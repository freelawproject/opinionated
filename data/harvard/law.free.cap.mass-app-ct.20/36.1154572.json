See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, \u00a7 13H, and c. 266, \u00a7 15, respectively. On appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he claims error in the trial judge\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress his identification and in the jury instructions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">I. <em>Facts Relevant to the Motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The facts are drawn from the judge\u2019s findings, which the defendant does not challenge, supplemented where appropriate by the evidence presented at the hearing on the motion to suppress. At about 12:45 a.m., July 25, 1983, Cambridge police Officers Sullivan and Walsh were on patrol duty when they received a radio call that a woman\u2019s screams had been heard coming from the second floor of 67 Dana Street. Upon their arrival at that address, the officers went to the second floor, where they were met by the victim. She told the police that, shortly after she had gone to bed, she heard a noise, a light went on, and a man was standing in her bedroom. She struggled with him for several minutes, and he punched her in the groin and upper part of her body.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The victim was able to free herself from her assailant, run to her window, and scream.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Sullivan testified that the victim described her assailant as a dark-complexioned, white male with brown hair, about eighteen years old, five feet six inches tall, about 155 pounds, and wearing a dark jacket. The victim was taken to a hospital, and the officers resumed their patrol duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Two hours later, about 2:45 a.m., Sullivan and Walsh received a radio call that a suspicious person had been reported at the rear of a dwelling house at 1 Dana Street, approximately three blocks away from the earlier call at 67 Dana Street. This call was also heard by Officers Hall and Santos, who were first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>to arrive at the scene. Hall testified that he saw a man, the defendant, standing about twelve to eighteen inches from an uncurtained window of a basement apartment and that the defendant was peering into the window. His belt was unbuckled, his trousers were unbuttoned and unzipped. He wore no underwear, and his hands were in front of his groin area (the defendant later claimed that he had been urinating). Hall came up from behind the defendant, grabbed him, and turned him over to Santos while he spoke with the woman who had made the suspicious person report.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">When Sullivan and Walsh arrived at the scene, just moments after Hall and Santos, Sullivan observed that the man who had been apprehended by Hall was a dark-skinned white male of about 170 pounds, five feet ten inches tall, in his early twenties, and wearing a dark bluejacket.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hall \u201cpatted down\u201d the defendant and found a packet of what he believed to be marijuana. The defendant was arrested for possession of marijuana and peeping and spying.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">In the meantime, based upon his observations of the defendant as he was being apprehended by Hall and Santos, Sullivan returned to 67 Dana Street to speak with the victim and learn if she would be able to identify her assailant. He picked her up at about 3:00 a.m., and called back to Hall who, with Santos and the defendant, had driven his cruiser to a nursing home parking lot across from 1 Dana Street. Upon learning that Sullivan was returning with the victim, Hall removed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>defendant\u2019s handcuffs, and the three men got out of the cruiser and walked about five feet to the rear of the car, where they awaited the victim\u2019s arrival.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Sullivan, the victim, and a male companion, pulled up within minutes, got out of the cruiser, and walked towards the defendant. When the victim was about ten to fifteen feet from the defendant, she became upset, backed away, said that he was her assailant, covered her face with her hands, and turned to her companion. The officers pressed her, stating that she had to be one hundred percent certain. The victim responded that she was.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The judge concluded that, when Hall saw the defendant \u201cpeering into the window of a house in the early morning hours with his pants open and in disarray,\u201d he had probable cause to arrest him. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gullick, </em>386 Mass. 278, 283 (1982). Because the victim, when attacked, had \u201cample opportunity to observe her assailant at close quarters with sufficient light and in the familiar surroundings of her own bedroom,\u201d and because the confrontation arranged by Sullivan between the victim and the defendant was constitutionally permissible, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coy, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 367, 371 (1980), the judge further concluded that the victim\u2019s identification should be allowed in evidence. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>394 Mass. 654, 659-661 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">II. <em>The Identification.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The defendant argues that, although his presence at the rear basement window in the early morning hours was sufficient to justify an investigatory stop of the type authorized under <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968), the police did not have probable cause to arrest him. His arrest, he continues, cannot be predicated upon the discovery of his possession of marijuana because that was found as a result of a search which exceeded permissible limits. See, <em>id., </em>at 22; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 405-406 (1974). Characterizing his detention as an investigatory one, the defendant concludes that the detention was impermissibly lengthy and, therefore, his identification by the victim illegal. In the alternative, the defendant attacks the identification as unduly suggestive and unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>a. <em>The defendant\u2019s arrest. </em>We do not accept the defendant\u2019s premise that his actions were sufficient to justify only an investigatory stop. The defendant was legally arrested, but in so concluding, we do not rely upon the Cambridge ordinance. The defendant is correct in asserting that the ordinance was not put in evidence and must, therefore, be disregarded. See <em>Gaunt </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Methuen, </em>327 Mass. 380, 381 (1951); <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falzarano, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 591, 597-598 (1979), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 380 Mass. 18 (1980). It does not follow, however, that the defendant\u2019s arrest must be deemed invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Whether a given set of facts is \u201csufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hason, </em>387 Mass. 169, 174 (1982), quoting from <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 162 (1925), and <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 175-176 (1940), does not turn on the label attached to those facts by the arresting officer. As stated in <em>Ralph </em>v. <em>Pepersack, </em>335 F.2d 128, 134 (4th Cir. 1964), \u201cTo make constitutional questions turn on the term chosen by police officers to describe their activity \u2014 officers who are accustomed to the vernacular of the police station and unschooled in the accepted constitutional vocabulary \u2014 is to engage in a futile and unwarranted exercise in semantics.\u201d Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hason, </em>387 Mass, at 175; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colitz, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 215, 223-224 (1982). We do not imply or suggest that the police are free to arrest and charge routinely and consider probable cause ex post facto or to expect that we will do so. Our holding is a narrow one: \u201c[Wjhen a crime under which the arrest is made and a crime for which probable cause exists are in some fashion related, then there is no question but that there is a valid arrest.\u201d <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>415 F.2d 787, 790 (5th Cir. 1969). There the court held that the defendant\u2019s arrest for vagrancy where no probable cause existed was illegal as a \u201csham\u201d or \u201cfraud\u201d even though there may have been probable cause to arrest on a charge of breaking and entering. See also 2 LaFave, Search and Seizure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \u00a7 5.1(e), and cases collected at nn. 136 &amp; 139 (1985 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Here the defendant was arrested, irrespective of the official designation of his acts, because he was standing at a rear, uncurtained, apartment window, at an early morning hour, with his trousers open, wearing no underwear, and his hands at his groin. Putting aside and disregarding \u201cpeeping and spying,\u201d the offense of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior is a felony. See G. L. c. 272, .\u00a7 16.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge correctly concluded that there was probable cause to arrest the defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">b. <em>The victim\u2019s confrontation. </em>The one-on-one confrontation of the defendant by the victim was hot impermissibly suggestive. Although disfavored, such confrontations have been held to be permissible where, as here, they occur promptly after the crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>371 Mass. 87, 92 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coy, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 371; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Loughlin, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 972 (1984). Attempts were made by the police to disguise the fact that the defendant was under arrest, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>371 Mass, at 93, and, after the victim\u2019s initial identification, the police cautioned her that she must be certain. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coy, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 373. We do not see any impermissible suggestion by the police in advising the victim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>when they asked if she would be willing to accompany them, that they had apprehended someone who \u201cclosely matched\u201d the description she had given to them earlier. As observed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 574, 583 (1984), \u201c[tjhe witness knows [s]he would not be asked to make an identification unless the police had reason to suspect the detainee\u2019s involvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Even were we to conclude that the confrontation was impermissibly suggestive, we would not disturb the judge\u2019s denial of the motion. All the indicia of reliability of the victim\u2019s identification were satisfied. See <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114 (1977). We do not regard the victim\u2019s prior identification as mistaken because she failed to point out that the sleeves of her assailant\u2019s jacket had yellow stripes or because of some differences between her observations and those made by Sullivan at the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest. The descriptions made by the victim and Sullivan even differ somewhat from the information set out in the booking sheet. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>These inaccuracies were insufficient to require suppression of the victim\u2019s identification, and their significance was a matter properly left to the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 230, 238-239 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 578-581.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">III. <em>The Jury Instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The defendant claims that two errors infect the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury: (1) that the instructions on the crime of indecent assault and battery were so vague that the jury were free to base a conviction on conduct not contemplated by c. 265, \u00a7 13H, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brattman, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 579, 584 (1980); and (2) that the instruction permiifetT by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>364 Mass. 87, 101 (1973), the so-called \u201cdynamite\u201d charge as modified, should not have been given, as the jury had not reached an impasse in their deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">a. <em>Indecent assault and battery. </em>The jury were charged on the elements of an indecent assault and battery as a lesser included offense within the indictment charging the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>with rape. That portion of the instruction to which the defendant objects<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">\u201cAn indecent assault and battery is essentially an act or series of acts which are fundamentally offensive to contemporary moral values. No particular definition is given by the statute for what constitutes the crime of indecent assault and battery. It has often been said, however, that it is behavior which the common sense of society would regard as immodest, immoral and improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">\u201cThus, in order to prove indecent assault and battery, the Commonwealth must therefore prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed an intentional unprivileged and indecent touching of the victim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The defendant constructs the following argument. If \u201cindecent\u201d assault and battery is to have any meaning, it must be construed as involving a \u201csexual touching.\u201d Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>390 Mass. 480, 483 (1983). The jury were not so told (but see <em>infra), </em>and their acquittal of the defendant of the charge of rape \u201cindicates the jury found that he had not committed the only battery testified to that had sexual aspects.\u201d Consequently, the conviction for indecent assault and battery could be based erroneously upon the evidence that the victim was attired in her nightclothes when punched by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">In the course of their deliberations, the jury asked the judge several questions,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> all of which indicate that they had focused upon the victim\u2019s testimony that the defendant had inserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>his fingers into her vagina. In responding to the jury\u2019s third question, the judge reread her original instruction on indecent assault and battery, adding that the \u201cmere touching of the private parts of a person\u201d has been held to be an indecent assault and battery. The jury found the defendant guilty of assault and battery as well as indecent assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">We will not attempt to analyze the jury\u2019s reasoning in reaching their verdicts. The sole question before us is whether they were correctly instructed. There is no error in the judge\u2019s statement of the law, and a limit to the type of conduct which could be found to be \u201cindecent\u201d was furnished by the evidence of the defendant\u2019s \u201cparticular acts,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brattman, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 584, which the record amply demonstrates to be the basis of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">b. <em>Coercion. </em>On March 23, 1984, the court convened at 9:30 a.m. After a lobby conference, the judge instructed the jury. In the course of the day, the jury sent several questions to the judge. Deliberations ended at 8:10 p.m., to be resumed the next day at 9:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">In the course of their deliberations the next morning, the jurors sent their final question to the judge. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>The judge concluded that \u201cthey are splitting hairs\u201d and that the questions demonstrated that \u201cthey are at an impasse.\u201d She answered the question and then gave a supplementary charge in accordance with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuey, </em>8 Cush. 1, 2-3 (1851), as modified by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>364 Mass, at 101-102. The jury returned with their verdicts at about 11:40 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">For substantially the same reasons as those set out in paragraph 1(a) of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connors, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1005, 1005-1006 (1982), we see no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-9\"> The defendant does not appeal from his conviction on the indictment charging him with assault and battery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b53-10\"> At trial, the victim testified that the man also \u201cjammed two to three fingers into\u201d her vagina.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b54-7\"> A police booking sheet was marked for identification at the suppression hearing. The description of the defendant appearing on the booking sheet reflects that he is a black male with black hair, five feet, eleven inches tall, was then 160 pounds and twenty-three years of age, and was wearing a dark blue sweat jacket with yellow stripes on the sleeves.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b54-8\"> By way of an addendum to the Commonwealth\u2019s brief, we are informed that peeping and spying is a violation of Cambridge City Ordinance \u00a7 13-7, which provides: \u201cNo person other than an officer of the law acting in the performance of his legal duty shall enter upon the premises of any person with the intention of peeping into a dwelling or spying upon any person therein.\u201d The defendant filed a motion to strike the addendum, and for reasons to be discussed <em>infra, </em>that motion is allowed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b57-7\"> The defendant argues that at the hearing on the motion to suppress no evidence was adduced to show whether anyone in the apartment, or elsewhere, had observed the defendant\u2019s condition. \u201cTo convict a defendant of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior, the Commonwealth must prove that the conduct is committed in \u2018such a way as to produce alarm\u2019 or shock.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, </em>391 Mass. 394, 396 (1984), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wardell, </em>128 Mass. 52, 53 (1880). However, although probable cause requires more than suspicion, evidence sufficient to warrant a conviction is not necessary. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>362 Mass. 24, 27 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hason, </em>387 Mass, at 174.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b57-8\"><em> </em>We need not consider the search of the defendant and the seizure of marijuana. Those questions are irrelevant to the validity of the defendant\u2019s arrest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weiss, </em>370 Mass. 416, 420-421 (1976). Additionally, an indictment arising out of the defendant\u2019s possession of marijuana was placed on file without a change of plea and without objection by the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b59-9\"> This instruction, because of questions by the jury during their deliberations, was given three times. Each time the defendant lodged an objection couched in terms of the unconstitutional vagueness of \u00a7 13H, a claim related to but somewhat different from that now argued. The Commonwealth does not argue that the defendant did not take a proper objection for the argument now being made, and we will construe the defendant\u2019s objection based on \u201cvagueness\u201d in the broad sense. Therefore, we do not hold the defendant to the more strict standard of review. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matos, </em>394 Mass. 563, 565 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b59-10\"> \u201cDoes the state have the obligation to prove that the defendant intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>to insert his fingers in order for the conviction of rape to be satisfied\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">\u201cDoes rape entail anything more than lack of consent and penetration?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">\u201cFor the elements of indecent assault and battery to be satisfied, does the state need to prove that the intent of the assault was indecent; or is a finding on our part that the assault was intended and the assault is indecent sufficient?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
