The action was originally brought on April 5, 1976, against Paul, individually and as doing business as Paul Properties. By amendments and substitute complaints, D.L.P., Inc. (DLP), a New York corporation; Vortex Construction Company (Vortex), a Massachusetts corporation; and Home Owners Federal Savings and Loan Association (Home Owners) were added as defendants. The complaints asserted negligence on the part of certain defendants in furnishing to Searcy an unsafe ladder.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">On March 31, 1976, Searcy had filed a claim with the Industrial Accident Board (the board), under G. L. c. 152 (worker\u2019s compensation), asserting that he was an employee of Vortex. This claim was settled, with the board\u2019s approval, by Vortex\u2019s compensation insurer for a lump sum of $5,300 (G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 48). This sum was paid to Searcy, his attorney (who also represents him in this action), and medical providers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">Among other defenses to the substitute complaints, the defendants asserted that Searcy was barred from proceeding at common law against them, respectively, by the lump sum settlement under G. L. c. 152. A pretrial motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>judgment (on the ground that the lump sum settlement barred relief in this action) was denied by one Superior Court judge, and later on February 8, 1983, was allowed by another judge as a defense protecting Vortex, but not other defendants. The action was dismissed as against Vortex.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">At trial, the case was submitted to the jury on special questions against Paul and DLP under which Searcy was awarded $112,500.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 motions for judgment n.o.v. and for a new trial were denied. Paul and DLP have appealed. The judge directed a verdict for Home Owners. From the resulting judgment for Home Owners, Searcy has appealed. We state the principal facts underlying the claims asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In 1974, Home Owners had acquired the complex by foreclosure when it was about sixty percent completed. By a duly recorded deed, Home Owners, on November 20, 1974, conveyed<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the complex to Paul, a real estate developer, who operated real estate projects in several States as Paul Properties. Paul owned all the shares of Vortex, a corporation engaged in construction, and was its president. Paul was also president, and owned a majority of the shares, of DLP. Paul hired Vortex as general contractor to complete the complex. It could be found that Paul hired DLP as managing agent for the complex and that he selected one Joseph Roif (upon the recommendation of Home Owners or of persons connected with Home Owners) to oversee the construction work for Vortex and as manager-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>operator of DLP.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Roif was the supervisor of Richard Record, also an employee of Vortex.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Searcy operated his own cleaning business. He was engaged<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by Vortex to clean units in the complex (after their completion) at a price of twenty dollars per unit and started work a week or more before April 8, 1975, when the accident happened. Searcy was told by Record that he was also to clean some outside windows about twelve feet above the ground. Searcy protested that he \u201cnever did any . . . outside windows before and . . . [that he] wasn\u2019t equipped to do outside windows.\u201d Searcy also told Record that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have a ladder ... [to use] to clean the windows.\u201d Record said the outside windows \u201chad to be done before . . . [Searcy] could get paid,\u201d and that he would get Searcy a ladder.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Later David Fagone, an employee of DLP (who lived in one of the apartment buildings and did miscellaneous work in the complex) brought an aluminum ladder to Searcy and said that Record had sent it. This was the bottom section of a sixteen to thirty-two foot extension ladder. It could be found or inferred that friction feet for the bottom of the ladder were not attached at the time of the accident and that Searcy had not \u201calter[ed] the ladder at all that . . . Fagone gave\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Searcy used the ladder in cleaning windows for four or five days. Record testified that he warned Searcy \u201ca couple of times,\u201d when he saw him, that the base of the ladder was too far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>away from the side of the building, near which he then was working, to be safe. On April 8, 1975, Searcy placed the base of the ladder on a blacktop walkway about eight feet away from a building on which he was about to work. He was washing a window with his left hand, and holding onto the building with his right hand. His bucket was between his feet, which were on the fourth rung from the top. The ladder suddenly shifted and Searcy fell to the ground, with the bucket. He noticed that the rung on which he had been standing was bent and the ladder was twisted. He was seriously injured, sustained head and back injuries, and had broken bones in or near his feet and ankles. He was hospitalized for a substantial time and some of his injuries are permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">1. Paul and DLP contend that Searcy is barred from bringing this action because of the approved lump sum settlement with Vortex by him as an employee of that corporation. Vortex was named as an insured, together with DLP and Paul Properties (and other entities), by endorsement on Vortex\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation policy. The contention, in effect, is that Searcy (having made a lump sum settlement under G. L. c. 152, cannot sue Paul and DLP as third parties under c. 152, \u00a7 15, as amended by St. 1971, cc. 888 and 941,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because the relationships among Paul, DLP, and Vortex were such as to create \u201cone [insured] multi-faceted construction company\u201d and, consequently, one aggregate employer of Searcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Examination of the legislative history of St. 1971, c. 941 (see note 7, <em>supra), </em>discloses no interpretation of the chapter\u2019s purpose beyond the language of the section itself. Contemporary comment, however, shows that the statute was taken by text and periodical writers as broadly abolishing the so-called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>\u201ccommon employment\u201d doctrine and permitting third-party actions by, or in behalf of, an injured employee against all but his immediate insured employer. See Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law 1972 Ann. Survey Mass. Law 50 \u00a7\u00a7 4.1-4.3 (1972); Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7\u00a7 661-665, 668-674 (2d ed. 1981 &amp; Supp. 1984); 2A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7\u00a7 72.31(b)-72.40 (1983 &amp; Supp. 1984). See also the concurring opinion of Braucher, J., in <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 229-230 (1978), and <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass. 342, 350-352 &amp; n.9 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">We apply the 1971 amendment as meaning just what it says, and as allowing a corporation\u2019s employee to bring actions for negligence against third parties, either individuals or corporations, even if in some degree affiliated with the insured employer corporation (at least where no joint venture with another defendant is established). This seems to be the trend of the cases elsewhere where legislation, generally comparable to the 1971 amendments of c. 152, \u00a7 15, has been enacted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">We perceive no basis, in the present circumstances, for extending the Massachusetts decisions with respect to \u201cdisregarding the corporate fiction\u201d so as to provide to a third party corporation immunity from an action by an employee of a somewhat affiliated corporation which has made a workers\u2019 compensation settlement with that employee. Here there has been shown (a) no flagrant or relevant disregard of corporate barriers by Paul and the several corporations of which he was an officer and shareholder and (b) no fraud. See <em>My Bread Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>353 Mass. 614, 618-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>619 (1968); <em>Gordon Chem. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>358 Mass. 632, 637-639 (1971).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">We do not view <em>Vertentes </em>v. <em>Barletta Co., </em>392 Mass. 165, 167-170 (1984), and see concurring opinion at 176-177, as precluding a third-party action by Searcy against either Paul or DLP. Searcy, in seeking recovery against Paul, was trying ,to recover from Paul <em>as principal </em>for the negligence of DLP alleged to be Paul\u2019s <em>agent. </em>Searcy has not been shown to have been working for DLP either as employee or independent contractor. Nothing in G. L. c. 152 (after the 1971 amendments) extends any immunity to Paul, if DLP was his agent, because Vortex (insured under c. 152) had made a lump sum settlement with Searcy. Whether Searcy was an employee or independent contractor of Vortex, the 1971 amendments specifically permitted Searcy to bring a third party action for negligence against DLP or against Paul as principal if DLP was his agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">2. It could be found that Paul, as owner of the complex, and DLP, as Paul\u2019s agent at the time of the accident on April 8, 1975, had sufficient control over the complex, to make it the duty of each of them to take \u201creasonable and appropriate\u201d steps to prevent injury to persons lawfully on the premises of the complex regardless of the status entitling such persons to be there. See <em>Mounsey </em>v. <em>Ellard, </em>363 Mass. 693, 707-709 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>(1973); <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, 374 </em>Mass. 206, 228 (1978), and the cases reviewed in the concurring opinion in <em>Vertentes </em>v. <em>Barletta Co., </em>392 Mass, at 171-176. We think that Searcy, whether an employee of Vortex or an independent contractor of Vortex, was lawfully on the premises owned by Paul and managed by DLP which could be found to be Paul\u2019s agent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Paul and DLP were not subject to any duty to furnish a ladder to Searcy. If he was an independent contractor, he should have supplied his own ladder. If, however, these defendants undertook to supply a ladder to Searcy, it was their duty to supply one which was safe. Failure to do so could be found to constitute negligence. See authorities cited in <em>Gauld </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>329 Mass. 724, 726-727 (1953), and see <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 219-228 (1978), in part overruling <em>Afienko </em>v. <em>Harvard Club of Boston, </em>365 Mass. 320, 327-330 (1974). There was evidence<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to support the jury\u2019s answers to special questions (see note 3, supra) that Fagone, as an employee of DLP, acting within the scope of his employment, had supplied Searcy with a ladder, knowing the use Searcy was to make of it. This (because it could be found that the ladder lacked friction feet<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and was only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>bottom part of an extension ladder) presented a jury question (as to which conflicting expert evidence was offered) whether Fagone was negligent in providing the ladder. The jury reasonably also could find that this negligence was a proximate cause of Searcy\u2019s fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">What has been said is sufficient to support the trial judge\u2019s refusal to direct a verdict for Paul and DLP on Searcy\u2019s claims against them. In the circumstances his denials of their motions for judgment n.o.v. and for a new trial also were justified.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">3. Searcy contends that the judge should not have directed a verdict for Home Owners, because he asserts that the evidence permitted an inference that Home Owners was the actual owner of the complex and, as landowner, had violated its duty of care toward him. On the evidence most favorable to Searcy, see <em>Alholm </em>v. <em>Wareham, </em>371 Mass. 621, 627 (1976), there was no error in granting the directed verdict. There were in evidence (a) a quitclaim deed from Home Owners to Paul, (b) a mortgage from Paul to Home Owners, (c) a construction loan agreement between Paul and Home Owners, and (d) a note from Paul to Home Owners. These documents all purported to show that Paul was the owner of the complex, subject to Home Owners\u2019 security interest and that Home Owners retained only a mortgage interest in the property.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under the terms of each such instrument exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>cuted by Paul, Paul was to be free of any personal liability. Paul planned to rent the units, refinance the property, and sell the complex as a whole to pay off the mortgage. The record contains no indication that Paul was to receive any compensation for serving as owner, manager, mortgagor, or construction director, except possibly as (a) companies controlled by Paul might realize a profit, or (b) the enterprise as a whole might earn enough to pay off the mortgages and other indebtedness and thus create in Paul a realizable equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The evidence reasonably was excluded at trial to which Searcy refers to support an inference that Home Owners remained in some degree the owner of the complex. This offered evidence included (a) a memorandum dated September 20, 1974, well before the sale in November, 1974, from Home Owners\u2019 attorney to the bank itself, describing as of that date some of the circumstances leading up to the November sale, and also (b) portions of Paul\u2019s deposition testimony to the effect that he held title to the property as Home Owners\u2019 \u201cnominee.\u201d The deposition also showed that Home Owners gave advice to Paul and his staff with respect to selecting some personnel at the complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The September memorandum<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> must have been written before the November transactions had been formulated in detail. It does not justify an inference that the November sale constituted a mere paper transaction with the bank remaining the true owner. See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>369 Mass. 47, 59 (1975). See also Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 408-409 (5th ed. 1981 &amp; Supp. 1983, hereafter referred to as the Liacos Handbook).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>The trial judge also justifiably treated as inadmissible portions of Paul\u2019s deposition and answers to interrogatories, which may have suggested the conclusion of law that Paul held title to the complex as Home Owners\u2019 \u201cnominee.\u201d The judge permissibly could rule, on inquiries not very precisely or clearly framed, that the statements were barred on principles fully discussed in the Liacos Handbook, at 95-103. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>370 Mass. 630, 635 (1976). See also <em>Chase </em>v. <em>New York Cent. &amp; H. R.R., </em>208 Mass. 137, 154-155 (1911); <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Hotel Touraine Co., </em>326 Mass. 742, 744-745 (1951). The judge reasonably could regard the term \u201cnominee\u201d as ambiguous and as involving a conclusion which most members of the public could not understand or use with certainty. See <em>Kulchinsky </em>v. <em>Segal, </em>307 Mass. 571, 573 (1940), and the Liacos Handbook, at 100-101. The judge also properly excluded, upon Home Owners\u2019 motions to strike, portions of Paul\u2019s deposition testimony relating to Home Owners\u2019 advice in the selection of personnel at the complex as not responsive to the particular questions posed and because both questions and answers were not clear. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spare, </em>353 Mass. 263, 265 (1967).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">4. The judgments are affirmed. Searcy is to have costs of appeal with respect to his claims against Paul and DLP. Searcy is not to recover as part of those costs the expenses of reproducing, for his appeal against Home Owners, any part of the record, even if that part was not reproduced in the appendix submitted by Paul and DLP. See the appendix to this opinion, par. A-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Appendix (see note 13, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Certain less significant issues argued in the brief are discussed in this appendix, together with other matters suggested by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>\n<em>Various Contentions by Paul and DLP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">A-l. The judge reasonably denied a mistrial because of alleged inaccurate references by Searcy\u2019s counsel to the record (and to proposed special questions to be put to the jury) during his closing argument. At the close of that argument, the judge conferred with counsel (with the jury absent) with respect to curative instructions. The defendants\u2019 counsel did not suggest that those proposed by the judge were inappropriate, although he still urged a mistrial. The judge\u2019s interruption of Searcy\u2019s counsel\u2019s final argument to correct an apparent misreading of proposed special questions was appropriate in the circumstances. We consider that the judge\u2019s actions were well within the scope of his discretion in conducting the trial. Where counsel were in disagreement concerning the accuracy of figures concerning Searcy\u2019s damages, placed by his counsel on a blackboard during his argument, the jury were clearly told that it was their \u201cmemory that governs,\u201d not that of the judge or that of counsel for either party. The judge\u2019s instructions on earning capacity and life expectancy were appropriate and clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">A-2. The judge explicitly told the jury that Searcy\u2019s counsel\u2019s comment in argument (that the complex was \u201ca shoestring operation\u201d) was irrelevant and inappropriate. The jury were directed to disregard it. This was well within the judge\u2019s discretion. See <em>Fialkow </em>v. <em>DeVoe Motors, Inc., </em>359 Mass. 569, 571-572 (1971). It will be assumed that jurors will follow instructions of this type. <em>Litos </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>322 Mass. 193, 196 (1947). See <em>Bessey </em>v. <em>Salemme, </em>302 Mass. 188, 210-211 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">A-3. During trial, regulations (relating to the prevention of accidents in construction and during window cleaning) of the Department of Labor and Industries were at first admitted in evidence. Thereafter the regulations were ruled to be inapplicable to the remaining defendants. In view of the full discussion by expert witnesses of community standards with respect to use of ladders and of this ladder in particular, the exposure of the jury to this evidence cannot have been prejudicial and in general was cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">A-4. The defendants argue that they were prejudiced by the admission in evidence of a net worth statement of Paul showing substantial assets and of a letter showing an increase in insurance coverage. These were admitted only against Home Owners, while it was still a party, to show aspects of the relationship between Paul and Home Owners. Careful limiting instructions were given concerning both the net worth statement and the letter. As to the letter, the amount of the increase in insurance was deleted before the jury saw the exhibit. There was no reference to the type of insurance. When Home Owners was dismissed as a defendant after Searcy had rested his case following several weeks of trial, the judge ruled that these exhibits were out of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">The jury were told that Home Owners was no longer in the case and that evidence admitted only against Home Owners would not be available to them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>in the jury room. This statement was emphasized in the judge\u2019s final instructions when the jury were told that they \u201cwere not to speculate\u201d why documents which applied only to Home Owners \u201care no longer in the case. They are out of the case completely.\u201d We have not been referred in the briefs to any request by the defendants\u2019 counsel, following the judge\u2019s general instructions, for any more precise and specific curative instructions on these documents. At the close of supplemental instructions counsel agreed that the judge had charged sufficiently on the further matters he had agreed to discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">A-5. The judge denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a mistrial which was based largely upon the contention that only mistrial would sort out the material pertinent only to Home Owners. The judge could reasonably determine that it would be a waste of scarce court resources to grant a mistrial after many weeks of trial before a jury described, at the close of the case, by the judge (out of the presence of the jury) as \u201cexceptional.\u201d He sensibly decided to spend several days with counsel (a) determining what items were not to be sent to the jury room or mentioned in the arguments of counsel, (b) ruling on evidence issues, and (c) working out the form of special questions to be put to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">We think the judge exercised a sound discretion in the circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>356 Mass. 598, 603-604 (1970); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prendergast, </em>385 Mass. 625, 630-631 (1982). Nothing in the jury\u2019s answers to the special questions suggests that they were improperly influenced by the documents removed from their consideration. See <em>Cushing </em>v. <em>Jolles, </em>292 Mass. 72, 75-76 (1935). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 314, 320 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">\n<em>Various Contentions of Searcy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">A-6. The record does not support an inference that Home Owners and Paul were joint venturers in efforts to prevent loss on the complex project. No evidence showed any agreement between these parties to associate as joint venturers in the complex project. See <em>Cardullo </em>v. <em>Landau, </em>329 Mass. 5, 8 (1952); <em>Shain Inv. Co. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 4, 7 (1982); <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Abbott Labs, </em>512 F. Supp. 1031, 1036 (D. Mass. 1981). The only written agreements between Home Owners and Paul in the record were the deed, the mortgage, the note, and the construction loan agreement and related undertakings exonerating Paul from personal liability on those instruments. On these documents the relationship between Paul and Home Owners was merely one of a buyer and seller of land and (after the conveyance of title to Paul) one of borrower and lender. There was no evidence of a community or joint property interest in the assets of the undertaking or of significant joint control of its development. See <em>Air Technology Corp. </em>v. <em>General Elec. Co., </em>347 Mass. 613, 624-625 (1964). To the extent that Home Owners contributed funds to the project and Paul his skills as a real estate developer, the relationship was not more than would be usual between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>a mortgagee and a mortgagor engaged in construction. Home Owners was not to share in any direct way in profits or losses from the complex. The only profit Home Owners was to realize was the fixed return on its loans. It would share losses only when foreclosure became inevitable and had taken place. Profit sharing and joint control have been considered essential to the existence of a true joint venture. <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Abbott Labs, supra </em>at 1036. See also Crane of Bromberg, Partnership \u00a7 35 (1968). Compare the views of Traynor, C.J., in <em>Connor </em>v. <em>Great Western Sav. &amp; Loan Assn., </em>69 Cal. 2d 850, 862-863 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">A-7. At the close of the main opinion, reference is made to excerpts from a deposition by Paul which were offered in evidence in behalf of Searcy and excluded by the judge. Some of these follow below:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\"><em>Excerpt No. 1 </em>Q: \u201cAnd that was the mortgage that you signed with a bank with an accompanying note for $3,100,000?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">[Counsel for Paul]: \u201cObjection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">A: \u201cIs that your testimony?

See and compare, e.g., <em>Kerwin </em>v. <em>Donaghy, </em>317 Mass. 559, 565-571 (1945, in certain respects now limited by <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Burkin, </em>390 Mass. 864 [1984]) and see the Liacos Handbook at 385-392.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">A-8. We note that each party has printed in the appendix all, or substantially all, the transcript of six weeks of testimony. This has caused extra expenditure of time in the decision of this case. Such duplication should have been avoided. See Mass.R.A.P. 9, and 18, as amended; 378 Mass. 935, 940 (1979), and Mass.R.A.P. 8, as appearing in 388 Mass. 1106 (1983). Duplication in the appendix of parts of the record, even though more than one party may claim an appeal, should be avoided and counsel should leave out unnecessary material by agreement or, if they cannot agree, should obtain the instructions of the trial judge or another judge of the trial court. Appellate courts should not be forced to examine duplicate or unnecessary material merely because it may be less expensive for the parties to reproduce such material than to have counsel expend time in excluding it from the record.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-12\"> The lump sum settlement agreement made note that the insurer disputed its obligation to make disability payments and claimed that Searcy \u201cwas a self-employed independent cleaning contractor. . . and was not an employee covered under\u201d G.

Searcy\u2019s total injuries were assessed at $150,000 by the jury. In answer to special questions, the jury also found: (a) DLP was in control of the complex as Paul\u2019s agent; (b) one Fagone was an employee of DLP and furnished the ladder to Searcy; (c) Fagone was negligent because the ladder did not have friction feet; (d) the lack of friction feet was a proximate cause of Searcy\u2019s fall; (e) Searcy was negligent to the extent of twenty-five percent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\"> The circumstances attendant upon this conveyance and the details of the instruments then executed are material to Searcy\u2019s appeal from the directed verdict on his claim against Home Owners.

An agency arrangement, however, could be inferred from the evidence, principally a somewhat diffuse deposition by Paul, not wholly internally consistent. In that deposition, Paul conceded that a sole proprietorship of his, Paul Properties, or \u201cemployees\u201d of his, \u201cran . . . [the complex] at Brockton, whatever had to be done.\u201d In an answer to interrogatories, Paul said, \u201cI was responsible for the hiring of general contractors to finish construction and lease the premises.\u201d Paul in his deposition described Roif as \u201cthe manager/agent of DLP most familiar with the facts\u201d here involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b153-9\"> There was some difference of position reflected in the record about whether Searcy was an independent contractor or an employee of Vortex.

L. c. 152, \u00a7 18. See Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 662 (2d ed. 1981). Vortex and DLP also were not joint venturers within the meaning of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(5), as appearing in St. 1954, c. 265, defining \u201cemployer\u201d as including two or more individuals or corporations \u201cengaged in a joint enterprise.\u201d The record shows no agreement among Paul, DLP, and Vortex for an association among themselves for joint profit and for sharing losses, amounting to either a partnership among the entities or a joint venture. Indeed, at trial, the defendants\u2019 counsel strongly argued that there was no such joint venture. See the discussion in <em>Shain Inv. Co. </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 4, 7-11 (1982), and cases cited. Stock ownership by Paul, and agency arrangements by him with DLP, do not amount to a joint venture. This action is against a corporation and an individual, each a separate entity from Vortex, Searcy\u2019s employer. There is no basis for application of the \u201cseparate capacity\u201d doctrine discussed in <em>Longever </em>v. <em>Revere Copper &amp; Brass Inc., </em>381 Mass. 221, 224-226 (1980).

It is, of course, possible for a corporation to be an agent for an individual. See <em>Southern Pac. Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Shippers Assn., </em>642 F.2d 236, 238 (8th Cir. 1981); Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7\u00a7 14M, 21 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\"> Fagone was on DLP\u2019s payroll. It reasonably could be inferred (e.g., from evidence that he let Searcy into apartments to be cleaned and helped Record inspect his work) that he was authorized to cooperate with Vortex and its employees and contractors in getting the construction work completed rapidly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\"> The purpose of friction feet is to give a ladder greater stability. An expert, called by the defendants, conceded that an aluminum ladder lacking friction feet tends to rotate. There was no evidence that anyone warned Searcy not to use this ladder without friction feet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b158-7\"> Examination of the transcript shows that, in a jury trial which lasted over six weeks, the experienced trial judge exercised great patience and dealt with counsel for all parties and the jury with appropriate consideration. Incidents mentioned in the defendants\u2019 brief as indicating unduly favorable treatment of Searcy\u2019s counsel as, for example, permitting him to expand his opening of the case more than once, to recall his expert witness, and to refer to regulations, were well within the judge\u2019s discretion, as was the judge\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 request for a view, again pressed after Searcy\u2019s case had been closed, at a time when only one witness remained to be called by the defendants.

Paul did not put up any money for the property, but did execute a nonrecorded mortgage to Home Owners for $3,100,000, a construction note for that sum, and also a construction loan agreement. The note provided for completion of construction by February 1, 1978, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>also provided an automatic extension.
