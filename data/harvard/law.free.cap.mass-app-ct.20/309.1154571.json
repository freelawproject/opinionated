On December 15, 1982, Joan was granted by probate judge No. 1 a divorce nisi from Benjamin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>on the ground of adultery. He, by the judgment nisi, was ordered to transfer within ten days to Joan all his interest in the locus. The judgment nisi, although dated December 15, 1982, was not recorded on the Probate Court docket until December 21, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">On December 15, 1982, Benjamin was adjudged in contempt, also by probate judge No. 1 for failure to make support payments to Joan and for their children. He was committed to a house of correction for sixty days or \u201cuntil he shall purge himself of . . . contempt by payment of $10,100.\u201d Benjamin then, within a few hours, borrowed from or was furnished $10,100 by (or through) the defendant Bonnie LaMothe and was released from custody.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">LaMothe and Benjamin went together to New Hampshire and consulted a lawyer there. The lawyer drew a promissory note for $10,100 for Benjamin to sign and a mortgage of Benjamin\u2019s interest in the locus (i.e., the marital home in Sharon). On the face of the mortgage it was shown that the locus consisted of \u201cthe same premises conveyed to Benjamin Feldman and Joan Feldman by deed . . . dated November 2, 1976\u201d recorded with Norfolk deeds, and \u201c[sjubject to a prior first mortgage.\u201d The mortgage was promptly recorded on December 16,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> prior to the filing in the registry of deeds of any lis pendens concerning the divorce proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Neither Benjamin nor LaMothe spoke with Joan before the mortgage was given, nor was Joan notified that the mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>had been executed. Benjamin did not convey his interest in the locus to Joan as directed by the judgment nisi. An order, dated January 3, 1983, of probate judge No. 1 purported to divest Benjamin of his interest in the locus and award it to Joan.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The present \u201ccomplaint in equity\u201d was filed in behalf of Joan on May 23, 1983. It seeks, among other forms of relief, (a) a declaration that the mortgage to Lamothe is invalid and that Joan holds title to the locus free of any lien of the mortgage, and (b) that Benjamin and LaMothe each be required to discharge the mortgage. The complaint was heard for two days before probate judge No. 2 on April 30 and May 1, 1984. There was evidence before him of the facts already recited, as well as somewhat conflicting evidence that for a substantial period before December 15, 1982, there had existed between Feldman and LaMothe (1) a close business relationship in a corporation formed in New Hampshire to distribute Montessori school supplies, and (2) a personal relationship which had originated when Benjamin had taken his son (apparently, according to the testimony, by a woman other than Joan) to the Montessori school in Salem, New Hampshire, run by LaMothe and an associate. The relationship had involved LaMothe and Benjamin living at the same address in circumstances which (on the testimony) would permit a variety of inferences.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There was testimony from Ann Neubert, a former (and now disillusioned or possibly disgruntled) business partner of LaMothe of circumstances showing a close business and personal relationship between Benjamin and LaMothe. Miss Neubert explicitly testified that LaMothe told her in the spring of 1981 that she (LaMothe) was \u201cin love\u201d with Benjamin.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">LaMothe conceded (a) that, after December 15, 1982, she made substantial payments to Benjamin (on invoices for services rendered by him to their corporation estimated by LaMothe at $8,000 to $9,000), (b) that no payments had been made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Benjamin on the mortgage note at any time, and (c) that LaMothe had not claimed any set-off of, or claim upon, the later payments made to Benjamin by her against his liability to her on the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Probate judge No. 2 found essentially the basic facts which had been stipulated by the parties at the opening of the hearings. He then found: (1) \u201cthat a close personal relationship existed between\u201d Benjamin and LaMothe \u201cas early as 1981\u201d; (2) that the purported mortgage of December 15, 1982, was a \u201cless than arm\u2019s length\u201d transaction; (3) that Benjamin and LaMothe \u201chad been engaged in a close business relationship\u201d long prior to December 15, 1982; (4) that Benjamin knew or should have known when he executed the mortgage to LaMothe, the possibility of his being divested by the divorce nisi from at least part of his interest in the locus, and that his purported mortgage of his interest was \u201cat least unfair and inappropriate\u201d and a fraud upon Joan and the court; and (5) that the mortgage was a \u201cbold attempt by\u201d Benjamin and LaMothe, <em>\u201cin conspiracy, </em>to . . . encumber a marital asset\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The judge was not required to believe the testimony of LaMothe and obviously did not do so in large measure. He expressly referred to her testimony as \u201cevasive.\u201d Her credibility had been shaken by cross-examination in various respects. See, e.g., note 3, <em>supra. </em>Of course, the judge\u2019s disbelief of all or some of LaMothe\u2019s testimony, see <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Esso Standard Oil Co., </em>337 Mass. 639, 642 (1958), does not constitute evidence to the contrary. The judge, however, reasonably could have inferred from the evidence already summarized that LaMothe, at least by the time she paid over her cashier\u2019s check to Joan on December 15, 1982, knew facts affecting the validity of the mortgage. She then must have known that Benjamin was married to Joan and that he needed $10,100 to discharge his past support obligations. She must have known also of the impending divorce, and of Joan\u2019s interest in the locus. Indeed, Joan\u2019s interest was apparent on the face of the mortgage accepted by LaMothe, as already stated. The close business and personal relationship, referred to in the evidence (and found by the judge), between LaMothe and Benjamin per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>mitted an inference that she had known most of the pertinent circumstances at a much earlier date.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The judge appropriately should have made more complete and explicit subsidiary findings. We think, however, that his finding that Benjamin and LaMothe engaged \u201cin [a] conspiracy\u201d to encumber a marital asset necessarily imports a finding of a joint and improper effort by Benjamin and LaMothe (a) to give security for the assets employed to produce Benjamin\u2019s release from the contempt order, (b) to encumber Benjamin\u2019s interest in the locus, and (c) to frustrate the award of that interest to Joan. The judge reasonably could conclude that the mortgage to LaMothe should be set aside, whether the assets used to secure Benjamin\u2019s release were the property of LaMothe alone or in part were assets of a business in which both she and Benjamin had an interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">LaMothe contends that Benjamin, prior to a recording in the registry of deeds by Joan disclosing the divorce proceedings or the divorce judgment nisi, was entitled to dispose of his interest in the estate by the entirety in any way permitted by the common law view of a husband\u2019s interest in such an estate and that this record shows nothing that put LaMothe on notice of any inability of Benjamin to secure by the mortgage her transfer of funds to him. She relies, in large measure, on G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 15, and cases applying that statute. See, <em>e.g.,Debral Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>DiChiara, </em>383 Mass. 559 (1981); <em>True </em>v. <em>Wisniowski, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 501 (1982).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>On the findings of the judge, we think that LaMothe must be taken to have had actual notice and knowledge of the divorce litigation. Such litigation necessarily involved the consideration of all interests in marital real estate pursuant to the revision of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, by St. 1974, c. 565 (now as amended through St. 1983, c. 233, \u00a7 77). Section 34, of course, since 1974 has permitted equitable division of marital property upon divorce. LaMothe\u2019s knowledge and participation with Benjamin in an effort to perfect a mortgage of Benjamin\u2019s interest in the locus was found by probate judge No. 2, as has been noted, to amount to a \u201cconspiracy\u201d to deprive Joan of that interest. Such an interference with the division of the marital estate is activity not within the purpose of c. 184, \u00a7 15, to protect transferees in good faith.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the circumstances (on the findings of probate judge No. 2), \u00a7 15 and the authorities applying that section do not control the present case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\"> There was evidence that Benjamin, while he was still at the courthouse, placed a telephone call to LaMothe, then in New Hampshire. She obtained funds from a safe deposit box and from a purse containing cash kept by her in her house, procured a certified check to her order, and (within a matter of hours) took the check to the D\u00e9dham courthouse, and there was able to arrange Benjamin\u2019s release. She had not arranged theretofore to obtain any security for the transfer of the funds. She endorsed the check to Joan Feldman. From the testimony, the funds used by LaMothe could have been found to have been her personal resources or, perhaps, funds of a business enterprise of which she and Benjamin each was or had been an officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b326-9\"> The note does not appear in the record and LaMothe, who testified that it was in her deposit box, was shown to have given earlier conflicting testimony concerning where the note was at the time of trial of this complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\"> There was evidence that Benjamin told Joan that LaMothe \u201cbabysat\u201d for Benjamin\u2019s (but not Joan\u2019s) child and there was some suggestion that LaMothe with Benjamin had visited Colby College where Joan\u2019s son was a student.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Section 15, as appearing in St. 1941, c. 88, reads in part: \u201cA . . . proceeding, either at law or equity, which affects the title to real property . . . shall not have any effect <em>except against the parties thereto and persons having actual notice thereof\u2019 </em>(emphasis supplied) until a lis pendens notice is recorded in the appropriate registry of deeds. In the <em>Debral </em>case, 383 Mass, at 560, it was said, \u201cUnder the common law doctrine of lis pendens, the mere existence of litigation involving title to real property was deemed constructive notice to the world, so that anyone who purchased the disputed property while the suit was pending was bound by the judgment ultimately rendered,\u201d and (at 560-561) \u00a7 15, \u201cfirst appearing in St. 1877, c. 229, ameliorated the harsh effects of the common law rule on <em>good faith </em>transferees unaware of pending litigation concerning the property\u201d (emphasis supplied). The present litigation, perhaps, might have been avoided if a lis pendens had been filed when the divorce proceeding was commenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b330-6\"> We perceive nothing in the first paragraph of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34A, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 400, \u00a7 34, which requires a different result. That \u00a7 34A (creating an equitable right in a spouse as a consequence of a judgment for alimony in a divorce proceeding) is \u201csubject to the provisions for recording of notice\u201d in G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 15, by reason of \u00a7 15 itself has no application to a person with actual notice of the divorce proceedings, at least after the enactment of St. 1974, c. 565.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\"> In our view of this case, we need not consider issues argued by the parties concerning the effect, if any, of the so called \u201cequal rights\u201d amendment, art. 106 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth, ratified in 1976, upon the power of either spouse (without the participation of the other spouse) to convey an interest in a previously created estate by the entirety. See <em>West </em>v. <em>First Agricultural Bank, </em>382 Mass. 534, 544-552 (1981), and authorities there cited. See also an opinion of Sullivan, J., of the Land Court, decided March 21, 1983, in <em>Inge </em>v. <em>Inge, </em>Misc. No. 108279, brought to our attention by Joan\u2019s counsel as discussing such issues which we need not and do not decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">We recognize that a husband\u2019s interest in an estate by the entirety may be taken into account in enforcing an order for alimony (or for a division of property). See <em>Krokyn </em>v. <em>Krokyn, </em>378 Mass. 206, 208-211 (1979). If it is necessary for a husband to liquidate his interest to avoid contempt, suitable relief can be made available by the Probate Court after notice to the wife.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
