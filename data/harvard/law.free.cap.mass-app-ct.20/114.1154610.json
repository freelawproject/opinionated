See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>394 Mass. 702, 706 (1985). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">I. <em>The Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The subjects of the indictments, twin sisters who were about eleven years old in 1981, are the defendant\u2019s nieces. Their father (the defendant\u2019s brother) and mother were divorced in 1974, and the mother remarried in 1976. The girls (referred to herein as Mary and Jane, not their true names) would see their father fairly regularly, and it was not unusual for them to visit and stay overnight with their paternal grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">In September, 1981, the defendant, who recently had been released from prison out-of-State and had returned to Massachusetts, moved in with his mother. He had found employment and the living arrangement was to be temporary.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">On Saturday, November 7, 1981, Mary and Jane arrived at their grandmother\u2019s house for an overnight visit. At about 11:00 p.m., Mary went to bed. She slept with her aunt (the defendant\u2019s sister) in her bedroom because, according to Mary\u2019s testimony, the aunt had a \u201cbig bed so two people can sleep in it.\u201d Some time later in the early morning (Mary testified that it was still dark outside) Mary was awakened by light coming through the doorway as the defendant, wearing only his undershorts, came into the bedroom. Mary\u2019s aunt was asleep, turned away from the door and towards the wall. The defendant went to Mary\u2019s side of the bed, knelt down, removed the bedclothes from her, and pulled up her nightgown. She feigned sleep. The defendant placed his hand beneath Mary\u2019s underpants, rubbed her vaginal area, and placed his finger into her. Mary related that the defendant kept his finger in her vagina for about five to ten minutes and then he went into the bathroom. That morning Mary told only Jane what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The girls\u2019 mother testified that, after her daughters arrived home Sunday afternoon, she received a telephone call from their father, who was then living in Oregon. The mother spoke with him, and, after this conversation, she called her daughters into her bedroom. The mother asked them if their uncle, the defendant, \u201chad bothered them at all.\u201d Jane responded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>\u201c[Mary], not me.\u201d Mary then reluctantly described to her mother what the defendant had done. When she finished her account, Jane volunteered that the defendant had done some similar things to her, but long ago. After further conversations with Jane and searching of her own memory of her children\u2019s overnight visits with their grandmother, the mother determined that the incident with Jane had to have occurred in the fall of 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The defendant testified and denied that he had ever abused his nieces. As to the 1979 episode, the defendant challenged the hazy testimony on dates with evidence to show that he was incarcerated on most of the weekends that the girls had visited with their grandmother. He was acquitted of any wrongdoing with Jane. See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">II. <em>Bias and Prejudice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The mother\u2019s testimony followed that of her daughters. Upon cross-examination, the mother related that her former husband visited with the children \u201cpretty regularly\u201d but that there was no set pattern because she and he had joint custody of the daughters. Apparently to dispel any notion of amicability between the mother and father, defense counsel brought out in questioning the mother that joint custody was not part of the \u201cdivorce settlement\u201d but was the result of \u201cgoing to court.\u201d When defense counsel pressed with, \u201cYou went to court again on a question of custody?\u201d the prosecutor objected. He was sustained, perhaps on the basis that, at this stage, the relevancy of the inquiry was not apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Defense counsel then backtracked in his examination and reestablished the fact of joint custody. Next, and without objection, the mother was asked whether the grandmother had \u201cany legal custody\u201d of the children, and she answered, \u201cNo, she didn\u2019t.\u201d Exercising good judgment, and perhaps hoping to ward off any anticipated objections from the prosecutor, defense counsel asked to approach the bench, where the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">Counsel: \u201cI would ask to be allowed to inquire further into any question of custody in court pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>ceedings, the reason being to try to show bias and prejudice on her part. It is my understanding that there was an attempt by . . . the children\u2019s grandmother to have custody taken away from [the mother] because she brought the children there one time and said I don\u2019t want them, you can have them; there was then a fairly substantial interfamily fight which I would have to believe left feelings between everyone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">Court: \u201cWell, the bad feelings would have to be with the defendant, not with the grandmother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">Counsel: \u201cOnly, again, the ex-set of in-laws, the Morrises\u2019 family, and a new husband being Mr. [ ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">Court \u201cPrejudice has to relate to this defendant, not to some other member of the family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">Counsel: \u201cYou will note my objection, judge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-12\">Court: \u201cCertainly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">The defendant argues that by the side bar mling the judge precluded him from showing that the mother\u2019s testimony was biased because of \u201cpassionate\u201d feelings against his family arising out of a \u201cbitter custody battle.\u201d Moreover, that evidence could show a motive to lie on the mother\u2019s part. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em>377 Mass. 755, 761 (1979). Because any attempts by the grandmother to take custody of the children would be weakened by showing that the children had been harmed by a member of the grandmother\u2019s household, we think that defense counsel\u2019s explanation as to what he had hoped to elicit, although sketchy, was sufficient to show that he had a right to pursue the point. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ahearn, </em>370 Mass, at 287; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>384 Mass. 377, 380 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>394 Mass. 584, 589-590 (1985). Our review of the record, however, shows that the matter was in fact explored.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>issue might not have been pursued to the degree that appellate counsel would have preferred cannot be attributed to an error by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">We understand the judge\u2019s ruling to be no more than a statement that any hostility the mother might harbor for the grandmother because of a custody dispute would be irrelevant unless shown to have infected the mother\u2019s feelings toward the defendant. The prosecutor clearly did not construe the judge\u2019s ruling as precluding inquiry on the topic, and it was his cross-examination of the defendant, presumably in response to the testimony summarized in note 2, <em>supra, </em>that brought the matter into even sharper focus.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That the judge did not intend by his ruling to preclude inquiry on the issue of a custody dispute as a cause of hostility can be seen from his comment to the prosecutor, who, in cross-examination of the defendant about the interfamily feelings, had unquestionably gone too far:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c[T]his is not an issue, the custody in this case, and the only reason it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>in the case at all is to show whether there was any bias or prejudice on the part of any party or another which you can weigh. We won\u2019t have a collateral issue . . . and we\u2019re not trying any divorce or custody situation in this hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">We think that reason for any hostility had been brought sufficiently to the jury\u2019s attention. It is understandable that the defendant would have preferred the information to be elicited from the mother rather than from him. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britland, </em>300 Mass. 492, 496 (1938). However, any limitations on the scope of the cross-examination of the mother were, in our view, self-imposed. \u201cThe judge made no \u2018unequivocal adverse ruling\u2019 against a line of questioning, as in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graziano, </em>368 Mass. 325, 330 (1975), nor did he exclude \u2018the total inquiry by his several rulings, \u2019 as in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ahearn, </em>370 Mass, [at 287].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cheek, </em>374 Mass. 613, 615 (1978). We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">HI. <em>Improper Questions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">If there is a saving distinction between the questions held to be improper in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 400, 401-402 &amp; n.2 (1983), and in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 707, 708-709 &amp; n.2 (1984), and that here put to the defendant \u2014 \u201cThere is no reason for [Mary and Jane] to lie, is there?\u201d \u2014 we fail to see it. Although <em>Long </em>was decided subsequent to this November, 1983, trial, <em>Ward </em>had been issued some eight months before the prosecutor put the question. Belatedly seeing the error of its way, the Commonwealth argues that it has been saved from reversible error by the defendant\u2019s \u201cinnocuous\u201d response, \u201cNot that I know of, no.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">We make no comment on the Commonwealth\u2019s contention and, for a different reason, conclude that the defendant suffered no material prejudice from that question or from several others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>which were of a comparable nature. We think that the error could not have made a difference in light of the context of the evidence adduced and the posture of the defense, that is, that the assaults and touchings had never happened. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>394 Mass, at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">As explained in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. at 402, one of the evils in a \u201cline of questioning designed to cause a witness to characterize another witness\u2019s testimony as \u2018lying\u2019 [is that] a lawyer implies to the jury that differences in the testimony of the witness and any other witness \u2018could only be the result of lying and not because of misrecollection, failure of recollection or other innocent reason.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Narciso, </em>446 F.Supp. 252, 321 (E.D. Mich. 1977).\u201d Here, however, the defendant put before the jury his defense that his nieces had engaged in exaggerated, childish fantasy which was exploited by the mother in her hostility against the defendant and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The defendant described his affection for his nieces and how he found their testimony emotionally painful; \u201cthey rehearsed it quite well.\u201d Although in his closing argument defense counsel was quick to disclaim any notion that he was alleging that the children had lied, he nonetheless pointed out, in numerous and specifically detailed respects, that their testimony was \u201cqdd.\u201d He attributed the unbelievable aspects of their testimony to the fact that Mary and Jane, as other youngsters but especially twins will do, shared and embellished their secrets. We put it another more direct way: Mary and Jane had lied, as children will do. When this treatment of the children\u2019s testimony is viewed with the attack made upon the mother\u2019s credibility, we are satisfied that the error did not produce prejudice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-15\"> The defendant was found not guilty on an indictment charging him with indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years of age. The two indictments involved sisters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b133-14\"> For example, after resuming his cross-examination of the mother following the bench conference, defense counsel asked the mother whether she, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>1979, had brought her daughters to their grandmother and asked her \u201cto keep them and take care of them.\u201d The mother replied, \u201cNot to my knowledge, no, I didn\u2019t.\u201d In answer to questions about her relationship with the defendant\u2019s family, the mother stated that she had known the defendant for about fifteen years, that she had not seen her former sisters-in-law since the incident in issue, and that her contact with the defendant\u2019s family was, at the time of trial, mostly with her former husband. He had returned from Oregon and was picking up his daughters at the mother\u2019s house for visitation \u201cpretty regularly.\u201d The prosecutor took no objection to any of defense counsel\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The defendant testified, without objection, that his mother had been \u201ctom\u201d because she had tried to take Mary and Jane from their mother and the mother had retaliated by attempting (although failing) to obtain a restraining order to prevent the grandmother from visiting with the daughters. See also notes 3 and 4, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\"> On cross-examination of the defendant, the prosecutor attempted to elicit agreement from the defendant that the \u201ccustody problems\u201d were no concern of his, but the defendant pointed out, \u201cThey are my family. I have some concern on that, yes.\u201d The defendant also responded to another question with the answer that the mother did have hostility towards him. When the prosecutor intimated that any such hostility would be without reason, the defendant pointed out that the mother\u2019s second husband had tried to shoot him and that he (the defendant) had caused the police to investigate the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b134-9\"> When the defendant further testified on cross-examination that his family had been concerned about the \u201cdrag situation\u201d at the mother\u2019s house, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>including \u201cjunkies\u201d on the floor, and that for that reason the grandmother had retained an attorney to secure custody of the children with her, the prosecutor went astray in asking how the grandmother could be concerned and want the children \u201cwith the drugs you had in your house.\u201d It was there that the judge drew the line.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b136-8\"> The defendant claims that the error in the questions was aggravated by the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, wherein he stated that defense counsel \u201cwould have you believe\u201d that all the witnesses for the Commonwealth had lied. Passing over the fact that no objection to the argument was taken, we think it fair comment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>376 Mass. 402, 422-423 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
