The school committee and the superintendent of schools, defendants, claiming they were entitled to directed verdicts by reason of G. L. c. 71, \u00a738, appeal from judgment against them entered on jury verdicts for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">We relate the facts as they could have been found by the jury. In late August, 1980, the school committee advertised for a permanent band leader and orchestra teacher for Cambridge High and Latin School for the 1980-1981 school year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The position had to be filled quickly, as the former band leader had resigned suddenly, the beginning of the school year was at hand, and the band was committed to a number of musical events in the early fall, including a parade in celebration of Cambridge\u2019s 350th anniversary.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">While in Boston visiting relatives, the plaintiff, a resident of Georgia and a high school teacher, saw and responded to a newspaper advertisement for the position. After several interviews with the director and assistant director of music of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Cambridge public schools (the directors), and after all his references had been checked, the plaintiff was offered a one-year \u201cpermanent\u201d position by the directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Although he was told that his appointment had to be approved by the Cambridge school committee, he was assured that approval would be no more than a \u201crubber stamp\u201d which would be granted upon the recommendation of the directors and that \u201cthis is common procedure in education.\u201d The directors read the list of school committee members to the plaintiff and mentioned those who were \u201con their side.\u201d The plaintiff was also given the name of one member of the committee (whom he called) who had a real estate business, as the directors wanted to ensure that the plaintiff would live in Cambridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">After urging by the directors, the plaintiff accepted the position. He gave up his teaching post in Georgia, moved to Cambridge (at a cost of approximately $3,000), and began teaching on September 15, 1980. Three and one-half weeks later, after the 350th anniversary parade, the directors fired him. They never submitted his name to the superintendent of schools or to the school committee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The jury were instructed that they could find a breach of an employment contract and were also instructed on the principles of estoppel, in each instance over the defendants\u2019 objection. They returned verdicts for the plaintiff and assessed damages in the sum of $23,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">1. <em>No recovery for year\u2019s employment, </em>(a) <em>Statutory bar. </em>The defendants claim they were entitled to directed verdicts by reason of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 38, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>provides the exclusive method of contracting with teachers, namely, that they be nominated by the superintendent and voted by the school committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The plaintiff did not secure an employment contract as a teacher with the city. \u201cAuthority to employ him was vested solely in the school committee.\u201d <em>Demers </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Worcester, </em>329 Mass. 370, 373 (1952). See <em>Pulvino </em>v. <em>Yarmouth, </em>286 Mass. 21, 24 (1934); <em>Bonar </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>369 Mass. 579, 581-582 (1976). The statutory requirements were concededly not met, and the jury were incorrectly charged that they could find a breach of an employment contract on common law principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The plaintiff argues that, at the very least, he was an \u201cextended term substitute\u201d and urges that his hiring as such a substitute did not require compliance with \u00a7 38. He cites no authority for this claim, and we do not see how he can escape the statutory requisites of the hiring process on this basis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Brophy </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Worcester, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 731, 737 (1978), where we held that service as a long term substitute teacher counted toward the establishment of tenure, noting that such a teacher \u201cperforms the same functions . . . , is evaluated and hired in the same manner as a regular teacher, and serves for a predetermined period of time . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">(b) <em>Estoppel inapplicable. </em>The jury were also instructed on principles of estoppel as follows: In order to find estoppel, \u201cyou must find that the defendant made a representation to the plaintiff that he had a permanent teaching position, that the plaintiff actually relied on that representation by the defendant and did something as a result of that representation, and the conduct or the action taken resulted in him being harmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Traditionally, courts have not permitted estoppel of the government. A starting point, suggested by Professor Davis, is that \u201cthe King cannot be estopped, for it cannot be presumed the King would do wrong to any person.\u201d 4 Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 20.2 (2d ed. 1983), citing Bacon\u2019s Abridgments, quoted in 15 Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England 248.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For a comprehensive discussion of Federal cases, a criticism of the doctrine,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the discerning of \u201ca mainstream of case law estopping the government,\u201d see 4 Davis, <em>supra </em>\u00a7\u00a7 20.1-20.6 and \u00a7 20.12, at 43. See also Note, Equitable Estoppel of the Government, 79 Colum.L.Rev. 551 (1979). Justifications of the tradition, other than that of sovereign immunity, are the need for protecting the public against improper collusions,\u201d <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Munroe, </em>11 U.S. (7 Crunch) 366, 370 (1813), deference to legislative policy, concern about the public treasury, and administrative efficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Although the withering of the doctrine of sovereign immunity has had some effect on the law of estoppel in Massachusetts,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the courts are \u201creluctant to apply principles of estoppel to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>public entities where to do so would negate requirements of law intended to protect the public interest.\u201d <em>Phipps Prod. Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>387 Mass. 687, 693 (1982). Thus, the rule against applying estoppel to the sovereign continues almost intact where a government official acts, or makes representations, contrary to a statute or regulation designed to prevent favoritism, secure honest bidding, or ensure some other legislative purpose. Preservation of \u201cthe processes ordered by the Legislature,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 694, \u201coverrides the equities that would appropriately be considered in a purely private transaction,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Application of estoppel principles to bind the defendants to a contract of employment with the plaintiff would, in this case, run counter to express judicial as well as legislative policy. Authority for the management of the public schools is vested in the school committee of a city or town. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 37 &amp; 38; <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Hopedale, </em>276 Mass. 230, 235-236 (1931). As was stated in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Somerville, </em>307 Mass. 354, 362 (1940), \u201cBy long established legislative policy school committees are given general management of the public schools including the election and the dismissal of teachers. . . . The success of a school system depends largely on the character and ability of the teachers. Unless a school committee has authority to employ and discharge teachers it would be difficult to perform properly its duty of managing a school system.\u201d A school committee may not delegate this authority, and the concept of nondelegability of the authority of \u201can incumbent school committee in the appointment ... of academic personnel [also] has a long tradition.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Danvers </em>v. <em>Tyman, </em>372 Mass. 106, 111 (1977), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">These judicial and legislative statements, designed to establish and maintain public schools of high quality, lead us to conclude that the public interest in complying with the statutory requirements of \u00a7 38 precludes the award of damages for a breach of an employment contract on estoppel principles. It was error to instruct the jury that they might make such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>2. <em>Recovery on a narrow basis. </em>Although the plaintiff is not entitled to damages for a breach of contract of employment, it does not follow that he is without any remedy. While G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 38, denies the directors ultimate hiring authority, the statute does not preclude the interviewing and negotiating with prospective applicants by subordinates of the school committee. Implicit in the jury verdict is a finding that, at the very least, the directors gave the plaintiff a subsidiary promise that, barring some valid reason, they would submit his name to the superintendent and the school committee. The record does not suggest that this subsidiary promise to recommend the plaintiff was beyond their authority or that it offends any statute or legislative policy. Cf. <em>School Comm. of Salem </em>v. <em>Gavin, </em>333 Mass. 632, 634-635 (1956). To the contrary, in the pressing circumstances of the last days of August, 1980, the directors as agents of the defendants were well within their duties in doing what they could to obtain, subject to the necessary approvals, the most qualified candidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The promise, however, is a very limited one and the meaning to be given to \u201csome valid reason\u201d must be broad. Thus, the directors may not, consistently with the policies of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 37 &amp; 38, bind themselves to submit the plaintiff\u2019s name to the school superintendent if they in good faith have a valid reason for refraining from doing so. The school committee in \u201cchoosing and keeping . . . proper and competent teachers,\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Somerville, </em>307 Mass. at 362, must have the best advice of its subordinates, even if the latter may have previously given rash assurances.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The broad and oft-cited meaning of \u201cgood cause\u201d set forth in <em>Rinaldo </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Revere, </em>294 Mass. 167, 169 (1936) is, we think, an appropriate standard for defining \u201cvalid reason\u201d in this context. \u201cGood cause includes any ground which is put forward ... in good faith and which is not arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable, or irrelevant to the . . . task of building up and maintaining an efficient school system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">That the present plaintiff was treated shabbily (so far as appears on this record) cannot be gainsaid. No rule requires that agents of the defendants, acting within the scope of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>authority, be totally exempt from the principles of fair dealing or be permitted to act arbitrarily. On the record before us, the promise does not require any relaxation of the requirements of law intended to protect the public interest<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and appears authorized. Indeed, the promise may be viewed as vital and proper to obtain needed services for the defendants. We see no reason not to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Liability has been imposed in similar circumstances. In <em>Kaye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>467 F.2d 416-419 (D.C. Cir. 1972), a Yale law student who had moved to Washington in June for a summer job with a government agency which required security clearance did not obtain such clearance until August. He had been told that the usual starting date for summer students was June, and he had turned down other jobs. The court reversed an order allowing summary judgment for the government and held that the plaintiff would be entitled to recover if he could prove the existence of a subsidiary promise by the government to exercise its best efforts in good faith to complete the security clearance as promptly as reasonably possible. <em>Id. </em>at 418-419.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">An additional ground<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for enforcing the subsidiary promise is set forth in \u00a7 90(1) Restatement (Second) of Contracts (1981). That section provides: \u201c(1) A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires.\u201d There is no question that the directors\u2019 subsidiary promise falls within the section and that reliance can form the basis of an enforceable promise in Massachusetts. <em>Loranger Constr. Corp </em>v. <em>E. F. Hauserman Co., </em>376 Mass. 757, 760-761 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>A number of courts have enforced promises against the government on the \u00a7 90 principle.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, in <em>Kaye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>467 F.2d at 419, discussed earlier, the court also proceeded on the \u00a7 90 principle, stating: \u201cAdditionally, Kaye was entitled to the opportunity to establish that the Government induced Kaye\u2019s reliance by its implied promise . ...\u201d A case strikingly similar to the one at bar, <em>Minor </em>v. <em>Sully Buttes Sch. Dist. #58-2, </em>345 N.W.2d 48 (S.D. 1984), allowed, on the \u00a7 90 principle, recovery of moving expenses to a band leader who had been induced to leave a job in Minnesota to come to South Dakota, although recovery was denied for breach of a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>of employment because statutory requisites had not been met. See also <em>Warner </em>v. <em>North Orange County Community College Dist., 99 </em>Cal. App. 3d 617, 627 (1979). Compare <em>Ogbunugafor </em>v. <em>St. Christopher\u2019s Union Free Sch. Dist., </em>100 A.D.2d 580, 580-581 (N.Y. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">While the plaintiff may be able to establish on retrial that he is entitled to some damages, we think the measure of damages for the breach should be limited to the damages the plaintiff incurred before and during the three and a half weeks prior to his discharge. Damages for the loss of the entire year, whether measured by his Georgia salary or his expected Cambridge compensation, may not be recovered, as it would be improper to accomplish, in the guise of compensation for breach of the subsidiary promise, what could not be done directly because of the policy reasons expressed in part 1 of this opinion. Cf. <em>School Comm. of New Bedford </em>v. <em>New Bedford Educators Assn., 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 793, 802 (1980). Damages measured by his Cambridge salary would also be too speculative. See note 9, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings limited to the issue whether the directors had \u201cgood cause\u201d to refrain from submitting the plaintiff\u2019s name; if the answer be no, there will be the further issue of damages.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b373-12\"> The post was advertised by the personnel department of the Cambridge public schools at the request of the director of music. This was the procedure followed when a position became \u201cofficially vacant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The reasons, other than a bare assertion that the plaintiff\u2019s performance was unsatisfactory, were not elucidated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b374-10\">General Laws c. 71, \u00a7 38, as amended through St. 1978, c. 100, in relevant part provides: \u201c[The school committee] shall elect and contract with the teachers of the public schools, shall require full and satisfactory evidence of their moral character, and shall ascertain their qualifications for teaching and their capacity for the government of schools. It may also hire instructional or administrative aides for assignments in laboratories and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>classrooms. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">\u201cThe vote on the election, contract, or promotion of a teacher shall be by yeas and nays.

L. c. 71, \u00a7 38, were not applied to substitute teachers related to \u201cday to day\u201d substitutes and not to \u201cextended term substitutes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b376-6\"> \u201cThe separate reasons why the rule of immunity was established for the municipality, on the one hand, and for the sovereign, on the other hand, may have been sound in their inception but they have long since lost their <em>validity.\"Morash &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 612, 616 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\"> Davis predicts at 7: \u201cIn the long run, the view that will prevail may be something like this: \u2018Something is wrong when the citizen can recover for a dented fender caused by a postal employee at the wheel of a government truck and one cannot when he is booby-trapped by an employee of Federal Crop Insurance. . . .\u2019 <em>McFarlin </em>v. <em>Federal Crop Ins. Corp., </em>438 F.2d 1237 (9th Cir. 1971).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b376-8\">See <em>Vasys </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Commn., </em>387 Mass. 51, 54-55 &amp; n.3 (1982), where the Supreme Judicial Court refused to follow Federal precedents in interpreting \u00a7 4 of G. L. c. 258, the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act. Based on \u201cmodem views on the doctrine of sovereign immunity,\u201d including rejection of the assumption that there can be no suit against the sovereign without the permission of the Legislature, the court estopped the defendant commission, by reason of its prior conduct, from raising a particular defense. <em>Id. </em>at 54-55, 57. But see <em>Holahan </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>394 Mass. 186, 190 (1985), which construes <em>Vasys </em>as an application of the principle that a <em>litigant </em>may not assume inconsistent and contradictory positions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\"> The obligations imposed on the directors because of their promise do not, of course, impose any obligation on the part of the superintendent to recommend or on the school committee to elect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The agreement to come to Cambridge was, at least, an acceptance by the plaintiff of the subsidiary promise. The subsidiary promise and its acceptance establish a contract, apart from the \u00a7 90 principle now discussed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b380-5\"> Although the term \u201cpromissory estoppel\u201d has been used to describe \u00a7 90 promises, the term may be misleading in this governmental context. \u201cEstoppel\u201d or reliance is used in this part 2 in a somewhat different sense from that in section 1 (b) of this opinion. There, we held that reliance may not be the basis to prevent or estop the government from asserting a statutory or other impediment to a plaintiff\u2019s claim that he had an employment contract with the city. If there were no such impediment (or any question or sovereign immunity), that is, if the directors had full authority by statute or otherwise to make such a contract, the reluctance to apply principles of estoppel to the government would not be involved. Only conventional contract principles would be at stake. This is so because promises enforceable by virtue of reliance, that is, \u00a7 90 promises, have been restored to their \u201ctraditional\u201d status and hence are now treated as ordinary contracts, except as to recovery. See <em>Loranger Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>E. F. Hauserman Co., </em>376 Mass. at 761, citing <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>363 Mass. 579, 588 n.6 (1973), and \u00a7 90. See generally as to amounts of recovery Farnsworth, Contracts \u00a7 2.19, at 93-98 (1982). Since we view the directors as acting within their authority to make the subsidiary contract without any statutory\" impediment (made known to us), we view the contract as binding on \u00a7 90 principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Another basis for recovery is stated in <em>Smale &amp; Robinson, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>123 F. Supp. 457, 465 (S.D. Cal. 1954), that is, \u201cacts or omissions of agents lawfully authorized to bind the United States or direct its course of conduct during a particular transaction may estop the Government.\u201d See also <em>Semaan </em>v. <em>Mumford, </em>335 F.2d 704, 706 &amp; n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1964), where the court held that the Librarian of Congress would be estopped, if the facts were as alleged, to deny the plaintiff the procedural rights of a permanent employee on dismissal. \u201cSince the Government agency to be estopped here possessed the authority to do what it appeared to be doing, was not depriving the public of the protection of any statute, and was acting in a proprietary capacity <em>qua </em>employer, there is no reason to bar an estoppel here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706 n.6. While we note that these cases lend some support to our conclusion, we prefer in this case to rest on the enforceability of the subsidiary promise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\"> The parties have not raised and we do not consider whether the city is a necessary party to the action.
