L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, as amended by St. 1971, c. 941, \u00a7 1, permitting an action at law to be brought for \u201cdamages for personal injuries ... by an employee against any person other than the insured person employing such employee and liable for payment of the compensation provided by this chapter....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">The case was tried on a statement of agreed facts. The plaintiff, an employee of Peakload, Inc., a company engaged in supplying temporary labor to various business establishments, was injured while working for the defendant on its premises. The plaintiff was supervised by an employee of the defendant. At all material times, both Peakload and the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>ant carried worker\u2019s compensation coverage in accordance with G. L. c. 152. The plaintiff\u2019s wages had been paid by Peakload, and he has received compensation benefits for his injuries from the compensation insurer of Peakload. There was no agreement between the defendant and Peakload concerning payment of worker\u2019s compensation benefits to personnel supplied by Peak-load to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">A judge of the Superior Court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the applicable provisions of G. L. c. 152 bar recovery and entered judgment for the plaintiff. The judge reasoned that, in the circumstances presented here, for an employer to be immune under c. 152 from an employee\u2019s common law action, that employer must satisfy a two-part test: \u201c(1) the employer must be an insured person liable for the payment of compensation, and (2) the employer must be the direct employer of the employee.\u201d The judge then concluded that the defendant was not immune from suit under c. 152 because it was not liable to pay compensation to the plaintiff. We concur. That ruling is entirely consistent with the unambiguous language of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, as amplified by \u00a7 18 of that same chapter. See <em>Searcy </em>v. <em>Paul, ante </em>134, 138-139 (1985). See generally Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 150 (2d ed. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The parties have stipulated that Peakload was the plaintiff\u2019s general employer and the defendant was his special employer; therefore, pursuant to \u00a7 18 of c. 152, as amended through St. 1969, c. 755, \u00a7 2, Peakload, as general employer, was liable to pay compensation to the plaintiff. Section 15 provides that the only person who will be immune from an action at law is \u201cthe insured person employing such employee <em>and </em>liable for payment of the [worker\u2019s] compensation\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The judge correctly ruled that \u201cas a special employer [the defendant] is not liable to pay compensation.\u201d See <em>Ramsey\u2019s Case, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 199, 201-204 (1977). Because Peak-load carried worker\u2019s compensation coverage and because Peakload and the defendant have not \u201cso agreed\u201d that \u201cthe special employer or its insurer shall be liable for such [compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>sation] payment\u201d (G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18) to personnel supplied by Peakload, the defendant cannot, as the judge properly concluded, satisfy one part of the two-part test set forth in \u00a7 15. It thus follows that this defendant is not immune from an action at law for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
