For the subdivision aspect of the controversy, see <em>Strand </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Sudbury, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 18 (1977), <em>S.C., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 935 (1979). The present appeal is from a judgment of the Superior Court, on the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for judicial review under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, affirming the decision of the defendant Department of Environmental Quality Engineering (department). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">I. <em>Prior Proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">In December of 1979, the Sudbury conservation commission (commission)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> determined that G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, the Wetlands Protection Act, applied to the trustees\u2019 twenty-six acre parcel of land upon which they wanted to construct a roadway and install a storm drainage system. Thereafter, the trustees filed a notice of intent with the commission, see \u00a7 40, first par., and 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.05 (1978), and a public hearing was held on or about March 5, 1980. At that hearing, the trustees were advised that their notice was incomplete, so they withdrew it. That notice is not here at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Nothing happened until May 1, 1980, when the commission received another notice of intent from the trustees, which it returned to them on May 16, 1980, as \u201cincomplete.\u201d Enclosed with the rejected notice and cover letter was a copy of the commission\u2019s \u201cGuidelines and Instructions\u201d for filing \u201cNotice of Intent.\u201d Review of the commission\u2019s cover letter and guidelines reveals that the trustees had failed to include color-coded plans (or engineering drawings) with their notice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It does not appear from the record that the trustees made any pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>test to or inquiry of the commission concerning the return of their notice. The next document we see is the trustees\u2019 request to the department (dated May 23, 1980) that it act on the notice of intent in view of the commission\u2019s failure to hold a timely public hearing. See G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, thirteenth par.; 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.06 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The department took up the trustees\u2019 request, made a determination of applicability of G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, and issued an order of conditions. The plaintiffs and the commission then requested an adjudicatory hearing. By agreement of the parties, the hearings officer bifurcated the hearing. The first part of the hearing concerned \u201cjurisdictional\u201d questions: whether the department could consider the trustees\u2019 request where the commission had not held a public hearing because it had returned the notice as \u201cincomplete,\u201d and whether the geographical areas in question were subject to G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40. That hearing was followed by another, addressing the question of the protection of the wetlands afforded by the department\u2019s order of conditions to the trustees\u2019 proposed activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">On April 8, 1981, the department issued its decision that the trustees\u2019 request was properly before it and that G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, applied to the area in question. The decision advised that the parties could file a motion for reconsideration, and the plaintiffs did so. That motion was denied, and, within thirty days of the denial, the plaintiffs brought their complaint under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. On July 23, 1982, the department issued its decision on the second phase of the hearings (the order of conditions), and the plaintiffs again timely moved for reconsideration. Their motion was denied on or about September 10, 1982, and some fifty-six days later the court granted them leave to file an \u201cAnnex\u201d to their previously filed complaint. In the \u201cAnnex,\u201d they sought review of the department\u2019s order of conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">II. <em>The \u201cIncomplete\u201d Notice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Under 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.04(3) and \u00a7 10.05(4) (1978), the commission could rightly conclude that the trustees \u2019 notice was incomplete for failure to submit properly color-coded engineering plans. It does not follow from that conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>sion, however, that the commission may refuse to accept the notice for filing. Rather, it appears that the commission\u2019s proper course of action should have been to file the notice, schedule the public hearing, and then deny the request. 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.05(6) and (7) (1978).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The department took the position that the commission must accept the notice and hold the public hearing, irrespective of the inadequacy of the .information therein contained. The reasoning is that, if the commission can simply refuse to accept the notice, it can prevent the applicant from seeking any further review of the request made in the notice. Thus, the commission\u2019s refusal to accept the notice for filing must be treated as a \u201cfailure to act\u201d by the commission, thereby giving the applicant the right to request the department to act. The department\u2019s position is consistent with the language of G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, as amended through St. 1979, c. 693, the pertinent portion of the thirteenth paragraph providing: \u201cIf a conservation commission has failed to hold a hearing within the twenty-one day period as required, or if a commission, after holding such hearing has failed within twenty-one days therefrom to issue an order ... or where an order does issue from said commission, the applicant. . . may, by certified mail and within ten days from said commission\u2019s order or failure to act, request the department... to determine whether the area on which the proposed work is to be done is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>significant to . . . [interests protected by \u00a7 40]. . . . Upon receipt of such request the department shall make the determination requested and shall . . . impose such conditions as will contribute to the protection of the interests described herein .. . ,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, unless the commission\u2019s refusal to accept the notice of intent for filing is treated as a failure to hold a public hearing and, hence, a failure to act, the applicant has no basis in \u00a7 40 for requesting action by the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The obvious reply to the department\u2019s reasoning is that, depending upon the degree of the inadequacy of the information contained in the applicant\u2019s notice, the required public hearing can be more ritualistic than meaningful. Yet, statutory provisions which create a right in the public to participate in land usage decisions are not uncommon. Traditionally, such provisions have been strictly enforced. See, e.g., <em>Co-Ray Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Adjustment of Boston, </em>328 Mass. 103, 107 (1951); <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Falmouth, </em>351 Mass. 410, 414 (1966); <em>Planning Bd. of Peabody </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Peabody, </em>358 Mass. 81, 83 (1970); <em>Strand v. Planning Bd. of Sudbury, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. at 23.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>There is nothing in \u00a7 40, however, which even suggests that local public participation is a condition precedent to a determination by the department on the applicant\u2019s request. The express language of the statute is to the contrary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The department\u2019s right to act with or without local input, so long as the local commission had the opportunity to participate, flows from the fact that the ultimate determination is not made by the local authorities. Rather, it is made by a Statewide agency, the department, which acts to protect a statewide interest. See <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Orleans, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 359, 368 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">III. <em>The Merits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments concern the various determinations made by the department on the substantive issues raised by the trustees\u2019 request. It is unnecessary to recite the details of the plaintiffs\u2019 numerous challenges to the department\u2019s decision; rather, it is sufficient to state that all their complaints turn on issues of credibility and the weight afforded to the evidence presented by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">We note that some of the issues presented by the plaintiffs arise out of the department\u2019s decision after the second phase of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the bifurcated hearing. As earlier noted, the department\u2019s final decision after the second hearing was issued on or about September 10, 1982, but the plaintiffs did not attempt to file their complaint under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, until October 28, 1982. Although the plaintiffs label this complaint an \u201cannex\u201d to the earlier and timely filed complaint for review from the decision after the first phase of the hearings, the \u201cannex\u201d is not, in our review, an amendment of the original complaint. It is a request for judicial review of the department\u2019s decision on issues separate and distinct from those earlier adjudicated. As such, it should have been filed within the thirty-day period set out in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(1). The fact that the plaintiffs were granted leave of court on November 5, 1982, to file their \u201cannex\u201d does not render it timely, as leave was neither requested nor obtained until after expiration of the thirty-day time period. See <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 668 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Even if the \u201cannex\u201d were a true amendment or it had been filed timely, the plaintiffs would not prevail. All their challenges to the department\u2019s decision are, in fact, arguments to the effect that we \u201cshould make independent findings on our own initiative from the record more in accordance with the plaintiff[s\u2019] theory of the case in place of making a determination as to whether substantial evidence exists to support the [department\u2019s] findings.\u201d <em>Number Three Lounge, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 301, 309 (1979). This we will not do for the reasons set out in <em>Number Three Lounge </em>and the cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\"> Although the commission took part in the proceedings before the department, it has not participated in the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the decisions of the department or of the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b319-9\"> The color code requirement instructed that the plan or drawing indicate by various and specifically described means the \u201c[e]xisting wetlands, flood plains and waterways\u201d as well as the \u201cproposed alteration to site.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b321-5\"> The cited sections of 310 Code Mass. Regs. (1978) read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u00a7 10.04(3): \u201cThe applicant may submit, or be required to submit by the conservation commission or Commissioner [of the department], any further information which will assist in the review and which is deemed necessary to determine the proposed effect on the environment. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u00a7 10.05(4): \u201cA complete filing for the purpose of this Act shall include the following: (a) A completed Notice of Intent including plans to be filed therewith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">\u00a7 10.05(6): \u201cWhere the material required in 310 CMR 10.05(4) is not submitted to the conservation commission, an Order may prohibit the activity after a public hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">\u00a7 10.05(7): \u201cThe adequacy of the items to be submitted under 310 CMR 10.05(4) shall be reflected in the Order to be issued by the conservation commission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\">In accord with \u00a7 40, the department promulgated 310 <em>Code </em>Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.06(2) (1978), which provides, in relevant part: \u201cThe applicant [or] any person aggrieved by an Order issued after the . . . commission\u2019s public hearing . . . may request, in writing, a determination to be made by the Department within ten days from the . . . commission\u2019s Order or determination or failure to act.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\"> The department disposes of the public hearing issue by citing <em>Falmouth Conservation Commn. </em>v. <em>Department of Environmental Quality Engr., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 1116 (1984), which held that alleged noncompliance with G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, does not deprive the department of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over a request for action. That decision, however, was issued pursuant to Rule 1:28 of the Appeals Court, as amended, 10 Mass. App. Ct. 942 (1980), and is unavailable for use as precedent. See <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 562, 566 &amp; n.7 (1985). We note, however, that in that case the defect in the proceedings was that the applicant had failed to file an environmental impact report, see G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62A; nonetheless, there was a full public hearing on the application, after which the commission issued its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">In going behind the summary order issued in the <em>Falmouth </em>case, we do not retreat from the strong message in <em>Lyons. </em>We have given the department the benefit of the fact that it filed its brief prior to <em>Lyons.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\"> Should the department be of opinion that the applicant\u2019s submission is inadequate, \u00a7 40 does not require that the application be returned to the commission. Rather, \u00a7 40, thirteenth par., provides that \u201cthe department shall notify the applicant within thirty days of the receipt of such request if his application or request is not in proper form or is lacking information or documentation necessary to make the determination.\u201d See also 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.04(3) (1978), at note 3, <em>supra. </em>The fact that the statute <em>allows </em>the department to make a determination notwithstanding an incomplete application at the local level does not mean that the department could not amend its regulations <em>to require </em>a remand to the commission in such a situation. See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.05(7)(h) (1983), which reads, in pertinent part: \u201cIf the Department determines that insufficient information was submitted, it shall affirm the denial and instruct the applicant to refile with the conservation commission and include the appropriate information. If the Department determines that sufficient information was submitted, it shall so inform the applicant and the conservation commission, and shall proceed to issue a Superseding Order as provided in 310 CMR 10.05.\u201d The 1983 regulation is consistent with \u00a7 40 and is reasonable.
