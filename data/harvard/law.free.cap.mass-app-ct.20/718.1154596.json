He was a provisional civil service appointee. G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41. The function of the unit, which has about 340 individuals on its staff throughout the Commonwealth, is to collect and supervise child support payments from absent parents. The evidence showed essentially the following course of Rafferty\u2019s work for the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">In June, 1981, Rafferty was told by the unit director, Dennis Sullivan, Rafferty\u2019s immediate supervisor, that there were problems with the field staff\u2019s supervision of support payments. Sullivan also requested Rafferty not to discuss his personal life with department employees but to deal with them in a professional manner. Earlier, Sullivan had received a complaint from another employee that Rafferty had been discussing his personal background and \u201csexual prowess\u201d among the staff. Sullivan, however, did not discuss this particular complaint with Rafferty.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">During their discussion, Rafferty stated he was unhappy working with Sullivan and complained of the fact that he was not given any direction from superiors or any breadth of authority. He told Sullivan that he was looking for employment elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">Sullivan again raised with Rafferty the problem of inadequate supervision in October, 1981. Subsequently, in January, 1982, at a group meeting, Sullivan told Rafferty and several area coordinators (subordinates to Rafferty) that he was dissatisfied with the performance in the field. When Rafferty started to criticize the area coordinators, Sullivan told Rafferty that it was his job to see that the area coordinators carried out their tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>In June, 1982, Sullivan decided that he was not getting proper effort from Rafferty and transferred him to the Boston office. There he was assigned to work on an Internal Revenue Service project, but his job title, pay, and benefits were not affected. About this time, Rafferty told Sullivan that he had several job prospects and was one of two remaining candidates for a position with a hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">In August, 1982, the defendant, Thomas Spirito, then Commissioner of Public Welfare, showed Sullivan a letter that Rafferty had sent to one Webber, an employee in the department\u2019s Lynn office, requesting Webber\u2019s help in obtaining a job in the department for Rafferty\u2019s wife. Sullivan told Rafferty that he had exercised poor judgment in sending the letter. At the same time, Rafferty informed Sullivan that the hospital job would probably materialize in the middle of September.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">On October 25, 1982, Rafferty told Sullivan that his job prospects had fallen through and that it appeared likely that he would remain with the department. After discussion of the unit\u2019s problems and the letter to Webber, Sullivan advised Rafferty that he should resign. According to Sullivan, Rafferty replied, \u201cIf you give me three weeks, I shall leave quietly.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sullivan agreed and checked with Commissioner Spirito, who had no objection. Four days later, Sullivan told Rafferty that he could remain with the department until November 12.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rafferty, then claimed that he had certain rights under a document known as Employee Relations Memo-3 (ER-3, discussed below in part 1 of this opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">In a memorandum to Sullivan, dated November 8, 1982, Rafferty said he did not intend to leave his job and requested an explanation of the reasons for his termination. On November 17, 1982, Sullivan told Rafferty by letter that he had been discharged, effective at the close of business that day, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>of \u201cunsatisfactory work performance.\u201d Rafferty did not request a hearing before the appointing authority pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41, third par.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">On December 20, 1982, Rafferty brought this action against the Commissioner (Spirito), the unit director (Sullivan), and the Commonwealth, seeking damages based on (1) alleged deprivation of property without due process of law in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982), (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress, and (3) breach of contract. A jury-waived trial was held before a probate judge, sitting by designation in the Superior Court. The judge, at the close of Rafferty\u2019s evidence and at the close of all the evidence, denied requests for the entry of judgment for the defendants. On November 17, 1983, the trial judge made findings<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and ordered (taking into account later amendments) judgment for Rafferty (a) for one dollar on the \u00a7 1983 claim against Sullivan,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> together with $4,800 as an attorney\u2019s fee under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1982), and (b) for $28,250.56 for his breach of contract claim against Sullivan and the Commonwealth. The judge dismissed Rafferty\u2019s emotional distress claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The trial judge ruled (a) that Rafferty was entitled to the benefits of ER-3 and under it had a constitutionally protected property interest in continued employment with the department; (b) that Rafferty was not required to exhaust administrative remedies; (c) that Rafferty\u2019s termination was unlawful because not effected in accordance with ER-3; and (d) that Rafferty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>was entitled to \u201cback pay\u201d for the time he had been without employment by the department.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A single justice of this court stayed portions of the amended judgment on December 28, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">1. ER-3 is a somewhat diffuse memorandum to supervisors and managers of the department, circulated on May 1, 1980, by Kevin D. Preston, then the department\u2019s director of labor relations. It begins with the following: \u201cThis memo outlines the [department's policy on employee discipline\u201d and \u201calso details the procedures to be followed in disciplinary matters. The policy and the procedures are applicable to all employees except holders of statutory positions\u201d (with another exception not here relevant). In general it provides for a system of progressive disciplinary measures prior to the discharge of an employee. ER-3 does not appear as a part of the Code of Massachusetts Regulations and has not been shown to have been adopted as a regulation under G. L. c. 18, \u00a7\u00a7 8-10. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 4-7.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The trial judge found that Spirito (by the time of trial a former commissioner) \u201cconcedes\u201d that ER-3 \u201cwas in place\u201d while Rafferty was an employee of the department and \u201cindividually concedes that ER-3 is applicable to\u201d Rafferty. The judge interprets ER-3 to make each covered employee \u201centitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>to a predischarge lock-step process involving informal warning, formal warning, suspension and discharge.\u201d He ruled that Rafferty was covered by ER-3 and found that he did not receive the benefits of ER-3 prior to his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">We think the trial judge concluded wrongly that ER-3 afforded Rafferty a constitutionally protected interest in further employment. There is no statutory requirement that a provisional employee cannot be removed without proof that the removal is for cause. G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 14 &amp; 41, third par.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> ER-3 also deals largely, if not entirely, only with procedures for the termination of a tenured departmental employee. It is not the type of departmental policy statement which can become a \u201cproperty interest\u201d for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982). <em>Beitzell </em>v. <em>Jeffrey, </em>643 F.2d 870, 874-878 (1st Cir. 1981), dealing with a probationary university teacher. See <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 344-347 (1976); <em>Laureano-Agosto </em>v. <em>Garcia-Caraballo, </em>731 F.2d 101, 103-104 (1st Cir. 1984). See also <em>Stetson </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Carlisle, </em>369 Mass. 755, 759-761 (1976); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Otero, </em>557 F.2d 435, 437 &amp; n.6 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Bleeker </em>v. <em>Dukakis, </em>665 F.2d 401, 403 (1st Cir. 1981), holding that personnel policies about warnings and an opportunity for an \u201cat will\u201d employee to correct performance before being discharged for unsatisfactory performance \u201care insufficient to convert\u201d the employee\u2019s \u201cemployment interest into constitutionally protected \u2018property.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">2. Because Rafferty\u2019s claims must arise, if at all, under Massachusetts law (rather than under \u00a7 1983) we think that Massachusetts law determines whether he was obliged to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>exhaust any administrative remedies. He did not claim his rights under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>despite the circumstance that he had known for some time that his discharge was in contemplation and had acquiesced in, and sought in some degree, postponement of its effective date. He has made no showing that taking an administrative appeal would have been futile. See <em>Shick </em>v. <em>Farmers Home Admn. of U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, </em>748 F.2d 35, 39-41 (1st Cir. 1984).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In view of what is said in part 3(a) of this opinion we need not and do not decide whether the trial judge was clearly in error in making findings in effect that Sullivan had not complied with ER-3 in the discharge of Rafferty. We note, however, that our reading of the evidence would lead to the conclusion that there had been at least substantial compliance with ER-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">3. (a) Under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41, third par.,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a provisional or nontenured employee may seek an \u201cinformal hearing,\u201d which shall be \u201cfinal,\u201d before the appointing authority. See note 8, <em>supra. </em>This remedy Rafferty did not pursue (he has referred us to no statute or duly adopted regulation granting a nontenured employee any other remedy). It is afforded under a chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>which (see e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 41-43) lays great importance on the prompt pursuit of administrative remedies. We do not decide whether a State agency can expand upon the rights of a provisional civil service employee by a policy such as that found in ER-3. We hold, however, that Rafferty cannot make a bypass of his unclaimed administrative remedy (which might have involved administrative examination of ER-3 and its validity) and obtain a court review of his discharge by an action for alleged breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">(b) The circumstances of this case provide no basis for any claim by Rafferty of a violation of any implied obligation of good faith in the discharge of an \u201cat will\u201d employee. See <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Bristol-Myers Co., </em>385 Mass. 300, 304-306 (1982). He certainly did not lose compensation for any past service. Compare <em>Fortune </em>v. <em>National Cash Register Co., </em>373 Mass. 96 (1977). Compare also <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>National Dairy Council, </em>491 F.Supp. 1108 (D. Mass. 1980, which, even if it represents the law of Massachusetts, applies the <em>Fortune </em>case in a situation not here presented). The trial judge erred in ordering judgment for Rafferty on any contract claim or claim based upon G. L. c. 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">4. Because we hold that Rafferty is not entitled to recover upon his claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982), there is no basis for granting attorney\u2019s fees to him under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1982). He now has no basis for contending that he is a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d Compare <em>Stock </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Sch., </em>394 Mass. 437, 441-442 (1985), and cases cited; <em>Guardianship of Hurley, </em>394 Mass. 554, 558-561 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">5. It is not clear that Rafferty on appeal argues that the trial judge improperly denied him recovery for emotional distress. In any event, we think no evidence justified a finding of intentional, extreme, and outrageous conduct, beyond all possible bounds of decency. See <em>Beecy </em>v. <em>Pucciarelli, </em>387 Mass. 589, 596 (1982), and authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">The judgments for Rafferty are reversed. Judgment (on all counts) is to be entered for each defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b736-8\">Rafferty\u2019s testimony was that Sullivan told him that \u201cthe director wants you terminated . . . [because of] a personality conflict.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\"> Later that same day, by memorandum, Sullivan told Rafferty that he had informed the personnel department of Rafferty\u2019s impending resignation on November 12, 1982.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b737-7\"> The judge found: (1) A number of Rafferty\u2019s subordinates were slow in \u201ccatching up\u201d on paperwork at times but that there was no tangible evidence that any specific field offices were seriously delinquent in collection of support moneys. His \u201cjob performance was not shown by the evidence to be measurably deficient.\u201d (2) His discussions of his personal life and \u201cfrivolous comments were, by the evidence, shown to be without . . . objective reality\u201d and \u201cwere hardly . . . transgression^] worthy of discharge.\u201d (3) There was no evidence that Rafferty \u201cbrought pressure on any departmental employees to secure . . . employment\u201d for his wife. (4) No credible evidence shows that Rafferty \u201cwas anything less than visible and efficient on the job.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b737-8\"> A similar judgment against Commissioner Spirito was ordered originally but was vacated by the trial judge sua sponte. He also dismissed Rafferty\u2019s claim for breach of contract against Spirito.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\"> In his order for judgment, the judge stated specifically that Rafferty did not seek reinstatement. Nevertheless, by amendments to his findings and the ensuing judgment, the judge ordered Rafferty reinstated as assistant to the unit\u2019s director.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Paragraph 2.0 of ER-3 defines a \u201c[n]on-tenured\u201d employee as \u201can employee who has held <em>neither </em>a permanent civil service appointment <em>nor </em>a position in any collective bargaining unit for six consecutive months\u201d (emphasis original) and notes that \u201c[ujnder statutory and contractual provisions non-tenured employees may be disciplined without \u2018just cause. \u2019 \u201d The paragraph states as a matter of departmental \u201cpolicy,\u201d that disciplinary action initiated against any employee \u201cmust be in accordance, with the policy and procedures of [ER-3].\u201d Paragraph 5.2 of ER-3 provides that \u201cin cases involving . . . non-tenured employees . . . informal and formal warning processes may be consolidated provided that the employee is made aware of the consequences of failure to improve his . . . performance ... by the end of the review period.\u201d Also, under ER-3, par. 5.3, a nontenured employee need not be suspended prior to discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Under \u00a7 41, as appearing in St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11, a provisional employee is entitled to \u201can informal hearing\u201d in circumstances discussed in part 3 of this opinion. See note 11, <em>infra. </em>Rafferty did not request such a hearing. See as to nontenured or provisional employees, <em>Dallas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Health, </em>1 Mass.

If the appointing authority, after hearing, finds that the discharge was justified, the discharge shall be affirmed, and the appointing authority may direct that the reasons for such discharge become part of such person\u2019s employment record. Otherwise, the appointing authority shall reverse such discharge, and the allegations against such person shall be stricken from such record. <em>The decision of the appointing authority shall be final, </em>and notification thereof shall be made in writing to such person and other parties concerned within ten days following such hearing\u201d (emphasis supplied).
