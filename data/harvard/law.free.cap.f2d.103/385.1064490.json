The application states that appellant\u2019s first use of the mark was on September 17, 1935. The examiner required appellant to disclaim the exclusive use of the word \u201cCola\u201d apart from the mark shown, which was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">Appellee filed notice of opposition to the registration of said mark, alleging that it was confusingly similar to appellee\u2019s registered mark \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d. A number of registrations of said mark by appellee and its predecessors are set out in said notice. The mark \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d appears in script in Said registrations, while appellant\u2019s mark, as shown in its application, is in stencil.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">Both sides took testimony. Appellant\u2019s testimony discloses that, at the time of taking _ the testimony, it had applied its said mark to a single shipment of a ten-gallon keg of syrup from its plant in New Jersey to New York; that appellant is a large manufacturer of various products, including ' glucose, corn starch, sugar, syrups, dextrines, feeds and oils, and that it owns and employs a number of trademarks for various package goods. One John D. Buhrer, vice president of appellant, testified that he suggested the mark \u201cDextra-Cola\u201d because \u201cit suggests the contents or make-up of the product.\u201d He further testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-14\">\u201cQ. 61. Have you ever heard of Coca Cola\"? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-15\">\u201cQ. 62. How long have you known Coca-Cola? A. Well, I imagine about twenty years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-16\">\u201cQ. 63. It is pretty well advertised, isn\u2019t it? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-17\">\u201cQ. 64. You have seen signs frequently around New York City? A. Plenty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-18\">\u201cQ. 65. In fact, everywhere you go, you see it? A. Too many.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-19\">s}s }{\u00ed ifc sj&lt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-20\">\u201cXQ. 43. You had Coca Cola in mind when you suggested Dextra-Cola? A. That is possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-21\">\u201cXQ. 44. Well, you said that you suggested the name? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-22\">\u201cXQ. 45. Well, you probably had Coca Cola in mind. A. I probably had Coca Cola in mind, although I had dextrose in mind too.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-23\">The testimony on behalf of appellee discloses that it and its predecessors had for more than fifty years manufactured a syrup for use in making beverages; that its business had grown from a production of 25 gallons in 1886 to more than 25,000,-000 gallons in 1934, and that in said last-named year appellee expended nearly $5,-000,000 in advertising its said product.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-24\">But one question was presented to the Patent Office tribunals, viz., that of confusing similarity of the respective, marks. Both the Examiner of Interferences and the commissioner held that the marks were confusingly similar, and from the decision of the commissioner appeal was taken to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-25\">The commissioner in his decision relied very largely upon our decision in the case of Steinreich v. Coca Cola Co., 67 F.2d 498, 21 C.C.P.A., Patents, 722, in which we held that the marks \u201cVera-Coca\u201d and \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d were confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-26\">Appellant insists that the word \u201cCola\u201d is descriptive as used in the marks of the respective parties, and -points to the fact that it has disclaimed the exclusive use of the word \u201cCola\u201d apart from the mark as shown in the drawing.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-27\">Upon this point we would observe that if the word \u201cCola\u201d in appellee\u2019s regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>tered mark is descriptive, so is the word \u201cCoca,\u201d and the effect of appellant\u2019s contention is to challenge the validity of appellee\u2019s registrations upon which it relies. That this may not be done in an opposition proceeding is well established. Ruth Candy Co. v. Curtiss Candy Co., 49 F.2d 1033, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1471; Revere Sugar Refinery v. Salvato, 48 F.2d 400, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1121, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In addition to the case of Steinreich v. Coca Cola Co., supra, we have at this term held that the marks \u201cKing Kola\u201d and \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d were confusingly similar. King Kola Mfg. Co. v. Coca-Cola Co., 99 F.2d 983, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents,-.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The record shows that appellant deliberately adopted its mark with full knowledge of the existence of appellee\u2019s mark \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d, and the vice president of appellant testified that he probably had \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d in mind when he suggested the mark \u201cDextra-Cola.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">In the case of Steinreich v. Coca Cola Co., supra, we stated [67 F.2d 500] : \u201cHad appellant wished clearly to indicate the origin of his goods, there were many thousands of words which he might have selected as a trade-mark for his product, or he could have coined a word or words, none of which could be open to the claim of similarity to appellee\u2019s mark. He did not see fit to do so, and, in view of the facts above recited, the conclusion is irresistible that he hoped and expected, by using the mark \u2018Vera-Coca,\u2019 that he would profit by the similarity of his mark to the mark \u2018Coca-Cola.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The remarks last quoted are equally applicable to the case at bar, and the circumstances under which appellant adopted its mark may properly be considered in determining the question of confusing similarity. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. v. J. L. Prescott Co., 49 F.2d 959, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1433; Time, Inc. v. Ultem Publications, Inc., 2 Cir., 96 F.2d 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">We have no doubt that the marks in question were properly held by the Patent Office tribunals to be confusingly similar, and the decision of the commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b441-28\">BLAND, Associate Judge, took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
