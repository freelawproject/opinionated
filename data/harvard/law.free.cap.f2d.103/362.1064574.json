Use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>it was alleged \"continuously since on or about October 10, 1916.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">It is conceded that the\u2019 goods of the respective parties are of the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The notice of opposition was filed in the Patent Office October 20, 1936, and on December 7, 1936, appellant moved to dismiss the same on various grounds. This motion was denied by the Examiner of Interferences who held in a decision rendered December 21, 1936, that appellant (under the facts- alleged in the notice) should file an answer or waive the right to do so if it wished to stand upon the \u201cmerely negative defenses raised by the motion to dismiss.\u201d It was further held that if such waiver were made, opposer would be given an opportunity to take testimony \u201cto establish any facts in the nature of mere statements of evidence, the inclusion of which in a notice of opposition is inhibited by federal Equity Rule 25, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723, provided only that the opposer shall make request therefor in writing not later than ten days after the filing\u201d of the waiver, and that applicant would be given an opportunity to take testimony in rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">On December 28, 1936, applicant filed a waiver electing \u201cto stand on the defenses raised in and by its motion to dismiss\u201d which, as applicant conceded, had the effect of admitting \u201call well pleaded averments in the notice of opposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Notwithstanding this waiver, opposer, in January 1937, proceeded to take testimony. Applicant was not represented at the taking of opposer\u2019s testimony nor did it offer any testimony in rebuttal. In the testimony so taken by opposer the word \u201cAmelotte\u201d appearing in its registered mark was totally disregarded and reference was made throughout only to the words \u201cPepsinic Seltzer.\u201d One witness did testify that the formula for the \u201cPepsinic Seltzer\u201d preparation was originated by a Mr. Amelotte, and it was said during the argument before us that this accounts for the word \u201cAmelotte\u201d in the registered mark. It is perfectly clear that, so far as the testimony is concerned, opposer limited itself to \u201cPepsinic Seltzer,\u201d, which is not proven ever to have been registered, except in connection with \u201cAmelotte.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">In its notice of opposition appellee stated: \u201c2. Attached hereto is a specimen of one of opposer\u2019s labels showing by way of illustration how opposer\u2019s said trade mark is, and continuously since long prior to applicant\u2019s adoption of the mark sought to be registered by the applicant herein opposed has been, used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">No particular label is identified as having been filed with the notice, but appellee during its taking of testimony introduced quite a number of specimens as exhibits. Most of them have the full mark, \u201cPepsinic Seltzer \u2018Amelotte\u2019,\u201d imprinted thereon, but one of them has only the words \u201cPepsinic Seltzer.\u201d This specimen bears the notation \u201cTrade Mark Reg.,\u201d appearing immediately underneath a heart shaped design upon which are printed the words \u201cThe Seltzer That Won\u2019t Affect The Heart.\u201d This specimen is clearly identifiable as one of those introduced during the taking of the testimony. It is referred to in the testimony as a- \u201cgold label,\u201d it having a gilded background, and it is stated that it was \u201cadopted in 1936.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">The notice of opposition did not plead any such mark, nor did it therein aver the use of \u201cPepsinic Seltzer\u201d alone, although it did compare \u201cPepsinic Seltzer\u201d with \u201cPep-so-Seltzer,\u201d alleging that both have the same suggestive significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">In his decision sustaining the opposition, the Examiner of Interferences said, inter alia: \u201cOpposer here relies upon its use of the marks \u2018Pepsinic Seltzer\u2019 or that notation in association with the word \u2018Amelotte.\u2019 These are disclosed by the specimens filed by the opposer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">In its appeal to the commissioner appellant alleged that the Examiner of Interferences erred in holding that opposer was entitled, under the recitals of its notice of opposition, to show use of any trade-mark in its business other than the registered mark, and that it was error to hold that opposer \u201chad any right to claim as its trade-mark Pepsinic Seltzer\u201d separate and apart from the word \u201cAmelotte\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-16\">The commissioner said: \u201cThe proceeding went to final hearing before the examiner of interferences on the notice -of opposition \u00e1nd applicant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Opposer nevertheless took testimony, to much of which applicant, for various reasons, has objected. As I find it unnecessary to consider opposer\u2019s evidence, such objections need not be passed upon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-17\">It is quite clear from the commissioner\u2019s decision that in reaching his conclusion he compared the full mark of opposer with that of applicant. He said, inter al\u00eda: \u201cIn my opinion the inclusion in opposer\u2019s mark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>of the name \u2018Amelotte\u2019 is not of controlling importanc\u00e9. Even in the absence of testimony to that effect it seems reasonable to assume that opposer\u2019s product is known and called for merely as \u2018Pepsinic Seltzer,\u2019 and the close similarity between that notation and applicant\u2019s mark \u2018Pepso Seltzer\u2019 is manifest. The occurrence in opposer\u2019s mark of the word \u2018Amelotte\u2019 is not to be disregarded, but in view of the substantial identity of the goods of the parties I do not consider it sufficient to render the two marks in their entireties so dissimilar as to insure against the 'probability of confusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">In a request for reconsideration, which the commissioner denied, appellant suggested another consideration growing out of the use of the notation \u201cTrade Mark Reg.\u201d on the \u201cgold label\u201d specimen which did not carry the word \u201cAmelotte,\u201d and this issue is raised in the reasons of appeal before us. It is to the effect that opposer \u201cis obviously holding out to the world that it is the owner of something other than what it has registered\u201d; that its use in the manner described was a \u201cdishonest use,\u201d and that by it \u201copposer has forfeited any rights which it might have had under the trademark statute.\u201d By this last we assume that it is meant as a contention that opposer forfeited any right to oppose appellant\u2019s registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The foregoing respecting the testimony has been set forth in order that all of appellant\u2019s contentions before us may be understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The failure of the commissioner to pass upon the issue raised as to appellee\u2019s alleged \u201cdishonest use\u201d of the particular label described was doubtless due to the fact that he did not find it necessary to consider the evidence which appellee offered and the facts appeared only in that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">There was in fact no assignment which covered the contention of \u201cdishonest use\u201d in the appeal taken to the commissioner, and, so far as the record shows, it was first raised in the request for reconsideration. We do not think the commissioner erred in failing to pass upon it, nor is it necessary that we pass upon it here under our view of.the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">We agree that upon the record presented, the marks proper to be compared are \"\u201cPepsinic Seltzer \u2018Amelotte\u2019 \u201d a'nd \u201cPepsoSeltzer\u201d and the sole question is whether there would be likelihood of confusion if the two marks were used on goods of the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">It is proper to say that inasmuch as appellee\u2019s registration is under the Act of March 19, 1920, it may not, as a registration, be relied upon as a basis for opposition, but appellee does have the right to oppose, based upon its use of the mark. Trustees for Arch Preserver Shoe Patents v. James McCreery &amp; Co., 49 F.2d 1068, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1507. Use was averred in its notice of opposition and stands admitted by appellant\u2019s waiver of answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">It is our opinion that the commissioner reached the correct conclusion. We hold this after comparing the respective marks as entireties. Certainly appellant\u2019s entire mark \u201cPepso-Seltzer\u201d is confusingly similar to the first part of appellee\u2019s mark. We do not agree with appellant\u2019s contention that \u201cAmelotte\u201d is the dominant part of appellee\u2019s mark. When the character of the merchandise is considered, the contrary, in our opinion, would be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">The cases cited by counsel for appellant have been carefully examined. In no one of them, however, do we find a state of facts which renders it persuasive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">The decision of the commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
