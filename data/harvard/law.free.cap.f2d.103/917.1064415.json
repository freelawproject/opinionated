C., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b972-9\">Before GARRETT, Presiding Judge, and BLAND, HATFIELD, LENROOT, and JACKSON, Associate Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b972-10\">HATFIELD, Associate Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">This is an appeal in a trade-mark opposition proceeding from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents dismissing appellant\u2019s notice of opposition, and holding appellee\u2019s mark registerable under the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 81 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">Appellee\u2019s mark is for use on deodorants, and comprises' an outline drawing of an Egyptian figure, across which appears the word \u201cNOBIO.\u201d The figure and the word \u201cNOBIO\u201d are enclosed within two concentric circles, between which appear the words \u201cnatural oils ban intimate odors.\u201d The latter words are disclaimed apart from the mark as shown. The word \u201cNOBIO\u201d is clearly the dominant feature of appellee\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">It appears from the record that appellee\u2019s product, which is in liquid form, is a household and personal deodorant. It is put up in two, four, and sixteen ounce bottles, and is sold at retail in drug stores. It is also apparently sold direct to consumers in one-gallon containers. It has no cleansing properties. Appellee claimed in its application that it had used its mark on its goods since April 2, 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-15\">The witness Allan C. Eldredge, testifying for appellee, stated that he was the \u201chead of the business there [in New York City] which is known as the Allan Eldredge Studios, contract furnishing and decorating of apartments and hotels throughout the metropolitan district, prin-. cipally, and we also have a business, the Nobio Products, Inc., of which I am the president,\u201d and that he was an artist and did \u201cmural paintings in connection with the decorative work.\u201d Relative to the origin of appellee\u2019s mark, the witness stated: \u201cBeing an artist, I made a number of sketches and finally selected for final use among these sketches one which is a circular symbol, around the outer border of' which there is a series of letters, 'N-O-B-I-O.\u2019 These letters in their given order are the initials of the descriptive sentence which is a part of our composite mark. The said sentence reads, \u2018Natural oils ban intimate odors\u2019 * * *. The descriptive sentence is indicative of the nature of our product and its use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-16\">It appears from the record that appellant\u2019s product is a toilet soap; that it is sold under the' trade-mark \u201cLifebuoy\u201d; that it is made up in cake form; that it is used both for its cleansing and deodorizing' properties; that it has been on'the market and sold extensively throughout the United States since the year 1895 in drug stores and other retail stores; that, comrhencirig in 1926, appellant advertised its \u201cLifebuoy\u201d soap as being effective in preventing the odor of perspiration; that, in 1928, appellant began advertising its soap as a preventive of \u201cB. O.,\u201d which letters, it was-explained in appellant\u2019s advertisements,, meant \u201cbody odor\u201d; that for several years prior to the filing of appellee\u2019s application, appellant used the letters \u201cB. O.\u201d in its advertisements without the words \u201cbody odor,\u201d because the public had come to understand from appellant\u2019s prior advertisements that \u201cB. O.\u201d meant \u201cbody odor\u201d; that during the period from 1928 to the time of the taking of the testimony in this case \u2014 October, 1936 \u2014 appellant had expended more than $10,000,000 in advertising its \u201cLifebuoy\u201d soap as a deodorant and a preventive of \u201cB. O.\u201d; and that, in addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>tion to advertising its products via newspapers, magazines, radio, and sign boards, appellant displayed advertisements in street cars, subway and elevated trains, and on large posters in baseball parks. Appellant also used other forms of advertising in which it emphasized the deodorizing qualities of its \u201cLifebuoy\u201d soap as a preventive of \u201cB. O.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">It appears from appellant\u2019s Exhibit No. 6, which is a collection of approximately 36 clippings from nationally known publications, that cartoonists, newspaper editorial writers, columnists, and feature writers have referred to \u201cB. O.\u201d as signifying \u201cbody odor.\u201d In many of the clippings either appellant or its product (\u201cLifebuoy\u201d soap), or both, are mentioned. The notation \u201cNo B. O.\u201d appears in some of the clippings. We quote the following from a clipping taken from the New York Sun: \u201cSpeaking of the campaign to keep fox hunting alive, a prominent metropolitan editor confesses that he has a great idea for a poster to be used by a nationally famous soap. It will show a fox, safe and grinning in an open field, while the hounds and riders gallop by. And the title of the advertisement will be: \u2018No B. O.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">It clearly appears from the record that, although appellant never used the letters \u201cB. O.\u201d or the words \u201cbody odor\u201d as a trade-mark or otherwise on its goods, it has so extensively advertised its \u201cLifebuoy\u201d soap as a preventive of \u201cB. O.\u201d that it has become popularized and identified in the mind of the purchasing public by the term \u201cB. O.\u201d; and that such term clearly indicates appellant\u2019s product to the purchasing public. Accordingly, we are of opinion that the term \u201cB. O.\u201d serves to indicate origin in appellant, and that its use is analogous to that of a trade-mark. John Wood Manufacturing Co. v. Servel, Inc., 77 F.2d 946, 22 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1370, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">In the case of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Old Colony Shoe Co., 82 F.2d 709, 23 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1039, relied upon here by counsel for appellee, it was held that as it was not alleged in the petition for cancellation either that the term \u201cGold Bond\u201d had been used by the petitioner on its 'goods prior to the registrant\u2019s date of first use or that the petitioner\u2019s goods had been popularized and identified in the mind of the purchasing public .by that term, the petitioner failed to fillege either a trademark use or a use analogous thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">In the instant case, however, it appears that, long prior to appellee\u2019s first use of its mark, appellant\u2019s \u201cLifebuoy\u201d soap had become popularized and identified in the mind of the purchasing public by the term \u201cB. O.\u201d and that such term indicated the origin of appellant\u2019s product.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">It may be, although we do not so hold, that appellant is not entitled to the exclusive use of the term \u201cB. O.\u201d However, the right to oppose the registration of a trade-mark does not depend upon the exclusive ownership by an opposer of a similar mark. Virginia Dare Extract Co. Inc. v. Adah Mae Dare, 70 F.2d 118, 21 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1086. It is sufficient if an opposer establishes \u201cpriority of use analogous to a trade-mark use\u201d of a trade-name, and the \u201clikelihood of damage to him by the registration of such mark to another.\u201d John Wood Manufacturing Co. v. Servel, Inc., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">It appears from the record that appellant used the term \u201cB. O.\u201d in connection with the advertising of its \u201cLifebuoy\u201d soap long prior to the first use by appellee of its mark. Accordingly, the only remaining question to be determined is whether appellant is likely to be damaged by the registration of appellee\u2019s mark, the dominant feature of which is the term \u201cNOBIO.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">According to the testimony of the witness Eldredge, who originated appellee\u2019s mark,- he was well aware of appellant\u2019s advertising use of the term \u201cB. O.\u201d at the time appellee\u2019s mark was adopted. The witness, who at times in his testimony had apparently pronounced the term \u201cNOBIO\u201d \u201cNO-B-O\u201d and at other times \u201cNO-BYE-0,\u201d stated: \u201cWe don\u2019t limit the pronunciation. We don\u2019t know how people are going to pronounce it.\u201d He further testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-13\">\u201cXQ. 163. How do you pronounce the r-a-d-i-o? A. All right, not like Mr. Smith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-14\">\u201cXQ. 164. In other words, you would pronounce r-a-d-i-o as though it were spelled ray-dee-o, is that correct? A. Yes, with that word there is an accepted pronunciation. With N-o-b-i-o, so far as I know, there is not, as yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-15\">\u201cXQ. 165. So that some persons might naturally pronounce it the way that I have first designated [NO-B-O] and the others in the way that I designated secondly [NO-BYE-O], is that correct? A. I grant you that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>It is evident, we think, that, although the terms \u201cNOBIO\u201d and \u201cB. O.\u201d do not look exactly alike, the term \u201cNOBIO\u201d will be pronounced as though it were spelled \u201cNO-B-O\u201d; that appellee intended that its term \u201cNOBIO\u201d should be understood as meaning no \u201cB. O.\u201d (no body odor), and that it will be so understood by the purchasing public. Accordingly, for all practical purposes, appellee has merely combined the negative \u201cNO\u201d with appellant\u2019s term \u201cB. O.\u201d for .the purpose of indicating to the purchasing public that its product will prevent \u201cB. O.\u201d (body odor).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">We are of opinion that the goods of the parties possess the same descriptive properties; that the terms \u201cNOBIO,\u201d the dominant feature of appellee\u2019s mark, and \u201cB. O.\u201d are confusingly similar; that appellant is entitled to use the-term \u201cB. O\u201d in connection with the marketing of its goods; and that appellant would be damaged by the registration of appellee\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">For the reasons stated, the decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
