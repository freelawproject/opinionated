Sasseen said he would have to see Whitaker, as he was the financial partner, that the matter should have been settled long ago, and he had no doubt that Whitaker would make it satisfactory with Mrs. Clark. This was on the night of witness\u2019 arrival in Atlanta. Next morning Sasseen introduced him to Whitaker. In conversation, Whitaker .said he could not pay that bill. Witness asked him if hedid not say to Mrs. Clark that if she would make affidavit to the articles stolen and the value of them, he would pay her. Whitaker said he did, b,ut that he could not pay that bill because it was too high, that he would have paid it had it been a reasonable bill.

The defendants\u2019 attorneys objected to their being read, because she was plaintiff\u2019s wife, (which was admitted) and because (as they said) she had stated that she could prove the articles lost and the value, by Miss Bell Stuart. The' plaintiff\u2019s attorneys stated that they only offered her testimony as to the articles not proven by Miss Bell Stuart and <em>their </em>value. For this purpose the Court allowed that part of her testimony read.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-4\">It was as follows: The trunks contained underclothing, stockings, pocket-handkerchiefs worth $125.00; Valenciennes, edgings, collars and embroidery, worth $100.00 To the proof of these items in this form, defendants\u2019 attorneys objected, because the items were not specifically set forth.

Defendants\u2019 attorneys read the interrogatories of Isaac W. Scott, who testified that he was clerk at said hotel from April, 1865,\" to June, 1866 \u2014 that he recollected Mrs. Clark coming to the hotel, in company with E. Crutchfield, in July, 1865. The baggage wras brought in by wagons not in the employment of the house. The pieces were not counted by witness, when they came in or when they went out \u2014 they were taken out next morning by one of the posters ef the hotel, and Mrs. Clark left with them. The baggage was near Mrs. Clark\u2019s room, nearly fronting the office door, and there was no chance for any of it to be removed without his knowledge, as he was with it all night, and none of it was taken while in the hotel. Witness was in the room when the baggage came and when it went out. ' Mrs. Clark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>did not complain of the loss of any baggage before she left the hotel \u2014 she left with the baggage \u2014 the porter who took the baggage to the train was not gone over fifteen minutes before he returned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-5\">Upon cross-examination, he stated in answer to the question, \u201c Did you see the porter or baggage after it went out of the door of the hotel ?\u201d \u201c I did not after it left the hotel.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-6\">Defendant closed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-7\">Plaintiff, in rebuttal, proved that the hotel was kept in the second story (stores being below,) that the stand occupied by the Clerk was at one side of the door, and when he stood there, he could not see outside of the door on the side next to him, that the way outside of the door led on to a verandah, and then down a narrow stairway, on the side occupied by the Clerk, and that, from the desk, it was impossible to see whether the baggage went down stairs, or to see it after it got down stairs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-8\">After argument, defendant's attorneys requested the Court to charge the jury, <em>\u201c </em>If the baggage was lost by the porters\"or other persons after it left the hotel, the hotel-keepers would not be liable for said loss as inn-keepers; it was not the duty of hotel-heepers as such to carry the baggage to the depot, or to deliver it elsewhere beyond the hotel premises, and if it was carried beyond the hotel premises by a servant of the hotel, the hotel-keeper would not be liable, as such, for any loss occasioned while so carried; that if the plaintiff or his wife was present, and consented to the delivery of the trunks to a porter or other person, to be carried beyond the hotel premises, this excused the hotel-keepers from further liability; that hotel-keepers are not liable for baggage beyond what is usually carried by travellers for their convenience as travellers, and to entitle plaintiff to recover he must set out in his bill of particulars each item separately, and prove it as set out. (The bill of particulars was proved as aforesaid.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-9\">The Court charged the jury in substance as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-10\">This is an action brought by the plaintiff against the defendants as inn-keepers for the loss of two trunks and contents.

Does the evidence establish the further fact, that the trunks and contents were lost while the same were in the possession or under the control of the defendants as inn-keepers, their servants and agents? If the evidence establishes these facts in your judgment, then the defendants are liable under the law for the proven value of the property lost while in the possession of defendants as inn-keepers, their servants and agents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-5\">If, however, you should believe, from the evidence, that the defendants exercised extraordinary diligence in preserving and taking care of the trunks, and that the same were lost, without any fault or negligence on their part, or on the part of their servants or agents, then you may find a verdict for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">In cases of the loss of property placed in the custody of an inn-keeper, the presumption of law is the want of proper diligence on his part, and the burden of proof is on him to show that he exercised that degree of care and diligence which the law required of him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-7\">The verdict was for $690.30.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-8\">A new trial was moved for by defendants\u2019 attorneys, on the ground that the Court erred, in allowing plaintiff\u2019s wife\u2019s evidence read to the jury; in not charging the jury as requested ; in allowing evidence \u201c of loss of goods, wares, and mercandise, including a pistol and jewelry, to which evidence defendants objected,\u201d and because the verdict is contrary to the weight of the evidence and the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-9\">The Court refused a new trial, and this refusal defendants\u2019 attorneys assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-10\">Hammond &amp; Mynatt, for plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKT\">contended that Mrs. Clark should have been rejected, citing 1st Gr.

By the common law as well as by our statutes, innkeepers are bound to extraordinary diligence in preserving the property of their guests, entrusted to their care, and are liable for the same, if stolen, where the guests have complied with all reasonable rules of the inns. Rev. Code, sec. 2091; Story on Bail, secs. 470, 471; Edwards on Bail 4028.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">2. In case of the-loss of the goods entrusted to the care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>of the inn-keeper by his guest the presumption is a want of proper diligence in the landlord. Rev. Code, sec. 2094; \u25a0Story on Bail, sec. 472. He may, however, relieve himself from liability, by showing that the loss was occasioned by the negligence or fault of the guest himself. Ib.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">3. In an action to charge an inn-keeper for the loss of a trunk and its contents, the wife of the plaintiff is admissible to prove the contents of the trunk, independent of the act of 1866, when no other evidence is attainable, upon a policy <em>in favorem justioice, </em>springing out of the necessity of the case, and the nature of the subject. Dibble vs. Brown, 12 Ga. Rep., 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">4. There seems to be a disposition to limit the liability of an inn-keeper as such for such of the goods of his guests only as is usually denominated baggage; that is, to such articles of necessity or personal convenience as are usually carried by passengers for their personal use. What articles may be denominated baggage must in each case be determined by the jury from the facts and circumstances which belong to it. Whether the inn-keeper is not liable as such for all the personal property that his guest may deposit with him, either baggage or other personal property, may well admit of doubt. In Calyes case, 8 Coke\u2019s Rep., 33, it is among other things said, <em>\u201c </em>Therefore, if one brings a bag or chest, etc., of evidences into the inn, or obligations, deeds, or other specialties, and by default of the inn-keeper they are taken away, the inn-keeper shall answer for them, and the writ shall be <em>bona et oatalla </em>generally, and the declaration shall be special. These words, <em>bona et oatalla </em>restrain the latter words to extend only to movables. And these words aforesaid, <em>absque substractione seu omissione, </em>extend to all' movable goods.\u201d This is the leading case upon the subject decided in 1584, and it would seem to enlarge the liability of the inn-keeper so as to embrace all the goods of his guest entrusted to his care. See also note to Calyes case, 1 Sm. L. C. p., 51; see notes to the original case as reported in 8 Coke\u2019s R., 320, and American notes to Coggs vs. Barnard, 1 Sm. L. C., 104; Edwards on Bail, p., 403. Our statute in speaking of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>liability of inn-keepers does not use the word baggage, but \u201cthe property of his guests, entrusted to his care,\u201d Rev. Code, sec. 2091. The evidence in this case showed such facts as made the inn-keeper liable under either view of the case. The idea of confining the liability for baggage only has probably originated from the somewhat analagous case of common carriers, where there is a liability as common carriers for baggage without other compensation than the fare for passengers. 12 Ga. R., 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u2022* ' 5. The beginning and the termination of the liability of an inn-keeper for goods of his guests must depend upon circumstances. The common usage of the country must have great weight in all such cases. Sto. on Bail, sec. 478. Where the goods are delivered at the usual place for such goods at the inn, the inn-keeper is chargeable with them, although not strictly within the inn. Sto. on Bail. sec. 480. It matters not where the goods are deposited, provided they are placed in the custody of the inn-keeper. Edwards on Bail, p. 405. The responsibility of the inn-keeper begins from the moment he receives the guest with his goods, and it ends when the relation between him and the guest is dissolved. The privileges and responsibilities of the inn-holder are reciprocal and dependent upon each other, as a duty upon a right. For this liability he has a lien on the goods entrusted to him. Where he has no lien, he is not liable as an innkeeper ; and he has a lien only where the property has been delivered to him by a traveler or guest. Ed. on Bail, p. 407. The liability of the inn-keeper for the goods of his guests, entrusted to his care or to the care of his servants, begins from the time the goods are entrusted, and at the place where the inn-keeper usually takes charge of the baggage of his guests. At our railroad depots the inn-keepers very often have their servants, usually called porters, for the purpose of taking charge of the goods of travelers in order to induce them to become guests of the hotel. A traveler delivers his trunk or other personal property to one of these servants to be taken to the hotel, he thereby impliedly contracts to become a guest of the hotel to which the servant is attached; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>and if he comply with such implied contract, the liability of the hotel-keeper for the care of the goods, begins from the time of the delivery to his servant, and that liability continues until the goods be again delivered to the actual custody and control of the guest. And if the servant of the inn-keeper take charge of the baggage, goods, etc., at the hotel to deliver at the cars, for the guest, such liability continues until such delivery. See Richards vs. The London, etc., R. R. Co. 7 M. <em>&amp; </em>G. 839 (62, E. C. L. R. 837.) When the proof once shows the inn-keeper in possession of and liable for the baggage of his guest, it devolves on him to show such facts as will discharge him from liability. If the custom be to deliver at the cars, or if he undertakes to do so, the proof should show a compliance with such undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
