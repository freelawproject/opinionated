Wilkes, as guardian of the minors and orphans of Jefferson R. Westburry, sued Hughes, upon an open ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>count for $301.00 for hire of a negro (Ben) from 28th December, 1864, to 25th December, 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-5\">The plea was, that it was intended that said hire should be paid in Confederate currency, and that the slave was manumitted on the 20th April, 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-6\">Plaintiff testified, in his own behalf, that defendant hired Ben on the 28th December, 1864, until the 25th December, 1865, at public outcry, at $301.00, to be paid in Confederate money \u2014 that the hire of the negro was worth eleven dollars per month in present currency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-7\">Upon the cross-examination, he was asked, when Ben ceased, by reason of his manumission, to serve defendant as a slave. This was objected to, upon the ground that manumission occurring during the term of hiring, the loss was the hirer\u2019s. The Court overruled the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-8\">The witness then testified that the negroes ceased to be used as slaves about the first of June, 1865. Here the plaintiff closed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-9\">Defendants examined two witnesses, who agreed that the negroes ceased to be used as slaves about the first of June, 1865. One put the monthly hire at $8.00, and the other at $7.00 or $8.00 per month, in United States currency. They were asked the value of the hire in coin. To this, plaintiff objected, and the Court sustained the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-10\">After the argument, the Court charged the jury they should find for the plaintiff so much, with interest, as it was proven the negro\u2019s services/were worth, while he served as a slave, and further, that this estimate should be made in the legal tender paper currency of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-11\">The jury found for the plaintiff for $40.00 and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-12\">The plaintiff in error assigns as error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-13\">1st.

A spirit of equity, consonant with the impulses of conscience, was wisely infused into our present system ; indeed it was impossible to pretermit ample and just provision for apportionment in such a case as this, without marring the obvious purpose of the codifiers, that of rendering the principles and practice of the two sides of the Superior Courts as near as practicable, alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">This was a contract for the hire of a negro for the year, 1865. It is an historic fact known to the world that, with the capitulation of the armies of the Southern Confederacy, and the military occupation of Georgia in April, 1865, slavery practically ceased. The owner could not any longer exercise dominion or control over his slave. The military authorities not only would not countenance any control, they absolutely prohibited any attempt to hold slaves involuntarily to service.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">By a force not to be resisted, and to which the rights of the people of Georgia had to succumb as they were a conquered people and at the mercy of the conqueror, Hughes, the defendent, the hirer of the negro Ben, had, like other whites, to yield. By the effect of the war and this military compulsion, he lost from April, 1865, the services of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>negro Ben for the remainder of the year, and without any fault on his part. These facts bring his defence clearly within the provisions and equity of the Code, and we affirm the judgment below, apportioning the hire in this case of bailment. ,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
