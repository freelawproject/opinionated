In such a case the defendant must be sued in the county where he resides.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b358-12\">\u25a0 Equity. Jurisdiction. Demurrer. Decided by Judge \"Wobbill. Schley Superior Court. October Term, 1867.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-13\">The averments of this bill, which are necessary to an understanding of the decision, are but few.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-14\">Mrs. Bivins averred that James H. Bivins, of the County of Taylor, had by fraud, (stating the facts upon which the charge of fraud was based,) obtained title in himself to certain valuable lands, which were situated in Schley county, ivhen in fact he should have taken the title to her. Her prayer was that he should be made to convey said lands to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>her. The bill was demurred to upon the ground that, it appearing by the bill that the defendant resided in Taylor county, and nothing being averred to give jurisdiction to Schley county, except the bare fact that the land was in Schley county, the Superior Court of Schley county had no jurisdiction over the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-4\">The demurrer was sustained, and this is complained of here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-5\">Blaneord <em>&amp; </em>Miller, B.

It appeared on the face of the bill that the defendant resided in the county of Taylor. It is contended that the Superior Court of Schley county had jurisdiction under that clause of the -Constitution, which declares that \u201c all cases <em>respecting </em>titles to land shall be tried in the county where the land lies,\u201d that this case <em>was \u201c respecting </em>title to land.\u201d The object of this bill, as we understand it, was for the purpose of obtaining a title to land, rather than to try, or litigate that title; neither the possession, or the right of possession to the land in Schley county, was involved. The question presented by the record in this case, comes fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>within the decision of this Court, in Smith vs. Bryan, 34th Ga. Rep., 59, and must be controlled by it. Let the judgment of the Court below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
