WILSON.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-6\">Plaintiff then examined F. Damish, of Branchville, South Carolina. He testified that he was conductor of the train upon the South Carolina Eailroad, on the 9th of May, 1864, which carried plaintiff\u2019s said cotton from Augusta, Georgia : it was on a flat ear, and so far as he knew no special messenger was in charge of the car. The car was No. 1, he took it at Hamburg, South Carolina, and left it at Branchville, South Carolina, on a side track. The tracks were about ten feet apart, and where he left said cotton it was in danger of being burnt by sparks from passing engines. A car of cotton, was burnt upon that side line about that time, but he did not know the fate of this cotton. So far as he knew, the car had no protection against fire; no person, other than the train hands, went with the car to protect it, and there were no buckets except those belonging to train. At times the Eailroad received cotton on flat cars. There was a watchman in the service of the South Carolina Eailroad at Branchville.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-7\">E. W. Cole, for plaintiff, testified that he -was Superintendent of the Georgia Eailroad, and had been for three or four months, that he had been Superintendent of the Nashville and Chattanooga Eailroad, and had been Superintendent of railroads for seven years. The rules of railroads, require very great care in loading cars with cotton, it is usually put in box-cars. Buckets of water should be carried (when cotton is shipped on platform cars) to extinguish fires. When left at a station, it should be under guard. Left on side line, it is in danger of fire from passing engines.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-8\">It was shown that on the 9th of May, 1864, such cotton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>was worth in Wilmington 12 J cents in specie. Such was then sold there at that price.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-5\">Here the plaintiff closed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-6\">The defendant relied on said receipt as a special contract, and also upon an alleged special oral contract with the Company, which Purcell agreed to take all risk of transportation on himself, and furnish means for protecting the cotton from fire, and failed to furnish them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-7\">In support of this last ground, the Company offered the following testimony:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-8\">Sylvester testified that he was then and on the 9th of May, 1864, an employee of defendant. The Company had no box-cars, had two open platform cars. About the 9th of May, 1864, plaintiff had a load of cotton brought from the direction of the Georgia Railroad, on one of the defendant\u2019s flat cars to the South Carolina Railroad. Sylvester was sent to Marly, Superintendent of the South Carolina Railroad, to see if he would take it. He refused to receive the cotton unless defendant would send it on one of their cars, cover it with a tarpaulin, and send a man along with it, with buckets of water, to extinguish fire. \u2022 Sylvester told Shuter, Superintendent of defendant, in the presence of plaintiff and James Mullins, what Marley had said. Plaintiff and Mullen agreed that Mullen should go with the car, and the terms required by Marly should be complied with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-9\">Mullen did not go with the train which took the cotton, nor did he go until the morning after it left. Purcell being a railroad man, defendant took it as an act of accommodation, to him, and was to receive only half the usual freights. Purcell gave his due bill for the <em>freight; </em>it has not been paid. Witness thought war existed at the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-10\">Witness was present when Wilson gave the receipt, he took the memorandum from witness\u2019 tally-book which contained the entries made by him from plaintiff\u2019s bills. He was told by an employee of defendant, the cotton was burnt; he saw the remains of the car when it was brought back, it was burnt. The car was worth $25,000.00 in Confederate money. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>The endorsement at shipper\u2019s risk, was only required of goods extra hazardous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-4\">The answers of Samuel Tinsley to interrogatories were read. He was employed in May, 1864, by the South Carolina Railroad Company, as agent at Branchville, South Carolina. During that month a car load of cotton was destroyed there,' but his books being lost, he could not give the exact date. It arrived there from Augusta, Georgia, at 8 o\u2019clock, A. M., and was switched off on the Columbia track, i. e. the side line on the Columbia side. It was an open car, a platform car, adapted to the carrying of coal, and was marked, Ho. 1., Southern Express Company. It was full of bales of cotton. He did not then count them, but the usual load is from thirty-five or forty bales. Its destination was Wilmington, Horth Carolina, and it was switched off to await the arrival of the train from Charleston to Columbia connecting at Kingsville with the Wilmington and Manchester Road. That train was due at Branchville at 2 o\u2019clock, P. M. The car Ho. 1 was destroyed by fire at Branchville, about 1 o\u2019clock, P. M., before the arrival of said train from Charleston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-5\">He knew not the origin of the fire. So far as he knew, neither the owner nor any agent for him was in charge of the car, or taking any care of it. The conductor of the train which brought it, turned it over to witness to be sent to Kingsville and there delivered to the Wilmington and Manchester Railroad. Witness saw no other person connected with the car or cotton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-6\">Witness, at the time of trial, was employed by South Carolina Railroad Company, and resided at Ho. 37, Wolfe steeet, Charleston, South Carolina. In May, 1864, he was the general agent of said Company at Branchville, and had charge of all its interests there, and was subject to call by day or by night. E. M. Gilbert, the assistant superintendent, had a desk at Branchville, and did business there as occasion required; he resided at Orangeburg and his duties took him over the whole road, he left orders with witness, who was the only officer transacting business at Branchville. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The employees of the Company at that place were two watchmen and two carpenters. It was the duty of the watchmen to guard the cars day and night, and of the carpenters to repair cars, etc. Henry Kinsay and-Carter were the watchmen \u2014 Kinsay was on duty at the time. The regular passenger trains, up and down, met at Branchville about 12 o\u2019clock, M., in the day, and the down freight trains from Augusta and from Columbia, met at Branchville about 8 o\u2019clock, A. M., and the up freight trains passed Branch-ville about 2 o\u2019clock, P. M., in the day, one going to Augusta and the other to Columbia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-6\">He did not recollect the name of the engine nor of the engineer of the train which brought the cotton there. The conductor\u2019s name was Frederick. The side track, where the cotton was burnt, was about fifteen or twenty feet from the main track. Witness knew not the origin of the fire, Kin-say discovered it about 1 o\u2019clock, P. M., and reported it to him at the office. He did not know the owner of the cotton, the conductor said it was for Wilmington, North Carolina. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-7\">In rebuttal the plaintiff was examined. The cotton burnt was that which he bought from Doughty. The contract for shipment was made with Shuter, acting President of the Company, in their back office. No one else was present. Sylvester, Hall and Mullen were at the time in the front office. The cotton was taken for him as a railroad man, the South Carolina Railroad Company having no cars to spare. He went over the river with <em>it; </em>it went down the road by the early train next morning. The contract was not a matter of accommodation, except that the cotton was taken for him as a railroad man with whom the Company exchanges favors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-8\">He did not agree to take the risk; he loaded the cotton in person ; this is not usual, though once Mr. Mays, at Camak, the father of the agent there, who lived near the depot, did it. The cotton was partly covered with a tarpaulin belonging to the Georgia Railroad Company. No water was furnished, nor did he agree to furnish any, nor did he agree to send Mullen with the cotton; he went next day to sell it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-9\">Shuter sent Sylvester to see Marly about shipping the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>cotton. Witness had not applied to Marly. Witness never demanded payment for the loss till Shuter demanded payment of the note for freight. Witness offered to square off, but Shuter refused ; this was eight or ten months after the loss. He had been up the Georgia Railroad some months, was back some time before Shuter dunned him on the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-4\">Edward O\u2019Donnell testified that he was an old railroad conductor, that in carrying cotton in open cars it is necessary to place it at least seven ears from the engine, and that open cars so loaded could not be safely left on sidelings, exposed to passing trains, without a guard and water to put out sparks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-5\">In surrebutter, defendant examined J. W. Meredith, who testified that he was an employee of the South Carolina Railroad Company, 9th May, 1864, this cotton came to the depot on a car loaded, and he sent it over to Hamburg that evening and did not see plaintiff go with it. It was started for Wilmington in the morning. Freight cars from Augusta to Wilmington always went with the train for Charleston, and were switched off at Branchville to wait for the up train from Charleston for Columbia, which took them to Kingsville. The passenger trains passed while those cars waited there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-6\">Said John E. Marly testified that Purcell applied to him about the 9th of May, 1864, to take a car load of cotton to Wilmington, he had no cars and declined taking it, \u2014 Sylvester afterwards called for the Express Company. Marly then agreed to take it if defendant would furnish a car, have the cotton covered with a tarpaulin, and send a man with buckets of water to prevent fire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-7\">The Court charged the jury that the receipt shown was not such a special contract as under the laws of Georgia exempted defendant from liability, and that they were liable as common-carriers, unless a special contract or agreement was shown; and that if the contract was made as testified by Sylvester, it was still incumbent on defendant to prove that there was no negligence by defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-8\">The verdict was for plaintiff, for one thousand dollars in specie without interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>New trial. was moved for by defendant on the grounds that the verdict was contrary to the evidence, etc., that the Court erred in charging as aforesaid as to the receipt, and as aforesaid as to the oral contract set up by Sylvester\u2019s evidence. The Court held the motion under advisement till June Term, 1867, and then refused a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-5\">The questions made here are those in the said motion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-6\">William T.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">This is an action brought against the defendant as a common-carrier for the loss of thirty-three bales of cotton. The errors complained of are, that the Court below refused to grant a new trial upon the several grounds specified in the record. The first assignment of error that we will now consider and decide is, that the Court below erred in charging \u25a0 the jury, <em>\u201c </em>that the receipt offered in evidence was not a special contract binding on the plaintiff.\u201d The decision of this question involves the <em>liability </em>of a common-carrier in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>State, as well as the <em>extent </em>to which he may limit his <em>legal liability </em>under the laws thereof. What is the legal liability of a common-carrier in case of the loss of goods entrusted to him as such, under the laws of this State? By the 2039th section of the Revised Code, it is declared, that \u201cAny person undertaking to transport goods to another place for a compensation, is a carrier, and as such is bound to ordinary diligence.\u201d The 2040th section of the Revised Code declares, that \u201c one who pursues the business constantly, or continuously, for any period of time, or any distance of transportation, is a <em>common-carrier, </em>and as such is bound to use <em>extraordinary diligence. </em>In cases of loss, the presumption of law is against him, and <em>no excuse </em>avails him, unless it was occasioned by the act of God, or the public enemies of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Agr\">1. The legal liability of a common-carrier by the laws of this State, therefore, in case of the loss of the goods entrusted to him, is clearly and explicitly defined, and <em>no excuse </em>will avail him, unless such loss was occasioned by <em>the act of God, or the public enemies of the State. </em>Thus is the law written, and positively declared, by the supreme power of the State. We have thus shown what is the <em>legal liability </em>of a common-carrier in this State, in case of the loss of the goods. The next question that presents itself is, how far, to what extent, and in what manner can such common-carrier <em>limit that liability, </em>imposed upon him by the law? It is contended in this case, that the defendant <em>has </em>limited his legal liability in his receipt given for the <em>cotton </em>to the plaintiff. To give such a construction and effect to the receipt, as is contended for, would be to allow the defendant to limit and regulate his legal liability as a common-carrier, in <em>express contravention of the law, </em>which imposes it upon him. The defendant\u2019s liability as a common-carrier is regulated by law upon the grounds of publie policy, and he cannot be permitted, by <em>his own act, </em>to limit the effect and operation of that law, and thereby defeat that public policy. It was the duty of the defendant, as a common-carrier, to <em>obey the law </em>in regard to his liability as such, and not to attempt to <em>make it, </em>for his own protection. But the 2042d section of the Revised Code expressly de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>dares, that <em>\u201c </em>A common-carrier <em>can not limit his legal liability </em>by any notice given, either by publication, or by entry on receipts given, or tickets sold. He may make an <em>express contract, </em>and will then be governed thereby.\u201d The legal liability of a common-carrier, as defined by <em>the law, </em>is one thing; his legal liability as a common-carrier, under an express <em>contract </em>made with the shipper, is another and quite a different thing. In the latter case, his liability will depend upon the terms of that express contract, and will be governed by it. But such express contract limiting <em>his legal liability </em>as a common-carrier, cannot be proved by a notice given, either by publication, or by an entry on the receipt given for the goods, or tickets sold. The express contract made with the shipper of the goods, <em>limiting the legal liability </em>of the common-carrier, must be made independently of the receipt given for the goods, and be proved independently thereof as any other contract is proved, when entered into by two or more parties to it. The common-carrier receipts the shipper for the goods, and <em>the law </em>fixes his liability therefor in. case of loss; but the common-carrier and the shipper may enter into an express contract, <em>outside of the receipt given for the goods, </em>in regard to the carrier\u2019s liability, and then, both parties having a <em>fair opportunity </em>to understand the terms of the contract, will be governed by it. Such, in our judgment, is a fair and legitimate interpretation of the Code, in relation to the liability of common carriers in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">2. The next ground of error assigned upon the record is, that the Court erred in charging the jury <em>\u201c </em>that if the contract was made as testified by the witness Sylvester, it was still incumbent on the defendant to prove, that there was no negligence on their part.\u201d The effect of this charge in our judgment, was to exclude from the consideration of the jury the question in dispute, whether the cotton was destroyed by the <em>negligence </em>of the defendant, or by <em>the failure of the </em>plaintiff to perform his part of the express contract, if they should believe such a contract was made. In view of the facts of this case, as disclosed by the record, we think that the Court below erred, in not charging the jury, in addition to the charge as given, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>if they should believe from the evidence, that there was an express contract made between the plaintiff and defendant outside of, and independent of the receipt given for the cotton, as testified to by the witness Sylvester, and that the cotton was destroyed by fire, in consequence of the failure of said plaintiff to perform said contract on his part, then the defendant was not liable for the loss of the cotton. It is true that the defendant, as a common-carrier, is liable under the law, for negligence. Whether the cotton was destroyed by the negligence of the defendant in this case, or by the failure of the plaintiff to perform his contract with the defendant in relation to its transportation (if any such contract was made) is the question for the jury to determine under the evidence, and the charge of the Court upon that point. Upon this last ground, we reverse the judgment of the Court below and grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
