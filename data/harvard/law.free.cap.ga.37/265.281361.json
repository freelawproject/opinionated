Bicknell, his daughter, one set of silver spoons, and to her son, a gold watch, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-5\">The remainder of his estate, real and personal, was to be divided between his wife, said Mrs. Bicknell, and the three' sons of testator, to-wit: Alexander M., Jesse G., and William C., first charging them with certain advances, rated as therein specified. His executor was authorized to sell at public or private sale, in his discretion, without order of Court, etc. His negroes to be disposed of according to the laws existing at the time of distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-6\">Item 9th, charged Jesse Gfs legacy with payment of any security debt for him for which testator was liable.

G. Wallace, my executor, to execute this will, and I hereby direct that no bonds or security be required of him for the faithful discharge of his duties as such, and that he be allowed five hundred dollars for his services as such; but if, from the vissitudes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>war or from any other cause, my said executor shall find it impracticable to become executor, and attend to the duties thereof in a reasonable time, I appoint and direct my son, \"W. C. Wallace, to execute this, my will, under the same regulations as to bond and compensation as above; and should the said W. C. Wallace, from similar or any other cause, find it impracticable to execute this said will, in a reasonable time, in that event I nominate and appoint my wife, Mary S. T.

Walker was duly qualified as executor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-5\">Letters of executorship were issued to said Walker, and he took possession of the estate. \u25a0 The assets of the estate so far as the executor knows were certain notes on various persons for various amounts, set out in an exhibit, eight Knox eounty bonds, Knoxville &amp; Chattanooga Railroad Company for $500.00 each, making $4000.00, four ditto for $100.00 each, and eight bonds Knoxville &amp; Kentucky for $500.00 each, making a gross sum of $10,627.57.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-6\">The liabilities of the estate, as exhibited, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-7\">J.

All the creditors reside in Tennessee, or elsewhere out of Georgia, and the condition of said sons and son-in-law is such that the executor must pay said liabilities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-5\">The widow, as she had a right to do under the laws of Tennessee, dissented from said will, and was thereby entitled to dower and a distributive share, to-wit: one seventh of the personalty not required to pay debts. She had also $600.00 assigned to her for her year\u2019s support. Her dissent made, by said laws, the will void as to her, but left it of force ' as to all other persons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-6\">By the laws of Tennessee real estate cannot be applied to the payment of debts till the personalty is exhausted, and the personalty of said estate is insufficient to discharge its liabilities, without using said Knox County bonds or their proceeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AM\">The heirs at law are said widow, said Jesse G., \"William C., and Alexander M., said Mary B. Bioknell, and the heirs of Martha J. Toole, deceased, and of Margaret A. Robinson, deceased, all of whom reside in Tennessee, except said Alexder M. Wallace. Before he died, testator left with John W. Duncan, in Atlanta, Georgia, for safe keeping, said Knox County bonds, Duncan then having a vault, and being a banker, and in the habit of receiving such things for aceom-' modation, with no view to compensation or profit. So he received these bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-8\">At the same time testator left with said Duncan, for safe keeping, some Confederate bonds and some other bonds belonging to the Female Institute at Marysville, Tennessee. These, like the others, Duncan was to keep, as a gratuity, for testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-9\">Duncan so held these bonds till after testator\u2019s death. Then said Alexander M. Wallace, residing in said Atlanta, though well knowing of said last will and testament, and that the testator died testate, in September, 1865, petitioned the Ordinary of Fulton County, Georgia, for temporary letters of administration on said testator\u2019s estate, stating in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>petition that said testator died intestate, and procured from the Ordinary of Fulton County permanent letters of administration on said estate, at November Term, 1865, of the Court of Ordinary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-4\">John W. Duncan became security on said Alexander M. Wallace\u2019s bond, (which is in the usual form of administrator\u2019s bonds.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-5\">Before becoming such security, Duncan had it understood with said Alexander M. Wallace, that Duncan should retain said Knox County bonds as indemnity against loss by reason of his suretiship aforesaid. In this way Duncan and Alexander M. Wallace have'since had a sort of joint ownership of, or claim on said bonds, Wallace claiming them as such administrator and Duncan holding them for indemnity. Meanwhile Duncan and Alexander M. Wallace severed from said bonds coupons for the payment of interest, to the amount or value, of $1,000.00, and converted or attempted to convert the. same to their own use; they still have said coupons or their proceeds. Besides those coupons, said bonds when they came to the hands of Duncan and said Alexander M. Wallace, had other coupons for interest attached to them. Those coupons then matured and those maturing up to the first of January, 1867, amounted to about $2,000.00, and these said Duncan and Alexander M. Wallace have converted to their own use, and no account of them has been rendered to the ordinary of Fulton County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-6\">In October, 1866, and again in February, 1867, said executor demanded said bonds and coupons from Duncan and Alexder M. Wallace, and though they knew said testator died testate, that his will had been proven, and that said executor had letters of executorship, yet they refused to deliver any of them to him, and proceeded to deliver the same to the heirs at law of said testator, as if he had died intestate, to-wit: in March, 1867, giving to each of, said heirs (including Alexder M. Wallace) $1,000.00, making in all $7000.00. This proceeding was undertaken and hurried through to prevent-said executor from getting said bonds, and applying them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>the payment of said debts, and from administering them according to said will and the laws of Tennessee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">On the 29th of March, 1867, Alexander M.

Wallace, and John W. Duncan, averring the foregoing as facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-4\">That bill charged that said return was incorrect in every particular, except in so far as it chai\u2019ges Alexander M. Wallace with the bonds: incorrect, because it does not charge him with the coupons or the interest; because he had no right so to distribute the bonds and take credit thereby; because he had no right to charge said commissions and expenses of administration, he not being the administrator rightfully; because the estate owed Duncan nothing, and because the last item in the return is obscure and unintelligible, or if intelligible should be a debit against him, rather than a credit in his favor. The bill further states that it is not known whether any of the bonds have been sold, and avers that if they have been, they should be accounted for at par; because said administration, taken out as aforesaid, is irregular and illegal, and nothing done under it binds the estate (except it be for the advantage of the estate, and be approved by the executor;) because they were sold without an order of Court, and not at public outcry, after advertisement according to law. Complainant avers that said bonds are worth $12,000.00, or other large sum; one thousand dollars, of which under the will, belong and should by the executor be paid to Mary A. Robinson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">Discovery was waived. The prayer was that the said administration be sot aside; that said defendants be decreed to deliver to said executor said bonds and said coupons, that they may be taken to Tennessee to be administered according to the laws of that State, and according to said will; and that said defendants account and pay to said executor the full value of said bonds and coupons; for said purpose; and if necessary, said Wallace\u2019s letters of administrator be set aside as fraudulent. It concluded with a prayer for general relief and for subpoena.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-6\">To this bill said defendants demurred on the grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-7\">1st. For that said W. A. Walker, by his own showing, is not the executor of the said W. Wallace, deceased, never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>having been appointed such by the last will and testament of said deceased, nor legally appointed or qualified as such by any competent authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">2d. For that, if complainant is such executor by said will, and by appointment and qualification in the State of Tennessee, as is claimed in said bill, yet he has no legal right to institute and maintain this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-6\">3. For that there is no such authenticated exemplification of the will and the probate in Tennessee and appointment and qualification of complainant, as is required by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-7\">4. For that the bill on its face shows that the defendant has completed his administration, at least, that he has accounted and paid over all assets, under the direction of proper authority, and this, they are advised, is a conclusive settlement thereof, as to complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-8\">5. For that said bill does not harmonize with the public policy which, <em>sub modo </em>and by comity only, allows foreign executors to sue in our courts, but is offensive in its charges against our courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-9\">6. For that said bill seeks, at the instance of a foreign executor, to take assets out of our jurisdiction, with both creditor and legatees or distributees our own citizens here, where the funds are secured; indeed, after distribution and at the instance of a party under no bonds, subjecting them to additional costs, and whether there is a will or not, identically the same individuals are entitled to the funds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-10\">7. For that no foreign creditor has any right in our courts through the comity extended to foreign executors, etc., etc. These creditors rights are direct and absolute. Such bill being predicated solely on such basis, has no equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-11\">8. For that our courts will not notice, nor in any way inquire of, debts or assets in Tennessee, or the management of estates of decedents there, or their creditors there, and thus predicate rights and suits, or either, here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-12\">9.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">It appears from the record in this case, that William Wallace died in the State of Tennessee, after having executed a will, disposing of his property. The will was executed on the 26th day of March, 1864, and duly admitted to probate and record in the Probate Court of Tennessee, in July, 1864; and. W. A. Walker, one of the executors appointed therein, was duly qualified as such executor to execute the same. At the November Term, 1865, of the Court of Ordinary, of Fulton county, in this State, Alexander M. Wallace, <em>knowing </em>that the testator had left a will in the State of Tennessee, (the place of his domicil at the time of his death,) representing to the Court, that the testator had died <em>intestate, </em>obtained letters of administration on the estate of said William Wallace, and proceeded to collect and dispose of the personal assets of the decedent, as such administrator, in this State. The executor of William Wallace filed his bill in the Superior Court of Fulton county, (exhibiting therewith a certified copy of the will and his appointment by the Probate Court of Tennessee, as required by the Code,) against Alexander M. Wallace, as administrator aforesaid, and John W. Duncan, his. security, praying that said letters of administration may be set aside <em>as' fraudulent, </em>upon the several grounds alleged and set forth in the bill, and the defendants may account for the personal assets of the testator received by them, and be decreed to pay over to him the value thereof, as the executor of the testator, in order that the same may be disposed by him in accordance with the provisions and directions of the last will and and testament of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">To this bill the defendants demurred upon the several grounds set forth in the record. The Court below overruled the demurrer, to which decision the defendants excepted, and assigned the same as error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>As it regards the objection taken to the legality <em>\u00a1of </em>the appointment of the executor by the Probate Court of Tennessee, as well as to the regularity of the proceedings of that Court in relation thereto, the legal presumption is in favor of the legality and regularity of the proceedings of that Court. Revised Code, sections 3700, 3710. Taking the several allegations in the complainant\u2019s bill to be true, as the demurrer necessarily admits them to be, for the purpose of this decision, the main and controlling question in the case is, whether the grant of administration by the Court of Ordinary of Fulton county, under which the defendants claim protection, was not obtained by <em>fraud, </em>and therefore ought to be set aside ? What are the facts ? The defendant, Wallace, it is charged, applied to the ordinary for letters of administration on the estate of the deceased testator, representing to that Court that he died <em>intestate, </em>when he <em>knew </em>at the time that he died <em>leaving a will. </em>The letters of administration were granted to him by the Court of Ordinary upon this <em>false </em>and <em>fraudulent </em>representation of the facts of the case. The record shows that William Wallace did <em>not </em>die intestate, but on the contrary he died <em>leaving a will, </em>and that Wallace, the defendant, <em>knew </em>it at the time he applied for and obtained his letters of administration on the decedent\u2019s estate. Has a Court of Equity in this State jurisdiction to set aside the letters of administration so procured by fraud, and to require the defendants to account with and pay over to the lawful executor the personal assets of the testator received by them or either of them, to be applied by the executor under the will, in accordance with the law of the testator\u2019s domicil at the time of his death ? By the 2414th section of the Revised Code, it is declared that <em>\u201c </em>executors qualified according to the laws of their domicil upon wills properly admitted to probate in another State, upon filing with the Court a certified copy of such proceedings, shall be entitled to use all the processes and <em>remedies </em>prescribed by the laws of this State, in the same manner as if qualified under the laws of this State.\u201d This section of the Code gives the foreign executor the right to file his bill in the Courts of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>State against the defendants, and it is no breach of <em>comity </em>for him to do so. The 3537th section of the Eevised Code declares that \u201cThe judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction may be set aside by a decree in chancery for <em>fraud, </em>accident or mistake, or <em>the acts of the adverse party, </em>unmixed with the negligence or fault of the complainant.\u201d This judgment of the Court of Ordinary granting the letters of administration to the defendant, Wallace, the complainant seeks to set aside upon the ground that, by his own act, he fraudulently represented to the Court that the deceased testator died <em>intestate, </em>when he <em>Icn.ew </em>the fact to be otherwise, and by that means <em>fraudulently </em>procured the judgment of the Court-in his favor. In such cases this Court has maintained the jurisdiction of a Court of Chancery to set aside the judgment. Mobly vs. Mobly, 9th Ga. Rep., 247; Loyless and wife, vs. Rhodes, ib., 547. This view of the main question involved in this case necessarily disposes of all the other questions made by the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">It has been insisted by the counsel for the defendant in error, that the grant of administration to Wallace was <em>void,</em>because there had been a <em>prior </em>grant of letters testamentary .upon the decedent\u2019s estate, in the State of Tennessee. When letters testamentary or of administration have once been granted upon a decedent\u2019s estate in the proper Court in this State, and subsequent letters are taken out here upon the same estate, there can be no doubt that the latter would be void; but when letters testamentary or of administration have been granted by a Court in a <em>foreign jurisdiction, </em>a different question is presented, upon which we express no opinion. In our judgment, upon the state of facts presented by the record in this case, the demurrer was properly overruled by the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">.Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
