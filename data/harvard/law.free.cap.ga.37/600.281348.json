October Term, 1867.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-10\">Case number one above stated, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-11\">Myers &amp; Marcus, rented to Kauffman, a store-house for one year, from the 1st of October, 1866, in consideration of his promise to pay them $1400 \u201c in American gold coin,\u201d to be paid in sums of $350 00 \u201c in American gold coin,\u201d in quarterly payments. Kauffman paid all the rent for the two first quarters, and on the third paid $350 00 in United States currency or greenbacks, worth at the time of payment, only $254 00 in American gold coin, leaving a balance of $96 00 in American gold coin on that quarter; on the fourth quarter, he had paid nothing. They sued out their distress warrant for this rent, claiming $446 00 \u201c in American gold coin.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHX\">Kauffman replied by counter affidavit, that he owed them only $350 00. He claimed that the $350 00 greenbacks paid, discharged the third quarter\u2019s rent, and was not a part payment as claimed by them. He admitted that the $350 00 paid, was worth only $254 00 \u201cin American gold coin,\u201d at the' time of its payment, and that $96 00 in American gold coin was, at the trial, worth $132.48 in United States currency, and that $350 00 in American gold coin was then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>worth $504 00 in such currency. It does not appear whether at the time this $350 00 was paid, anything was said as to whether it was' in full, or only a partial payment for the third, quarter. \"When the last quarter was due, Kauffman tendered them $350 00 in United States legal tender notes in full payment' for the last quarter, but they refused so to receive it, and he did not pay it. The date of the contract, does not appear, but it was treated as made in 1866. Upon this state of facts, it was agreed that the Court should decide whether or not said contract could be discharged by payment of the sum promised in gold coin, with United States legal tender notes at par, and that if he held in the affirmative, the plaintiffs should have a verdict for $350 00 without costs, and if he should decide in the negative, then for $636.-48 with interest on $132 48 from July 1st, 1867, and interest on $504 00 from October 1st, 1867, with costs, (the same in either event to be paid in United States currency.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-4\">The Judge decided in the affirmative, and the verdict was for only $350 00.

It was secured by mortgage which has been foreclosed, the judgment for foreclosure being for \u201c one thousand in gold, or its equivalent in United States currency.\u201d The <em>fi. fa. </em>issued for \u201c one thousand dollars in gold or its equivalent in United States currency.\u201d It was levied on the mortgaged property, \u00e1rid it was advertised for sale. Defendant tendered, to plaintiffls attorney and the sheriff, the full amount of principal, interest and costs, called for by the <em>fi. fa. </em>in United States legal ten-der treasury notes. They were willing to take it and credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>the <em>fi. fa. </em>with the then market value of said treasury notes in gold, but they refused to receive it as the defendant wished it received, and also refused to enter the same as a credit on said <em>fi. fa. </em>specifying in said entry, the kind of currency paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-5\">The defendant filed an oath of illegality, founded on said grounds.

Chambers, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b614-13\">Harris, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b614-14\">In the first of the above stated cases, the facts were, that plaintiffs rented a store in Augusta, to Kauffman, who agreed to pay for it quarterly $350 00 <em>\u201cin American gold coin.\u201d </em>Kauffman sought to discharge his contract by an offer of $350 00 in legal tender notes, which was refused. It was admitted that the currency or legal tender notes, were of less value at the time of the offer to pay an equivalent amount in them, than the gold'stipulated for. The Judge below, erred in deciding as he did. A <em>specific </em>contract, like this, to pay in <em>American </em>gold, cannot be discharged by the payment in <em>legal tender notes, </em>of a nominally equal amount with the gold agreed to be paid, unless it should happen that the legal tender notes were in the market <em>at par value </em>with the American gold.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Upon the plaintiffs, however, receiving from Kauffman, the actual market difference in value, between the American gold which he promised to pay, and the legal tender notes which he offered to pa}7 \u2014 that difference in the value of the two things being virtually a portion of the damages plaintiffs were entitled to, by reason of Kauffman\u2019s failure to comply with his contract, Myers <em>&amp; </em>Marcus, will <em>then, </em>be bound under the act of Congress, to receive the legal tender notes in discharge of the debt of Kauffman, thus fixed by the ascertainment of plaintiff\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">In the case of Thompson vs. Riggs, 5th Wallace R., 578, the Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, delivering the opinion of the Court, said: <em>\u201c A </em>party agreeing to pay in <em>bullion or coin, must do so, </em>or answer in damages for <em>its value ; </em>and so, if one agrees to pay in, depreciated paper, the tender of that paper is a good tender, and in default of payment the promisee can recover its market, and not its nominal value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">This extract from a case involving the interpretation of the \u2022 legal tender act of 1862, has furnished the rule for the decision of the case in the record. The judgment below is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The case of Taylor <em>vs. </em>Green, at the head of this opinion, from the Ocmulgee Circuit, having been brought to this term, but coming up subsequently for decision to the case of Myers &amp; Marcus vs. Kauffman, from its facts, must' be controlled by it \u2014 in that case, Taylor agreed to pay in <em>gold.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The ruling of the Judge below, being in accordance with our decision in Marcus &amp; Myers vs. Kauffman, we affirm his judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
