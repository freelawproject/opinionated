It was propounded for proof, in solemn form, by said Bristow and' Kent, and <em>caveated </em>by said Eeynolds upon the grounds: 1st, That it was made when she was <em>in extremis </em>and laboring under a mental aberration as to her heirs at law. 2d, That by opiates, etc., her testamentary capacity was taken away. 3d, 4th and 6th, That the will was procured by fraudulent practices, etc.; and, 5th, \u201c Because the seventh item in said paper propounded as to the last will and testament of said Nancy Eeynolds, deceased, as aforesaid, is illegal, and therefore void, because the said paper purporting to be the will of the said deceased was not executed ninety days previous to the death of said Nancy Eeynolds, in conformity to the requirements and provisions of the Code of the State of Georgia in such cases made and provided.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-6\">The ordinary admitted the will to record, and his judgment was appealed from. The witnesses to the \u2019will were Benj. B. Eeid, J. I.

Many witnesses (pro and <em>con.) </em>were examined as to the condition, physical and mental, of testatrix at the time she made the will, and to show that before that time she had said she intended to dispose of her property differently, etc., but their testimony is not material, as the case turned purely on a question of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-5\">The paper was then read in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-6\">The Court charged the jury, among other things, that no part of said will was obnoxious to or violated the provisions of section 2388 of the Code of Georgia, it being admitted that the testatrix was a widow, and left no child or descendant of child. Therefore, although she died within less than ninety days of the execution of her will, those clauses which contained devises to charitable uses were not void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-7\">The jury found that said paper was said testator\u2019s will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-8\">The case was argued in the Supreme Court alone upon the ground that said charge of the Court is erroneous.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b298-9\">Floyd &amp; Reid, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b298-10\">L.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">The only question made before this Court for its consideration and judgment, is the validity of the seventh clause of the will of the testatrix, under the existing laws of this State. That portion of the 7th clause of the will to which objection is made, relates to the bequest and devise of certain portions of her property .and effects to \u201c The Baptist Convention of the State of Georgia, to be by said Convention used and expended in promoting and forwarding such benev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>olent objects and purposes as, in their judgment,will do the most good.\u201d By the 2432 section of the Revised Code, it is declared that \u201c A devise or bequest, to a charitable use, will be sustained and carried out in this State.\u201d By the 3100th section of the Revised Code, is is declared that \u201c Provisions for religious instruction or worship among other enumerated objects, are proper matters of charity for the jurisdiction of equity.\u201d Thus it will be perceived that a bequest or devise of the character of that mentioned in the will of the testatrix for <em>charitable uses, </em>is not forbidden by the laws of this State, but on the contrary, is expressly authorized. It being <em>lawful, </em>therefore, for the testatrix, under the general law of the State, to make this bequest and devise of her property for charitable uses, let us now examine what <em>restrictions </em>have been placed by the legislature upon testators\u2019 general power to dispose of their property by will, to <em>charitable uses. </em>The restriction is to be found in the 2344th section of the Revised Code, which declares that \u201c No person leaving a wife, or child, or descendants of child, shall by will, devise more than one-third of his estate to any charitable, religious, educational or civil institution, to the <em>exclusion of such wife or child\u2019, </em>and in <em>all cases, </em>the will containing such devise, shall be executed at least ninety days before the death of the testator, or such devise shall be void.\u201d It is intended that, inasmuch as this will was not executed <em>ninety days </em>before the death of the testatrix\u2014 that the devise to charitable uses contained in it, is void \u2014 that <em>the </em>words \u201cin all cases,\u201d applies to every bequest and devise, made by any testator for <em>charitable uses </em>under the laws of this State \u2014 that the Court below erred in not so deciding in this case; and that is now <em>the </em>question to be decided here.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">We have already shown that it is not unlawful, nor against the declared policy of the State for testators to devise their property to charitable uses; but that, in a particular and special enumerated class of cases, expressly named, a <em>restriction </em>is imposed upon their right and power to dispose of their property to charitable uses. What is the special enumerated class of cases to which this <em>restriction </em>is applicable ? To that class of cases only in which the testator leaves <em>a wife or child, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>or descendants of a child. </em>In this particular class of cases, the testator <em>is restricted. </em>He cannot* when he leaves a wife or child, or the descendants of a child, devise more than one-third of his estate to charitable uses, and in <em>all cases </em>of <em>that description, </em>whether he attempts to devise as much as one-third of his estate to charitable uses, or a less portion of his estate for that purpose, the will containing such devise, must be executed at least ninety days before the death of the testator, or such devise will be void, and the wife, or child, or descendants of such child, as the case may be, will inherit his estate. The obvious intention of the legislature was to prevent testators who had wives, or children, or descendants of children, having a just claim upon their bounty, from defeating those just claims; and therefore, in <em>all oases </em>of that character, whenever the attempt is made by a testator to devise <em>any portion of his estate to charitable uses, to </em>the exclusion of his wife, or child, or descendants of a child, from its enjoyment, then the will should be executed at least ninety days before his death. The object was to protect the testator\u2019s wife, children, and descendants of children, from any improper influences that might exercised over him when <em>in </em>extremis, thereby inducing him to, devise any portion of his property to charitable uses, to <em>their prejudice, </em>and therefore, <em>in all cases, </em>when that was attempted to be done, the will must be executed ninety days before his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Rut suppose the testator had no wife, children, or descendants of children to be provided for, or to claim his bounty in their behalf, what reason is there why the will should be executed ninety days before his death ? There is no restriction imposed upon him by law as to the right to devise his property to charitable uses, when there is no wife, or child, or descendants thereof; but on the contrary, it is lawful for him to do so. Where there is no wife, child, or descendants of a child to be provided for, the testator may make his will, bequeathing, or devising his property to charitable uses as in other cases, without any restriction as to the time of its execution. In <em>all cases, </em>however, when the testator has a wife, child, or the decendants of a child, and desires to bequeath or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>devise one-third of his property, or less portion thereof to <em>charitable uses, </em>he must execute his will at least ninety days before his death, or such bequest or devise will be void. The law does not look with any great degree of favor upon a bequest or devise of any part of a testator\u2019s property to charitable uses, to the <em>exclusion </em>of his wife and children, or descendants from its enjoyment, and therefore guards and protects their rights against any improper influence that might be exercised over the mind of the testator during his last moments, by requiring that wills of that character, <em>in all cases </em>should be executed at least ninety days before his death. The record in this case discloses the fact that the testatrix had <em>no children, </em>or <em>descendants of children, </em>who stood in need of the restraining clause of the Code for their protection; consequently, the bequest and devise in her will, to the <em>\u201c </em>Baptist Convention of the State of Georgia\u201d is legal and valid, although the same was not ^executed ninety days before her death. Let the judgment of the Court below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
