The labor contract does not limit the company in its right to discharge an employee with less than three years\u2019 service. This is not disputed. The case was submitted to the court on cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-21\">It is settled law that absent a contractual provision, the employer has the right to hire and discharge employees at will provided the motivating cause is not a protected union activity. See, <em>e. g., </em>Kellwood Co., Ottenheimer Bros. Mfg. Div. v. NLRB, 411 F.2d 493 (8th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-22\">Chief Judge Henley, in a published memorandum opinion, thoroughly recites the facts and sets forth the applicable law. We agree with the conclusion reached and affirm the judgment on the basis of the district court opinion in Young v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 309 F.Supp. 475 (E.D.Ark.1969).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
