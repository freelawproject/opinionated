Accordingly, we have directed the Clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties of this fact in writing. <em>See </em>Huth v. Southern Pacific Co., 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 526; Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804; 5 Cir. R. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">Clyde John Brooks pleaded guilty in 1965 to the possession of a sawed-off 12-gauge shotgun which he had not registered. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5851, 5861. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment to commence at the end of a state sentence. But in Haynes v. United States, 1968, 390 U.S. 85, 88 S.Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923, the Supreme Court has held that a claim of self-incrimination provides a full defense to such a prosecution. Brooks now seeks relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court denied relief, holding that <em>Haynes </em>was not to be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">This Court has recently decided that two companion cases to <em>Haynes, </em>Marchetti v. United States, 1968, 390 U.S. 39; 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889, and Grosso v. United States, 1968, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906, require retroactive application. United States v. Lucia, 5 Cir. 1969, 416 F.2d 920, aff\u2019d en banc, 5 Cir. 1970, 423 F.2d 697. At the time of its order, the district court did not have the benefit of this decision. For the reasons enunciated in <em>Lucia, </em>we conclude that Brooks did not waive his right to raise the defense of self-incrimination and that <em>Haynes </em>like <em>Marchetti </em>and <em>Grosso </em>must be applied retroactively. In this conclusion, we follow the Fourth and Ninth Circuits, United States v. Miller, 4 Cir. 1969, 406 F.2d 1100; Meadows v. United States, 9 Cir. 1969, 420 F.2d 795, and differ with the Sixth Circuit. Graham v. United States, 6 Cir. 1969, 407 F.2d 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-18\">We reverse and remand for disposition consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
