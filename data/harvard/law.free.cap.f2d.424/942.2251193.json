C.Code \u00a7 3204 (1967). We need discuss only their contention that the evidence obtained in a search incident to their arrest should have been suppressed for want of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">The Government\u2019s first response is that we need not reach the question of probable cause. It argues that, whether or not probable cause existed, appellant\u2019s conduct was suspicious enough to justify a \u201cstop and frisk.\u201d Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A frisk would have disclosed Thaxton\u2019s concealed pistol; the officers would then have had probable cause to arrest and search both men and their automobile. Therefore, the argument goes, an arrest and incident search (which were <em>not </em>permissible in the known circumstances) should be held valid if a frisk (which <em>was </em>justified) would eventually have produced the same incriminating evidence. But this syllogism must be rejected for the same reason that \u201ca search is not to be made legal by what it turns up.\u201d United States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 581, 595, 68 S.Ct. 222, 229, 92 L.Ed. 210 (1948). A lack of probable cause cannot be made up in hindsight by a hypothetical variation in the basis on which a search was conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-16\">We turn then to the question of probable cause, which is an extremely close one in this case. A careful review of the record has led us to conclude that, on balance, the decision to arrest appellants had adequate support. The specific facts articulated by the arresting officers, including Cunningham\u2019s furtive disposal of the instrumentalities of the burglary and Thaxton\u2019s attempt to get his gun out of his pocket as the officers approached, \u201cwarrant [ed] a prudent man in believing that the offense [had] been committed\u201d by the appellants. Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 102, 80 S.Ct. 168, 171, 4 L.Ed.2d 134 (1959).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court must be</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">. The Government presents its <em>Terry </em>rationale only as a theoretical justification for the officers\u2019 conduct; it makes no attempt to fit the facts of the arrest into a \u201cstop and frisk\u201d mold. It would, indeed, be impossible for the Government to do so on the facts of this case. A police officer and a security officer for an apartment complex were investigating a reported <em>burglary </em>when they spotted appellants carrying a coffee table out of another building in the complex. Appellants\u2019 distinctive clothing matched the description of two men who had earlier been seen \u201cgoing in and out of the buildings.\u201d The officers got into the police car and raced over to the automobile into which the appellants were placing the table; with guns drawn, they immediately placed appellants under arrest and proceeded to search the automobile.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1007-19\">. <em>Accord, e. g., </em>Beck v.
