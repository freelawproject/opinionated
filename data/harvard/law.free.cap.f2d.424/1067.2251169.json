We construe this as a concession that the facts were not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>dispute so that the district court could properly consider entry of summary judgment under Rule 56, F.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">We conclude that the appellant has failed to demonstrate, below or here, that any breach of their contractual responsibilities was committed by the closing agents. Hence the summary judgment in their favor was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
