On the first occasion the immigration officers testified that while in uniform and traveling in a marked car, they saw what appeared to be a Mexican run into appellant\u2019s house. The officers went onto the property and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>as they approached the house, appellant emerged with a shotgun pointed at the officers. After an exchange of unpleas-antries between the officers and appellant\u2019s brother, who was outside the house when the officers approached, the officers left the premises. Appellant and his brother followed with their guns until the officers drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">On the second occasion two immigation officers, again traveling in a marked car, were fired upon by appellant as they drove past his house. Both shots missed the vehicle and later that day appellant was taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">At the trial appellant denied the assaults. He testified that on the first occasion he did not use a shotgun to evict the officers from his premises. As to the second assault, appellant claimed that he fired the gun into the air for the purpose of merely attracting the officers\u2019 attention. In addition, appellant presented evidence of his lack of sanity on the two occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">The district court instructed the jury as to all the elements necessary to an assault charge. In addition, an insanity instruction was given. No instruction relating to defense of property, self-defense, or defense of a third person was requested or given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">Counsel on appeal (not the same as trial counsel) asserts that the latter defenses were apparent from the facts and failure to give instructions upon them were plain error. We disagree. It is not at all clear that such an instruction, even if requested, should have been given under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-9\">In any event, the defenses were inconsistent with appellant\u2019s assertion that he did not have a shotgun on the first occasion and was not trying to defend anything on the second. As such, the decision to forego the defenses may have been the well reasoned decision of trial counsel that their injection into the trial may only have confused the jury. See Chavira Gonzales v. United States, 314 F.2d 750, 752 (9th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
