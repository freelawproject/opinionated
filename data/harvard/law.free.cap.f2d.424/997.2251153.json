In checking the registration of the car, the officer found that the name on the auto registration did not match the name given by the defendant Powell who was the driver. Powell was unable to produce any driver\u2019s license. During the course of the investigation, the defendant Wilson dropped an envelope containing money, later found to be counterfeit. Defendants and the two girls accompanying them were then taken in the patrol car to Sidney. On the same day, the arresting patrolman found in his patrol car, sticking between the crack of the seat and the back of the seat, a white envelope containing more counterfeit bills. A segregated roll of real money was found in the possession of the defendant Wilson. At the trial, Margaret Johnson, one of the girls riding in the car with the defendants at the time of the arrest, testified as to her passing counterfeit bills in Salt Lake City, Utah. She received change in good money and turned it over to the defendants. Her deposition was read at trial which contradicted some of her testimony. The government called a salesgirl from Salt Lake City who corroborated the testimony by Margaret Johnson as to the passing of the counterfeit notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-16\">The defendants primarily challenge the credibility of the witness Margaret Johnson. We have pointed out on many occasions that this court, as a reviewing body, cannot pass on the credibility of the witnesses. Based upon the verdict of guilty we must view the evidence in light of the most favorable inferences to sustain the government\u2019s case. See United States v. May, 419 F.2d 553 (8 Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-17\">The defendants likewise assert error on the basis of the court\u2019s alleged failure to instruct the jury that each and every essential element of the crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. A thorough examination of the record reveals that the court did so instruct. The record does not support the claim of error asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>We find that the record contains substantial evidence to support the verdict of guilty and no error exists in the judgments below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
