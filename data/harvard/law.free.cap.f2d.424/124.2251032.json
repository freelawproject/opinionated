Vincent, Jr., Regional Director of the Third Region of the National Labor Relations Board. The petition was based upon a charge filed with the Board by Bethlehem Steel Corporation and alleged that there was reasonable cause to believe that Teamsters was engaged in picketing and various related acts and conduct designed to compel Bethlehem to assign the work of fueling equipment and handling the fuel hose and nozzle at the New York State South Mall Project at Albany to employees represented by the Teamsters rather than to employees represented by Local 106, International Union of Operating Engineers (AFL-CIO) in violation of Section 8(b) (4) (i) and (ii) (D) of the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>trict court, after conducting a hearing, found that there was reasonable cause to believe that appellant was engaging in the unfair labor practices alleged and, on July 16, 1968, entered an order enjoining appellant from engaging in such acts and conduct \u201cpending the final disposition of the matters involved pending before the [Board].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Thereafter, the Board, pursuant to Section 10 (k) of the Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> conducted a hearing on the merits of the jurisdictional dispute which gave rise to the unfair labor practice charge filed by Bethlehem, and on January 8, 1969 issued a decision determining that employees represented by Local 106, Operating Engineers were entitled to perform the disputed work for Bethlehem. The Board directed appellant to give notice whether or not it would comply with the determination and refrain from engaging in the unfair labor practices proscribed by Section 8(b) (4) (i) and (ii) (D).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">Appellant did not comply to the satisfaction of the Board, and on June 3, 1969, the Regional Director petitioned the district court for an order adjudging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>appellant to be in civil contempt of court for violating and disobeying, and failing and refusing to comply with, the injunction order entered on July 16, 1968. The petition alleged, in substance, that appellant, at various times during April and May of 1969, induced and encouraged employees of McEneny Oil Corporation to refuse to supply fuel to Bethlehem, and continued to threaten, restrain and coerce Bethlehem with the object of compelling Bethlehem to assign the work of handling the fuel hose nozzle at the South Mall Project to employees represented by appellant rather than to employees represented by the Operating Engineers. The district court conducted a hearing and, on July 17, 1969, issued a decision finding that appellant had violated the intendment of the injunction order of July 16, 1968 and adjudging appellant to be in civil contempt. An order and adjudication in civil contempt was entered on July 30, 1969, directing appellant to purge itself of civil contempt by fully complying with the injunction order, and upon failure to do so, to pay a fine of $200 a day for every day it continued in noncompliance with that order. No fine was imposed for the past failure to comply with the injunction order.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Meanwhile, on June 5, 1969, the Regional Director had filed with the Board a consolidated complaint alleging that appellant had failed to comply with the Board\u2019s Section 10(k) determination of the jurisdictional dispute and that its activities in 1968 and in 1969 constituted unfair labor practices under Section 8 (b) (4) (i) and (ii) (D) of the Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These were the activities which formed the basis for the injunction order of July 15, 1968 and for the Board\u2019s petition of June 3, 1969 for an order of civil contempt. Hearings on the unfair labor practice charges were held before a trial examiner on July 29 and 30, 1969, and on December 16, 1969, while the present appeal from the order of civil contempt was pending, the Board issued its decision and order, adopting the trial examiner\u2019s conclusion that appellant\u2019s activities both in 1968 and in 1969 violated Section 8(b) (4) (i) and (ii) (D) of the Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">On appeal, Teamsters contends that it did not violate the injunction order of July 16, 1968 and that it was error to adjudge it in civil contempt. The Regional Director argues that since the Board has made a final adjudication with respect to the unfair labor practice charge which formed the basis for the Section 10(i) injunction, both the injunction and the civil contempt order have terminated and the appeal should be dismissed as moot. Bethlehem, the charging party, which prepared a brief and participated at oral argument, would prefer us to hold that the civil contempt order is not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1964) and is therefore not appealable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">We find that the order of civil contempt is appealable, but hold that the appeal is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">The general rule as to the appealability of an order of civil contempt is stated in 6 Moore, Federal Practice If 54.17 at 154-155 (1966) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"arv-dedup-0\">\u201c[A] party to a suit may not appeal an order finding or imprisoning him for the commission of a civil contempt during the pendency of the action, except in connection with some appeal-able order, as an interlocutory injunction, or a final judgment or decree in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the civil action, or in connection with an appeal from a judgment imposing both criminal and civil sanctions\u201d [footnotes omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">See Fox v. Capital Co., 299 U.S. 105, 107, 57 S.Ct. 57, 81 L.Ed. 67 (1936); McCrone v. United States, 307 U.S. 61, 59 S.Ct. 685, 83 L.Ed. 1108 (1939). Where, however, civil contempt proceedings are instituted after the conclusion of the principal action rather than during the pendency of the action, the order disposing of the contempt proceedings is appealable. Stringfellow v. Haines, 309 F.2d 910, 911 (2d Cir. 1962); Parker v. United States, 153 F.2d 66, 69 (1st Cir. 1946). The issue in each case is whether the matters adjudicated in the civil contempt proceeding are otherwise subject to review. See Lamb v. Cramer, 285 U.S. 217, 221, 52 S.Ct. 315, 76 L.Ed. 715 (1932); Penfield Co. of California v. SEC, 330 U.S. 585, 591, 67 S.Ct. 918, 91 L.Ed. 1117 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The civil contempt order in this case, based on the Section 10(1) injunction, was issued after the conclusion of the principal action rather than during its pendency. The Section 10 (Z) injunction, although termed a temporary injunction, nevertheless represents the culmination of the Section 10(Z) proceeding.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, as in Parker v. United States, <em>supra, </em>a finding of non-appeal-ability would effectively foreclose any review of the issues involved in the contempt order, since nothing remains to be determined on the merits of the Section 10(Z) injunction proceeding and no appeal has been taken from the order granting the injunction. This distinguishes the present case from Comptone Co. v. Rayex Corp., 251 F.2d 487 (2d Cir. 1958), cited by the charging party, where a contempt order based on the violation of a temporary restraining order in a copyright infringement case was held non-appealable because it was subject to modification prior to judgment. Furthermore, to forbid appellant an appeal in this case would leave him subject to continuing liabilities under the civil contempt order, although, as we decide below, the Section 10 (Z) injunction itself no longer remains in effect. This is a predicament which strongly favors appealability. See Gompers v. Bucks\u2019 Stove &amp; Range Co., 221 U.S. 418, 451-452, 31 S.Ct. 492, 55 L.Ed. 797 (1911); Parker v. United States, <em>supra, </em>153 F.2d at 69; Dickinson v. Rinke, 132 F.2d 884, 885 (2d Cir. 1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">For these reasons, we conclude that the civil contempt order entered against appellant is a \u201cfinal decision\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1964) and, as such, is appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">We nevertheless find that the appeal no longer presents a viable controversy and is therefore moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">In McLeod for and on behalf of National Labor Relations Board v. Business Machine &amp; Office Appliance Mechanics Conference Bd., etc., 300 F.2d 237, 241 (2d Cir. 1962), this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-12\">\u201cSection 10 (Z) was designed by Congress to provide a means by which temporary injunctive relief could be obtained \u2018pending the final adjudication of the Board.\u2019 Sen.Rep.No.105 (80th Cong.1947), p. 27. H.R.Conf. Rep.No.510 (80th Cong.1947), p. 57. It does not provide relief beyond that stage, for Sections 10(e), (f) specify the procedure to be followed after the Board has rendered a decision. These sections allow temporary relief pending appeal or petition for enforcement, but only in aid of the Board order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>We find this analysis to be correct. Section 10(Z), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(0 (1964) plainly says that the Board may petition \u201cfor appropriate injunctive relief pending the final adjudication of the Board with respect to such matter.\u201d While there might seem little reason for Congress not to have provided that the injunction could continue until the conclusion of enforcement proceedings, the answer, as recognized in <em>McLeod, </em>is found in Sections 10(e) and (f), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) and (f) (1964), which fill the gap by allowing the Board to petition for temporary injunctive relief based on its order pending the outcome of enforcement proceedings or a petition for review. This interpretation is also consistent with what must happen if the Board determines that no unfair labor practices have occurred; the Section 10(\u00bf) injunction must terminate immediately.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The Board\u2019s decision and order of December 16, 1969 was the final adjudication of the Board with respect to the unfair labor practice charges which formed the basis for the Section 10(i) injunction entered July 16, 1968. Therefore, upon the issuance of that decision and order, the injunction expired.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although the injunction order was not phrased in the precise statutory language, we will not attribute to the district court an intention to exceed its statutory powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-19\">Since the sole purpose of the civil contempt order was to compel compliance with the injunction order, the necessity for the sanction ended with the expiration of the injunction, and the sanction itself must necessarily be terminated. See Gompers v. Bucks\u2019 Stove &amp; Range Co., <em>supra, </em>221 U.S. at 441, 451-452, 31 S.Ct. 492; United States v. International Union, United Mine Workers, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 341, 190 F.2d 865, 873-874 (1951); Harris v. Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. Co., 196 F.2d 88, 90 (7th Cir. 1952); Parker v. United States, <em>supra, </em>153 F.2d at 71.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Cf. United States v. United Mine Workers, 330 U.S. 258, 294-295, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947). Appellant can no longer be subjected to liability under the contempt order; accordingly, we have no reason to review the correctness of that order, and the appeal herein is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-21\">Appeal dismissed as moot and case remanded to the district court with directions to vacate the order of civil contempt.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160 (\u00cd) (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">That Section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARK\">Whenever it is charged that any person has engaged in an unfair labor practice within the meaning of paragraph (4) (A), (B), or (C) of section 158(b) of this title, or section 158(e) of this title or section 158(b) (7) of this title, the preliminary investigation of such charge shall be made forthwith and given priority over all other cases except cases of like character in the office where it is filed or to which it is referred.
