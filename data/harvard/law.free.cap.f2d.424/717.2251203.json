Both parties moved for summary judgment and the district court granted the motion of the appellee, Audubon, for reasons exemplified in its unpublished opinion, attached here as an appendix. We are convinced that the case was correctly decided below for the correct reasons, and adopt the opinion of the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-23\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b782-24\">ORDER OF THE COURT GRANTING PLAINTIFF\u2019S. MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"ahj-dedup-0\">(Number and Title Omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b782-25\">Filed: July 22, 1969</p>\n<p id=\"b782-26\">This is an action for declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2201, 2202. Invoking the jurisdiction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Court under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1332(a), plaintiff, National Audubon Society, Inc., alleges diversity of citizenship and the necessary jurisdictional amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Plaintiff maintains that it and the defendant are remaindermen under a testamentary trust established by Item 8 of the will of William Audley Marshall; that following the death of the life tenant, an income beneficiary, plaintiff and defendant became entitled to one half each of the appreciated value of the corpus of the trust, and that the defendant as successor trustee has refused to make such distribution. Accordingly, plaintiff prays:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">(1) a declaration of the rights and duties of both parties under a proper construction of the will;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-8\">(2) declaration that plaintiff is entitled to one half of the appreciated value of the corpus, plus income accumulated since the death of the life tenant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-9\">(3) an accounting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-10\">(4) an order requiring distribution in accordance with the findings of the court, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-11\">(5) any additional appropriate relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">Defendant answers that he and the plaintiff are not remaindermen under the trust, but only objects of general legacies in the amount of $30,000 each, payable upon termination of the trust at the death of the life tenant. Alternatively, he maintains that even if he and Audubon take as remaindermen, the gifts are limited to $30,000 each by the terms of the trust, with the appreciated value of the corpus passing under the residuary clause of the will. Defendant states that he has accordingly offered distribution of $30,000, which plaintiff refused. He further states that he has at all times been and still is ready, willing and able to make such distribution. Both parties have submitted motions for summary judgment, with supporting briefs and documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">JURISDICTION OF THE COURT.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-13\"> A suit between parties of diverse citizenship, seeking declaration of their rights in a remainder interest devised under a testamentary trust is a civil suit or controversy within the meaning of federal jurisdiction and not a prescribed probate proceeding, where the suit does not attack the will but affirms it, seeking only construction of its terms. Byers v. Byers, 254 F.2d 205 (5th Cir. 1958). The Court of Appeals found the following facts significant: (1) the states of which the parties were citizens had enacted the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, and (2) the states also lodged jurisdiction to construe trusts or wills in their courts of general jurisdiction, so that had the parties been litigating in the courts of either state, they would have been in a court of general jurisdiction. Byers v. Byers, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-14\">Although neither New York nor Georgia have enacted the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, both do have statutes authorizing declaratory judgments. New York C.P.L.R. \u00a7 3001 et seq., (McKinney) ; Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 110-1101 et seq. The Georgia Code particularly authorizes actions for declaratory judgment to determine any questions in the administration of wills or trusts, and to direct a trustee to take particular action. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 110-1107. Brewton v. McLeod, 216 Ga. 686, 119 S.E.2d 105 (1961), however, casts some doubt on whether a complaint such as that herein filed would be held by the Georgia Courts to plead a cause of action for declaratory judgment. In <em>Brewton, </em>two devisees under a probated will sought to prevent the executor from selling two houses devised to them. The court held that their petition for declaratory judgment did not state a cause of action under Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 110-1107 read in conjunction with \u00a7 110-1101, because the devisees did not allege they were uncertain, insecure, and needed direction before taking some future action. Brewton v. McLeod, 216 Ga. 686, 691, 119 S.E.2d 105 (1961). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>However, the court went on to hold that Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 110-1102 (a) authorized granting any other relief to which the petition showed the devisees were presently entitled. The prayers of the dev-isees allowed the petition to be maintained as one for construction of a will with an accounting, and with an injunction to preserve the status quo. <em>Ibid. </em>Consequently, this Court deems Georgia\u2019s declaratory judgment statute, with the above judicial gloss, sufficient to support federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Similarly, both states confer jurisdiction to construe trusts or wills on their courts of general jurisdiction. In New York, the Supreme Court has general jurisdiction in law and equity. New York Const. Art. 6, \u00a7 7 (McKinney Supp.1968). New York courts of equity have inherent power under their jurisdiction over trusts to construe wills, to the extent to which trusts are thereby created. 96 C.J.S. Wills \u00a7 1075b, n. 30, citing In re Taylor\u2019s Will, 29 Misc. 2d 520, 217 N.Y.S.2d 754. And although the Surrogates\u2019 Courts may hear questions of construction under New York S.C.P.A. \u00a7 1420 (McKinney 1967), this statutory proceeding may be brought upon probate, during administration or upon settlement of the personal representative\u2019s account. New York S.C.P.A. \u00a7 1420, Supplementary Practice Comment (McKinney Supp.1968). Furthermore, when so construing a will, the Surrogate is exercising \u201cfull and complete general jurisdiction in law and in equity.\u2019\u2019 New York S.C.P.A. \u00a7 201(3) (McKinney 1967). Georgia has given its Superior Courts jurisdiction over construction of wills. <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 37-403, 404; Brewton v. McLeod, 216 Ga. 686, 119 S.E.2d 105 (1961). Consequently, it is concluded that the Court has jurisdiction of the case before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">CHARACTER OF THE PARTIES\u2019 INTERESTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The pleadings and briefs of the parties failed to join issue on the merits of this issue. Plaintiff argued that the parties took remainder interests. Defendant replied that they were given general legacies. It does not appear to the court that the two terms are mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">Interests in property are either possessory (present) or future interests. 31 C.J.S. Estates \u00a7\u00a7 13-15, 132. If the right to possession or enjoyment is postponed to a future date, the estate is a future interest. 31 C.J.S. Estates \u00a7 15. The parties here agree that possession and enjoyment of their interests were postponed until the death of the life tenant. Consequently, there is no question that they were holders of future interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">Generally, future interests in transferees can be either remainders or executory interests, depending on whether the future interest divests or cuts short the preceding particular estate prior to its normal expiration. A. Gulliver, Future Interests 55 (1959). Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 85-701 defines an estate in remainder as one limited to be enjoyed upon determination of another estate. Under either criterion, the parties to this action hold remainder interests in at least a portion of the corpus of the Marshall trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">EXTENT OF THE PARTIES\u2019 INTERESTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">The chief dispute between plaintiff and defendant is over the extent of their interests in the fund. Plaintiff asserts it is entitled to one half of the appreciated value of the corpus of the trust, arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-12\">(1) a Georgia Superior Court has already construed Item 8 of the will of William Audley Marshall;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-13\">(2) the decision of that court established the following interpretations :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-14\">(a) the testator\u2019s use of numerical language in describing segregation of the corpus of the trust had reference only to the value of that proportion of his estate which he wished set aside; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>(b) the testator intended that any decrease in value, in the assets of his estate between the date of his death and the time of distribution, reduce equally the corpus of the trust and the residual gift;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-5\">(3) therefore,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\">(a) the numerical language conferring the remainder interests refers only to a proportion of the (appreciated) corpus <em>i. e. </em>50%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-7\">(b) the testator must have intended that the two remaindermen share equally in any increase in the value of the corpus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">When the plaintiff\u2019s argument is thus stated, it becomes clear that the intent of the testator regarding division of estate assets between the trust corpus and the residuary gift is not relevant to his intended division of that trust corpus between remaindermen; plaintiff\u2019s conclusion, resting on a contrary premise, is a <em>non sequitur. </em>However, plaintiff\u2019s assertion that the former litigation has established the interpretation of the numerical language used in Item 8 is not answered satisfactorily by the defendant. Plaintiff\u2019s argument is not that prior litigation adjudicated the rights of these parties, but only that it construed a manner of phraseology again in controversy. In the action before the Georgia Superior Court, the executor of the will argued that the testator intended (1) that after the trust corpus had been set aside, the residuary estate would have approximately the same value; (2) that the securities in the estate should be divided in kind between the trust corpus and the residuary estate, or (3) that the executor should have discretion to make such division in kind; (4) that the $60,000 trust fund should be set aside out of estate securities valued as of the testator\u2019s date of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">It is not possible or necessary to determine what the Superior Court decided was the intent of the testator. The effect of that court\u2019s judgment was to treat the testator\u2019s use of the term \u201c$60,000\u201d as a reference to the value of a proportion of the estate, as the plaintiff has argued. The use in Item 8 of \u201chalf of said amount, or $30,000\u201d to describe the interests of the parties to this action is even more clearly a reference to a proportion, in which the number is merely descriptive of the proportion.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">Although the defendant would argue that the applicable whole to which the proportion refers is $30,000, the Court concludes that the terminology describing the remainder interests refers to a proportion of the <em>appreciated </em>corpus. First, Item 8 clearly constitutes an attempt to dispose of the entire corpus\u2014 the description of the remainder interests comprise the whole corpus. Second, both Item 8 and Item 9, the residuary clause, are otherwise silent regarding the appreciation accumulated at the death of the life tenant. Third, under Georgia law, ordinarily extraordinary accumulation \u2014 including enhancement in value \u2014 goes to the remainderman. <em>See, </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 85-605; cf. Wood v. Davis, 168 Ga. 504, 148 S.E. 330 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">Accordingly, plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is hereby granted. Plaintiff and defendant as remainder-men are entitled to share equally, one half each, in the appreciated value as of April 16, 1964, of the corpus of the trust created by the will of William Audley Marshall, and in the income thereon since said date.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">The defendant, MacLean Marshall a/k/a Percy M. Marshall, Jr., individually and in his capacity as Trustee of said trust is hereby ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-14\">(1) to answer the interrogatories propounded by the plaintiff February 11, 1969, on or before August 15, 1969; a copy of said answers shall be filed with the court on or before said date;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-15\">(2) to distribute to the plaintiff, National Audubon Society, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of New York, with its principal office and place of business in the City, County and State of New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>York, its distributive share above described in the trust created by the will of William Audley Marshall.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Counsel are directed to confer regarding such detailed orders as may be appropriate to carry out this judgment and to submit the same to the court for approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">(Signed) SIDNEY 0. SMITH, JR.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Sidney 0. Smith, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">United States District Judge</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
