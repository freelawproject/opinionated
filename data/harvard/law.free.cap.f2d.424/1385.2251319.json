We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-23\">Clairol\u2019s opposition is predicated on its ownership of the registered marks \u201cCome Alive\u201d,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cCome Alive Gray\u201d,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cCome Alive Blonde\u201d,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cCome Alive Brown\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and \u201cCome Alive Red\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for hair tinting and coloring preparations. Clairol contends that it would be damaged if \u201cLook Alive\u201d were registered for lipsticks because that mark so resembles its registered marks for hair coloring preparations that purchasers would be likely to be confused as to the origin and sponsorship of Cosmetically Yours\u2019 goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-24\">The board agreed, noting that, beginning in 1965, Clairol expanded its activities into marketing a general line of cosmetic preparations, including lip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>sticks, and presently has a substantial business in this new line. Taking judicial notice that the products of the parties are all cosmetic preparations, the board observed that the record shows that a number of leading cosmetic companies market both hair preparations and facial cosmetics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-4\">The board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1451-5\">Despite the fact that opposer is the owner of its various registrations, it is applicant\u2019s primary contention herein that there would be no likelihood of confusion because opposer\u2019s only mark is \u201cCOME ALIYE GRAY\u201d and that this mark is obviously different in various respects from \u201cLOOK ALIVE\u201d. This contention of applicant must fail, however, both for the reason that opposer is the owner of a subsisting registration for the mark \u201cCOME ALIVE\u201d and the fact that opposer\u2019s record supports continued use of this term as a mark. * * * it is our opinion that the goods of the parties are closely related and that applicant\u2019s mark \u201cLOOK ALIVE\u201d so resembles \u201cCOME ALIVE\u201d in connotation that, as applied to applicant\u2019s goods, there would be a likelihood of confusion or mistake. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1451-6\">Although appellant, in its reasons of appeal, arguably assigned error in the board\u2019s finding of likelihood of confusion between its mark \u201cLook Alive\u201d and Clairol\u2019s subsisting registered mark \u201cCome Alive\u201d, it did not pursue that point in its brief or on oral argument. Accordingly, we pretermit that issue as abandoned. L. &amp; C. Hardtmuth, Inc. v. Fabrique Suisse De Crayons Caran D\u2019Ache S.A., 287 F.2d 599, 48 CCPA 873 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-7\">Appellant has chosen, instead, to narrow the issues of appeal to the correctness of the board\u2019s reliance on opposer\u2019s \u201cCome Alive\u201d trademark registration. Appellant contends that Clairol is entitled to only a rebuttable presumption of use of \u201cCome Alive\u201d based on ownership of that registration, which was rebutted by \u201cconclusively\u201d showing non-use of that mark since December 1958. The board erred, appellant urges, in rejecting the foregoing contention and should have held that the contest was between \u201cCome Alive Gray\u201d for hair rinse and \u201cLook Alive\u201d for lipstick; and that there is no likelihood of confusion between those two marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-10\">Section 2(d) of the Trademark Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d)) prohibits registration of a mark \u201cwhich so resembles <em>a mark registered </em>in the Patent Office * * * as to be likely, when applied to the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive: * * (Emphasis supplied.) As long as the registration relied upon by an opposer in an opposition proceeding remains uncanceled, it is treated as valid and entitled to the statutory presumptions. Tri-Valley Growers etc. v. Maple Island, Inc., 360 F.2d 248, 53 CCPA 1217 (1966); Island Road Bottling Company v. Drink-Mor Beverage Co., 140 F.2d 331, 31 CCPA 816 (1944), and cases cited therein. Therefore, in the absence of a counterclaim for cancellation under section 14 of the Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1064),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it is not open to an applicant to prove abandonment of the opposer\u2019s registered mark; and appellant\u2019s argument (upon which it now stakes its appeal) that opposer no longer uses the registered mark \u201cCome Alive\u201d must be disregarded. Food Specialty Co., Inc. v. Standard Products Co., Inc., 406 F.2d 1397, 56 CCPA 1005 (1969); Gillette Co. v. \u201c42\u201d Products Ltd., 396 F.2d 1001, 55 CCPA 1347 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-13\">One matter remains. In an appendix to its brief, appellant requests that we assess a portion of the costs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1388\">*1388</page-number>printing the transcript of the record against appellee because certain material added to the record by appellee\u2019s Supplemental Praecipe was unnecessary in resolving the issues raised by the appeal. However, under the circumstances here, we think appellee followed the prudent course in requesting inclusion of those items as they had appeared reasonably necessary to a proper determination of all the issues raised by appellant\u2019s reasons for appeal. Treating the request in appellant\u2019s brief as a motion, the motion is denied, and costs are assessed against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-4\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1450-12\">.

The record shows that, in its answer to the Notice of Opposition, appellant did attempt to initiate a cancellation proceeding to cancel Clairol\u2019s mark \u201cCome Alive\u201d on the ground its use \u201chas been abandoned.\u201d On motion by Clairol, the board dismissed that counterclaim for cancellation with prejudice for reasons unnecessary to detail here. Appellant did not appeal from that dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
