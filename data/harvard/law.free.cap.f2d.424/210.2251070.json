The issue was submitted to the trial court on stipulated facts and resulted in a summary judgment favoring Fireman\u2019s premised on two legal conclusions: a) Fireman\u2019s had a complete policy defense under the required notice provisions of its policy and b) there was no causal relation between the injuries suffered by Rutelonis and the risk carried by Fireman\u2019s. The parties agree that the applicable law is that of the state of Texas. The determinative facts may be summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Rutelonis was injured while unloading steel beams from a flat-bed truck at a construction site at Tulsa. He was an employee of the prime contractor but was then assisting a subcontractor, Tu-loma Rigging, Inc., a local company engaged by the prime contractor to unload the steel. Tuloma is Transport\u2019s insured. The steel had been transported to the site on the flat-bed owned by Delta Steel Co., Fireman's insured. Thus possible insurance coverage applicable to the accident rested in Transport for the potential active negligence of Tuloma and in Fireman\u2019s as the insurer of the operation, including the unloading, of the Delta truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">Transport was notified of the accident and investigated it. On March 31, 1965, and again on August 5, 1965, its adjuster made inquiry from Delta as to the identity of Delta\u2019s insurance carrier. Delta\u2019s employees refused to give this information or the identity of its driver.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In August, 1966, Rutelonis filed suit against Tuloma seeking damages for his injuries. In July, 1967, Transport advised Delta of the suit and demanded that Delta undertake the defense. Delta made no response. On November 2, 1967, for reasons not disclosed, Transport made a similar demand upon Employer\u2019s Casualty, an insurance company. That company, again for reasons not disclosed, forwarded Transport\u2019s letter of demand to Fireman\u2019s and it was received by Fireman\u2019s on November 9, 1967. It is undisputed that this was the first notice or knowledge that Fireman\u2019s had obtained of the accident, injury or suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">After taking appropriate reservation of fights agreements, Fireman\u2019s consulted with Transport about the suit and it was settled with Rutelonis for $14,500, Fireman\u2019s expressly denying any obligation therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">Standard notice provisions in the Fireman\u2019s-Delta policy provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-16\"><em>Notice of Accident. </em>When an accident occurs written notice shall be given by or on behalf of the insured to the company or any of its authorized agents <em>as soon as practicable. </em>Such notice shall contain particulars sufficient to identify the insured and also reasonably obtainable information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>respecting the time, place and circumstances of the accident, the names and addresses of the injured and of available witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\"><em>\u201cNotice of Claim or Suit. </em>If claim is made or suit is brought against the insured, the insured shall immediately forward to the company every demand, notice, summons or other process received by him or his representatives.\u201d (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Transport concedes, as it must, that these policy provisions were obviously breached by Fireman\u2019s named insured, Delta. However, Transport presents its own insured, Tuloma, as an omnibus insured under the Fireman\u2019s policy be-' cause the accident happened while the insured vehicle was being unloaded and then urges the applicability of Texas cases <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> giving approval to the text that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">\u201cAn additional insured, operating an automobile with the permission of the owner, has been held to be a proper person to give notice to the insuror. Such additional insured cannot be expected nor required to give notice before he knew of the existence of the policy or the fact that he was covered thereby * * 8 Appleman, Insurance Law &amp; Practice \u00a7 4738, at 54.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">We can give no comfort to appellant from this test nor the cited cases for they are dependent for result on circumstances not here present. In the case at bar we are not faced with an uninformed insured, unaware of the existence of insurance or the extent of coverage; rather we have as the only interested party (Tuloma had its own insurance) an insurance company interested in a claim to contribution or indemnity from another insurance company. Transport makes no claim that it did not know of the existence of insurance for, acting for itself through its insured, it made inquiry from Delta. And Transport\u2019s expertise must include knowledge that both Oklahoma and Texas law, in addition to federal regulations applicable to interstate carriers, imposed minimum insurance requirements. Transport makes no claim to any effort to discover the identity of Delta\u2019s insurer through known sources of information or otherwise; nor, after suit was filed, did it attempt to avail itself of state or federal discovery procedures. In the same vein, no reason appears to explain why the information which stimulated the letter to Employer\u2019s Casualty was not available two or three years earlier, or if it was available, why it was not acted upon. It seems clear that Transport had both the knowledge and the resources to furnish Fireman\u2019s with notice of the accident, claim and suit and failed to do so \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d As Chief Judge Brown aptly states in National Surety Corp. v. Wells, <em>supra </em>287 F.2d at 108:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">Whether process is forwarded quickly enough depends on the reasonableness of the action of any such person considering his knowledge and understanding of the probable existence of coverage and some duty to act flowing therefrom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">The trial court correctly held that Fireman\u2019s was not given notice as soon as practicable within the terms of its policy. We need not consider other bases for the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-11\">. We accept, as fact, that such inquiries and responses were made, although denied by Delta, because of the summary disposition of the case in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-13\">.
