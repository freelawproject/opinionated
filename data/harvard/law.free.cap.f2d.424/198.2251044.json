See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir., 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I; and Huth v. Southern Pacific Company, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 526, Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-17\">In passing upon a habeas corpus petition filed by a state prisoner the United States District Courts are not required to hold a second evidentiary hearing on any point upon which a full and fair hearing was held at the State level, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); Shinall v. Breazeale, 5 Cir., 1968, 404 F.2d 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-18\">This is such a case. We affirm the judgment of the District Court which denied habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-19\">On January 23, 1964, the petitioner, Robert Ryan, was given a full and complete Florida Rule 1 post conviction hearing by the Circuit Court of Pinellas County, Florida. The transcript is before us. It reflects that, represented by counsel, Ryan pleaded guilty to murder in the second degree. He had been indicted for murder in the first degree. He, at the time, had previously been convicted of a felony and then stood charged with an armed robbery. The armed robbery charge was nolle prossed and, on December 16, 1955, Ryan was sentenced to serve twenty-five years for second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-20\">The transcript of the Florida hearing reflects that this petitioner, upon sound advice of competent counsel, knowingly and voluntarily entered the plea of guilty now under review. We, therefore, have no authority to interfere with the state court sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
