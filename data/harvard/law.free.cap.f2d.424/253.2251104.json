Successful in establishing breach of contract to do the job in a workmanlike manner, plaintiff complains on appeal of other defaults in performance and urges that the award of damages in the amount of $19,200 was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The district judge personally inspected the premises and painstakingly found facts which are supported by substantial evidence. His findings are not clearly erroneous. To those findings he applied correct principles of law. We affirm on the opinion of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
