F. Goodrich Company (Goodrich) seeks in effect to enforce section 5(2) of the Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by an action in the District Court of Delaware requesting an injunction to restrain Northwest Industries, Inc. (Industries) from acquiring Goodrich stock without first obtaining Commission approval, and an order declaring such action unlawful without Commission approval.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The basic contention in the Goodrich complaint is that control of Goodrich by Industries without Commission approval would violate section 5(2) because it would result in control of a carrier (Goodrich acquired control of a motor carrier) by a company (Industries) which is not a carrier but has control of one or more carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-9\">Goodrich is a New York corporation whose stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Industries, a Delaware corporation, is a conglomerate holding company whose interests include approximately 99 percent of the voting stock of Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company (North Western), as well as direct or indirect control of other railroads. North Western is a common rail carrier subject to the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1415-15\">On January 20, 1969, Industries made a public announcement that it would offer to exchange certain of its securities for Goodrich stock. Goodrich sought to prevent this acquisition by filing, on January 27, 1969, a petition with the Commission for leave to intervene in the Chicago and North Western Railway Company-Merger proceeding, then pending before the Commission.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the petition, Goodrich also endeavored to reopen the proceeding with the Commission, complaining that Industries should be subject to certain portions of Section 20 of the Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1415-16\">On March 4, 1969, Goodrich purchased all the outstanding shares of Motor Freight Corporation, a motor carrier subject to the Act, which operates under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the Commission. Industries did not apply to the Commission for approval of its acquisition of the Goodrich stock, and indicated that it did not intend to do so. On March 7, 1969, Goodrich filed with the Commission its \u201cSupplement to Amended and Supplemental Petition\u201d, which advised the Commission of Goodrich\u2019s ownership of Motor Freight. It contended that the acquisition of Goodrich by Industries would violate section 5(2) of the Act in that a \u201cperson [Industries] which is not a carrier and which has control of one or more carriers\u201d would \u201cacquire control of another carrier\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>[Motor Freight] without the approval of the Commission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1416-4\">Industries answered, on March 10, 1969, that its acquisition of Goodrich would not violate the Act because \u201csimultaneously with acquisition of control of Goodrich, the stock of Motor Freight Corporation will be sold to a non-affiliated non-carrier [and] pending sale, complete control of such motor carrier will be placed in an independent voting trustee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-5\">The Commission issued an order, on April 24, 1969, granting Goodrich the right to intervene in the proceeding, reopening the proceeding for the \u201csole purpose\u201d of subjecting Industries to the provisions of section 20(5) of the Act and denying the petition \u201cin all other respects.\u201d In the order the Commission indicated that it found Industries\u2019 plan of divestiture acceptable to preclude a violation of the Act, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1416-6\">\u201c * * * simultaneously with acquisition of control of B. F. Goodrich Company the stock of Motor Freight Corporation will be sold to a non-affiliated non-carrier, or, pending sale, complete control of such motor carrier will be placed in an independent voting trustee, that the Commission has held in the past that the placing of stock in an independent voting trust, with necessary restrictions, constitutes divesture of control * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1416-13\">On July 25, 1969, Goodrich filed a complaint in the District Court of Delaware for a declaratory judgment and injunction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Commission intervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-14\">Judge Steel granted the Commission\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, and denied Goodrich\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. The basis for his order was (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter in that there is no <em>private right </em>of action for enforcement of Section 5(2) of the Act, (2) Goodrich had exhausted its administrative remedy unsuccessfully and therefore the \u201cdoctrine of primary jurisdiction requires this Court to respect the administrative ruling implicit in the Commission\u2019s decision\u201d, and (3) there was insufficient danger of irreparable harm to Goodrich or likelihood of a violation of a statute by Industries to warrant the issuance of a preliminary injunction. [B. F. Goodrich Co. v. Northwest Industries, Inc., 303 F.Supp. 53, 60 (D.Del.1969)]. Goodrich then appealed the dismissal of the complaint to this Court, but not the refusal to grant the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-15\">We agree that the District Court had no jurisdiction over the Goodrich complaint. The complaint was in substance a collateral attack on an order of the Commission and an attack on such an order may be brought only before a three-judge court convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2325.<footnotemark>6a</footnotemark> Venner v. Michigan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>Central Railroad Co., 271 U.S. 127, 46 S.Ct. 444, 70 L.Ed. 868 (1926); Lambert Run Coal Co. v. B &amp; O Railroad Co., 258 U.S. 377, 42 S.Ct. 349, 66 L.Ed. 671 (1922); Suffin v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 396 F.2d 75, 76 (3d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1062, 89 S.Ct. 713, 21 L.Ed.2d 705; Schwartz v.

Goodrich contended in its March 7, 1969, petition before the Commission, as it did in the District Court and continues to do here, that Industries, which held 99 percent of North Western stock, was a \u201cperson * * * which has control of one or more carriers\u201d and since Goodrich controlled Motor Freight the acquisition of Goodrich by Industries without permission of the Commission would violate the Act. The Commission rejected such contention when it denied Goodrich\u2019s petition in all respects other than granting reopening of the proceedings for the sole purpose of subjecting Industries to Section 20(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-15\"> The Urgent Deficiency Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2321-2325,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> sets forth the exclusive procedure for review and enforcement of Commission orders: Section 2325 requires the convening of a three-judge court before an \u201cinjunction restraining the enforcement, operation or execution, in whole or in part, of any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission [is] granted\u201d. The United States, by the Attorney General, is an indispensible party to such action in which the Commission or parties in interest may appear of their own motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2322-2323. As in all three-judge eases, there is a direct appeal to the United States Supreme Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253. <em>See generally </em>Anderson, \u201cJudicial Review of Decisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission\u201d, 31 Geo.Wash.L.Rev. 277 (1962). Although the statutory arrangement may be criticized as cumbersome, since orders of other administrative agencies can be reviewed or enforced by a single judge in the district court, the mandate that this be the exclusive procedure of review in Commission cases must be followed until changed by Congress.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1417-17\">The statutory procedure for review is applicable although an order is not directly attacked \u2014 so long as the practical effect of a successful suit would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>contradict or countermand a Commission order. Venner v. Michigan Central Railroad, <em>supra, </em>Lambert Run Coal Co. v. B &amp; O Railroad Co., <em>supra; </em>Simpson v. Southwestern Railroad Co., 231 F.2d 59 (5th Cir. 1956), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 828, 77 S.Ct. 41, 1 L.Ed.2d 50. <em>See also </em>United States v. Southern Railway Co., 380 F.2d 49, 53 (4th Cir. 1967); United States v. Southern Railway Co., 364 F.2d 86, 92 (5th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1031, 87 S.Ct. 1479, 18 L.Ed.2d 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-4\">In order to circumvent the requirements of sections 2321-2325 Goodrich contends that it is not attempting to \u201csuspend, enjoin, annul or set aside\u201d a Commission order, because no appealable order was issued by the Commission. As authority, it cites Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. United States, 363 U.S. 202, 205, 80 S.Ct. 1131, 4 L.Ed.2d 1165 (1960), and State of New Jersey v. United States, 168 F.Supp. 324 (D.N.J.1958), aff'd per curiam, 359 U.S. 27, 79 S.Ct. 607, 3 L.Ed.2d 625. Neither case supports Goodrich\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-5\">We do not dispute the dictum relied on in Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 363 U.S. at 205, 80 S.Ct. at 1133, that \u201cwhile a mere \u2018abstract declaration\u2019 on some issue by the Commission may not be judicially reviewable, an order that determines a \u2018right or obligation\u2019 so that \u2018legal consequences\u2019 will flow from it is reviewable.\u201d But we conclude, as did the Supreme Court in <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Company, </em>that the Commission\u2019s order met the latter standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-6\">The Commission\u2019s order in the present case determined the right of Industries to proceed with its acquisition of Goodrich, and it denied Goodrich the opportunity to contest this issue in a reopened proceeding. The Supreme Court has said that a permissive order as well as a mandatory one is appealable, Venner v. Michigan Central, <em>supra; </em>Chicago Junction case, 264 U.S. 258, 263, 44 S.Ct. 317, 68 L.Ed. 667 (1924), and has long abandoned the \u201cnegative order doctrine\u201d. Rochester Telephone Corporation v. United States, 307 U.S. 125, 59 S.Ct. 754, 83 L.Ed. 1147 (1939). A refusal of the Commission to grant a rehearing may be appealed. See Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. United States, 284 U.S. 248, 52 S.Ct. 146, 76 L.Ed. 273 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-8\">In the <em>State of New Jersey </em>case, the plaintiff appealed the refusal of the Commission to investigate its complaint, and the three-judge court held that \u201cno order of the Commission [was] complained of\u201d and \u201cwritten notice that it would not investigate the complaint does not constitute such action as is reviewable.\u201d The action of the Commission in the present case is not, as Goodrich contends, a \u201cfailure to investigate\u201d. The Commission here issued an order which, although not crystal clear, in effect sanctions Industries\u2019 plan and refuses to reopen the proceeding at Goodrich\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-9\">Goodrich\u2019s argument is essentially the same as that noted and rejected in Simpson v. South Western Railroad Company, <em>supra, </em>when Judge Little said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1418-10\">\u201cIt seems to us that the appellants are here forced into the narrow position of arguing that this suit is not a suit to \u2018suspend, enjoin, annul or set aside\u2019 an <em>order </em>of the Interstate Commerce Commission because all it seeks is to suspend, enjoin, annul and set aside a <em>course </em>of action that the Commission order has approved and authorized.\u201d 231 F.2d at 62.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1418-11\">Even if we were to hold that Goodrich\u2019s complaint is not a collateral attack on a Commission order, Goodrich\u2019s suit must be dismissed for failure to state a federal cause of action. Goodrich asserted jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337, which provides for original jurisdiction in district courts of \u201cany civil action or proceeding arising under any Act of Congress regulating commerce\u201d. Although \u00a7 1337 creates jurisdiction it does not create a cause of action. <em>See </em>Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Public Service Co., 341 U.S. 246, 71 S.Ct. 692, 95 L.Ed. 912 (1951). Goodrich asserts a cause of action under sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>tion 5(4) of the Act,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which makes it unlawful for certain acquisitions enumerated in section 5(2) to take place without Commission approval. The enforcement provision for this section is contained in section 5(7) which authorizes the <em>\u201cCommission </em>* * * upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint * * * to investigate and determine whether any person is violating the provisions of paragraph (4)\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 5(11) then makes the clear statement that \u201cThe authority conferred by this section shall be exclusive and plenary\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Act therefore places sole responsibility for its enforcement on the Commission. After the Commission has issued an order, the private party who considers such order in violation of the law may seek review only in the manner set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2321-2325.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-5\">The position that alone the Commission may seek judicial enforcement of section 5 is further buttressed by section 5(8) which provides: \u201cThe district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction <em>upon the complaint of the Commission, </em>alleging a violation of any of the provisions of this section * * <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1419-6\">We find nothing in the Act which would authorize a private party to bring an action in a district court to enforce section 5. Any possible interpretation of the Act indicating such a cause of action would be at war with the statutory scheme vesting responsibility for the operation of common carriers with the Commission. <em>See </em>Gilbertville Trucking Co., Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 115, 83 S.Ct. 217, 9 L.Ed.2d 177 (1962). The acquisitions and combinations prohibited by section 5(4) are lawful with Commission \u201capproval\u201d; the Commission is authorized to approve such acquisitions on terms it finds \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d. Section 5(2) (b). As Mr. Justice Black stated in Seaboard Air Line Railroad Co. v. Daniel, 333 U.S. 118, 125, 68 S.Ct. 426, 92 L.Ed. 580 (1948): \u201cBy \u00a7 5(11) of the Interstate Commerce Act * * * Congress granted the Commission \u2018exclusive and plenary\u2019 authority in refusing or approving railroad consolidations, mergers, acquisitions, etc. The breadth of this grant of power can be understood only by reference to \u00a7 5(2) (b) which authorizes the Commission to predicate its approval upon \u2018such terms and conditions and such modifications as it shall find to be just and reasonable\u2019 \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-14\">Congress clearly placed complete initial control of acquisitions involving federally regulated carriers in the Commission. Any private party injured by a violation of the Act must seek remedial relief from the Commission. Such party must obtain an order from the Commission which may be reviewed only pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2321-2325. This interpretation is consistent with the decision in Neisloss v. Bush, 110 U.S. App.D.C. 396, 293 F.2d 873, 878 (1961). There, Mr. Justice Reed, sitting by designation, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action where stockholders who attacked their corporation\u2019s acquisition of the New York Central contended that the transaction violated Section 5. Justice Reed stated: \u201cThere is nothing in the statute or its history to indicate that Congress, in enacting \u00a7 5(2), meant to authorize an original action in the district court, and that it took the extraordinary step of bypassing its expert agency in the matters here involved. These matters call for the exercise of discretion and the practical application of the Commerce Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-15\">Goodrich seeks to distinguish <em>Neisloss </em>from the present case on the basis that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number><em>Neisloss </em>involved a factual determination on which the Commission had expertise, whereas its own complaint may be adjudicated solely as an issue of law, a matter in which the courts are the experts. In view of the language of section 5, this distinction is not tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-4\">Two district courts which have considered the issue of a private right of action under section 5 have reached contrary results. Most v. Allegheny Corp. (S.D.N.Y., No. 66 Civ. 962, February 17, 1970), heavily relied on by Goodrich at oral argument, decided <em>inter alia </em>that a private cause of action for enforcement of section 5(2) (b) may be brought under the jurisdiction of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Judge Wyatt said: \u201cThe purpose of Section 5(11) is not to limit the jurisdiction of this Court but to make clear that a transaction authorized by the Commission can be carried into effect without regard to state or municipal law or to any other federal statute.\u201d Although one aspect of \u00a7 5(11) is to immunize parties who comply with Commission orders from violations of state and municipal laws <em>(see e. g. Seaboard, Air Line, supra), </em>the language when construed in the context of the other provisions of section 5 is not limited to that interpretation. We therefore disagree with the decision in <em>Most </em>\u2014 a decision significantly made without benefit of Commission participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-6\">Chicago, South Shore &amp; South Bend Railroad v. Monon Railroad, 235 F.Supp. 984 (N.D.I11.1964), is in direct conflict with <em>Most. </em>In <em>Monon, </em>the court dismissed a complaint seeking an injunction against an acquisition alleged to have violated section 5. One of the reasons set forth in the opinion which concluded that there is no private cause of action under section 5, was the need for the Commission\u2019s expertise. Goodrich attempts to distinguish <em>Monon, </em>as did the court in <em>Most, </em>on the ground that in <em>Monon </em>there was an issue whether \u201ccontrol\u201d would be achieved. Admittedly there is no dispute regarding the meaning of control in the present case. There is, however, a question whether Industries\u2019 plan for divestiture removes it from the prohibition of the Act. There is no real distinction between these two issues. Both concern a question of statutory construction rather than a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-9\">Goodrich seeks to justify its position that there is an implied private cause of action for enforcement of section 5 by directing attention to decisions in which courts have inferred a private cause of action from statutes which do not specifically set forth such action. The only Supreme Court case Goodrich cites is J. I. Case v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 84 S.Ct. 1555, 12 L.Ed.2d 423 (1964). Section 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, construed in <em>Borak, </em>is clearly not analogous to Section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act. As stated in <em>Borak-, </em>\u201csection 27 specifically grants the appropriate District Courts jurisdiction over <em>\u2018all </em>suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created\u2019 under the [Securities Exchange] Act.\u201d 377 U.S. at 431, 84 S.Ct. at 1559. In contrast, the jurisdiction portion of Section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, Section 5(8), is not silent on the question of jurisdiction; it specifically gives the district courts jurisdiction <em>\u201cupon the complaint of the Commission, </em>alleging a violation\u201d of Section 5. Thus, the analogy of the Securities Exchange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>Act of 1934 may not be aptly drawn.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-5\">Although not raised by either party there is some question regarding the standing of Goodrich to bring an action enforcing the Act or to appeal the order of the Commission. In view of our decision that there is no private right of action to enforce Section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, it is unnecessary to consider who could bring such cause of action if one existed. Goodrich\u2019s standing to contest the order of the Commission in a three-judge court should, in the first instance, be decided by the district court if such suit is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-6\">There is also a question whether this particular proceeding is moot inasmuch as Industries\u2019 tender offer has by its terms now terminated. Since none of the parties wish to press this point, and in view of the fact that Industries has indicated that it may, in the near future, proceed with a new tender offer, we do not at this stage decline jurisdiction because of mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-7\">Finally, because of our disposition of the case it is unnecessary that we address ourselves to the application of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction as discussed by Judge Steel and pressed by the parties in this appeal. 303 F.Supp. at 60. For a discussion of the application of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction to the Interstate Commerce Commission in this Circuit, <em>see </em>Seatrain Lines Inc. v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 207 F.2d 255 (3d Cir. 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-8\">An order will be entered affirming the dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1415-10\">.

In support of its decision, the court in <em>Most </em>said that Mississippi River Fuel Corp. v. Slayton, 359 F.2d 106, 114 (8th Cir. 1966) makes a similar construction of Section 5(11). However, such construction is far from clear since the court in <em>Mississippi River Fuel </em>recognized that the \u201cmerits or demerits and the fairness or unfairness of a proposed railroad consolidation are not, in the first instance, matters for our jurisdiction or our concern, or for the jurisdiction or concern of the district court.\u201d 359 F.2d at 113. <em>Mississippi River Fuel </em>was reversed on other grounds, sub nom.
