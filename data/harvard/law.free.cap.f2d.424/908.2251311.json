General Counsel, Securities and Exchange Commission, with whom Messrs. Philip A. Loomis, Jr., General Counsel, and David Ferber, Solicitor, Securities and Exchange Commission, were on the brief, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>Before DANAHER, Senior Circuit Judge, and TAMM and LEVENTHAL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b973-5\">TAMM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Petitioners, securities salesmen, charge that respondent abused its discretion, and acted \u201cin total and arbitrary disregard of its own established criteria,\u201d when it \u201cignor[ed] the recommendation of the hearing examiner\u201d and imposed upon them \u201cthe most drastic statutory sanctions possible.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They identify themselves to us as salesmen who \u201cenjoyed a good reputation, were first offenders and whose actions were in accordance with advice of counsel and were taken in good faith and whose actions and statements caused no injury to the investing public.\u201d Accordingly, the petitioners base their claim for relief on the fact the respondent upon review ordered that they be barred from any future association with a broker or dealer in securities although the hearing examiner would have imposed varying periods of suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">Encapsulated, then, the sole question before us is whether under the circumstances of this case the respondent Commission abused its discretion, or exceeded its authority, in imposing upon petitioners the sanction against further participation in the securities business.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">A lengthy detailing of the transactions preceding the appeal to this court is unnecessary since there is no substantial question raised as to the procedural steps resulting in the respondent\u2019s ultimate action. It will suffice to enumerate only that as a result of an action initiated by the Commission pursuant to sections 15(b) and 15A of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78o(b), 78o-3 (1964) against the employing corporation, corporation president, and these petitioners, extensive proceedings were conducted by a hearing examiner to determine whether those persons had willfully violated the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 \u00a7 5(a) and (c), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e(a), (c) (1964), and the antifraud provisions of both securities acts, section 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a) (1964); \u00a7\u00a7 10(b) and 15(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b), 78o(c) (1) (1964) and Rules 10b \u2014 5 and 15cl-2, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 240.-10b \u2014 5, 240.15c! \u2014 2, in the offer and sale of stock in two named corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">The hearing examiner ordered the suspension of our present petitioners from association with any broker or dealer for periods varying from four to six months. None of the respondents requested the Commission to review the examiner\u2019s Initial Decision, but the Commission\u2019s Division of Trading and Markets took exception to that part of the Examiner\u2019s conclusion that the participation of the salesmen was not willful, filed a petition for review, and urged upon the Commission the conclusion that the sanctions imposed upon the salesmen were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">The Commission made an independent review of the entire record (J.A. 86), found that our petitioner salesmen had willfully committed the violations alleged, and overruled the examiner\u2019s punitive ruling by ordering that all four be barred from any future association with a broker or dealer in securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">Petitioners concede that the Commission possesses the statutory power to increase the sanctions imposed by the hearing examiner (Brief for the Petitioners at 5). They urge, however, that this power for \u201csound and persuasive\u201d reasons should be exercised in only the most extreme circumstances, which circumstances they say are entirely absent in this case. The petitioners argue that the Commission\u2019s discretion is not without limit and must be susceptible to some type of \u201cmeasurement.\u201d Citing Mr. Justice Frankfurter for the proposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>tion that \u201c[discretion without a criterion for its exercise is authorization of arbitrariness,\u201d Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 496, 73 S.Ct. 397, 441, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953), they contend that the respondent here has arbitrarily and capriciously disregarded the reasonable standards applied in yet other situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">They say the Commission here should have considered and applied principles such as have heretofore governed the Commission\u2019s remedial determinations, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-5\">1) Whether the respondents in a proceeding were first offenders. <em>J. H. Goddard &amp; Co., Inc., </em>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 7618 (June 4, 1965); <em>Strathmore Securities Inc. and Turner, </em>Securities Exchange Release No. 8207 (Dec. 13, 1967);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-6\">2) Whether the respondents bear a good reputation. C.M. Loeb, Rhoades &amp; Co. 38 S.E.C. 843 (1959); <em>Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Beane, </em>31 S.E.C. 494 (1950);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-7\">3) Whether restitution has been made. <em>Reynolds &amp; Co., </em>39 S.E.C. 902 (1960);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-8\">4) Whether respondents acted upon advice of counsel. <em>C.M. Leob, </em>[sic] <em>Rhoades &amp; Co., supra; G. J. Mitchell, Jr. Co., </em>40 S.E.C. 409 (1960) ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-9\">5) [Whether any] investors appear to have been injured [.] <em>C.M. Leob, </em>[sic] <em>Rhoades &amp; Co., supra;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-10\">6) [Whether] failure to disclose unfavorable financial information was prompted by faith in the ultimate success of the company. <em>Van Al-styne, Noel &amp; Company, </em>33 S.E.C. 311, 340 (1952).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-11\">(Brief for the Petitioners at 11-12.) These citations are apparently intended to illustrate the principle that while in most cases the Commission\u2019s remedial action is very human and sometimes superhuman, it was, in the present case, inhuman.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b974-13\">We note initially that the hearing examiner in his detailed and documented initial report (J.A. 6-74) found that these petitioners participated in \u201cwilful violations of the anti-fraud provisions\u201d in the sale of stock of two named corporations (J.A. 71), and that their actions were \u201cserious, flagrant and financially remunerative\u201d (J.A. 72). He concluded that their conduct \u201creveals a recklessness in each man and an indifference to the need for full and accurate disclosure and it supports and requires the imposition of sanctions in the public interest.\u201d (J.A. 72.) Our review of the record before us completely satisfies us that these findings and conclusions are amply supported by the evidence adduced before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-14\">The examiner also concluded, however, in yet other respects that \u201cabsent control and evidence of knowledge of violations by the salesmen * * * their participation in the mark-up violations * * * <em>should not be deemed wilful.\u201d </em>(J.A. 25; emphasis added). He also pointed out that the evidence did not disclose \u201cthe more flagrant types of high-pressure sales operations found in some other cases,\u201d and commented upon the fact that the petitioners were guided by Howard, the principal of the broker-dealer employer, \u201cin whose judgment they had faith,\u201d that money was being spent for the improvement of the hotel property involved in one sales promotion, and the fact that the hotel \u201cmight be a profitable venture\u201d (J.A. 72). Further ameliorization of petitioners\u2019 culpability was expressed by the examiner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-15\">Although the selling transactions engaged in by each of the respondent salesmen aided and abetted registrant\u2019s violations of Section 5, nevertheless, inasmuch as the salesmen were not in positions of control within registrant\u2019s organization and were not shown to have engaged in the sale transactions with knowledge or reason to know that registration was required, I conclude that they did not wilfully violate the pertinent securi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>ties laws, and in the further light of the opinions from Schuehert to registrant and registrant\u2019s decisions and directions, in turn, to the salesmen with regard to the sales activity, that sanctions against the salesmen for such a violation would in any event be inappropriate. * * * Nor do I believe that the directorship held by O\u2019Leary in registrant\u2019s firm compels a contrary result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">(J.A. 39-40.) It was these additional considerations, expressed with great conviction but somewhat less clarity, that resulted in the examiner\u2019s recommendation that suspension rather than permanent bar would be appropriate in the public interest. (J.A. 72-73.)</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">Dissatisfaction with the hearing examiner\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions relating to the petitioners\u2019 responsibility in the sale of \u201cstock at excessive and unreasonable prices,\u201d that the petitioners \u201cdid not willfully violate section 5 of the Securities Act\u201d and that none of petitioners \u201chad any intention to defraud the public,\u201d motivated the Commission\u2019s Division of Trading and Markets to petition the Commission for a review of those findings and conclusions (J.A. 75-84). This petition was granted, briefs were filed, oral argument heard, and an \u201cindependent review of the record\u201d made by the Commission (J.A. 86). Thereafter the Commission issued its findings and opinion in which it held that the conduct of petitioners <em>did constitute willful violations </em>of the antifraud and registration sections of the securities acts, and in the public interest justified their being barred from association with broker-dealer activities. The appeal to this court followed that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">Customarily in cases challenging the actions of administrative agencies we consider first the extent of our authority to review such actions. We recognize that \u201cwhere Congress has entrusted an administrative agency with the responsibility of selecting the means of achieving the statutory policy \u2018the relation of remedy to policy is peculiarly a matter for administrative competence\u2019.\u201d American Power &amp; Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. 90, 112, 67 S.Ct. 133, 146, 91 L.Ed. 103 (1946). <em>See also </em>Moog Industries, Inc. v. FTC, 355 U.S. 411, 413, 78 S.Ct. 377, 2 L.Ed.2d 370 (1958); Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 177, 194, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271, 133 A.L.R. 1217 (1941). We are bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s action in adopting</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-12\">a principle now firmly established, that in cases raising issues of fact not within the conventional experience of judges or cases requiring the exercise of administrative discretion, agencies created by Congress for regulating the subject matter should not be passed over. This is so even though the facts after they have been appraised by specialized competence serve as a premise for legal consequences to be judicially defined. Uniformity and consistency in the regulation of business entrusted to a particular agency are secured, and the limited functions of review by the judiciary are more rationally exercised, by preliminary resort for ascertaining and interpreting the circumstances underlying legal issues to agencies that are better equipped than courts by specialization, by insight gained through experience, and more flexible procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">Far East Conf. v. United States, 342 U.S. 570, 574-575, 72 S.Ct. 492, 96 L.Ed. 576 (1952). Moreover, we recognize that \u201c[w]here the established facts empower an administrative agency to take particular remedial action, the determination of whether it should take that action rests within the sound discretion of the agency.\u201d San Francisco Mining Exchange v. SEC, 378 F.2d 162, 165 (9th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">Congress has bestowed broad and far-reaching authority on the Commission in the enactment of sections 15(b) (5) and (7) of the Securities Exchange Act. The authorization empowers the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>mission to bar any person from association with a broker or dealer if, after prescribed procedures, it finds that such barring \u201cis in the public interest\u201d and that the charged conduct constitutes willful violation of the Act. \u201cThe Commission is given the duty to protect the public. What will protect the public must involve, of necessity, an exercise of discretionary determination. This court ordinarily should not substitute its judgment of what would be appropriate under the circumstances in place of the Commission\u2019s judgment as to measures necessary to protect the public interest.\u201d Pierce v. SEC, 239 F.2d 160, 163 (9th Cir. 1956), citing Wright v. SEC, 112 F.2d 89 (2d Cir. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Our review satisfies us that the evidence before the Commission substantially supports its findings, that the Commission was not thinking in emotional cliches, that the Commission\u2019s actions are neither arbitrary nor capricious, and that the Commission\u2019s action was completely within its statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">Although petitioners do not challenge the .Commission\u2019s legal authority to increase the sanctions imposed by the hearing examiner, our views on the point do not differ greatly from those expressed in several recent decisions upholding the Commission in increasing the sanctions imposed by the hearing examiner. This action has been specifically upheld in Nees v. SEC, 414 F.2d 211 (9th Cir. 1969); Hanly v. SEC, 415 F.2d 589 (2d Cir. 1969); Fink v. SEC, 417 F.2d 1058 (2d Cir. 1969); Gross v. SEC, 418 F.2d 1058 (2d Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">Finally, as to petitioners\u2019 protest that they \u201cwere first offenders,\u201d acting in accord with advice of counsel, and causing no injury to the investing public, we concur with Chief Judge Lumbard\u2019s statement in Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965): \u201cWhile these factors might have warranted a lighter sanction, they did not require one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-15\">.
