Taxpayers are the owners of boats used in commercial fishing. The fishing is carried out through contractual arrangements with boat captains who staff the boats and manage their day-to-day operation. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>crucial legal issue is whether the captain and crewmen are the \u201cemployees\u201d of the owners within the meaning of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3101 et seq.) and the Federal Employment Tax Act (26 U.S.C.A. 3301 et seq.) This Court, 402 F.2d 956, agreed with the district court, 271 F. Supp. 249, that the statutes\u2019 prescription of \u201ccommon law rules\u201d barred application of maritime standards in making this determination. Based on that legal premise, we concluded that the decision of the district court that the captains and crewmen were not employees of the taxpayers should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">The Supreme Court held that this Court \u201cerred in declining to judge the status of the captains and crewmen against the standards of maritime law.\u201d This holding, coupled with our earlier conclusion that under maritime law the captain is the agent of the owner and the crew hands are employees, leaves no room for further argument as to the appropriate disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-6\">Accordingly, the Court.denies the taxpayers\u2019 request for.further proceedings here; the case is remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss the taxpayers\u2019 complaints.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
