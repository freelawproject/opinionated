Hilmer and Habicht had filed U.S. and foreign \u201cconvention\u201d applications in the following order on the following dates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-4\">Habicht Swiss application Jan. 24, 1957</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"azv-dedup-1\">Hilmer German application July 31, 1957</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"alv-dedup-0\">Habicht U. S. application Jan. 23, 1958</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlG\">Hilmer U. S. application July 25, 1958</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1174-7\">Hilmer was accorded the benefit of his German application filing date, as a date of invention, but this was noc early enough to overcome the date of Habicht\u2019s Swiss filing date, to which <em>he </em>was held to be entitled on the \u201cpriority\u201d issue. Accordingly, Hilmer conceded priority of the <em>invention of the count </em>to Habicht.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-8\">In Hilmer I, the question we decided was whether the Habicht patent was effective as a <em>prior art </em>reference under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(e) as of the Swiss filing date. We held that it was not and that it was \u201cprior art\u201d under 102(e) only as of the U.S. filing date, which date Hil-mer could overcome by being entitled to rely on the filing date of his German application to show his date of invention. This disposed of a rejection predicated on the <em>disclosure </em>of the Habicht patent, as a primary reference, coupled with a secondary prior art patent to Wagner et al, No. 2,975,212, issued March 14, 1961, filed May 1, 1957 (herein \u201cWagner\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-9\">This appeal is from the decision of the board on the remand as to claims 10 and 16, claim 17 evidently now standing allowed in view of our reversal in Hilmer I of the sole ground on which it was rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-10\">The board agrees with the view we expressed in Hilmer I that it had failed to pass on the rejection based on the count of the interference in view of Wagner and a finding of obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. It summed up the situation and the issue before it on remand as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-11\">As we stated in the former opinion, we do not consider that there is any question of <em>res judicata </em>or estoppel arising from the interference involved with respect to the present claims and the question which arises then is: is claim 1 of the patent, that is, the subject matter of claim 1, prior art against appellants and on what statutory basis can it be so used ?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1174-14\">Using a claim itself as \u201cprior art,\u201d a claim being a definition of the <em>scope </em>of the patent protection, can be fraught with difficulties,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but in this instance Habicht\u2019s claim 1 is to a specific bis-sulfonyl urea of a stated formula and there is no problem in this regard. The board, it is to be noted, was meticulous in specifying, in its statement of the question, that we are dealing with <em>the subject matter of </em>claim 1 rather than with a patent claim as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-15\">The board\u2019s conclusion was that the subject matter of claim 1, the compound claimed, is prior art against Hilmer. As to the basis on which it can be considered to be, or treated as, prior art, the board divided. Two members stated that the statutory basis is 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(g) combined with \u00a7 119 and read in the light of \u00a7 104. The third member declined to accept this, concurred only in the result, and said, \u201cI see no reason to go beyond the concession of priority filed by Hilmer et al. * * Since his view was not determinative of the appeal, we consider that what we have before us for review is only the correctness of the reasoning of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-17\">Note must be taken of the fact that the rejection here is under \u00a7 103 for obviousness wherefore it is clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>the subject matter of the appealed claims is <em>different from </em>the subject matter of Habicht\u2019s claim l,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> allegedly, however, only in an obvious way by reason of the further disclosures of Wagner. Were the appealed claims to the <em>same </em>subject matter, it seems clear that Hilmer, because he conceded <em>priority </em>to Habicht, would not be entitled to them and Hilmer appears to have admitted as much throughout this appeal. But, it is contended, the situation is different when the claims on appeal are to different subject matter. We confess to some difficulty in determining just what appellants\u2019 view is but it seems to come down to this: Appellants are entitled to the benefit of their German filing date and this antedates Habicht\u2019s U.S. filing date, which is the earliest date as of which Habicht\u2019s claim 1 invention can be \u201cprior art.\u201d The words appellants use, referring to Habicht\u2019s U.S. filing date, are, \u201cthe only possible date that can be considered for anticipation purposes.\u201d Appellants appear to use the term \u201canticipation\u201d in the broad sense to mean \u201cprior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">We turn now to the reasoning by which the board majority arrived at the conclusion that the compound of Habicht claim 1 is in the <em>prior </em>art\u2014 i. e., ahead of Hilmer\u2019s German filing date \u2014 and usable with the Wagner patent to support a section 103 obviousness rejection. We note at the outset that the board majority in no way relied on what occurred in the interference, on the concession of priority, or on any estoppel growing out of the interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-7\">Before examining the board majority\u2019s statutory theory, we will recall the fact that in Hilmer I we dealt with another statutory theory that by combining \u00a7 102(e) and \u00a7 119 a U.S. patent had an effective date as a prior art reference for all it discloses as of its foreign convention filing date. We reversed that holding and remanded. We nowT are presented with another theory that by combining \u00a7 102(g) with \u00a7 119 at least the <em>claimed </em>subject matter of a U.S. patent is prior art as of the convention filing date. The crux of the matter lies in \u00a7 102(g), which we must have before us. In relevant part it reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-8\">\u00a7 <em>102. Conditions for patentability; novelty </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-9\">A person shall be entitled to a patent unless\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-4\">(g) before the applicant\u2019s invention thereof the invention was made <em>in this country </em>by another who had not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed it. * * * [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">The board majority\u2019s rationalization begins thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-6\">Section 102(g) of the statute refers to the prior invention of another as a basis for refusing a patent. Inasmuch as the subject matter of the claim of the Habicht patent is patented to another, it must be recognized as an invention of another, and being the invention of another, some date of invention must be ascribed to it. When nothing else is available, the date of filing the application [in the United States] is by law taken as the date of invention since the invention obviously must have been made on or before the day the application for a patent for it was filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1176-7\">But this much, assuming its correctness,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> would not sustain the rejection because appellants are entitled to a date of invention which is earlier than the day the Habicht application was filed in the United States, the date obviously referred to in the above quotation. To sustain the rejection it was necessary for the board to accord an earlier date to Habicht\u2019s invention, the only such date available being the date Habicht filed his application <em>in Switzerland. </em>This, however, is not in compliance with the provision of 102(g) that the invention be \u201cmade\u201d (or at the very least <em>be) </em>\u201cin this country.\u201d The board majority attempted to vault this hurdle as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-8\">While Section 102(g) refers to the prior invention as made \u201cin this country\u201d, this limitation is removed as to application filing date by Section 119 of the statute which provides that an application for a patent for an invention shall have the same effect as though filed in this country on the date a prior application was filed in a foreign country, under the conditions prescribed. That this is the effect of Section 119 is also evident from Section 104. * * * The Habicht invention is * * * entitled to the filing date of the application in Switzerland as its date of invention in this country. Hence, we conclude on the basis of Section 102 (g) and Section 119 that the claimed subject matter of the Habicht patent is available for use against the present application [as patent-defeating prior art] as of the date of the application filed in Switzerland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1176-14\">We disagree with this line of reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-15\">In Hilmer I we explained at length why we could not accept similar reasoning about \u00a7 119 which was there alleged to remove or qualify the limitation in \u00a7 102(e) to the date when an application was filed \u201cin the United States.\u201d For the same reasons we hold, contrary to the ipse dixit of the board, that \u00a7 119 does not remove the limitation of \u00a7 102(g) fo\u00fand in the phrase \u201cin this country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-16\">We disagree with the board that such an effect \u201cis also evident from Section 104.\u201d Section 104 merely states that, except as provided by \u00a7 119, an applicant or patentee may not establish a date of invention \u201cby reference to knowledge or use thereof, or other activity\u201d in a foreign country. Thus \u00a7 119 and \u00a7 104 relate, respectively, only to what an applicant or patentee may and may not do to <em>protect himself </em>against patent-defeating events occurring between his invention date and his U.S. filing date. Moreover, we discussed \u00a7 104 and \u00a7 102(a), (e), and (g) in Hilmer I and there showed that they indicate an intention on the part of Congress that knowledge and acts in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>foreign country are not to defeat the rights of an applicant for a patent, except as the applicant may become involved in a <em>priority </em>dispute with another applicant entitled to \u00a7 119 benefits. The present appeal does not involve a <em>priority </em>dispute. We repeat what we said at the end of that discussion in Hilmer I (under headnote [8]):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-4\">We think it follows that section 119 must be interpreted as giving only a positive right or benefit to an applicant who has first filed abroad to <em>protect him </em>against possible intervening patent-defeating events in <em>obtaining </em>a patent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">That Habicht, as an applicant, was entitled to the benefit of his Swiss filing date does not mean that his invention acquires that same date under \u00a7 102(g) as patent-defeating prior art, in direct contravention of the \u201cin this country\u201d limitation of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">While it has not been discussed in the briefs, the legislative history of section 102(g) clearly shows that the words \u201cin this country\u201d were deliberately inserted in the section. They did not appear in H.R. 9133, the first patent law revision bill introduced July 17, 1950, in the 81st Congress, 2d Session.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They appeared in the next bill, H.R. 3760, 82d Congress, 1st Session, April 18, 1951.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The present version appeared in the final bill, H.R. 7794, 82d Congress, 2d Session, May 20, 1952, which was enacted. House Report 1923 and Senate Report 1979 on that bill both state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-7\">Subsection (g) relates to the question of priority of invention between rival inventors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-9\">The Revision Notes forming part of the Reports state, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-10\">Paragraph (g) * * * retains the present rules of law governing the determination of priority of invention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-11\">The Commentary in 35 U.S.C.A. by P. J. Federico states (p. 19):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-12\">Paragraph (g) relates to prior in-ventorship by another <em>in this country </em>as preventing the grant of a patent. It is based in part on the second defense in old R.S. 4920 (see under section 282), and retains the rules of law governing the determination <em>of priority </em>of invention developed by decisions. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1177-13\">In none of this do we find any support for the board majority\u2019s theory of statutory interpretation and none is cited by the board in support of its view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-14\">As we understand the meaning of the term \u201cpriority,\u201d it refers either (a) to the issue which exists in the interference proceedings, namely, which of two or more rival inventors <em>attempting to patent </em>the <em>same </em>invention shall be deemed prior or first in law and <em>entitled to the patent </em>or (b) preservation of an effective filing date during a period such as the \u201cconvention\u201d year as against acts which would otherwise bar the grant of a patent, for the protection <em>of an applicant </em>against loss of right <em>to a patent. </em>Nothing we have seen tends to indicate that this matter of \u201cpriority\u201d has ever been intended to modify the long-standing provisions of our statutes as to what shall be deemed \u201cprior art\u201d under \u00a7 103.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>Since we disagree with the board\u2019s interpretation of the statute, we disagree with its conclusion that the Habicht claim 1 subject matter is \u201cprior art\u201d as of any date earlier than Habicht\u2019s U. S. filing date (if it is \u201cprior art\u201d at all). Appellants have an earlier effective date. The rejection, on the board majority\u2019s theory, is therefore reversed. Habicht\u2019s claim 1 compound being removed as \u201cprior art,\u201d it is unnecessary to reach the second question posed by the board, whether the subject matter of claim 1 can be used in combination with the other reference, Wagner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">The decision of the board affirming the rejection of claims 10 and 16 is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1174-18\">.

The board\u2019s statement implicitly requires two substantial assumptions: (1) that \u00a7 102(g) can be used as a basis for refusing a patent in <em>ex parte </em>proceedings and (2) that prior \u201cinvention * * * by another\u201d is \u201cprior art\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 103.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1177-15\">.

We have considered the views expressed by the author of the board majority opinion herein in a concurring opinion in Ex parte Easpe, 156 USPQ 217 (1967), in a somewhat different factual situation. We think it necessary to distinguish between the right to a patent, which is only a right to exclude others, and a right to practice an invention or to be free of liability for infringement. If the law as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>it has been written by Congress creates anomalous situations, then it is for Congress to decide whether to change the law. In the present case we do not see the anomalous situation that was seen in <em>Raspe </em>since allowance of claims 10 and 16 would not give appellants coverage of Habicht\u2019s claim 1 compound.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
