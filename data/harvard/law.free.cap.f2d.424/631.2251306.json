Imbler v. Craven, 298 F.Supp. 795, 812 (C.D.Calif.1969). Respondent-appellant contends that the district court failed to give the factual findings of the state court (see In re Imbler, 60 Cal.2d 554, 35 Cal.Rptr. 293, 387 P.2d 6 (1963)), the weight to which they are entitled under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), as amended November 2, 1966, Pub.L. 89-711, \u00a7 2, 80 Stat. 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">The identical contention was advanced on petition for rehearing in the district court. It was rejected by the district court with this comment: \u201c[Tjhere is no major dispute as to the basic facts involved in this case. The events that transpired at petitioner\u2019s trial are clear; the only controversy that exists is as to so-called mixed questions of law and fact, and the conclusions of law as to federal questions. While this court gives the state findings of \u2018pure\u2019 facts great weight where appropriate, it is not required to adopt them. Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963). As to most of such facts (that is, as to what actually happened at the trial), this court has accepted the state findings. It has not, and cannot, accept as binding the state court\u2019s conclusions as to mixed questions of law and fact and as to the legal consequences of those facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">The district court\u2019s comment, so far as it went, accurately defined the court\u2019s obligation under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) to accept as presumptively correct the prior determination by the state court of a \u201cfactual issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">As the Supreme Court said in Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 309 n. 6, 83 S.Ct. 745, 755 n. 6, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963): \u201cBy \u2018issues of fact\u2019 we mean to refer to what are termed basic, primary, or historical facts: facts \u2018in the sense of a recital of external events and the credibility of their narrators * * *.\u2019 Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 506, 73 S.Ct. 397, 446, 97 L.Ed. 469 (opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter). So-called mixed questions of fact and law, which require the application of a legal standard to the historical-fact determinations, are not facts in this sense.\u201d Section 2254(d) was drafted by a committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States composed of judges fully cognizant of this then-recent decision. <em>See </em>1966 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, pp. 3663, 3665. There is no reason to suppose that they used the term \u201cfactual issue\u201d in any different sense in the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-15\">A close comparison of the opinions of the state court and the federal district court reveals that the court below accepted the \u201chistorical-fact determinations\u201d of the state court but reached different conclusions than the state court in applying federal constitutional standards to those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-16\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-17\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
