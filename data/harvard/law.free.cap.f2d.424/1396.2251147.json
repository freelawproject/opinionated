As filed, the protests were directed only to the internal revenue tax, which was levied at the rate of $10.50 per wine <em>gallon</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>\n</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>under section 5001(a) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and the importers claimed that the tax should have been levied on a proof gallon basis at 86% of $10.50, amounting to $9.03 per wine gallon. Subsequent to submission of the cases, the Customs Court, on motion of appellants and over objections by the government, allowed amendment of the protests by adding a paragraph which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-18\">Your assessment of tariff duties under item 168.45, Tariff Schedules of the United States, on the basis of wine gallons is illegal, null and void because it is contrary to headnote 3, Part 12, Schedule 1, T.S.

That the merchandise in issue is like bottled distilled spirits of equivalent proof manufactured in the United States and that the merchandise in protests No. 66/24918 is like the merchandise in protest No. 66/70446.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-26\">3. That a proof gallon of distilled spirits contains 50 percent of alcohol by volume, and a proof gallon is called 100 proof, that is, the number of proof represents twice the percentage of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-27\">4. That below-proof distilled spirits contain less than 50 percent of alcohol by volume and the number of proof represents twice the percentage of alcohol. For example, spirits containing 43 percent of alcohol are called 86 proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-28\">5. That in the United States, the practice of producers of domestic below-proof bottled distilled spirits is to withdraw spirits from bond at or above proof and have the taxes under sec. 5001, Internal Revenue Code, determined on the proof-gallon basis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>Thereafter water is added to reduce the proof to the desired level before bottling.

That the assessment on below-proof bottled distilled spirits on the basis of wine gallons requires payment of higher taxes than would be payable on the basis of proof gallons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-5\">7. That over 90 percent of domestic distilled spirits legally produced for consumption in the United States are withdrawn from bond in bulk at or above proof and are taxed on proof gallons.

The portions of that treaty pertinent here are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-5\">Article XVI (1 UST 788 at page 797):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-6\">1. Products of either Party shall be accorded, within the territories of the other Party, national and most-favored-nation treatment in all matters affecting internal taxation and sale, distribution, storage and use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-7\">Article XXI (1 UST 788 at page 801):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-8\">1. The term \u201cnational treatment\u201d means treatment accorded within the territories of a Party upon terms no less favorable than the treatment accorded therein, in like situations, to nationals, companies, products, vessels or other objects, as the case may be, of such Party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-9\">As to the spirits imported from Scotland, i. e., Scotch whiskey, appellants rely additionally on the treaty between the United States and Great Britain, 8 Stat. 228, entered into force July 3, 1815. Under that treaty, products of Great Britain coming into this country are to be accorded most-favored-nation treatment with respect to \u201cduties\u201d levied against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-10\">Appellants point to the practice, of domestic producers of below proof spirits, of withdrawing the spirits from bond in proof or over proof condition whereby they are subjected to tax on the proof gallon basis and then diluting them to below proof for bottling. The tax of $10.50 per proof gallon so paid is reflected in the cost of domestic spirits bottled at 86 proof, for example, to the extent of only 86 percent of $10.50, or $9.03 per wine gallon. If the foreign produced spirits are imported in bulk at proof or over proof and subsequently bottled at 86 proof, the tax is levied on the bulk spirits on the proof gallon basis just as with domestic spirits and the reflection of that tax on the ultimate bottled product amounts to $9.03 on the gallon just as that on the domestic bottled product. However, the instant imports, having been bottled in Ireland and Scotland, respectively, at 86 proof, were necessarily withdrawn from customs bond in below proof condition so that the resulting tax amounted to $10.50 per <em>bottled </em>gallon, or $1.47 per gallon more than the reflected tax on domestic or imported spirits withdrawn from bond in proof or over proof condition and then bottled in the United States at 86 proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-12\">Appellants\u2019 protests are grounded on the charge that the aforementioned circumstances result in discrimination against their imported below proof bottled spirits relative to below proof bottled domestic spirits. They state that the imported Irish whiskey is entitled to national treatment within the United States under Article XVI of the treaty with Ireland, and that, under Article XXI of that treaty, \u201cnational treatment\u201d means treatment upon terms no less favorable than the treatment accorded in like situations to products of the United States. With respect to the Scotch whiskey, appellants take the position that the most-favored-nation provisions of the British treaty of 1815 \u201coperate prospectively to encompass the benefits conferred upon products of Ireland in the National Treatment provisions of the Irish treaty, and they encompass specifically the tax here in dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-13\">The Customs Court accepted the premise, conceded here by appellee, that the imports from Great Britain are entitled under the most-favored-nation clause of the British treaty to whatever tax treatment is required with respect to the imports of Irish origin. It thus found, and we think correctly, that the ease comes down to whether assessment of taxes on the imported merchandise on the wine gallon basis under the stipulated circumstances is in violation of Articles XVI and XXI of the Irish treaty. It observed that the time at which the tax is determined fixes the basis of the assessment and found that \u201cthe issue turns on whether the stipulated circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>stances involve \u2018like situations\u2019 at the time of tax determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-4\">In disposing of that question, the court concluded that the <em>bottling </em>of the spirits has no bearing on the \u201ctaxing event\u201d to which both the domestic and imported products are subject, observing that Sections 5001(a) (1) and 5006(a) (1) are addressed to the spirits and not to the containers which house them. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-5\">We cannot conclude that the rate of taxation should be the same for both domestic and foreign spirits merely because both products end up in the hands of the consumer bottled and un-derproof. The criterion on which the taxing event takes place is, with respect to the domestic spirits, the withdrawal of the spirits from bond. Under the stipulated facts at bar the imported spirits are underproof at the time of tax determination, while the domestic spirits are at or overproof at such time. It is this difference in the nature of the taxed commodity which, in our view, militates against plaintiff\u2019s claim of discrimination in violation of treaty obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-6\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-7\"><em>* * * </em>Underproof imported spirits (bottled) and proof or overproof domestic spirits (bulk) at the time of tax determination do not involve \u201clike situations,\u201d and consequently, the provisions of Articles XVI and XXI of the Irish treaty are not applicable here. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1464-8\">The Customs Court relied on Bercut-Vandervoort &amp; Co. v. United States, 46 CCPA 28, C.A.D. 691 (1958), cert. den., 359 U.S. 953, 79 S.Ct. 739, 3 L.Ed.2d 760 (1959),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finding that case \u201cnot distinguished upon the relevant facts or the law from the case before the court\u201d and held it <em>stare decisis </em>herein. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-9\">* * * In Bercut-Vandervoort &amp; Co., Inc. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>the protest considered by the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals involved distilled spirits which were imported underproof in bottles and on which the internal revenue taxes were assessed on the wine gallon basis. In substance, the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade therein considered permitted, on imported products, \u201ca charge equivalent to an internal tax\u201d on like domestic products and prohibited the imported products of a contracting party from being \u201csubject, directly or indirectly, to internal taxes or other internal charges of any kind in excess of those applied, directly or indirectly, to like domestic products.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiGi\">Appellants concede that the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 before this court in <em>Bereut </em>are comparable to those of Section 5001(a) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 now before us. Also, they make no contention that the \u201cnational treatment\u201d provision of the Irish treaty is in any way more restrictive than the similar requirements, expressed in different terms, of GATT which were found not to be violated in <em>Bereut.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1464-12\">It is also acknowledged by appellants that Sec. 5001 appears on its face to be non-discriminatory in that it establishes two classifications \u2014 proof (and above proof) spirits and below proof spirits\u2014 and applies equally to both without regard to whether they are domestic or imported. Rather, they urge that it is examination of other provisions of the law, not considered in <em>Bereut </em>which shows that Sec. 5001 is in fact discriminatory as applied in <em>Bereut </em>and here. Those provisions are (a) (1) Sec. 5006, I.R.C., <em>supra, </em>which provides that the tax shall be determined when the spirits are withdrawn from bond; (2) Sec. 5233, I.R.C., which provides that spirits cannot be bottled in bond below 100 proof (except spirits for export which are not subject to tax); and (3) Sec. 206(a) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>27 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(a), which allows only bottled spirits to be sold to the ultimate consumer. Appellants urge that these provisions were not considered in <em>Bercut </em>and that Sec. 5006 had no counterpart in the 1939 Act that the court had before it in that case, and regard them as establishing that the law does not permit domestic <em>bottled </em>spirits to be below proof at the time of tax determination. Since bottled imported spirits are the only bottled spirits to which the wine gallon tax can legally apply, they reason, the assessment of the wine gallon tax of Sec. 5001 on their bottled underproof imports is discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-5\">Her Majesty\u2019s Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland submitted a brief in support of the appeal as <em>amicus curiae </em>and was represented by counsel at oral hearing. <em>Amicus </em>\u201caccepts the premise of the Customs Court that <em>Bercut </em>\u2018is not distinguished [from the present case] upon the relevant facts or the law,\u2019 \u201d but it \u201cquestions the correctness of the conclusions drawn therefrom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-6\">More specifically, <em>amicus </em>points out that the United States undertook the obligations of GATT <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> subject to the Protocol of Provisional Application. That Protocol accepted Part II of the agreement, which part includes Article III embodying the restriction against imported products being subjected to internal taxes or other internal charges in excess of those applied to like domestic products, \u201cto the fullest extent not inconsistent with existing legislation.\u201d <em>Amicus </em>then concludes that, since the wine gallon provision was existing legislation, the same result could have been reached in <em>Bercut </em>on the basis that the Protocol rendered the national treatment provision of Part II of GATT (Article III) ineffective instead of on the grounds on which it was decided \u2014 that the national treatment provision was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-14\">As evidence of error on the grounds on which <em>Bercut </em>actually was decided, <em>amicus </em>refers to the acknowledgment in paragraph 1 of Article III of GATT that internal taxes should not be applied to imported or domestic products so as to \u201cafford protection to domestic production.\u201d It then refers to proceedings and documents concerned with the proposed Customs Simplification Act of 1951 (H. R. 1535). That material<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> indicates that the executive branch of the government proposed the elimination of the wine gallon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and that certain officials apparently regarded those provisions in derogation of the intent of GATT to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>avoid internal tax discrimination against imported goods. <em>Amicus </em>and appellants also point to testimony of certain representatives of domestic producers of spirits, and appellants also to testimony of the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, opposing the elimination of the wine gallon provision as indicating that such elimination would amount effectively to a reduction in the import duties for foreign shippers of cased whiskey. <em>Amicus </em>also asserts that, besides itself, \u201cthe Common Market, consisting of France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands,\u201d and Canada have \u201cprotested the United States excise tax system for spirits imported in bottles (wine gallon) as being contrary to Article III of GATT.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\">We think the Customs Court was plainly correct in regarding the decision in <em>Bercut </em>as compelling the conclusion it reached here. Not only is the language in Sec. 5001 equivalent to that in Sec. 2800 of the 1939 Act considered in the earlier case but the covenants in the Irish treaty are no more restrictive than those of GATT which were considered in <em>Bercut.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1466-5\">Appellants\u2019 reliance here on Sec. 5006 and Sec. 5233 of the I.R.C. of 1954 and Sec. 206(a) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act as establishing that the law does not permit domestic bottled spirits to be below proof at the time of tax determination does not demonstrate that the present case is distinguished from <em>Bercut </em>in any significant respect. As a matter of fact, it was assumed ar-guendo at the outset in <em>Bercut </em>that it was the \u201cuniversal practice\u201d of domestic producers to withdraw spirits from bond when over proof, and thus pay tax on the proof gallon basis, before diluting them. Thus <em>Bercut </em>was in no way premised on a view that domestic under-proof spirits would or could ever be subject to the internal revenue tax in that condition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1466-9\">Neither do.we find any significance in the contention of <em>amicus </em>and <em>Bercut </em>might have been decided with the same result on the basis of the adherence of the United States to GATT having been provisional under the Protocol of Provisional Application. The case was actually decided on the broader rationale that application of the wine gallon provisions of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code did not discriminate against imports of bottled under proof spirits under the national treatment provisions of GATT.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-10\">The decision in <em>Bercut </em>was reached after thorough consideration of the precedents, including the only case which appellants now advance holding that underproof spirits should be subjected to internal revenue tax on the proof gallon, rather than wine gallon, basis. That case, Parrott &amp; Co. v. United States, 156 F.2d 943 (C.A. 9, 1946) involved interpretation of a provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1918 providing that there be levied, collected and paid \u201cupon articles coming into the United States from the Virgin Islands, a tax equal to the internal revenue tax imposed in the United States upon like articles of domestic manufacture.\u201d The court found the quoted provision to require that underproof rum, which was alleged to have been distilled in the Virgin Islands at more than 100 proof, be taxed, <em>not as an importation, </em>but \u201cas if produced in the United States.\u201d We think the court in <em>Bercut </em>was correct in distinguishing that case, where the sole issue was interpretation of language of the tax law and that language was entirely different from the prohibitory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>language of Article III, section 2, of the trade agreement involved in Bercut.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">The arguments that the unsuccessful attempt of officials of the executive branch of the government in 1951 to persuade Congress to eliminate the wine gallon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, with certain of the officials urging the change as a means to insure compliance with GATT, and that persons opposing the proposed change referred to it as amounting to a reduction in the protection afforded the domestic (including Puerto Rican) spirits industry, are not considered sufficiently indicative of discrimination to justify overruling <em>Bercut. </em>It is of course apparent how foreign producers would find the elimination of the wine gallon provision desirable and it is also understandable that some United States government officials might consider it in the best interests of international trade cooperation to do away with an aspect of the Internal Revenue Code that may well be an irritant to foreign trade negotiators. It is significant to note that there is no history of the GATT negotiations of record to show that that treaty was regarded as compelling the abrogation of a United States tax provision having a long prior history.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> What is of record does not clearly establish that <em>Bercut </em>was in error, and therefore the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>dictates that we should not reverse ourselves. See R. J. Saunders &amp; Co., Inc. v. United States, 54 CCPA 29, C.A.D. 898 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-6\">Referring specifically to the present case, the classification of spirits for internal revenue purposes in the two categories of proof gallon and wine gallon amounts but to a continuation of a practice long established at the time Congress passed the 1954 Internal Revenue Act specifically continuing it. The Irish treaty was already in force at that time. It is apparent that Congress had knowledge through the hearings on the Customs Simplification Act of 1951, discussed at length by appellants and <em>ami-cus, </em>of the controversy relating to the application of the wine gallon tax to bottled imported underproof spirits. In those circumstances, we cannot conceive that Congress, in including in the 1954 Internal Revenue Code, Sec. 7852(d), denying effect to provisions \u201ccontrary to any treaty obligation,\u201d intended it to apply to the express provision for the wine gallon rate in Sec. 5001.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-11\">The rationale of the protests against the customs duty imposed on the imports under item 168.45, Tariff Schedules of the United States, depends upon the proposition that the quantities of spirits on which the internal revenue tax is applied should be adjusted<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> because the applications of the latter tax on the wine gallon basis was improper. Since we find no basis for such an adjustment, the propriety of the Customs Court\u2019s allowing amendment of the protests need not be considered in reaching the conclusion that the protests against the customs duties were properly disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-12\">The judgment of the Customs Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1461-19\">.
