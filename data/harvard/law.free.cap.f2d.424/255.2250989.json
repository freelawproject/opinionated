For this he was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-23\">The sole challenge of this appeal is to the jurisdiction of the court below on the theory that appellant was not in federal custody when he escaped. The contention lacks merit. Since appellant was being conveyed under valid process of the federal government, he was in federal custody. Derengowski v. United States, 404 F.2d 778 (8th Cir. 1968), cert. den., 394 U.S. 1024, 89 S.Ct. 1640, 23 L.Ed.2d 49. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
