Wood with directions to prepare and file his opinion on the issues of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment and defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment under the order of reference and Rule 99(c) [since September 1, 1969, Rule 166(c)]. The commissioner has done so in an opinion and report filed on August 19, 1969, wherein such facts as are necessary to the opinion are set forth. Plaintiffs requested that the court review the commissioner\u2019s report and opinion. Defendant urged that the court adopt the report as its decision in this case. The case has been submitted to the court on oral argument of counsel and the briefs of the parties. Since the court agrees with the opinion and recommended conclusion of the trial commissioner, it hereby adopts the same as the basis for its judgment in this case as hereinafter set forth. Therefore, to the extent that plaintiffs\u2019 claims arose in Lease Areas 3-6, the claims are barred by unconditional releases; their state sales tax claims are devoid of merit; to the extent indicated, defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted, plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment is denied and the petition is dismissed. Plaintiffs are allowed 30 days from the date hereof to file an amended petition asserting any claims (except those dismissed) they may have arising out of Lease Areas 1 and 2; absent a timely amended petition, plaintiffs\u2019 petition shall be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-15\">OPINION OF COMMISSIONER</p>\n<author id=\"b1435-16\">WOOD, Commissioner:</author>\n<p id=\"b1435-17\">This case, before the court on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment and defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, grew out of a 1959 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>Capehart Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contract between plaintiffs, joint venturers, and the Department of the Army for the construction of 856 housing units at Fort Lewis, Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 supplemental petition claims (1) the sum of $538,491.20, in reimbursement for retail sales taxes allegedly paid to the State of Washington at the rate of 4 percent of the total contract price, or, alternatively, the portion thereof ($90,-197.28) said to be attributable to an increase in the state retail sales tax rate after the \u201ccontract date\u201d; and (2) the further sum of approximately $64,000, on several claims based on alleged \u201cunilateral direction and improper inspection * * * faulty design * * * [and] delay by the Government * * <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1436-6\">In its answer, defendant denies any obligation to reimburse plaintiffs for state retail sales taxes, and, as one of several affirmative defenses, avers that unconditional releases executed by plaintiffs at the mortgage closings of four of the six lease areas into which the project was divided discharged defendant from all claims arising out of the areas (Lease Areas 3, 4, 5 and 6) to which they applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-7\">Plaintiffs, by motion for partial summary judgment \u201cbased upon the files and records in this cause * * <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ask the court, <em>inter alia, </em>to hold the releases \u201cinvalid as a defense,\u201d and to grant plaintiffs summary judgment for $90,197.28 (plus interest) on their alternative sales tax claim. Defendant has cross-moved for summary judgment dismissing the petition, asserting that plaintiffs\u2019 sales tax claims lack merit, and that the \u201cremaining claims are barred by general releases * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For the reasons hereinafter set forth, it is concluded that defendant\u2019s said contentions are correct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1436-18\">At the outset, the parties argue at some length whether, under Len Co. &amp; Associates v. United States, 385 F.2d 438, 181 Ct.Cl. 29 (1967), the \u201cvalidity and effect of the releases\u201d and the sales tax claims were subject to administrative determination, or are matters of which the court has \u201coriginal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>Fort Sill Associates v. United States, 183 Ct.Cl. 301 (1968). They also differ as to whether the ASBCA decision sustaining the releases was a ruling on a question of law or fact. <em>Cf. </em>Aircraft Associates &amp; Mfg. Co. v. United States, 357 F.2d 373, 174 Ct.Cl. 886 (1966). There are, too, a number of other related contentions having as their common source the provisions of the Wunderlich Act, 68 Stat. 81, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 321, 322 (1964).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>The troublesome problems thus raised in the briefs need neither be delineated at any length nor here resolved. The parties agree that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the release and sales tax issues. There is no reason not to accept their assessment of the record in this respect. Whether the releases bar plaintiffs\u2019 claims as to Lease Areas 3-6, and the claims concerning state sales taxes, can be decided, on cross-motions for summary judgment, without any expedition into this treacherous area. <em>Cf. </em>Chase and Rice, Inc. v. United States, 354 F.2d 318, 321, 173 Ct.Cl. 740, 745 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-5\">The Releases</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-6\">The invitation for bids on the Fort Lewis project, issued December 18, 1958, advised prospective bidders in part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap3\">* * * If it is desired or necessary to obtain more than one mortgage in order to finance the project, it will be permissible * * * to subdivide the project into two or more units for mortgaging purposes. * * * If such subdivision is proposed, the bidder will submit a suggested division of the project together with a breakdown of the bid into comparable units which will be subject to review and approval by all parties concerned. In accordance with 12 U.S.C. 1748b, the total cost of work payable out of any one mortgage proceeds may exceed the statutory limits of an average of $16,500 per housing unit, providing that the principal obligations of all mortgages effected pursuant to this invitation for bids do not exceed an average of $16,500 per housing unit. If such subdivision of the project is contemplated, there should be submitted information showing whether it is intended to treat each mortgage unit as a separable project to be turned over to the Government as completed on a progressive schedule and, if so, the number of mortgagor-builder corporations to be formed for the purpose of holding separate leases and mortgages which will pass to the Government pursuant to the completion schedule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1437-9\">The date set for opening of bids was February 5, 1959. Plaintiffs\u2019 bid (of $13,463,280) was successful. Plaintiffs proposed to (and did) divide the project into six lease areas (Lease Areas 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), each of which was given a separate FHA project number. Plaintiffs also caused to be incorporated six mortgagor-builder corporations (Ft. Lewis Capehart, Inc., No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, No. 5, and No. 6). The housing contract, between plaintiffs, defendant, and each of the six mortgagor-builder corporations, was executed May 19, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-10\">Article IV(8) divided \u201cthe total amount of the contract\u201d in specified sums, \u201camong the six mortgagor-builder corporations for work which each of said corporations is responsible in accordance with Article I, Paragraph (2.1) * * * \u201d of the contract (\u201cScope of Work\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-11\">Paragraph (2.1), Article I, contained six separate subparagraphs, each pertaining to a different mortgagor-builder (and a correspondingly numbered lease area). Ft. Lewis Capehart Inc., No. 1, \u201cshall be responsible, in accordance with the Building Loan Agreement required by Article V hereof, for all construction within Lease Area 1 * * The five other mortgagor-builders and lease areas were linked in like manner.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ak5\">Article IV(9) provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-12\">Upon completion of the improvements, including all landscape requirements, the balance due the eligible builder hereunder shall be payable to the eligible builder upon the expiration of 30 days from the date of final completion and acceptance of the project <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>by the mortgagor-builder, the Contrac-ing Officer, the Commissioner and the mortgagee; provided, however, that the mortgagor-builder, the Contracting Officer or mortgagee may withhold approval of final payment until after the expiration of any period which laborers, subcontractors, and material-men may have for filing notice of mechanics\u2019 liens.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">Article I (\u201cDefinitions\u201d) of the contract\u2019s General Provisions provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-5\">(g) \u2018Mortgagor-builder\u2019 means each and all of the corporations formed by the eligible builder in accordance with his bid and signatory to this contract; though used in the singular throughout the contract, \u2018mortgagor-builder\u2019 shall mean each corporation so formed individually or all such corporations jointly, as the sense may dictate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-6\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUP\">Various terms used in this contract in the singular form shall be construed in the plural where by reason of the formation of more than one mortgagor-builder corporation, the execution of more than one lease, mortgage note, mortgage, Building Loan Agreement, Trade Payment Breakdown, etc., such term of logical necessity applies to more than one entity or instrument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1438-7\">The contract General Provisions included (and this case centers on) the following release clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-8\">14. Payment to Eligible Builder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AugM\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-9\">(d) Upon completion and acceptance of all work required hereunder, the amounts due the eligible builder under this Housing Contract from mortgage proceeds will be paid by the mortgagor-builder. Final amounts shall be payable after the eligible builder shall have furnished the mortgagor-builder and the Department with a release, if required, of all claims against the Department and/or the mortgagor-builder arising under and by virtue of this Housing Contract, other than such claims, if any, as may be specifically excepted by the eligible builder from the operation of the release in amounts stated herein. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1438-11\">The mortgage closings of the six lease areas occurred as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-12\">Lease Area 5: May 19, 1960</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ajl-dedup-0\">Lease Area 4: June 30, 1960</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ad5-dedup-0\">Lease Area 3: August 22, 1960</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adn\">Lease Area 6: August 22, 1960</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1K\">Lease Area 1: January 4, 1961</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"amc-dedup-1\">Lease Area 2: January 4, 1961.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1438-14\">At the closing of Lease Areas 3, 4, 5, and 6, plaintiffs were represented by an attorney (not present counsel) who had formerly been employed by FHA, and who was well qualified in Capehart Act matters. The procedure for the closing of Capehart Act contracts prescribed by Army Regulations 210-46 was followed. On each occasion, at the appropriate place in the proceeding, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney produced and delivered an unconditional release he himself had prepared, and the release was accepted as tendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-15\">The form of the release in Lease Area 5 was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-16\">Date: May 19, 1960</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-17\">FHA Project No. 127-81027-Army 15</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-18\">FT. LEWIS CAPEHART, INC., NO. 5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-19\">Contract No. DA-45-108-ENG-4800</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-20\">RELEASE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1438-21\">The work under Contract No. DA-45-108-ENG-4800 dated May 19, 1959; between the United States of America; FT. LEWIS CAPEHART INC., NO. 5, a Delaware Corporation; and the undersigned, INLAND EMPIRE BUILDERS, INC., J. C. BOES-PFLUG CONSTRUCTION CO., and McLAUGHLIN, INC., a joint venture; having been satisfactorily completed and accepted as set forth in the \u2018Determination of Completion and Notice of Final Acceptance' of even date herewith, the undersigned does hereby re-mise, release and forever discharge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>United States of America and FT. LEWIS CAPEHART INC., NO. 5, their officers, agents, successors and assigns, jointly and severally, of and from any and all claims and demands whatsoever arising out of or by virtue of said contract, except as follows: ******</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1439-5\">No exceptions were stated. At the closings of Lease Areas 4, 3, and 6, plaintiffs also executed releases identical in form (differing only as to date, FHA project number, and the mortgagor-builder). At the end of each of the latter three releases, plaintiffs added the word \u201cnone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-6\">Despite the fact that construction work in Lease Areas 3, 4, 5, and 6 had (to use the ASBCA\u2019s language) \u201cgenerated a number of circumstances * * * which are the bases of the current claims,\u201d plaintiffs made no claims for additional compensation until after the mortgage closings in these four lease areas.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1439-7\">Plaintiffs were incurring, and until closing would continue to incur, substantial interest charges. Plaintiffs\u2019 representatives had gained the impression that the presentation of claims would result in delays in closings, pending the contracting officer\u2019s decision on the claims. The costs of the claimed additional work were not segregated by lease area, and since some of this \u201cadditional work\u201d pertained to more than one area and the work was pursued \u201cright up to the time of closing,\u201d \u201cclaims relating thereto, to that extent, were incapable, prior to completion, of full and exact statement * * * <em>\u201d </em>'<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-9\">These considerations, and the following, prompted [plaintiffs\u2019] attorney-in-fact, to make the \u2018business decision,\u2019 at the first closing, to sign an unconditional release, a practice followed at the closing of three other areas. In an affidavit received in this proceeding he said he\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-14\">&lt; * * * was further under the impression that, as only one contract was involved, it was unnecessary to make any formal claim until the completion of the entire contract. Affiant is not aware of any provision in the contract documents which required that claim releases be executed by the prime contractor for each lease area or for the entire contract.\u2019 [1963 BCA 3930 at p. 19,488]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1439-15\">In these circumstances, the ASBCA held, plaintiffs\u2019 contract was \u201cnot only severable by its nature but expressly so\u201d in some respects; that it was \u201ccompletely unrealistic to say that the contract Release provisions contemplated one release transaction upon completion and acceptance of all of the work in all of the lease areas\u201d; that, as the contract called for the giving of releases, if required, the releases, were not unsupported by consideration; and that, as to Lease Areas 3, 4, 5, and 6, plaintiffs were barred by the releases \u201cinsofar as any then existing rights are concerned.\u201d 1963 BCA If 3930 at p. 19,489.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1439-16\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the releases are ineffective to bar the claims in suit starts with the sound observation that a valid release must be supported by consideration. Paccon, Inc. v. United States, 399 F.2d 162, 185 Ct.Cl. 24 (1968). Their principal position is that, for a number of reasons, the releases executed as to Lease Areas 3-6 are not so supported, and therefore do not bar their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-17\">First, plaintiffs contend that, in exchange for the execution of these re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>leases, they received only monies to which they were otherwise entitled; thus, they urge, notwithstanding the rule of United States v. William Cramp &amp; Sons Co., 206 U.S. 118, 27 S.Ct. 676, 51 L.Ed. 983 (1907), the releases lack consideration and should be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-4\">In Cramp <em>&amp; Sons, </em>a contract between the United States and the claimant called for the execution of a release of all claims prior to final payment, and such a release was given. In disposing of essentially the same argument that plaintiffs here advance, the Supreme Court held that <em>(Id., </em>at 128, 27 S.Ct. at 678):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1440-5\">No payment of moneys not due is necessary to sustain this release. It is under seal, and <em>the contract is itself full consideration, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1440-6\">Decisions of this court that a release called for by a contract is not without consideration, even though the contractor receives only amounts otherwise due, are legion. <em>E. g., </em>J. G. Watts Constr. Co. v. United States, 161 Ct.Cl. 801 (1963); <em>see also </em>H.L.C. &amp; Associates Constr. Co. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>fn 1; Hellander v. United States, 178 F.Supp. 932, 147 Ct.Cl. 550, (1959); Houdaille Industries, Inc. v. United States, 151 F.Supp. 298, 138 Ct.Cl. 301 (1957); A. L. Coupe Constr. Co. v. United States, 139 F.Supp. 61, 134 Ct.Cl. 392 (1956), cert. denied 352 U.S. 834, 77 S.Ct. 52, 1 L.Ed.2d 53 (1956). Plaintiffs recognize the holdings in <em>Watts </em>and other cases following <em>Cramp &amp; Sons, </em>but contend that the \u201cbasic rule, founded * * * on unnecessary dicta, should be reexamined and abandoned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-9\">What plaintiffs term \u201cunnecessary dicta\u201d cannot properly be so characterized. \u201c * * * every proposition of law enunciated, if actually involved in the facts of the case, is to be taken as a principle of law <em>stare decisis.\u201d </em>Maddox v. United States, 5 Ct.Cl. 372, 376-377 (1869), aff\u2019d 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 58, 21 L.Ed. 61 (1872). The \u201cbasic rule\u201d of <em>Cramp &amp; Sons </em>is sound and settled law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-14\">In asking the court to \u201cabrogate * * * the contract release rule,\u201d plaintiffs also assert that the \u201cmanifest unfairness and abuseability [sic] of the contract release requirement\u201d should make unenforceable any such release \u201cunless in fact sustained by a consideration as usually understood\u201d; that the doctrine is anomalous, unjustified, and unfair; and that defendant should be precluded from having such an advantage. These assertions are wholly unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-15\">When, in accordance with contract provisions, execution of a release is called for, a determination whether there are any unresolved differences between the contracting parties, and a delineation of any such differences, are legitimate and desirable ends. <em>See </em>J. G. Watts Constr. Co. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>161 Ct.Cl. at 810. Where a government contractor has, but fails to exercise, the right to reserve claims from the operation of such a release,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it is neither improper nor unfair to invoke the principle that, absent some vitiating circumstance, the contractor \u201ccannot thereafter successfully maintain a suit * * * based upon events which occurred prior to the execution of the release.\u201d H.L.C. &amp; Associates Constr. Co. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>367 F.2d at 590, 176 Ct.Cl. at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-18\">Sprinkled throughout plaintiffs\u2019 contentions that the releases lack consideration is another, separate, line of argument. Plaintiffs assert that excepting claims from the releases executed at the closings of Lease Areas 3-6 would have delayed the closings in these areas to their substantial economic detriment, by way of continuing interest charges and delay in receipt of amounts due, and that the releases are therefore invalid because compelled by \u201cconstructive duress,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>\u201ceconomic duress,\u201d or \u201ceconomic coercion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-5\">Plaintiffs readily concede that the \u201cconstructive duress of the arrangement in the present case\u201d cannot be equated to the \u201cextreme coercion\u201d depicted in Aircraft Associates &amp; Mfg. Co. v. United States, <em>supra,. </em>Plaintiffs urge, however, that the basic reasoning of that case is applicable, and that the result there reached should also be reached here, particularly since defendant \u201cprematurely required releases as a condition of paying funds otherwise due in any event,\u201d and the releases are an \u201cunearned windfall\u201d to defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On the record before the court (whether or not the court has \u201coriginal and de novo jurisdiction\u201d to hold that the releases involved in this case are vitiated by duress or coercion) <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> plaintiffs\u2019 conclusion is not a tenable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-6\">In Fruhauf Southwest Garment Co. v. United States, 111 F.Supp. 945, 951, 126 Ct.Cl. 51, 62 (1953), this court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1441-7\">* * * In order to substantiate the allegation of economic duress or business compulsion, the plaintiff must go beyond the mere showing of a reluctance to accept and of financial embarrassment. There must be a showing of acts on the part of the defendant which produced these two factors. The assertion of duress must be proven to have been the result of the defendant\u2019s conduct and not by the plaintiff\u2019s necessities. * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1441-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1441-9\">* * * the mere stress of business conditions will not constitute duress where the defendant was not responsible for those circumstances, * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1441-12\">Measured by the decisional law and the record summarized above, plaintiffs\u2019 claim of duress or coercion must be rejected. Fruhauf Southwest Garment Co. v. United States, <em>supra; see also </em>Alloy Products Corp. v. United States, 302 F.2d 528, 157 Ct.Cl. 376 (1962); Harvey-Whipple, Inc. v. United States, 342 F.2d 48, 169 Ct.Cl. 689 (1965). As plaintiffs recognize, Aircraft Associates &amp; Mfg. Co. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>and this case present markedly different situations; that case is inapposite here. <em>See also </em>Urban Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>again involving quite different circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-13\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second lack of consideration argument is that no release was required by the Fort Lewis Capehart contract until final acceptance of and final payment for the entire project. Accordingly, it is asserted, the releases executed as to Lease Areas 3-6 were premature, not contractually required, unsupported by consideration, and ineffective to bar claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-14\">As the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals held (and defendant here contends) this narrow construction of the contract \u2014 as requiring only a single release at the conclusion of all work \u2014 is an unjustified one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-15\">Under the contract, responsibility for construction, and the total contract price, were divided. The contract contemplated the separate phasing-out of the six mortgagor-builders. The mortgagor-builders, \u201cformed for the purpose of holding separate leases and mortgages * * * to pass to the Government pursuant to the completion schedule,\u201d were called for by the Invitation for Bids only if \u201cit is intended to treat each mortgage unit as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>separable project to be turned over to the Government as completed * * Final payment was prescribed within a definable period after completion and acceptance of each of the separable projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 present construction of the release clause takes into account none of these provisions, and ignores the \u201cDefinitions\u201d clause (quoted <em>supra) </em>as well. In light of all of its provisions, the contract provided plainly that, upon the completion and acceptance of all work required in each of the several lease areas, a release of all claims against defendant and the mortgagor-builder responsible for that lease area, \u201cother than such claims, if any, as may be specifically excepted * * * \u201d would be given \u201cif required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-5\">In support of the argument that only one release was required by the Fort Lewis contract, and that at the conclusion of all work on the entire project, plaintiffs emphasize (1) segments of the release clause, and (2) language in the Invitation for Bids permitting the total cost of work payable out of any one mortgage proceeds to exceed the statutory limits of an average of $16,500 per housing unit, provided \u201cthat the principal obligations of all mortgages effected pursuant to this invitation for bids do not exceed an average of $16,500 per housing unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-6\">The release clause, read as a whole, and particularly in the context of the entire contract, is to the contrary. And, in the light of other language in the Invitation for Bids, the contract provisions, and the conduct of the parties, the quoted Invitation for Bids language does not aid plaintiffs\u2019 case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1442-7\">In short, releases were contractually required as to Lease Areas, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and those releases are not unsupported by consideration. United States v. William Cramp &amp; Sons Co., <em>supra; </em>J. G. Watts Constr. Co. v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1442-10\">This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that, at the closing of each of these lease areas, plaintiffs\u2019 then attorney produced and delivered, and defendant accepted, a release he himself had prepared. That attorney had formerly been employed by FHA, and was well qualified in Capehart Act matters. Clearly, plaintiffs then were of the view that a release was due at each closing. This practical interpretation of the contract by the parties, at a time when it was not a subject of controversy, is entitled to great, if not controlling, weight. Chase &amp; Rice, Inc. v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Blanchard v. United States, 347 F.2d 268, 273, 171 Ct.Cl. 559, 566 (1965); Crown Coat Front Co. v. United States, 292 F.2d 290, 292-293, 154 Ct.Cl. 613, 617 (1961).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1442-11\">Finally, plaintiffs assert that they \u201cshould be permitted to rescind the releases under equitable principles.\u201d This contention is supported only by dictum from United Fruit Co. v. United States, 186 F.2d 890, 896 (1st Cir. 1951), concerning a \u201cgratuitous\u201d release held to be \u201ca nullity for lack of consideration.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 894. That case has no relevance here. Plaintiffs make no showing of entitlement to any relief in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-12\">In H.L.C. &amp; Associates Constr. Co. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>fn. 1, a Capehart Act contractor executed releases as to two of the three mortgage areas into which the project was divided. The court held that the release executed with respect to one of the mortgage areas contained a reservation \u201cso broad as to make the release virtually meaningless,\u201d and \u201creleased nothing,\u201d but that the unconditional release executed with respect to the other mortgage area barred the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>sued on. <em>Id., </em>367 F.2d at 591-593. 176 Ct.Cl. at 295, 297-298.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1443-4\">As plaintiffs observe, the contract before the court in that case contained a specific clause for the \u201cseverability of contract as to each project.\u201d while plaintiffs\u2019 contract contains no such specific clause. In light of plaintiffs\u2019 contract as a whole, however, what the court there held is equally applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-5\">The situation with respect to [Lease Areas 3-6] is therefore identical to the situation upon which the decision in <em>Watts </em>turned:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1443-6\">* * * there is nothing in the * * * facts which serve * * * to place this ease in any of these * * * [excepted] categories. All we have is the simple case of a contractor who completed his contract, and, as provided by the contract, received his final payment upon the execution of a full release, and then * * * later attempts to assert claims. * * * [H.L.C. &amp; Associates Constr. Co. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>367 F.2d at 591-592, 176 Ct.Cl. at 295.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1443-12\">To the extent that plaintiffs\u2019 claims arose in Lease Areas 3-6, they are barred by valid and unconditional releases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-13\">The State Sales Tax Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-14\">Article 41 of the contract\u2019s General Provisions pertained to \u201cFederal, State and Local Taxes (Except Real and Personal Property Taxes).\u201d The provisions of Article 41 (the only contract Article relating to this issue) are set forth in Appendix A, attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-15\">Article 41(a) defined the \u201ccontract date,\u201d for Article 41 purposes, as \u201cthe date set for the opeing of bids\u201d (February 5,1959).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Article 41(b) stated that, except as otherwise provided in the contract \u201cthe contract price includes all Federal, State and local taxes * * * in effect and applicable to this Housing Contract on the contract date, except taxes from which the eligible builder or the transactions or property covered by this Housing Contract are then exempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-19\">On February 5, 1959, the state retail sales tax rate was \u201cequal to three and one-third per cent of the selling price.\u201d Effective April 1, 1959, the tax rate was increased to 4 percent, and, plaintiffs say, the full 4 percent tax rate was applied to the entire contract price, requiring that plaintiffs pay to the State of Washington some $559,165.14. A portion of this amount (assertedly $90,197.28) was \u201cassessed against the contract price in addition to the tax in effect and applicable on the contract date.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that the court should grant summary judgment in their favor for that portion of their sales tax payment attributable to the April 1, 1959, tax rate increase. Defendant\u2019s position is that any recovery on the state sales tax claims is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-20\">Before the Board, plaintiffs contended (1) that \u201cnotwithstanding the provisions of the contract [defendant] as owner remains responsible for the tax and is obligated to reimburse * * * \u201d plaintiffs therefor by reason of Washington State law, and (2) that, \u201cin any event, under the provisions of the contract, [defendant] is liable to [plaintiffs] for the amount of any increase in tax from the applicable rate on the contract date * * * \u201d The Board held that, insofar as the claims were ascribable to Lease Areas 3-6, they were barred by releases, but that, releases aside, the claims were \u201cwithout merit.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>In this court, plaintiffs in effect concede that defendant is not liable to them with respect to state retail sales taxes in effect and applicable to the contract on February 5, 1959.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As to the alternative claim, however, plaintiffs have first asserted that Article 41(b) can mean only that defendant intended plaintiffs <em>not </em>to \u201cbe responsible for additional taxes or tax increases\u201d after the contract date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-4\">This argument founders on Article 41 (c). That provision directs an increase in contract price should plaintiffs have to pay or bear the burden of \u201can increase in rate of any <em>Federal </em>tax or duty,\u201d and a decrease in contract price should plaintiffs not have to pay or bear the burden of any <em>\u201cFederal\u2019\u2019 </em>tax or duty which was to be pursuant to Article 41(b), or which was included in the contract price. Article 41(c) (4) makes it plain that any such adjustment under other provisions of Article 41 shall not extend to \u201cany State and local taxes.\u201d On a fair reading of Article 41, just as plaintiffs would be entitled to benefit from a reduction in such taxes subsequent to February 5, 1959,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> plaintiffs bear responsibility for any increases in state sales taxes subsequent to that date. <em>Cf. </em>Duhame v. United States, 119 F.Supp. 192, 127 Ct.Cl. 679 (1954); Wolf, State and Local Taxation, 36 (Government Contracts Monograph No. 5, 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-5\">In their reply brief, plaintiffs urge that, absent Article 41(b), defendant, as \u201cbuyer,\u201d would have been required by state law to pay \u201call of the taxes assessed against the project, even without any contract language agreeing to do so\u201d ; that Article 41(b) merely \u201cexcuses\u201d defendant from having to pay that portion of the state retail sales taxes in effect and applicable to the contract on February 5, 1959; and that, by reason of \u201cthe contract provision and the law of the State of Washington,\u201d defendant must at least bear the burden of any increase in state retail sales taxes after the contract date. This line of argument must also be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-12\">In Murray v. State of Washington, 62 Wash.2d 619, 384 P.2d 337 (1963), appeal dismissed, Inland Empire Builders, Inc. v. Washington, 378 U.S. 580, 84 S.Ct. 1910, 12 L.Ed.2d 1035 (1964), several contractors (including plaintiffs) sued to recover state retail sales taxes paid under protest, and to enjoin assessment of the state retail sales tax, in connection with the construction of Capehart Act housing at military installations in the State of Washington. The litigation, involving the contract presently before this court, resulted in holdings that, under Washington law, the mortgagor-builder corporations were the \u201cbuyers\u201d obligated to pay the state retail sales tax to the contractors; that the mortgagor-builder corporations were not agents of the United States; that the sales tax was properly levied; that the contractors \u201cwere obligated to collect the tax from the mortgagor-builder corporations\u201d; and that, having failed to collect the tax, the contractors were liable for it. All else aside,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on state law as imposing any responsibility for state retail sales taxes on defendant is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-13\">In sum, plaintiffs are not entitled to reimbursement for state retail sales taxes in effect on the \u201ccontract date,\u201d or for subsequently increased state retail sales taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-14\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-15\">Therefore, to the extent plaintiffs\u2019 claims arose in Lease Areas 3-6, the claims are barred by unconditional releases; their state sales tax claims are devoid of merit; to the extent indicated, defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted, plaintiffs\u2019 motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>partial summary judgment is denied and the petition is dismissed. Plaintiffs are allowed thirty (30) days from the date of this decision within which to file an amended petition asserting any claims (except those dismissed) they may have arising out of Lease Areas 1 and 2; and, absent a timely amended petition, plaintiffs\u2019 petition shall be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-5\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-6\">\n<em>Excerpt from General Provisions, Housing Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-7\">41.

The contract price also shall be correspondingly decreased (and in the same manner) if the eligible builder, through his fault or negligence or his failure to follow instructions of the Contracting Officer, is required to pay or bear the burden, or does not obtain a refund or drawback of any such Federal tax, duty, interest or penalty. Interest earned on refunded Federal taxes shall inure to the benefit of the Department to the extent that such interest was earned after the eligible builder was paid or reimbursed from the proceeds of the mortgage for such taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-13\">(3) Invoices or vouchers covering any increase or decrease in the contract price pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall set forth the amount thereof as a separate item and shall identify the particular tax involved, and each such invoice or voucher shall be identified with the appropriate change order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-14\">(4) Nothing in this paragraph (c) shall be applicable to social security taxes, income taxes, excess profits taxes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>capital stock taxes, transportation taxes, or any State and local taxes. (The treatment of State and local real and personal property taxes are covered in Article XIX, paragraph 33, of the Housing Contract.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-4\">(d) The eligible builder shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of all matters pertaining to Federal taxes that reasonably may result in either an increase or decrease in the contract price..
