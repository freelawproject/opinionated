He has no appeal pending, nor has he filed or attempted to file a motion to vacate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255, or a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court. The District Court denied the motion. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-26\">Title 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2250 provides that only where a petitioner for the writ of habeas corpus has been granted leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>to proceed in forma pauperis and his application is pending before the court is that petitioner entitled to be furnished copies of court records without cost. Harless v. United States, 5 Cir. 1964, 329 F.2d 397. A federal prisoner is not entitled to obtain copies of court records at Government expense for the purpose of searching the record for possible error. Harless v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Culbert v. United States, 10 Cir. 1964, 325 F.2d 920; Ketcherside v. United States, 6 Cir. 1963, 317 F.2d 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The judgment below is</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-17\">. Pursuant to Rule IS of the Rules of this Court, we have concluded on the merits that this case is of such character as not to justify oral argument and have directed the clerk to place the case on the Summary Calendar and to notify the parties in writing. <em>See </em>Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I; and Huth v. Southern Pacific Company, 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 526; Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
