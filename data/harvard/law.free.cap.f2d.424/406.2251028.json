In 1960 Mrs. Legory, having separated from her husband, instituted an action for divorce in New Jersey where the parties were domiciled. This action was uncontested and on March 10, 1961 a judgment nisi was entered. Three months later, final judgment was entered as of course, as was provided by New Jersey law. However, before the judgment thus became final Orlando had become ill and Mrs. Legory had returned to her former marital abode to care for him. The parties had become reconciled, cohabitation had been resumed, and they lived together as husband and wife until Orlando\u2019s death in November 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Shortly after her husband\u2019s death Mrs. Legory filed an application for Social Security benefits on behalf of herself as widow of the wage earner,' and on behalf of their infant daughter. These benefits were initially granted; however, after two payments Mrs. Le-gory\u2019s benefits as a widow were terminated when the Social Security Administration learned of the existing decree of divorce.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mrs. Legory then applied for benefits as a divorced wife who had been receiving one half of her support from the deceased wage earner. 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 402(g) (1) (F). This application was finally denied on February 17, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">In April 1965 Mrs. Legory petitioned the Superior Court of New Jersey to set aside the divorce decree. In addition to setting out the fact of her reconciliation with Orlando prior to the entry of the final judgment, Mrs. Legory explained that she had received no notice of the entry of a final decree and did not learn that the divorce had become final until after her husband\u2019s death. She had believed that a further hearing was necessary before the decree could become final. The New Jersey court granted her motion, ruling in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-12\">\u201cORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the final judgment of divorce entered herein on June 12, 1961, dissolving the marriage between Pauline Le-gory and Orlando Legory be and the same is hereby vacated and set aside, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-13\">\u201cORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the marriage between the parties be deemed to have continued without interruption until dissolved by the death of Orlando Legory on November 7, 1961, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-14\">\u201cORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the said Pauline Legory be and she is hereby declared to be the lawful widow of the said Orlando Legory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM0\">Immediately following the entry of this order, Mrs. Legory reapplied for benefits as the widow of Orlando Legory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Her application was granted, but benefits were awarded only from May 24, 1965, the date of the order invalidating the divorce, rather than as claimed from the date of her husband\u2019s death in 1961. Thus, the Social Security Administration ruled that Mrs. Lego-ry did not have the status of widow for Social Security purposes until the date of the vacating order, but acquired such status at that time. This is an appeal from a decision of the district court affirming that ruling of the Social Security Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-15\">The Social Security Act entitles Mrs. Legory to benefits for every month beginning with the first month in which she was a widow. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(g); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.335 and 404.336. Whether she had the status of widow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>for Social Security purposes prior to the court order invalidating her divorce must be determined in accordance with state-law because the Social Security Act provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\">\u201cAn applicant is the * * \u00ae widow * * * of a fully or currently insured individual * * * if the courts of the state in which such insured individual * * * was domiciled at the time of death * * * would find that such applicant and such insured individual were validly married at the time such * * * [insured individual] died.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h) (1) (A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Orlando Legory died domiciled in New Jersey. The issue for determination is whether, on the present facts, the courts of that state would hold that the Legorys were validly married at the time of his death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">It is not necessary to decide whether the Social Security Administration could properly have judged Mrs. Legory a widow before she brought an action in the state courts to have the divorce set aside. Her present application for benefits was filed after the state order vacating the divorce. The inquiry of this court, therefore, is limited to the question whether the courts of New Jersey would respect the terms of that order and find that the marriage continued uninterrupted until dissolved by Orlando\u2019s death.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-19\">In denying Mrs. Legory any benefits prior to the date of the vacating order, the Social Security Administration reasoned that the final judgment of divorce, entered after the parties had resumed cohabitation, was not void but merely voidable, and thus must still be deemed effective from the date of its entry until it was set aside in a later proceeding. However, the cases cited in support of this position illustrate merely that in certain circumstances it may be inequitable to set aside \u00e1 final judgment of divorce simply because the parties' temporarily resumed cohabitation prior to the entry of that judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No case is cited and our research has disclosed no case holding that once a divorce decree is vacated it continues to have legal effect as an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>terruption of the continuity of the marriage for the period preceding its vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">We emphasize that the present case does not present a situation where the order vacating the judgment of divorce is silent upon the subject of retro-activity. The New Jersey court specifically held the vacating decree retroactive, stating \u201cthat the marriage between the parties be deemed to have continued without interruption until dissolved by the death of Orlando Legory * * While the Social Security Administration may ignore a decision by a lower state court, particularly one entered <em>ex parte, </em>when that decision is demonstrably inconsistent with the general law of the state, Cain v. Secretary of H. E. W., <em>supra, </em>such a course is improper when the lower court decision is fair and logical and no authoritative decision to the contrary exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The purpose of the New Jersey three-month \u201cwaiting period\u201d before a decree of divorce becomes final is to foster reconciliation of the parties. Iovino v. Iovino, 1959, 58 N.J.Super. 138, 155 A.2d 578. In the present case the Legorys did reconcile during that period, and the New Jersey court vacated the divorce because of such reconciliation. It is illogical that a divorce set aside precisely because the conjugal relationship in fact continued should thereafter be held to suspend the marital status between the divorce decree and its vacation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">It is arguable that an order invalidating a judgment of divorce should not be applied retroactively to a party who has relied on the validity of that judgment during the intervening period. However, New Jersey cases, though considering such reliance by an innocent third party in determining whether to set aside a divorce, imply that if the divorce is set aside, the vacating order will apply retroactively to such a party. <em>See </em>Shammas v. Shammas, 1952, 9 N.J. 321, 333, 88 A.2d 204, 210; Pavlicka v. Pav-licka, <em>supra; </em>Plodzien v. Plodzien, 1937, 121 N.J.Eq. 270, 189 A. 621. In any event the Social Security Administration is quite unlike the innocent third persons in the above cases who married one of the parties to a divorce in reliance on the validity of that divorce. In addition, the Administration has not recommitted funds or been in any other way prejudiced in reliance on the judgment of divorce, and is, therefore, not entitled to avoid the full effect of the vacating order. <em>Cf. </em>Pearsall v. Folsom, N.D.Calif. 1956, 138 F.Supp. 939, 944, <em>aff\u2019d </em>9th Cir. 1957, 245 F.2d 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">It is also noteworthy that the Social Security Administration has, despite its protests, accepted the retroactivity of the New Jersey order setting aside the divorce. For by awarding Mrs. Legory benefits as a \u201cwidow\u201d, albeit only from the date of the vacating order, the Administration necessarily determined that the Legorys were married at the time of Orlando\u2019s death. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h) (1) (A). The Administration also has found that Mrs. Legory satisfied the statutory requirement that to qualify as a widow an applicant must have been married to the deceased for nine months \u201cimmediately prior to the day on which he died.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(c). Yet, this was part of the period between divorce decree and vacating order.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number> Finally, in support of its contention that the vacating order should be treated prospectively for Social'Security purposes, the Administration attempts to analogize the present case to the situation where a widow entitled to benefits remarries and that remarriage is later annulled. A widow\u2019s entitlement to benefits under the Social Security Act terminates when she remarries. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(g) (1) (F). However, several cases have held that when the remarriage is subsequently annulled, benefits should be reinstated, but only prospectively from the date of the annulment. Pearsall v. Folsom, 9th Cir. 1957, 245 F.2d 562; Santuelli v. Folsom, N.D.Calif., 1958, 165 F.Supp. 224; Sparks v. United States, D.Vt.1957, 153 F.Supp. 909; Mays v. Folsom, D.Idaho, 1956, 143 F.Supp. 784. The rationale for not awarding benefits during the de facto existence of the remarriage is clear. The Social Security Act is intended to provide economic support to a widow who has been deprived of such support by the death of her husband. When the widow remarries she becomes, at least during the existence of that remarriage, entitled to support from her new husband. An additional award of Social Security benefits for that period would be inequitable. Nott v. Flemming, 2d Cir. 1959, 272 F.2d 380; Pearsall v. Folsom, <em>supra. See, </em>Sleicher v. Sleicher, 1929, 251 N.Y. 366, 167 N.E. 501.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the present case Mrs. Legory\u2019s divorce, unlike a remarriage, did not provide her with another means of support. The death of her husband deprived her of that support which the Social Security Act undertakes to replace.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for the entry of judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-9\">. It seems that the benefits theretofore paid Mrs. Legory were recovered by temporarily suspending benefits for her child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b472-16\">. The Administration treated Mrs. Le-gory\u2019s 1961 application for widow\u2019s benefits as having been reopened. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.957 and 404.958.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b473-9\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h) (1) (A) further provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">\u201cIf such courts would not find that such applicant and such insured individual were validly married at such time, such applicant shall, nevertheless be deemed to be the * * * widow * * * of such insured individual if such applicant would, under the laws applied by such courts in determining the devolution of intestate personal property, have the same status with respect to the taking of such property as a * * * widow * * * of such insured individual.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b473-13\">. The Administration does not contend that the state court acted improperly in setting the divorce aside. It accepts the vacating order insofar as it sets aside the divorce, but refuses to apply that order as relating back to the date of the decree it vacated. The issue in the present case is, therefore, 'entirely different from that in Cain v. Secretary of H.E.W., 4th Cir. 1967, 377 F.2d 55, upon which the Administration relies. That case did not involve the retroactivity of a state vacating order. Ratlier, the Administration there refused to award any benefits contending that the divorce should not have been set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-21\">The present case is more closely analogous to Litteral v. Celebrezze, E.D.Ky. 1963, 215 F.Supp. 865, which also involved the question of the retroactive effect for Social Security purposes which should be given a state order invalidating a divorce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b473-22\">. The question whether voluntary cohabitation during the pendency of a divorce suit makes the judgment of divorce void or voidable is unclear under New Jersey Law. Compare Byrne v. Byrne, 1921, 93 N.J.Eq. 5, 114 A. 754, with Pavlicka v. Pavlicka, 1964, 84 N.J.Super. 357, 202 A.2d 200. <em>See also </em>Note, Cohabitation During Pendency of a Divorce Action, 19 Wash. &amp; Lee L.Rev. 243 (1962). In any case, our view of the present issue as not whether the divorce was void or voidable, but whether the courts of New Jersey would give the order vacating that divorce retroactive effect in accordance with its terms, makes it unnecessary to resolve the above doubtful issue of New Jersey law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\">. Although no case has been found directly on point, it seems that an order setting aside a divorce after the husband\u2019s death would at least restore to the wife a widow\u2019s share in his undistributed property. Dyott v. Henderson, 1916, 85 N.J. Eq. 338, 97 A. 35; Givernaud v. Givernaud, 1912, 81 N.J.Eq. 66, 85 A. 830; Wright v. Wright, 1849, 8 N.J.Eq. 143, 153; 3 A. Freedman &amp; M. Freedman, Law of Marriage and Divorce in Pennsylvania \u00a7 741 (2d ed. 1957). Such a result would not only indicate that Mrs. Legory was Orlando\u2019s widow for the purpose of the devolution of his property, but would also satisfy the alternate test for determining whether she is a widow for Social Security purposes. N. 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b475-6\">. The dominance of equitable considerations is further indicated by the rule that, when the annulment entitles her to future support from her second marital partner, benefits as the widow of her first husband will not be reinstated. Nott v. Fleming, <em>supra. </em>But see Yeager v. Flemming, 5th Cir. 1960, 282 F.2d 779.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
