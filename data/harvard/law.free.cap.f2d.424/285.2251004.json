While he could have obtained permission to report in New York and, had he refused to be inducted after reporting there, venue would have been in New York, this defendant did nothing. His default was in his failure to report in South Carolina, and the proceedings were required to be instituted in that District. Johnston v. United States, 351 U.S. 215, 76 S.Ct. 739, 100 L.Ed. 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-19\">We have considered the other contentions on appeal and find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
