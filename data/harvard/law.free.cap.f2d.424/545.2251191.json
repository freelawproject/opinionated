Some of the trees had been tied together with cords. In obscure light at approximately 6 p. m., Mrs. O\u2019Quinn proceeded from the parking lot in front of the store onto the walkway, took several steps, entangled the toe of her left shoe in a cord, fell, and sustained injuries. By reason of diversity of citizenship, Mrs. O\u2019Quinn\u2019s negligence action was tried in the United States District Court. The jury returned a verdict of $6,000 in favor of Mrs. O\u2019Quinn.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-20\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs and record and are of the opinion that oral argument is unnecessary. Because we find no error, the judgment of the district court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b609-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
