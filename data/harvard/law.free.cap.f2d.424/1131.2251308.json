We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-19\">The bankrupt, James Russell Ferwer-da, is a physician and surgeon engaged in the practice of ophthalmology in Kenosha, Wisconsin. His voluntary petition and schedules were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The proceeding was referred to the Honorable James E. McCarty, Referee. William Urban Zievers qualified as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-20\">In Schedule B-5, the bankrupt claimed deposits of $6,346.01 made by him under the American Medical Association Members\u2019 Retirement Plan (the Plan) were exempt by the laws of the United States and the laws of the State of Wisconsin. The parties now concede and agree that there is no applicable federal law under which the subject deposits could be allowed as exempt, and that the question must be determined under Wisconsin law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-21\">The bankrupt contends that his deposits under the Plan are exempt by virtue of Section 272.18(31) of the Wisconsin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>Statutes (1967).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This statute exempts from execution, and prohibits voluntary transfers of, any person\u2019s interest in an \u201cemployes\u2019 trust\u201d defined as \u201cany trust created by an employer as part of a retirement or pension plan * * for the exclusive benefit of some or all of his employes * * * provided that it is impossible * * * for any part of the corpus or income to be * * * diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of such employes * * <em>*\u00bb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">The bankrupt here is a self-employed physician and not an \u201cemployee\u201d in the usual sense of being <em>employed by another. </em>Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language (1942); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1957); The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (1967); and The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (1969). He nevertheless claims that his interest in the Plan is within the exemption provided by the Wisconsin statute for the reason that the Plan defines \u201cemployee\u201d to include self-employed \u201cowner-employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-8\">The Plan was drawn by the AMA to meet the requirements of the \u201cSelf-Employed Individuals Tax Retirement Act of 1962,\u201d commonly known as the \u201cKeogh Act,\u201d P.L. 87-792, 76 Stat. 809, 26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq. </em>Under the Act, self-employed individuals are treated as \u201cemployees\u201d under qualified retirement plans and are eligible for certain tax benefits. The bankrupt, however, makes no claim of exemption under this federal act, and its provisions cannot affect the meaning of the term \u201cemploye\u201d in the Wisconsin statute under consideration, which was first enacted in 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-15\">The bankrupt may well qualify as an \u201cemployee\u201d under the broader definition used in the Plan to meet Keogh Act requirements. However, the Plan is essentially a private contract between the bankrupt and the AMA which can have no controlling effect on the meaning of a term as used in the statutes of Wisconsin. It is our opinion that when the Wisconsin legislature enacted Section 272.18(31) it had in mind the normal meaning of the term \u201cemploye\u201d which does not include the \u201cself-employed.\u201d The bankrupt has not shown any legislative intent to use the term with other than its ordinary and accepted meaning. Thus we conclude that the bankrupt\u2019s interest under the Plan is not exempted from the operation of the federal Bankruptcy Act by Wisconsin law. The Wisconsin legislature could have enacted such an exemption but has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-16\">The bankrupt raises a second issue for the first time on this, appeal. He contends that, regardless of their exempt status, these deposits are not property to which the trustee acquired title by virtue of Section 70a of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 110(a), <em>supra. </em>The basis for this contention is the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>sertion that the bankrupt had no right to transfer or withdraw his interest in the Plan before he filed his petition in bankruptcy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since this issue was not raised before the referee or the district court, we deem it inappropriate to reach and determine it on this appeal. It appears that it would be appropriate to raise such question in any subsequent turnover proceeding concerning the bankrupt\u2019s interest in the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">Simply stated, we agree with the referee and the district court that the bankrupt\u2019s claimed exemption does not fall within the purview of the appropriate Wisconsin statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s approval of the order under review and its denial of the petition for review is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1196-13\">. The applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Act are Section 6, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 24 and Section 70, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 110.
