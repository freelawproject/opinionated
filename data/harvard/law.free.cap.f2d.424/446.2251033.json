It was selected by the court <em>sua sponte </em>for en banc consideration. It was reargued before the entire bench in the December 1969 term of the court. The fundamental question presented is whether the Fifth Amendment bars appellant\u2019s conviction on an indictment charging violations of the federal alcohol tax laws. We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-17\">Appellant was convicted on seven counts of an eight-count indictment and sentenced to concurrent terms totaling four years. The counts charged appellant with possession, custody and control of a still, the making of mash, the transportation of raw materials to an unlawful distillery, and the possession of distilled spirits, all in violation of the federal tax laws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-18\">The record discloses extensive surveillance of the house in Detroit, Michigan, where ultimately the still and 800 gallons of mash were found. Appellant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>seen going into the house carrying 60-pound sacks of sugar and coming out with paper bags containing something heavy and loading same in cars. Two such ears were stopped by Internal Revenue agents. Appellant, who was driving one of them, was arrested. Both cars were found to be loaded with non-tax-paid whiskey. Thereupon a search warrant was procured for the house, the still was found, and appellant was indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to sustain conviction on several counts, including Count 6 pertaining to the making of mash. He also contends that various provisions of the federal tax laws violated his Fifth Amendment rights under Supreme Court decisions in the Marchetti,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Grosso,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Haynes </em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">We believe that the evidence of appellant\u2019s activity inland about the premises were acts which represented much more than presence at the site of a still <em>(see </em>United States v. Romano, 382 U.S. 136, 86 S.Ct. 279, 15 L.Ed.2d 210 (1965)) or assistance in only one phase of an illegal liquor business <em>(see </em>Bozza v. United States, 330 U.S. 160, 67 S.Ct. 645, 91 L.Ed. 818 (1947)). Appellant was seen engaged in activities from which the jury could have inferred that he was carrying supplies for illegal manufacture of liquor into a house and carrying the illegal liquor out. He was arrested while driving an automobile which contained illicit whiskey which the jury had every right to infer was a product of an illegal still operated by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">As to the count which alleged illegal manufacture of mash, appellant was seen carrying heavy bags of sugar into the house where subsequently the still and some distilled liquor were found. The sugar bags were found empty in a closet in the house. Eight hundred gallons of mash were also found there.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">All in all, there was both direct and circumstantial evidence from which the jury could have inferred appellant\u2019s guilt on all counts beyond a reasonable doubt. Ramsey v. United States, 248 F.2d 740 (6th Cir. 1957); Chadwell v. United States, 260 F.2d 257 (6th Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">Turning to the constitutional issue, we note that appellant herein did not seek to raise the Fifth Amendment privilege at trial. Nonetheless, we do not consider the privilege to have been waived in this case and we elect to decide this issue on its merits. <em>See </em>Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 63, 70, 71, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906 (1968); Drennon v. United States, 393 F.2d 342 (8th Cir. 1968); Greenwood v. United States, 392 F.2d 558 (4th Cir. 1968); United States v. Manfredonia, 391 F.2d 229 (2d Cir. 1968); Harris v. United States, 390 F.2d 616 (8th Cir. 1968); <em>but see </em>Howard v. United States, 397 F.2d 72 (9th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">We are urged to hold these tax measures unconstitutional in that they require the performance of certain affirmative acts; here, the posting of a sign at the site of a lawful distillery, the furnishing of bond, the purchase and affixing of tax stamps and the filing of registration information. Appellant asserts that these affirmative acts might create for some prospective taxpayers in some possible situations \u201chazards of incrimination * * * [which] are not trifling or imaginary.\u201d Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 54, 88 S.Ct. 697, 706, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-15\">At the outset we emphasize that we do not read these words as having been written as a litmus paper test of constitutionality. It is \u201ccompelled\u201d self-incrimination against which the Fifth Amendment has been held to offer protection. Every criminal act, no matter how voluntary, creates some real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>hazard of incrimination. And where regulatory legislation provides penalties for failure to perform certain acts normally the Fifth Amendment does not apply because the omission is not deemed \u201ccompelled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">We do not think \u2022 that the Supreme Court has as yet provided a wholly clear rationale for distinguishing constitutional exercise of taxing and regulatory powers from those situations wherein fatal Fifth Amendment conflicts are to be found. In such a situation we would proceed with some caution and with strict construction of the case holdings if the issue involved appeared to be in doubt. In our instant case, however, we believe there is no reason for doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">There are clear and important distinctions between the currently disputed provisions of alcohol tax statutes and those statutory provisions which were held vulnerable to attack on Fifth Amendment grounds in the <em>Marchetti, Grosso </em>and <em>Haynes </em>cases. <em>See also </em>Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Underlying the series of cases to which we have referred is the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Albertson v. SACB, 382 U.S. 70, 86 S.Ct. 194, 15 L.Ed.2d 165 (1965). The Supreme Court there distinguished between the <em>Sullivan </em>case (United States v. Sullivan, 274 U.S. 259, 47 S.Ct. 607, 71 L.Ed. 1037 (1927) ) which upheld as constitutional the requirement of filing an income tax return, and an order requiring a Communist to register as such and thus furnish evidence of his violation of two federal criminal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">In <em>Albertson </em>the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\">\u201cIn <em>Sullivan </em>the questions in the income tax return were neutral on their face and directed at the public at large, but here they are directed at a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities. Petitioners\u2019 claims are not asserted in an essentially noncriminal and regulatory area of inquiry, but against an inquiry in an area permeated with criminal statutes, where response to any of the form\u2019s questions in context might involve the petitioners in the admission of a crucial element of a crime.\u201d Albertson v. SACB, 382 U.S. <em>supra </em>at 79, 86 S.Ct. at 199.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">THE PUBLIC PURPOSE</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">The alcohol tax laws are \u201cessentially noncriminal\u201d revenue measures. Until the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (income tax), taxes on alcoholic beverages provided the fundamental financing of the United States government.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">Even after enactment of the federal income tax, the alcohol tax laws constitute substantial revenue producing measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-15\">As the Fourth Circuit has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-16\">\u201cIn 1966, the taxes on distilled spirits produced $3.7 billion in internal revenue. The wagering tax scrutinized in <em>Marchetti </em>produced \u2018in the past several years\u2019 only $115 million. 390 U.S. at 82, 88 S.Ct. at 721.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-17\">\u201cWe think the failure of these defendants to designate place of manufacture and to post a distillery bond is due to their wish to avoid the federal tax of $10.50 per gallon on distilled spirits. The evasion of tax alone provides the enormous margin of profit in the white whiskey business and accounts for the delinquency here. It lies well within the power of Congress to exercise a regulatory function to enforce the collection of such lawfully due taxes.\u201d United States v. Walden, 411 F.2d 1109, 1112 (4th Cir. 1969). (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-18\">In a preprohibition case, the United States Supreme Court provided this description of the alcohol tax laws of that day \u2014 a description which we feel entirely appropriate to describe the statute currently under attack:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-19\">\u201cIt is clear, even upon a cursory reading, that the well-considered and minute provisions of the Revised Statutes found in chapter 4, entitled \u2018Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>tilled Spirits,\u2019 of Title XXXV., entitled \u2018Internal Revenue,\u2019 were adopted with one purpose only, namely, to secure the payment of the tax imposed by law upon distilled spirits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-4\">\u201cAll the regulations for the manufacture and storage the marking, branding, numbering, and stamping with tax stamps, of distilled spirits, and all the penalties, forfeitures, fines, and imprisonments prescribed by the chapter mentioned, have that end only in view. If the tax on distilled spirits were repealed, all the ingenious and complicated provisions of the chapter would become useless and insensible.\u201d United States v. Ulrici, 111 U.S. 38, 40, 4 S.Ct. 288, 289, 28 L.Ed. 344 (1884).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Returning to the language of <em>Albertson, </em>the statutory provisions here attacked are \u201cneutral on their face and directed at the public at large.\u201d The manufacture of alcoholic beverages is lawful under some circumstances in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and the taxes are collected from thousands of persons engaged in lawful sale and distribution of these products.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The Fifth Circuit has expressed this view in a case'upon which the Supreme Court has already denied certiorari:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">\u201cPerhaps if this prosecution had occurred under an appropriate statute that existed during the short life of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, appellants could properly equate their situation to the appellants in Marchetti. As it is, however, we are informed by the government\u2019s brief, and it is not disputed, (a matter of which we can take judicial notice) that possession of distilled spirits is legal to some extent in every one of the fifty states of the union. Therefore, we find ourselves in agreement with those district courts in addition to the trial court here, which have held that there is no danger of self incrimination resulting from the requirement of- Sections 5205(a) (2) and 5604(a) (1) relating to the placing of stamps and taxing of distilled spirits.\u201d Brown v. United States, 401 F.2d 769, 770 (5th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 962, 89 S.Ct. 1314, 22 L.Ed.2d 564 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">THE EFFECT ON THE INDIVIDUAL</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">Regardless, however, of what we have written thus far pertaining to the purpose of the alcohol tax laws, appellant would argue that the Fifth Amendment privilege depends upon no such balancing of rights and is absolute as to him. We cannot perceive, however, how the affirmative acts here objected to can be held to represent compelling this appellant \u201cin any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d U.S.Const. Amend. V. Contrary to the facts in the <em>Albertson </em>case, these statutory provisions are not aimed at exposing \u201ca highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities\u201d to prosecution under other criminal statutes. Nor do we find here a compelled response which might involve \u201cthe admission of a crucial element of a crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-14\">These statutes do apply generally to all who manufacture liquor, including many persons or organizations who do so entirely lawfully within the State of Michigan. We find here no purpose to aid state officialdom in suppressing activities generally rendered illegal by state law. <em>Cf. </em>Marchetti v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Grosso v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-15\">We certainly do not find here that \u201cCongress intended information obtained as a consequence of [the requirements of these statutes] to be provided to interested prosecuting authorities.\u201d Marchetti v. United States, <em>supra, </em>390 U. S. at 58, 59, 88 S.Ct. at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-16\">Nor do we find that these statutes have \u201can obvious purpose * * * to coerce evidence from persons engaged in illegal activities for use in their prosecution.\u201d Grosso v. United States, <em>supra </em>390 U.S. at 74, 88 S.Ct. at 717 (concurring opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-19\">Indeed, the alcohol tax statutes were drafted with the purpose of keeping per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>sons of ill-repute out of the alcohol beverage manufacturing business. Seaway Beverages, Inc. v. Dillon, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 321, 319 F.2d 722, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 923, 84 S.Ct. 265, 11 L.Ed.2d 166 (1963). And these federal statutes \u2014 in place of seeking to expose a limited class of law violators to state prosecution <em>(Cf. Marchetti, Grosso </em>and Haynes)\u2014 prohibit issuance of a basic permit upon a finding \u201cthat the operations proposed to be conducted by such person are in violation of the law of the State in which they are to be conducted.\u201d 27 U.S.C. \u00a7 204(a) (2) (C) (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Absent the prior securing of the basic permit on a showing of compliance with state law, it is greatly to be doubted that any other of the affirmative acts required as a prerequisite to legal manufacture of alcoholic beverages under federal law <em>(i.e., </em>posting of bond, securing and posting of a distillery sign, securing and affixing of tax stamps) could actually be performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">For example, Title 27 \u00a7 203 makes it unlawful to manufacture, ship or sell any distilled spirits, except pursuant to the basic permit referred to above. And appellant in this case (if we hypothesize his ability to show compliance with state law) could not have received such a basic permit to manufacture distilled spirits on the premises involved in this ease because 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5178 flatly prohibits such a plant \u201cin any dwelling house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The possibility of appellant\u2019s self-incrimination by dint of actual compliance with the statutory provisions attacked herein is considerably less than \u201cpurely hypothetical.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>Minor v. United States, 396 U.S. 87, 90 S.Ct. 284, 24 L.Ed.2d 283 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">In summary, the statutory provisions attacked in this appeal are a far cry from the statutory provisions invalidated in <em>Marchetti, Grosso </em>and <em>Haynes </em>which the Supreme Court held deliberately sought to expose federal registrants to state prosecution. Here federal registration is prohibited unless the registrant is in compliance with state law. This appellant could not, if he had tried, have gotten his name on any list of federal registrants because that list was a list of lawful distillers under both state and federal laws and not as in <em>Marchetti </em>and <em>Grosso </em>a list of gamblers whose activities were illegal under state law. Judge McCree\u2019s dissent suggests that appellant might have \u201cattempted\u201d registration and in effect told the federal authorities of his intention to make white whiskey in residential premises. Since there would have been no conceivable federal statutory benefit from such a disclosure, we cannot perceive how it could be deemed \u201ccompelled\u201d in any Fifth Amendment sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">We find no abuse of appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">While this is a case of first impression in this court, we are by no means plowing new ground in the federal law. Three circuits and many District Courts have already reached the same conclusion. United States v. Fricano, 416 F.2d 434 (2d Cir. 1969); United States v. Walden, 411 F.2d 1109 (4th Cir. 1969); Wilson v. United States, 409 F.2d 604 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 923, 89 S.Ct. 1772, 23 L.Ed.2d 240 (1969); Thornburg v.

Appellant\u2019s only objection to his convictions on these counts is directed to the sufficiency of the evidence to uphold these convictions, and I agree that the evidence is sufficient to uphold them. I would, however, reverse appellant\u2019s convictions on count 1 for carrying on the business of a distiller without giving bond in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5173(a) and 5601(a) (4); on counts 3 and 4 for possessing and transporting distilled spirits in containers not having affixed thereto the required revenue stamps in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5205(a) (2) and 5604(a) (1); on count 5 for possessing an unregistered still in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5179(a) and 5601(a) (1); and on count 8 for carrying and delivering raw materials to an unlawful distillery at which no sign was posted in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5180(a) and 5681(c). I would reach this result because appellant\u2019s refusal to comply with the statutory requirements upon which these convictions are based was a proper exercise of his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination and therefore he may not be criminally punished for his failure to comply. <em>See </em>Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 61, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The fifth amendment provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cNo person * * * shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself jn a serjes 0f recent decisions involving the relationship between this privilege and the' Government\u2019s right to require a person, upon threat of criminal prosecution, to provide potentially incriminating information, the Supreme Court has decided that \u201cThe <em>central standard </em>for the privilege\u2019s application [is] whether the claimant is confronted by substantial and \u2018real,\u2019 not merely trifling or imaginary, hazards of incrimination.\u201d Marchetti v. United States, <em>supra </em>at 53, 88 S.Ct. at 705 (emphasis added). <em>Accord, </em>Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906 (1968); Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 88 S.Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923 (1968); Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969). If the obligation to provide information creates \u201c \u2018real and appreciable,\u2019 and not merely \u2018imaginary and unsubstantial,\u2019 hazards of self-incrimination,\u201d a person cannot be criminally punished for refusing to comply. Marchetti v. United States, <em>supra </em>at 48, 88 S.Ct. at 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">At the outset, it should be observed that this standard renders inapposite one of the factors relied on by the majority to distinguish <em>Marchetti, Grosso, Haynes </em>and <em>Leary </em>from the present case. The majority points out that the alcohol tax laws are \u201cessentially noncriminal revenue measures\u201d and that the purpose of the disclosure provisions is to facilitate securing the payment of the taxes imposed and not to aid law enforcement officials in their efforts against illegal manufacturers of distilled spirits. However, regardless of the Congressional purpose for inclusion of the disclosure provisions in the alcohol tax laws, the refusal to comply with these provisions cannot be criminally punished if compliance would create substantial and real hazards of self-incrimination. <em>See generally </em>Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 585, 12 S.Ct. 195, 35 L.Ed. 1110 (1892)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>before us, then, is whether appellant \u201c* * may compelled to give evidence against himself.\u201d Marchetti v. United States, <em>supra </em>390 U.S. at 51, 88 S.Ct. at 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Considering the substantiality of the risk of self-incrimination if appellant complied with the disclosure provisions of the alcohol tax laws, the majority concludes that the degree of risk involved is \u201cconsiderably less than \u2018purely hypothetical\u2019 \u201d (1) because the disclosure provisions are \u201cdirected at the public at large\u201d and not \u201cat a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities\u201d, Albertson v. SACB, 382 U.S. 70, 79, 86 S.Ct. 194, 199, 15 L.Ed.2d 65 (1965), and (2) because it is doubtful, in any event, whether appellant would ever have the opportunity to perform the affirmative acts of disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Admittedly, compliance with a statutory provision requiring the disclosure of illegal activity creates a greater risk of self-incrimination when the disclosure requirement is directed at a \u201cgroup inherently suspect of criminal activities,\u201d since it identifies the discloser as a member of the suspect group. Leary v. United States, <em>supra, </em>395 U.S. at 18, 89 S.Ct. at 1539. <em>See also </em>Marchetti v. United States, <em>supra </em>390 U.S. at 57, 88 S.Ct. 697; Grosso v. United States, <em>supra, </em>390 U.S. at 68, 88 S.Ct. 709. However, the character of the group subject to a disclosure requirement certainly is not by itself determinative of the substantiality of the risk of self-incrimination attendant on compliance with such a requirement. Even if the requirement is not directed at an inherently suspect group, the risk encountered as a consequence of compliance may still be \u201creal and appreciable\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">Indeed, manufacturers of distilled spirits are a prime example of this. Although distillers may not be a \u201cgroup inherently suspect of criminal activities,\u201d they are involved in a business which is subject to extensive state and federal controls. In Michigan, the liquor industry is an area permeated with statutory requirements, the violation of which can be criminally punished. <em>See, e. g., </em>Mich.Comp.Laws \u00a7\u00a7 436.1, 436.2, 436.17, 436.19, 436.22, 436.32, 436.50. Moreover, at the time appellant was engaged in the illegal manufacture of distilled spirits, there was a statutory requirement that certain internal revenue offices maintain a list of persons who had paid the special taxes assessed on the manufacture of distilled spirits and that this list be furnished to any prosecuting officer of any state, county, or municipality upon request. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6107.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is therefore sufficient attention focused on manufacturers of distilled spirits to indicate that the hazards of self-incrimination attendant on compliance with the disclosure provisions of the alcohol tax laws would be more than \u201cmerely trifling or imaginary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">The important inquiry then is whether, in reality, these hazards ever would materialize. <em>Cf. </em>Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969); Minor v. United States (Buie v. United States), 396 U.S. 87, 96 S.Ct. 284, 24 L.Ed.2d 283 (1969). The majority concludes that this is \u201cgreatly to be doubted\u201d because a prerequisite to compliance with the disclosure provisions of the alcohol tax laws is the securing of a basic permit, 27 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(b) (1), and the Secretary of the Treasury is prohibited from issuing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>basic permit when \u201cthe operations proposed to be conducted * * * are in violation of the law of the State in which they are to be conducted.\u201d 27 U. S.C. \u00a7 204(a) (2) (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The effect on the privilege against self-incrimination of practical barriers to actual compliance with provisions requiring disclosure of illegal activity depends on the nature of the barriers. In Leary v. United States, <em>supra, </em>the Government contended that there was no substantial risk of self-incrimination because one who intended unlawfully to purchase marihuana would know he could not obtain the order form which contained the incriminating questions and consequently never would apply for it. The Government also contended that even if the buyer did apply for an order form, it was doubtful that the unsuccessful application would be revealed to law enforcement officials. <em>Id'., </em>395 U.S. at 18-20, 89 S.Ct. 1532. The Supreme Court rejected both of these contentions and concluded that \u201creal and appreciable\u201d hazards of self-incrimination did confront Leary because the Congressional intent, as revealed by the statutory scheme adopted, was that an unlawful purchaser of marihuana should be able to obtain an order form.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">On the other hand, in Buie v. United States, <em>supra, </em>the Court decided that the practical barriers encountered by one who unlawfully sold marihuana were sufficiently insurmountable to preclude any real possibility that he actually would comply with the order form requirements and thereby incriminate himself. Indeed, it was the Court\u2019s earlier decision in <em>Leary </em>that reduced the hazards of self-incrimination to the point where they were \u201cimaginary and unsubstantial\u201d as far as the seller was concerned because its decision relieved the purchaser of marihuana of his obligation of obtaining the order form and of providing the seller with an opportunity to comply with its requirements and thereby incriminate himself. Buie v. United States, <em>supra, </em>396 U.S. at 91-93, 90 S.Ct. 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The practical barriers to compliance confronted by appellant in the instant case are not as artificial as those in <em>Leary, </em>but neither are they as substantial as those in <em>Buie. </em>Although a basic permit is a prerequisite to the lawful manufacture of distilled spirits, the absence of such a permit might not preclude appellant from complying with the provision requiring him to post a sign at the site of the still. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5180(a). Under the terms of the statute and the regulation adopted pursuant thereto, appellant apparently could have complied with this requirement merely by fabricating a sign containing the required information and installing it. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.235. Since \u201ca sign placed conspicuously on the outside front or entrance [of the still] and exhibiting in readily legible and durable characters (a) the real name of the proprietor, (b) the plant number, and (c) the designation of the kind of business\u201d, 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.235, would disclose the operation of the still, I think the hazards of incrimination attendant on compliance with 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5180(a) are \u201creal and appreciable\u201d. Accordingly, I would hold that appellant cannot be criminally punished for his failure to comply with this statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The necessity of a basic permit and the prohibition on its issuance if the proposed operation violates the laws of the state probably would foreclose \u201cliteral and full compliance\u201d with the statutory provisions requiring appellant to register the still and to file a qualification bond. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5179(a), 5173 (a). However, the basic permit requirement would not prevent appellant from <em>attempting </em>to comply with the registration and qualification bond provisions by submitting an application. There is no statutory requirement that a distiller obtain a basic permit prior to filing an application for registration and a qualification bond.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Also, pursuant to 26 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>C. \u00a7 5171(a), \u201cEvery person <em>shall, before commencing </em>or continuing the business of a distiller * * * make application\u201d for the registration of his still. (Emphasis added). Accordingly, under the statutory scheme adopted by Congress, a distiller can file the registration form and qualification bond simultaneously with his request for a basic permit. Moreover, the likelihood that a distiller would do this is increased by the fact that he can lawfully obtain distilling apparatus prior to securing a basic permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Similarly, appellant also would not be precluded from <em>attempting </em>to procure the revenue stamps which must be affixed to containers of distilled spirits. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5205(a) (2). Again, the likelihood of \u201cliteral and full compliance\u201d is small, since the purpose of the stamps is to evidence compliance with the provisions of the alcohol tax laws. However, in determining whether appellant would attempt to comply with this requirement, and with those imposed by sections 5179(a) and 5173(a), I doubt that we are permitted to speculate that, in reality, he would not attempt to obey the law. Implicit in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Leary </em>is the notion that regardless of whether, in reality, one who purchases marihuana illegally would attempt to obtain an order form, the Court, in analyzing the substantiality of the risks of self-incrimination, would assume that this was a realistic alternative for the purchaser.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">Therefore, even with regard to the registration, qualification bond, and revenue stamp requirements, the hazards of self-incrimination confronting appellant were greater than those confronting Buie. In <em>Buie, </em>the Court concluded that the seller would never have an opportunity to complete the order form and disclose his illegal activity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant, on the other hand, by attempting to comply with the requirements of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5170(a), 5173(a) and 5205(a) (2), would reveal his intention to engage in the manufacture of distilled spirits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-14\">Of course, whether the potentially incriminating inforcnation provided by the attempt to comply would, in reality, ever be used by law enforcement officials to forge a \u201c \u2018link in the chain\u2019 of evidence tending to establish his guilt,\u201d Marchetti v. United States, <em>supra, </em>390 U.S. at 48, 88 S.Ct. at 703, and thus, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>the hazards of incrimination involved in such an attempt are \u201creal and appreciable\u201d, involves some conjecture. The court has before it no factual data indicating the likelihood that the information contained in unsuccessful applications to register, to post the qualification bond, and to obtain revenue stamps is passed on to other law enforcement officials. However, in the absence of such data, I would resolve the doubts in favor of the applicability of the Constitutional privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Until recently, an exchange of information between treasury officials and prosecuting officers of states, counties, and municipalities with regard to persons paying the special taxes assessed on the manufacture of distilled spirits was mandated by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6107. Thus, the channels of communication have been established. Moreover, although 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6107 has been repealed, <em>see </em>n. 2, <em>supra, </em>there are still no restrictions imposed upon the use of the potentially incriminating information contained in an application for registration or a qualification bond form. <em>See </em>Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. at 66, 88 S.Ct. 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">It is also relevant that \u201cother methods, entirely consistent with constitutional limitations,\u201d Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. at 98, 88 S.Ct. at 731, could be employed to obtain the information provided by compliance with the statutory provisions in question. <em>See generally </em>Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 585, 12 S.Ct. 195, 35 L.Ed. 1110 (1892). <em>See also </em>Adams v. Maryland, 347 U.S. 179, 74 S.Ct. 442, 98 L.Ed. 608 (1954); Murphy v. Waterfront Commission, 378 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 12 L.Ed.2d 678 (1964). Thus, permitting appellant to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination in order to prevent criminal prosecution for failing to comply with these provisions would not \u201cprevent the effective regulation or taxation by Congress\u201d of distilled spirits. Haynes v. United States, <em>supra, </em>390 U.S. at 98, 88 S.Ct. at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Accordingly, I would hold that sections 5179(a), 5173(a) and 5205(a) (2),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as well as section 5180(a), compelled appellant, upon threat of criminal punishment, to disclose his illegal activities and that the hazards of self-incrimination which would have resulted from disclosure were \u201creal and appreciable\u201d. I would therefore reverse his convictions on counts one, three, four, five and eight.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\">. It is interesting to speculate on the effect on the privilege against self-inerimination of a doctrine which would jjermit infringement of the privilege if occasioned by a legitimate Congressional purpose, since the suppression of criminal activity, in certain areas, would be a legitimate Congressional purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b517-8\">. This provision was repealed, effective December 16, 1968, by Section 203(a), Title II of the Gun Control Act of 196S, Pub.L.No. 90-618, 1968 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News, p. 1423, but this does not affect the relevance of section 6107 to the substantiality of the risk of self-incrimination confronting appellant at the time of his illegal activity. <em>See </em>Albertson v. SACB, 382 U.S. 70, 77, 86 S.Ct. 194, 15 L.Ed.2d 65 (1965). Furthermore, although the Internal Revenue Service is no longer required to compile a list of persons who pay the special alcohol taxes and to furnish this list to prosecuting officials, \u201cneither has Congress imposed explicit restrictions upon the use of information obtained as a consequence of payment of the tax.\u201d Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. at 66, 88 S.Ct. at 712. <em>See </em>Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. at 60, n. 18, 88 S.Ct. 697.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b518-9\">. The qualification bond is filed at the same time as the application for registration. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5173(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b519-7\">. If the Court had not made this assumption, the substantiality of the risks of incrimination confronting Leary would have been no greater than those confronting Buie. In other words, if the Court took judicial notice of the fact that illegal purchasers of marihuana do not, in reality, attempt to comply with the requirement of obtaining an order form, the risks of self-incrimination confronting Leary would have been minimal. Accordingly, the significant distinction between <em>Leary </em>and <em>Buie </em>would seem to be that Leary could have attempted to obtain an order form and incriminate himself where as Buie could not, since the obligation to procure the order form is on the purchaser. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7-4705 (a), 4742(a). In the present ease, the various obligations imposed by the statutory provisions in question are on the distiller.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\">. In <em>Buie, </em>the Court also observed that the statutory obligation to furnish the information requested on the order form was on the buyer and that this may eliminate the problem of \u201cself-incrimination\u201d, as that term is ordinarily understood. In the present ease it is the distiller himself who is obligated to disclose his activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b519-16\">. The fact that appellant would be revealing an intention to violate the law at some future time may reduce the sub-stantiality of the risks of self-incrimination, but it would not make these risks trifling or imaginary. \u201cWe see no reason to suppose that the force of the constitutional prohibition is diminished merely because confession of a guilty purpose precedes the act which it is subsequently employed to evidence. * * * [A]l-though prospective acts will doubtless ordinarily involve only speculative and insubstantial risks of incrimination, this will scarcely always prove true.\u201d Mar-chetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 54, 88 S.Ct. 697, 705, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), overruling United States v. Kahriger, 345 U.S. 22, 73 S.Ct. 510, 97 L.Ed. 754 (1953), and Lewis v. United States, 348 U.S. 419, 75 S.Ct. 415, 99 L.Ed. 475 (1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b520-6\">. The fact that counts 3 and 4 are directed at appellant\u2019s possession and transporta- \u25a0 tion of unstamped containers, and not at his failure to obtain revenue stamps <em>per se, </em>is irrelevant, since the effect of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5205(a) (2) is to require a distiller to obtain revenue stamps in order to lawfully possess and transport distilled spirits in containers. <em>See </em>Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 90-95, 88 S.Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b520-9\">COMBS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AWA\">(dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">I concur in Judge McCree\u2019s dissent.

I believe that, whether operating in Michigan, Tennessee, or elsewhere, \u201cmoonshiners\u201d make up a \u201cgroup inherently suspect of criminal activities\u201d just as much as the \u201cbig time\u201d gamblers who enjoy the protection of Marchetti. Emphasis is placed upon the fact that the alcohol tax laws are \u201cessentially noncriminal\u201d. This is so, it is argued, because such laws exist primarily to raise revenue. Such laws do, however, provide <em>criminal </em>sanction for their violation and in most states, while the manufacture of distilled spirits is not totally forbidden, the activity for which this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>convicted \u2014 -\u201cmoonshin-defendant was ing\u201d \u2014 is criminal activity wherever it is carried on.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Distinction is asserted to exist because the statute involved in <em>Marchetti </em>was purposely passed by Congress to interrupt criminal conduct \u2014 \u201cbig time\u201d gambling carried on, in part at least, by \u201cthe syndicate\u201d, a part of organized crime. It is argued that Congress cannot impair the Fifth Amendment rights of those so engaged, but may forbid use of the Fifth Amendment by those who choose to violate the revenue laws relating to distilled spirits. The \u201cmoonshiner\u201d has been as effectively deprived of the protection of the Fifth Amendment when he is convicted for failure to announce his intention to engage in criminal activity as is the interstate gambler, convicted for failure to register and disclose his intention to engage in crime. I am unable to discern legitimacy in the nuances employed to find distinction between the \u201cmoonshiner\u201d and members of \u201cthe syndicate\u201d. So long as <em>Mar-chetti </em>is the law, it should be followed without discrimination.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
