He said that he would. The exhibition, which had been arranged for but not seen by the superior in charge, proved to be controversial. Several administrative meetings were held, attended by the university president, the provost, and other officials, and after it had been up for five of the twenty-four days scheduled, the exhibition was removed. Claiming that this was an invasion of his constitutional rights, plaintiff sued for a mandatory injunction ordering the officials to make the space available for the equivalent of the unexpired period. The district court, after trial, granted the relief and defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-19\">Basically, the district court held that \u201cembarrassment\u201d and \u201cannoyance,\u201d causing defendants to conclude that the exhibition was \u201cinappropriate\u201d to the corridor, was insufficient to warrant interference with plaintiff\u2019s right of free speech. This holding was not grounded upon a finding that defendants were unreasonable in their opinion. The court refused autoptic profference of the exhibition, apparently taking the position that, at least in the absence of express regulations as to what was impermissible, defendants had no right to censor simply on the basis of offensiveness which fell short of unlawful obscenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-20\">We disagree. We first consider the nature and quality of plaintiff\u2019s interest. Plaintiff makes the bald pronouncement, \u201cArt is as fully protected by the Consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>tution as political or social speech.\u201d It is true that in the course of holding a motion picture entitled to First Amendment protection, the Court said in Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 1952, 343 U.S. 495, at 501, 72 S.Ct. 777, at 780, 96 L.Ed. 1098 that moving pictures affect public attitudes in ways \u201cranging from direct espousal of a political or social doctrine to the subtle shaping of thought which characterizes all artistic expression.\u201d However, this statement in itself recognizes that there are degrees of speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\"> There is no suggestion, unless in its cheap titles, that plaintiff\u2019s art was seeking to express political or social thought. <em>Cf. </em>People v. Radich, 26 N.Y. 114, 308 N.Y.S.2d 846, 257 N.E.2d 30. Cases dealing with students\u2019 rights to hear possibly unpopular speakers, <em>e.g., </em>Brooks v. Auburn University, D.Ala., 1969, 296 F.Supp. 188, aff\u2019d 5 Cir., 412 F.2d 1171; Dickson v. Sitterson, M.D. N.C., 1968, 280 F.Supp. 486; Smith v. University of Tennessee, E.D.Tenn., 1969, 300 F.Supp. 777; Snyder v. Board of Trustees, N.D.Ill., 1968, 286 F.Supp. 927, involve a medium and subject matter entitled to greater protection than plaintiff\u2019s art.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even as to verbal communication the extent of the protection may depend upon the subject matter. <em>See </em>New York Times v. Sullivan, 1964, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686; Garrison v. Louisiana, 1964, 379 U.S. 64, 85 S.Ct. 209, 13 L.Ed.2d 125. We consider plaintiff\u2019s constitutional interest minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\"> In this posture we turn to the question whether defendants have demonstrated a sufficient counterinterest to justify their action. The corridor was a passageway, regularly used by the public, including children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Several of the paintings were nudes, male or female, displaying the genitalia in what was described as \u201cclinical detail.\u201d A skeleton was fleshed out only in this particular. One painting bore the title, \u201cI\u2019m only 12 and already my mother\u2019s lover wants me.\u201d Another, \u201cI am the only virgin in my school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-9\">The defendants were entitled to consider the primary use to which the corridor was put. LeClair v. O\u2019Neil, D. Mass., 1969, 307 F.Supp. 621. See C. A. Wright, The Constitution on the Campus. 22 Vand.L.Rev. 1027, 1040-43 (1969). On the basis of the complaints received, and even without such, defendants were warranted in finding the exhibit inappropriate to that use. Where there was, in effect, a captive audience, defendants had a right to afford protection against \u201cassault upon individual privacy,\u201d see Redrup v. New York, 1967, 386 U.S. 767, 769, 87 S.Ct. 1414, 18 L.Ed.2d 515, short of legal obscenity. <em>Cf. </em>Emerson, Toward a General Theory of the First Amendment, 72 Yale L.J. 877, 938 (1963). To quote from Professor Wright, <em>supra, </em>at 1058,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-10\">\u201cThere are words that are not regarded as obscene, in the constitutional sense, that nevertheless need not be permitted in every context. Words that might properly be employed in a term paper about Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover or in a novel submitted in a creative writing course take on a very different coloration if they are bellowed over a loudspeaker at a campus rally or appear prominently on a sign posted on a campus tree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>Freedom of speech must recognize, at least within limits, freedom not to listen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">In hypereoncern with his personal rights plaintiff would not only regard his interest in self-expression as more important then the interests of his unwilling audience, but asks us to add nearly three weeks of such exposure to the five days he has already received. With all respect to the district court, this is a case that should never have been brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">Judgment reversed. Complaint dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">. The cited cases all rest to some extent upon principles of vagueness and over-breadth. We may doubt, however, the value of doctrines based on \u201cchilling effect\u201d and prejudice from lack of fair warning when no penalty is involved beyond an order to desist. In any event, the degree to which specificity will be required should correspond to the importance of the speech interest asserted. In the ease at bar the absence of a regulation against offensive exhibitions, anil the failure to describe what would be considered offensive, does not impress us as significant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1054-12\">. While the presence of children might be thought to show defendants inescapably reasonable, <em>cf. </em>Ginsberg v. New York, 1968, 390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195, we do not deem it necessary to make such a finding, and rest our decision on broader principles.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
