(United States v. de Polanco (9th Cir. 1970) 422 F.2d 1304; Witt v. United States (9th Cir.) 413 F.2d 303, cert. denied (1969) 396 U.S. 932, 90 S.Ct. 272, 4 L.Ed.2d 230.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-17\"> If Williams\u2019 second contention is that the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice is never sufficient to sustain a conviction, the contention has been often answered adversely to him. <em>(E. g., </em>Suhl v. United States (9th Cir.) 390 F.2d 547, cert. denied (1968) 391 U.S. 964, 88 S.Ct. 2035, 20 L.Ed.2d 879; Moody v. United States (9th Cir. 1967) 376 F.2d 525.) If the contention is merely that Knight\u2019s testimony was insufficient, the record does not support the contention. Knight\u2019s testimony was not incredible or unsubstantial on its face; nor was it wholly uncorroborated. The case was a proper one for submission to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-18\">His last contention requires more discussion. A customs officer, Jackson, testified that there had been relayed to him by another customs officer, Greppin, information received by Greppin from an informant. The informant was said to have told Greppin that he had seen part of the loading of marihuana into the concealed panels of a specifically described Jaguar. The informant told Greppin that the informant had not assisted in the loading or otherwise participated in the arrangements for shipping the marihuana. The informant also said that he had seen the Jaguar at a known narcotic dealer\u2019s house in Tijuana, Mexico. The Government stipulated that the informer at no time observed Williams on the day in question. The Jaguar belonged to Williams. When Williams\u2019 co-defendant, Knight, drove the loaded car to the border, customs officers, relying on the relayed information, searched the vehicle and found 40 pounds of concealed marihuana. Williams\u2019 motion to disclose the identity of the informer was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-19\">Under Roviaro v. United States (1957) 353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639, there is no fixed rule in respect of such disclosure, but a balancing test molded to fit the circumstances of the case. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>have concluded that there was no error in denying Williams\u2019 motion to disclose, because we are unable to say that the disclosure would have been \u201crelevant and helpful\u201d to Williams\u2019 defense. The informant did not participate in any way in the offense. By stipulation, the informant never saw Williams on the crucial day. Nothing other than speculation suggests that the informant\u2019s testimony could have been used to impeach Knight\u2019s testimony, because that testimony and the aspects of the informant\u2019s story revealed by Agent Jackson were reconcilable. Williams thus failed to carry his burden of showing a basis for requiring disclosure of an informant\u2019s identity. (E. <em>g., </em>Lannom v. United States (9th Cir. 1967) 381 F.2d 858, cert. denied (1968) 389 U.S. 1041, 88 S.Ct. 784, 19 L.Ed.2d 833; Alexander v. United States (9th Cir.) 362 F.2d 379, cert. denied (1966) 385 U.S. 977, 87 S.Ct. 519, 17 L.Ed.2d 439; Hurst v. United States (9th Cir. 1965) 344 F.2d 327.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
