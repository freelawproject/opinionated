ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b835-17\">In what marks a reappearance of the controversy in this court, the petitioner, Herbert Harvey, Inc., renews its challenge to the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over it as an employer of service and maintenance workers in buildings in the District of Columbia owned by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, commonly known as the World Bank. When the litigation was here previously, we reversed an order of the Board directing Harvey to bargain with the certified representative of those employees, and remanded the proceeding for determinations calculated to resolve the jurisdictional problem.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On remand, the Board rendered a supplemental decision <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>reaffirming its earlier decision,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the case is back for further review. We are satisfied, after careful study of the record, that the Board did not err in assuming jurisdiction over Harvey, and the order to bargain will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-19\">The complexity of the jurisdictional issue prompts us to retrace the procedural history of the dispute as a preface to an expression of our reasons for sustaining the Board. Government Service Employees\u2019 Union, Local 536, Building Service Employees\u2019 International Union, AFL-CIO, petitioned the Board for an election to ascertain its status as bargaining representative of certain service and maintenance employees <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in three buildings <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> housing the principal office of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>the World Bank at which Harvey, by contract with the Bank, manages the operation and maintenance. Harvey opposed the petition on the grounds that the Bank, and not Harvey, is the employer and that, in any event, the Bank is exempt from regulation by the Board and Harvey\u2019s relationship with the Bank is such that the Board should decline jurisdiction over Harvey.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The Board, after a hearing, directed a representation election, finding that Harvey is \u201can employer\u201d whose service and maintenance activities are \u201cnot so intimately connected with the purposes or operations of the World Bank as to warrant withholding the exercise of jurisdiction over the business of the Employer.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Harvey moved for reconsideration on averments that those findings are inconsistent with Board precedents, and that the Board had failed to determine the Bank\u2019s status as an employer. The motion was denied without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">In the Board-conducted election, the Union amassed a majority, and the Board formally certified it as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees. When Harvey subsequently refused to bargain, the Board\u2019s General Counsel issued an unfair labor practice complaint alleging that the refusal infringed provisions of the National Labor Relations Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Board deemed the decisive question to be essentially that resolved in the representation proceeding, and perceived no triable issue requiring a hearing. Consequently, it awarded a summary judgment that Harvey had violated the Act as charged, and ordered Harvey to bargain with the Union upon its request.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">Harvey then petitioned this court to review and set aside the Board\u2019s decision and order, raising only the jurisdictional point, and the Board cross-petitioned for enforcement of the order. Commenting upon an apparent inconsistency between that decision and prior holdings of the Board,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we held that the Board had \u201cerred in failing to find the Bank to be a joint employer with Harvey, in failing to make findings as to the Bank\u2019s status \u2014 whether exempt or not \u2014 and in failing to decide whether the Bank\u2019s status, if exempt, would require it to refuse to assert jurisdiction over Harvey.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We accordingly remanded the cause to the Board for further consideration in the light of our opinion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-15\">On remand, the Board issued a supplemental decision <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> reaffirming its prior decision and elucidating the basis upon which it predicated the bargaining order against Harvey. The World Bank, the Board held, enjoys immunity from its jurisdiction,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and our view that the Bank and Harvey are joint employers was accepted as the law of the case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But, the Board held further, Harvey has sufficient control over the working conditions of the service and maintenance employees at the World Bank as to enable it to bargain effectively with the Union.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Board also reviewed the previous decisions that had troubled us and, overruling one,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> considered them to be compatible with the result achieved here.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>The effect of the Board\u2019s supplemental decision is, of course, to reinstate its bargaining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The parties now return to this court, Harvey in an effort to annul the decision and the Board to obtain enforcement of the order. Harvey insists that the evidence shows that it is incapable of meaningful collective bargaining, and that the Board\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction is so much at war with Board precedents as to reach the point of administrative arbitrariness. To these and other facets of the Board\u2019s adjudication we now proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Although the World Bank is not a target of the Board\u2019s bargaining order, the status of that institution, as we signified in our opinion preceding the remand,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> bears vitally on the contest at hand. The Board, on remand, held that the Bank lay outside the ambit of the Act, and that holding Harvey readily accepts. The Board was influenced to that end by the Bank\u2019s genesis in an agreement ratified by many countries, its situation as a spe-eialized agency of the United Nations, and the unique advantages it enjoys.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> From these factors, \u201c[i]t [was] manifest\u201d to the Board \u201cthat the World Bank is an international organization which enjoys the privileges and immunities from the laws of the sovereignty in which it is located customarily extended to such organizations.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Recognizing that to sustain jurisdiction in the \u201cdelicate field of international relations there must be present the affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed,\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the Board could \u201cfind nothing in the language of the statute or in its legislative history that would lead us to conclude that Congress intended the Board to exercise its jurisdiction over the operations of the World Bank.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">Like Harvey, we approve the Board\u2019s determination in this regard, but that determination is not the finale, but only the prelude. The Board, it seems patent, has statutory jurisdiction over Harvey, <em>qua </em>Harvey,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and Harvey does not urge the contrary. The Board, however, has traditionally reserved a discretion to decline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>jurisdiction in particular cases where it believes the policies of the Act will not be effectuated by an exercise of its authority,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and Harvey does press for a declination. It may be expected that in the consideration and resolution of that contention in each of its argumentative aspects, the role of the World Bank will loom large.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The Board read our previous decision as holding that Harvey and the World Bank are joint employers of the workers in question.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> And the Board felt that it must, as we feel that we should, take that holding as the law of the case.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The issue then arising before the Board, as it stated,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> was whether, in this alliance of exempt and nonexempt employers, Harvey is vested with enough autonomy over the employment arrangements and working conditions to enable it to. bargain efficaciously with the Union.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> For Harvey is not required \u201cto do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>the impossible\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> or to engage in \u201ca mere \u2018exercise in futility; \u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> rather, \u201cthe purpose of collective bargaining is to produce an agreement and not merely to engage in talk for the sake of going through the motions.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> And \u201c[t]he doing of a useless and futile thing is no more required in collective bargaining between an employer and a labor union than in other activities.\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">On the record, the Board concluded, however, \u201cthat [Harvey] is fully capable of bargaining effectively with the Union regarding the wages, hours, and other conditions of employment of its employees.\u201d <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In reaching that conclusion, the Board looked first to the contract <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> which for many years has particularized the rights and liabilities of the parties,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> an initiation point it was free to select.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> To the Board it was \u201cplain that the contract * * * contemplated a completely independent relationship between the parties.\u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and to us an examination of the agreement discloses ample foundation for that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">The contract obligates Harvey to \u201cfurnish to the Bank complete operating and maintenance service\u201d and to \u201cprovide and .supervise all personnel necessary for\u201d that service. As the Board emphasized, the contract states that Harvey affords the service \u201cas an independent contractor,\u201d specifies that Harvey \u201cwill be solely responsible for the conduct of its employees,\u201d and binds Harvey to indemnify the Bank against liability or loss \u201carising out of the conduct of the Company\u201d or \u201cits employees.\u201d <footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>It was \u201cobvious\u201d to the Board, and upon a reasonable reading nearly so to us, that these stipulations were \u201cintended to make clear that as between the\u201d parties Harvey \u201cwas to be regarded as the Employer with primary responsibility over the employees performing services under the contract.\u201d <footnotemark>40</footnotemark> And since, as the Board pointed out, the contract does not elsewhere refer to the employees who are to perform the service, \u201cthere is no reservation of rights to the Bank to determine wage rates, to set hours of work, to discharge or hire, or otherwise to exercise authority over the conditions of employment of the employees.\u201d <footnotemark>41</footnotemark> That proposition draws support as well from the contractual provisions which specify the financial arrangements between the parties. The contract requires the Bank to compensate Harvey by a fixed monthly fee and to reimburse Harvey for all reasonable direct<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> costs, up to a stated monthly maximum,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> of affording the service. Reimbursable costs include the wages paid and the benefits afforded the employees <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and, as the Board states, the contract imposes no limitation on the wages Harvey pays the employees.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">In sum, it was the Board\u2019s overall estimate that \u201cthe contract discloses that the parties thereto intended that [Harvey] should assume complete control over the employees performing the maintenance services in the buildings occupied by the World Bank, subject only to the general [contractual] strictures * * * that the services by [Harvey] be rendered \u2018in an efficient, safe and businesslike manner and * * * as economically as sound business judgment warrants\u2019 and * * * that the \u2018cost\u2019 of the services rendered by [Harvey] be \u2018reasonable\u2019 \u201d.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> With contractual stipulations of such clear import as those before us, we perceive no sound ground upon which we might disturb that construction.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">Harvey contends, very properly, that the inquiry must extend beyond the language of the contract to the evidence describing the parties\u2019 actual practice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>and that the evidence demonstrates Harvey\u2019s impotency at the bargaining table. But the Board did consider the parties\u2019 relationship as revealed by the evidence, and in its light, as well as that shed by the contract, it found that Harvey is able to engage in meaningful collective bargaining. We ourselves have scrutinized the factors upon which the Board relied and the evidence upon which they were based, and conclude that the result reached by the Board is well supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The Board found that the hiring of employees to perform the work required by the contract fell primarily within Harvey\u2019s sphere, and so the evidence discloses. With occasional departures in procedure, Harvey receives the applications for appointment, reviews the applicants\u2019 references, and makes the decisions on employment, clearing with the Bank if there is doubt as to an applicant\u2019s acceptability.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Hiring is a constant activity, since absenteeism runs exceedingly high and replacements for the work force are a daily need.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Ordinarily, if a prospective employee has a normal reference on former employment and a clear police record, he is engaged to fill any vacancy existing.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> And while Harvey does not, as a matter of practice, discharge employees without consultation with the Bank,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> the testimony suggests that the practice is designed to avoid displeasing the Bank.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Supervision of the \u2022 employees\u2019 work, the Board also found, is Harvey\u2019s responsibility<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> and again the evidence sustains the Board\u2019s finding. Harvey maintains on-the-job supervisors who direct the details of the work done by both the day and night crews. The daytime supervisor, during the course of his daily contacts, frequently receives instructions from Bank officials, and these are passed on to the employees; sometimes a direction as to the work is given an employee directly.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> In the main, however, there is close observance of the contract provisions investing Harvey with control over the employees and disclaiming any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>duty upon the Bank relative to their performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\">The Board recognized that the Bank has to some extent participated in the hiring and firing of employees.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> It acknowledged that the Bank approves promotions and year-end wage increases but saw from the evidence that the Bank routinely agrees to them.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> But despite so much of an interlinking relationship between the Bank and Harvey over the employees, the Board found that primary control of the employees was vested by the contract in Harvey and was actually exercised by Harvey. In the Board\u2019s judgment, \u201c[s]o far as the record reveals, the extent of [Harvey\u2019s] acquiescence in the World Bank\u2019s participation in the hiring, discharge, and assignment of employees was no more than that which any service company would permit in order to please its clients,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and the World Bank\u2019s participation in promotions and the setting of wage scales was no more than an exercise of its right to police the costs being incurred under the contract.\u201d <footnotemark>58</footnotemark> \u201cIndeed,\u201d the Board observed, \u201cfor the World Bank to have participated to any great degree in the employment conditions of the employees would be to interfere with [Harvey\u2019s] obligation to obtain and retain the competent employees necessary to render the efficient and economical service which it was hired to provide under the contract with the World Bank.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Thus the Board was led to \u201cconclude that [Harvey] exercises effective control over the working conditions of its employees and is fully competent to bargain with the Union in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\u201d <footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Undoubtedly, the cost-plus-fixed-fee method of reimbursing and compensating Harvey gives the World Bank some control \u2014 in the form of cost ceilings periodically agreed to by the parties \u2014 over monetary rewards to the employees, but in no greater measure than in other instances where that arrangement is a contractual feature. Indeed, as we have stated, the Bank usually approves promotions and annual wage increases requested by Harvey. Moreover, cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts are in widespread use, not only in private industry but also in business with the Federal Government.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The Board exerts its jurisdiction over Government cost-plus-fixed-fee contractors,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> and we perceive no reason why it cannot<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The paramount question is whether enough authority over labor relations is lodged in such a contractor to enable a satisfaction of bargaining obligations under the Act, and we believe that in the case at bar there was.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The evidence sustains the Board\u2019s finding that Harvey is able to bargain effectively in the areas of prospective negotiation \u2014 hiring, firing, promotions, wages, benefits and other conditions of employment. True it is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>Harvey, like many \u2014 perhaps most<footnotemark>64</footnotemark>\u2014 other employers, may face practical limitations in some of these areas but, as the evidence denotes and the Board found, not in sufficient degree to frustrate bargaining efforts. The process of collective bargaining, we are instructed, may appropriately be invoked although the employer is subject to rather substantial handicaps. In NLRB v. E. C. Adkins &amp; Company,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> the Supreme Court held that guards at a plant producing military materials were Adkins\u2019 \u201cemployees\u201d <footnotemark>66</footnotemark> although they were required to be civilian auxiliaries to the Army\u2019s military police, and although the Army had power to veto the hiring or firing of any guard and to take corrective action through management to safeguard the caliber of plant protection. The Court sustained the Board\u2019s determination that Adkins had \u201ca sufficient residual measure of control over the terms and conditions of employment of the guards\u201d to permit their treatment as employees;<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> \"it matters not,\u201d said the Court, \u201cthat [Adkins] was deprived of some of the usual powers of an employer, such as the absolute power to hire and fire the guards and the absolute power to control their physical activities in the performance of their service. Those are relevant but not exclusive indicia of employer-employee relationship under [the Act].\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> The Court accordingly sustained the Board\u2019s order requiring Adkins to bargain with the guards\u2019 representative.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-16\">A conclusion that one joint employer has the dominant role in setting the conditions of employment depends upon the relative weight to be credited to the individual factors having pertinence. Here the Board weighed the factors\u2014 derived from the parties\u2019 contract and their actual practices \u2014 and found that Harvey had sufficient command of employment conditions to enable efficacious bargaining with the Union. What the Board faced was \u201cessentially a factual issue,\u201d <footnotemark>70</footnotemark> the Board\u2019s resolution of which is conclusive upon us unless unsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole,<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> or unless arbitrary or capricious.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-17\">Beyond that, the Board\u2019s task in this case was reconciliation of the benefits conferred by the Act with the immunities enjoyed by the World Bank, a task not fundamentally unlike others that have been thrust upon the Board before.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> The record reflects the Board\u2019s appreciation of the competing considerations inhering in the situation and its conscientious endeavor to effect a sensible accommodation. We think \u201c[t]he responsibility of representing the public interest in such matters and of reaching a judgment after giving due weight to all the relevant factors lay primarily with the Board.\u201d <footnotemark>74</footnotemark> We think, too, that \u201c[i]n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>the absence of some compelling evidence that the Board has failed to measure up to its responsibility, courts should be reluctant to overturn the considered judgment of the Board and to substitute their own ideas of the public interest.\u201d <footnotemark>75</footnotemark> We uphold the Board in its determination that Harvey is amply endowed to bargain effectively with the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">While, to be sure, the Board has broad discretion to determine when a jurisdictional exercise will serve the objectives of the Act,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> its power is not unlimited, and is never to be used dogmatically.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> As we recently noted in another instance where the Board\u2019s action departed substantially from that taken in seemingly like cases, \u201cthe Board cannot act arbitrarily nor can it treat similar situations in dissimilar ways. The Board has a responsibility to administer the Act fairly and rationally.\u201d <footnotemark>78</footnotemark> This admonition brings us to the question whether the Board\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over Harvey was so inconsistent with its precedents as to constitute arbitrary treatment amounting to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-15\">When the litigation was here before, we called attention to an apparent incongruity, \u201ctotally unexplained,\u201d <footnotemark>79</footnotemark> between the Board\u2019s adjudication in this case and those it had made in four cases involving nonexempt suppliers of food services to exempt institutions.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> On remand, the Board reexamined the eases we identified and, overruling one,<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> felt that its decision in the litigation at bar was in keeping with the remaining three.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> At Harvey\u2019s insistence, we now reexamine those holdings to ascertain the degree to which that might be so.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-16\">In two of the three decisions the Board left standing, food services were furnished to educational institutions <footnotemark>83</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>in the third to a hospital,<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> and in each the Board declined jurisdiction. In its supplemental decision herein, the Board distinguished this triology on the basis of an interconnection, which it found in the three cases, of the services supplied and the institution\u2019s noncommercial activities that gave rise to its exemption. The Board explained: <footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-5\">[T]he assertion of jurisdiction over a contractor providing services for an institution exempted from the process of the Act is dependent upon the relationship of the services performed to the exempted functions of the institution. Where the services are intimately connected with the exempted operations of the institution, the Board has found that the contractor shares the exemption; on the other hand, where the services are not essential to such operations the Board has found that the contractor is not exempt and asserts jurisdiction over the contractor\u2019s activities. By so doing the Board is enabled to strike a balance between the Congressional policy of excluding the noncommercial charitable and educational activities of the institution<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> and the policy of the statute to encourage collective bargaining \u2014 one of the fundamental purposes of the Act.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">The Board has consistently applied this rationale of distinction in a number of cases besides those comprising the triology.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> And not only have these applications resulted in declinations of jurisdiction in some cases but also in assumptions of jurisdiction in others.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>What stands out in the Board\u2019s decisions is careful analysis and appraisal of the facts in individual cases in order to determine whether its \u201cintimately connected\u201d test leads to the one result or the other.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> And so it was that the Board concluded that the services Harvey supplies were not so related to the functions of the World Bank as to warrant a withholding of jurisdiction:<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-4\">The World Bank is an international investment institution engaged in making or guaranteeing loans for productive reconstruction and development projects in the territories of its members. The Bank supplements its investment activities by providing technical assistance of various kinds to underdeveloped member countries. [Harvey\u2019s] employees are engaged exclusively in the operation and maintenance of the buildings in which the World Bank is located. These housekeeping duties performed by [Harvey\u2019s] employees have no connection with the functions of the World Bank as an investment institution.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApN\">Numerous cases attest the broad scope of the Board\u2019s discretion in determining whether an abstention from jurisdiction . is likely to promote the objectives of the Act.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> \u201cThe extent to which the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>chooses to exercise its statutory jurisdiction,\u201d the Fifth Circuit aptly warns, \u201cis a matter of administrative policy within the Board\u2019s discretion, and in the absence of extraordinary circumstances whether jurisdiction should be exercised is for the Board, not the courts, to determine.\u201d <footnotemark>94</footnotemark> In situations wherein nonexempt contractors deal with exempt organizations, the Board has drawn the line of demarcation between its jurisdictional assertions and non-assertions so as to separate activities that are \u201cintimately connected\u201d with the exempted functions from those that are not. Not only does this distinction strike us as rational but we also recognize the need for indulging some leeway in its application. Administrators, no less than judges, may differ in their views on the same subjects without becoming arbitrary\u2014 even in their views as to whether two not unlike subjects require similar or dissimilar treatment.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> Certainly when the administrative determination on that score stays within the zone of reasonableness, we are not at liberty to upset it simply because another determination might also be logical.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> We do not find in the Board\u2019s holding in this ease such a departure from its holdings in other cases resembling it as to support Harvey\u2019s claim of arbitrariness.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The petition to review is denied.

The agreement reached at the conference was subsequently accepted by 39 of the 44 participating nations. The agreement established the Bank as an intergovernmental institution, corporate in form, with all of its capital stock being owned by its member governments. In 1947 the Bank became a specialized agency of the United Nations. Under the agreement the Bank enjoys certain privileges and immunities. Thus the governors, directors, officers, and employees of the Bank are immune from legal process for acts performed in their official capacities, and, unless they are local nationals, they are to be accorded the same immunities from immigration restrictions, alien registration requirements, and national service obligations, and the same treatment in respect to travel facilities as are accorded officials of member governments. The archives of the Bank are inviolable and its assets immune from seizure, attachment or execution prior to delivery of final judgment against it.

In <em>Crotty Bros., Inc., supra </em>note 80, an independent supplier of food service management contracted to provide Trinity College, a nonprofit educational institution, with food service on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis. The operation, paid for out of Trinity's budget, provided eating facilities for resident students, faculty and administrators. Trinity furnished and maintained the facilities and equipment, and shared with the contractor the control over the budget and labor relations. There was no opportunity for the contractor to profit from the operations. There was no other place within a mile of Trinity\u2019s campus at which food could be obtained. Because of the relationship of the food services to Trinity\u2019s educational program, the Board declined jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-20\">Similarly, in <em>Prophet Co., supra </em>note 80, an independent contractor provided food services to Whitewater State University, a nonprofit state-operated institution, in facilities for students, faculty, staff and alumni. The contractor received a fixed fee for every student enrolled in the university\u2019s board plan and a percentage of cash sales it made. The university supplied all fixed equipment, and retained considerable supervisory con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>trol over the operation. No comparable facilities were available within a reasonable distance of the campus. Following <em>Grotty, </em>the Board declined jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">In <em>Specialized Maintenance Servs., Inc., supra </em>note 80, the Board declined jurisdiction over a contractor furnishing service and maintenance employees at Seton Hall University. The Board, in its supplemental decision, was unable to address the apparent conflict with <em>Grotty Bros. </em>and <em>Prophet Go. </em>because no record had been made in <em>Specialized Maintenance. </em>Herbert Harvey, Inc., <em>supra </em>note 2, 1968-1 CCH NLRB It 22,441 at 29,603.

In <em>Horn </em>tC- <em>Hardart Go., supra </em>note 80, an independent contractor provided a food service operation for a nonprofit hospital. The hospital prepared all menus for the patients, supervised the preparation and nutritive contents of the food served them, and decided the times at which their meals would be served. The operation included principally a cafeteria for hospital employees, a coffee shop for hospital visitors, and a dining room for hospital faculty. The contractor's employees were required to meet the hospital\u2019s standards as to sanitation and clothing, and were subject to direction by the hospital staff in the performance of their duties. The Board declined jurisdiction because of the connection the food service operation bore to the patient care and medical education purposes of the hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"85\">\n<p id=\"b845-17\">.

For example, the Board, since 1950, has declined jurisdiction over racetracks because of their essentially local nature and extensive local regulation, actual or potential, <em>e. g., </em>Hialeah Race Course, Inc., 125 N.L.R.B. 388 (1959), Los Angeles Turf Club, Inc., 90 N.L.R.B. 20 (1950), and, in the application of the \u201cintimately connected\u201d test, has likewise declined jurisdiction over independent employers and activities closely related to the functioning of the racetrack operation. <em>H. g., </em>Local 343, Hotel Employees Union (Resort Concessions), 148 N.L.R.B. 208, 213-214 (1964) (food and beverage concessions); Walter A.

Where the institution\u2019s activities are noncommercial in nature and \u201cintimately connected\u201d with its charitable purposes and activities, jurisdiction is declined. See, e. <em>g., </em>Young Men\u2019s Christian Ass\u2019n, 146 N.L.R.B. 20, 22 (1964) (community service organization); Trustees of Columbia University, <em>supra </em>note 86, 97 N.L.R.B. at 426, 427 (libraries of educational institution). On the other hand, where the institution\u2019s activities are commercial in character or are not \u201cintimately connected\u201d with its charitable functions, jurisdiction is asserted. See, e. <em>g., </em>Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, <em>supra </em>note 87, 143 N.L.R.B. at 572-573 (research exclusively for Federal Government) ; Massachusetts Labor Relations Comm\u2019n (Massachusetts Hospital Serv., Inc.), 138 N.L.R.B. 1329, 1331 (1962) (health and accident insurance services).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"90\">\n<p id=\"b846-7\">. The Board\u2019s rationale is not whether the activity under scrutiny is essential to the functioning of the exempted operation but whether it is an integral attribute of that operation. Thus in Richmond of New Jersey, Inc., <em>supra </em>note 89, 1968-1 CCH NLRB \u00b6 21,979 at 28,884, the Board stated that \u201con the basis of the whole record, it must be concluded that the services rendered to the hospital by the employer were not so integrated and interwoven with the purposes and operations of the hospital as to warrant the Board withholding jurisdiction over the employer also. * * * The fact that the employer\u2019s operations are necessary and essential to the functioning of the hospital, that they add to the comfort and convenience of patients, and that some of them are subject to review and approval of the hospital do not dictate a different conclusion in this case.\u201d See also Local 343, Hotel Employees Union (Resort Concessions), <em>supra </em>note 88, 148 N.L.R.B. at 214.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"91\">\n<p id=\"b846-14\">. It was by an application of the \u201cintimately connected\u201d standard that the Board, from the very beginning, has insisted that its jurisdiction is appropriately exercised over Harvey. In its first decision--in the representation proceeding \u2014 the Board concluded \u201cthat the maintenance and service activities of [Harvey] are not so intimately connected with the purposes or operations of the World Bank as to warrant withholding the exercise of jurisdiction over the business of [Harvey].\u201d Herbert Harvey, Inc., <em>supra </em>note 7, 159 N.L.R.B. at 255.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"92\">\n<p id=\"b846-15\">.
