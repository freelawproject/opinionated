App. \u00a7 462. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-21\">On appeal he contends: (1) that the war in Vietnam is illegal. Inasmuch as appellant may not go to Vietnam, the issue would seem to be moot. Be that as it may, this type of an allegation is not a defense to a prosecution for failure or refusal to submit to induction. United States v. Leavy, 422 F.2d 1155 (9th Cir., 1970); Rusk v. United States, 419 F.2d 133 (9th Cir. 1969); United States v. Mitchell, 369 F.2d 323, 324 (2d Cir. 1966), <em>cert. denied </em>386 U.S. 972, 87 S.Ct. 1162, 18 L.Ed.2d 132; (2) he claims a violation of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Constitution in that the Selective Service Act does not conscript men in the war industries which profit by war, and exempts men under 18% and over age 26. This issue has been answered against appellant\u2019s contentions. Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954); Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.S. 464, 69 S.Ct. 198, 93 L.Ed. 163 (1948); Bertelsen v. Cooney, 213 F.2d 275 (5th Cir. 1954), <em>cert. denied </em>348 U.S. 856, 75 S.Ct. 81, 99 L.Ed. 674. The equal protection clause, as provided in the Fourteenth Amendment, or as implied in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, merely requires that all legislative classifications have a reasonable basis and that everyone placed within a classification be treated similarly. These classifications meet all requirements; (3) that appellant is being denied due process of law because he is being required to engage in a war which is not authorized by law. Appellant cites no authority, nor do we find any supporting this contention; (4) that the religious training and belief requirement of the statute is unconstitutional because it violates the First Amendment. He relies on United States v. Sisson, 297 F.Supp. 902 (D.Mass.1969), prob. juris, postponed 396 U.S. 812, 90 S.Ct. 92, 24 L.Ed.2d 65. This circuit has declined to follow the <em>Sisson logic. </em>Negre v. Larsen, 418 F.2d 908 (9th Cir. 1969); and (5) lastly, appellant contends that the statute requires appellant to subject himself to criminal prosecution in order to challenge his classification. This contention is without substance. Clark v. Gabriel, 393 U.S. 256, 89 S.Ct. 424, 21 L.Ed.2d 418 (1968); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We find nothing in United States v. Seeger, 380 U.S. 163, 85 S.Ct. 850, 13 L.Ed.2d 733 (1965), which is of help to appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
