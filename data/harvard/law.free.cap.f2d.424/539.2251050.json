Other witnesses in the bank were unable to identify him as one of the two participants in this armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-28\">Two errors are <em>urged </em>\u2014 one: that the evidence was insufficient to convict appellant. We disagree. The evidence, though conflicting, was abundantly sufficient to establish appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Two: </em>that the court erred in giving an instruction that the appellant was not required to take the stand, in his own defense, and that his failure could create no inference against appellant. (R.T. 310). Appellant\u2019s counsel first objected to the giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>of such instruction (R.T. 231), then waived any objection, stating \u201cwe will accept that instruction.\u201d (R.T. 233). Apart from the waiver, the instruction was proper. United States v. Jones, 406 F.2d 1297, 1298 (9th Cir. 1969). It was also beneficial to the appellant, rather than harmful, in a bank robbery case. Coleman v. United States, 367 F.2d 388 (9th Cir. 1966). <em>Cf. </em>also: Aiuppa v. United States, 393 F.2d 597, 602-603 (10th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
