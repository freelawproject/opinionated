Our review of the record satisfies us that there was no error in the instruction and that the impropriety in closing argument was not such as to warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-24\">While, on the whole record, counsel\u2019s closing argument to the jury does not warrant reversal, it calls for comment. Defense counsel argued that one of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses \u201ctold a lie, that he committed perjury on the stand * * *.\u201d We occasionally have found it necessary to remind counsel of the elementary rule, stated in the Canons of Ethics and interpretative opinions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which forbids an advocate from arguing to the jury <em>his </em>opinion or <em>his </em>appraisal of the issues, of the evidence, or of the credibility of a witness. It is unprofessional conduct, meriting discipline by the court, for counsel either to vouch for his own witnesses or to categorize opposing witnesses as \u201cliars\u201d; that issue is <em>for the jury. </em>Not unlike yet other courts, we have more than once noted the frequency with which our records disclose violations of standards of permissible argument. .As we said in Harris v. United States, 131 U.S.App.D.C. 105, 108, 402 F.2d 656, 659 (1968), we \u201cmust rely primarily on the trial judges to make clear that they do not want such argument,\u201d and we further pointed out that \u201cdisciplinary mechanisms are available to the trial courts to deal with unlawyerlike behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-25\">We are fortified in our reiteration of our view in the foregoing respects after consideration of the Code of Professional Responsibility prepared by the American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>Bar Association Special Committee on Evaluation of Ethical Standards and unanimously adopted by the ABA House of Delegates in 1969, with specific reference, for present purposes, to DR 7-106(C) (4) which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-4\">\u201c(C) In appearing in his professional capacity before a tribunal, a lawyer shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-5\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-6\">(4) Assert his personal opinion as to the justness of a cause, as to the credibility of a witness, as to the culpability of a civil litigant, or as to the guilt or innocence of an accused; but he may argue, on his analysis of the evidence, for any position or conclusion with respect to the matters stated herein.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"akj-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-26\">. <em>Of., </em>to like effect, EC 7-24, Code of Professional Responsibility, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
