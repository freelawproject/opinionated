Our review of the record reflects more than ample evidentiary support for the Board\u2019s findings, conclusions and order which, with a single exception, were an adoption of the recommendations of the Trial Examiner. The exception lies with a finding by the Trial Examiner that an employee, Lucas, was not discharged for discriminatory reasons and a finding by the Board that Lucas\u2019 termination was unlawfully motivated. The evidence pertaining to the discharge of Lucas is largely circumstantial in nature and capable of supporting different inferences. In such case it is well within the province of the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>to draw a different inference from the evidence than that of the examiner although the ultimate finding of the examiner may not be clearly erroneous. Rocky Mountain Natural Gas Co. v. NLRB, 10 Cir., 326 F.2d 949. So, too, a violation need not be solely motivated by union discrimination. Bets Baking Co. v. NLRB, 10 Cir., 380 F.2d 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">The order will be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
