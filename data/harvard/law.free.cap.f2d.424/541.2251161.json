We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-27\">Appellant is currently serving an eight-year sentence for violating 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a), selling narcotic drugs (Heroin) not in the original stamped package, to which he pled guilty. In his \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate sentence, appellant contends that his guilty plea \u201cwas coerced by the then existing weight of authorities which held that the privilege against self-incrimination could not be asserted by those in [his] circumstances.\u201d He urges that the reasoning in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Leary v. United States, 1969, 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57, applies to his case, arguing that by being required to register and pay the tax he is being forced to incriminate himself for a state prosecution. The district court denied relief based upon this Court\u2019s opinion in United States v. Walker, 5th Cir. 1969, 414 F.2d 876. For the reasons expressed in <em>Walker, </em>the judgment below is affirmed. See also Turner v. United States, 1970, 396 U.S. 398, 90 S.Ct. 642, 24 L.Ed.2d 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-17\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this pro se case summarily, pursuant to this Court\u2019s local Rule 9(c) (2), appellant having failed to file a brief within the time fixed by Rule 31, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
