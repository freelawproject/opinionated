Denney for the policy issued to him by Selected Risks Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-25\">The district court found that there was a misrepresentation of fact in the application, that the misrepresentation was material, that it was knowingly made, and that Selected Risks had not waived its right to cancel the policy by failing to give timely notice to the insured of its intention to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-26\">Upon consideration of the record, the briefs, and oral argument, we find no reversible error. Therefore, the judgment below will be</p>\n<p id=\"b617-27\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
