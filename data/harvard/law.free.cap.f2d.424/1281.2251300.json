Defendant, the principal of the high school in Marlboro, Massachusetts, admits that there was no written school regulation governing hair length or style but contends that students and parents were aware that \u201cunusually long hair\u201d was not permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-4\">On these sparse facts the parties submitted the ease posed by plaintiff\u2019s request for injunctive relief against the deprivation of his rights under 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 1983. Each relied on the failure of the other to sustain his burden of proof, plaintiff claiming that he should prevail in the absence of evidence that his appearance had caused any disciplinary problems, and defendant maintaining that plaintiff had failed to carry his burden of showing either that a fundamental right had been infringed or that defendant had not been motivated by a legitimate school concern. The district court granted plaintiff\u2019s request for a permanent injunction and ordered plaintiff reinstated. Richards v. Thurston, 304 F.Supp. 449 (D.Mass.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-5\"> Defendant, apart from his argument on the merits, insists that the district court erred in not abstaining pending consideration by the courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. We are in entire sympathy with the proposition that questions involving school board authority ought to be resolved whenever possible on a nonconsti-tutional basis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, however, we agree with the district court that Leonard v. School Committee of Attle-boro, 349 Mass. 704, 212 N.E.2d 468 (1965), a case containing similar facts, forecloses that nonconstitutional approach and clearly suggests that the courts of Massachusetts would have ruled against plaintiff on these facts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1346-14\">Plaintiff, too, advances a narrow argument for prevailing \u2014 the lack of any specific regulation authorizing suspension for unusual hair styles. We do not accept the opportunity. We take as given defendant's allegation in his answer that parents and students \u2014 including plaintiff \u2014 were aware that unusually long hair was not permitted. Moreover, we would not wish to see school officials unable to take appropriate action in facing a problem of discipline or distraction simply because there was no preexisting rule on the books.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-15\">Coming to the merits, we are aware of a thicket of recent eases concerning a student\u2019s wearing of long hair in a public high school.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While several of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>decisions holding against the student have relied on the prior occurrence of disruptions caused by unusual hair styles,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we think it fair to say that many of those courts would hold against the student on a barren record such as ours, on the grounds that the student had not demonstrated the importance of the right he asserts. On the other hand, in few of the cases holding for the student was there any evidence of prior disruptions caused by hair styles. Despite the obvious disagreement over the proper analytical framework, each of the \u201cpro-hair\u201d courts held explicitly or implicitly that the school authorities failed to carry their burden of justifying the regulation against long hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-5\">What appears superficially as a dispute over which side has the burden of persuasion is, however, a very fundamental dispute over the extent to which the Constitution protects such uniquely personal aspects of one\u2019s life as the length of his hair, for the view one takes of the constitutional basis \u2014 if any \u2014for the right asserted may foreshadow both the placement and weight of the ev-identiary burden which he imposes on the parties before him. For this reason, we resist the understandable temptation, when one is not the final arbiter of so basic a constitutional issue, to proceed directly to an application of the constitutional doctrine without attempting to ascertain its source as precisely as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-8\">It is perhaps an easier task to say what theories we think do <em>not </em>apply here. We recognize that there may be an element of expression and speech involved in one\u2019s choice of hair length and style, if only the expression of disdain for conventionality. However, we reject the notion that plaintiff\u2019s hair length is of a sufficiently communicative character to warrant the full protection of the First Amendment. United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968); Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503, 507-508, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969); <em>see </em>Cowgill v. California, 396 U.S. 371, 90 S.Ct. 613, 24 L.Ed.2d 590 (1970), Harlan, J. concurring; <em>cf. </em>Close v. Lederle, 424 F.2d 988 (1st Cir. 1970), filed this date. That protection extends to a broad panoply of methods of expression, but as the non-verbal message becomes less distinct, the justification for the substantial protections of the First Amendment becomes more remote. Nor do we see the logic of expanding the right of marital privacy identified in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965), into a right to go public as one pleases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>Our rejection of those constitutional protections in this case is not intended to denigrate the understandable desire of people to be let alone in the governance of those activities which may be deemed uniquely personal. As we discuss below, we believe that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment establishes a sphere of personal liberty for every individual, subject to reasonable intrusions by the state in furtherance of legitimate state interests.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\">The idea that there are substantive rights protected by the \u201cliberty\u201d assurance of the Due Process Clause is almost too well established to require discussion. Many of the cases have involved rights expressly guaranteed by one or more of the first eight Amendments.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But it is clear that the enumeration of certain rights in the Bill of Rights has not been construed by the Court to preclude the existence of other substantive rights implicit in the \u201cliberty\u201d assurance of the Due Process Clause. In the 1920\u2019s the Court held that such \u201cliberty\u201d includes the right of parents to send their children to private schools as well as public schools and to have their children taught the German language. Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 534-535, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399-400, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923). In 1958, the Court held that \u201cthe right to travel [to a foreign country] is a party of the \u2018liberty\u2019 of which the citizen cannot be deprived without the due process of law under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, 125, 78 S.Ct. 1113, 1118, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204 (1958); followed in Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U.S. 500, 505-506, 84 S.Ct. 1659, 12 L.Ed.2d 992 (1964). More recently, the Court, without specifically ascribing its source, established the right to travel interstate as a right fundamental to our Federal Union despite the absence of any specific mention thereof in the Constitution. United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 757, 759, 86 S.Ct. 1170, 16 L.Ed.2d 239 (1966); Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 629-631, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969). Such a right of interstate travel being more inherent in and essential to a Federal Union than the right to travel abroad established in <em>Kent </em>and Aptheker,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we can only conclude that such right must a fortiori be an aspect of the \u201cliberty\u201d assured by the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-10\">We do not say that the governance of the length and style of one\u2019s hair is necessarily so fundamental as those substantive rights already found implicit in the \u201cliberty\u201d assurance of the Due Process Clause, requiring a \u201ccompelling\u201d showing by the state before it may be impaired. Yet \u201cliberty\u201d seems to us an incomplete protection if it encompasses only the right to do momentous acts, leaving the state free to interfere with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>those personal aspects of our lives which have no direct bearing on the ability of others to enjoy their liberty. As the court stated in Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Botsford, 141 U.S. 250, 251, 11 S.Ct. 1000, 1001, 35 L.Ed. 734 (1891):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1349-5\">\u201cNo right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from ,all restraint or interference of others, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law. As well said by Judge Cooley, \u2018The right to one\u2019s person may be said to be a right of complete immunity: to be let alone.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1349-6\">Indeed, a narrower view of liberty in a free society might, among other things, allow a state to require a conventional coiffure of all its citizens, a governmental power not unknown in European history.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1349-7\">We think the Founding Fathers understood themselves to have limited the government\u2019s power to intrude into this sphere of personal liberty, by reserving some powers to the people.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The debate concerning the First Amendment is illuminating. The specification of the right of assembly was deemed mere surplusage by some, on the grounds that the government had no more power to restrict assembly than it did to tell a man to wear a hat or when to get up in the morning. The response by Page of Virginia pointed out that even those \u201ctrivial\u201d rights had been known to have been impaired \u2014 to the Colonists\u2019 consternation \u2014 but that the right of assembly ought to be specified since it was so basic to other rights.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Founding Fathers wrote an amendment for speech and assembly; even they did not deem it necessary to write an amendment for personal appearance.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We conclude that within the commodious concept of liberty, embracing freedoms great and small, is the right to wear one\u2019s hair as he wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-9\">Determining that a personal liberty is involved answers only the first of two questions. The second is whether there is an outweighing state interest justifying the intrusion. The answer to this question must take into account the nature of the liberty asserted, the context in which it is asserted, and the extent to which the intrusion is confined to the legitimate public interest to be served. For example, the right to appear au na-turel at home is relinquished when one sets foot on a public sidewalk. Equally obvious, the very nature of public school education requires limitations on one\u2019s personal liberty in order for the learning process to proceed. Finally, a school rule which forbids skirts shorter than a certain length while on school grounds would require less justification than one requiring hair to be cut, which affects the student twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, nine months a year. <em>See </em>Westley v. Rossi, 305 F.Supp. at 713-714.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>Once the personal liberty is shown, the countervailing interest must either be self-evident or be affirmatively shown. We see no inherent reason why decency, decorum, or good conduct requires a boy to wear his hair short. Certainly eccentric hair styling is no longer a reliable signal of perverse behavior. We do not believe that mere unattractiveness in the eyes of some parents, teachers, or students, short of uneleanliness, can justify the proscription.. Nor, finally, does such compelled conformity to conventional standards of appearance seem a justifiable part of the educational process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">In the absence of an inherent, self-evident justification on the face of the rule, we conclude that the burden was on the defendant. Since he offered no justification, the judgment of the district court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1346-6\">.

Smith, 310 F.Supp. 732 (D.Me.1970), the court explicitly accepted the proposition that the right to wear one\u2019s hair at any length is an aspect of personal liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, following the \u201cpro-hair\u201d cases cited above. However, the court on the facts before it held that the state vocational school had met its substantial burden of justification by a showing that neatness of appearance enhanced the employment opportunities of its students.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1347-14\">. <em>See also </em>two Fifth Circuit \u201cfreedom button\u201d cases expressly differentiated because of the disruptive response to the plaintiffs in the latter case which had not occurred in the former: Burnside v.

That \u201cprivacy\u201d has not been generally understood in the latter sense is indicated by the definition of privacy given by Alan F.

The fact that the \u201cliberty\u201d protected by the Due Process Clause includes such a sphere of personal liberty does <em>not </em>require the state to provide a special forum for the exercise of such personal liberty. Moreover, having provided a forum, the state may revoke it when the exercise of personal liberty becomes inimical to the societal interests affected by such use of the state\u2019s forum. <em>Cf., </em>Close v.
