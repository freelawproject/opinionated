F. A. REYNOLDS CO., Inc., Respondent.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b1132-9\">No. 28426</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b1132-10\">Summary Calendar.</p>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b1132-11\">United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b1132-12\">April 9, 1970.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b1132-21\">Marcel Mallet-Prevost, Asst. Gen. Counsel, N.L.R.B., Washington, D. C., Elmer P. Davis, Region 16, N.L.R.B., Fort Worth, Tex., Arnold Ordman, General Counsel, Dominick L. Manoli, Associate General Counsel, John I.

See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I; and Huth v. Southern Pacific Company, 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 526, Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-26\">The National Labor Relations Board found that F. A. Reynolds Co., Inc., had violated Section 8(a) (5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act, Title 29, U.S.C. Section 151 et seq., by refusing to bargain with International Union of Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers AFL-CIO, the certified exclusive representative of its employees. The sole issue on this petition for enforcement is whether the findings are supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>substantial evidence on the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-5\">There is ample record support for the Board\u2019s findings that negotiations had not reached an impasse and that F. A. Reynolds Co., Inc., violated Section 8(a) (5) and (1) when it refused to bargain; accordingly, these findings may not be disturbed by us. N.L.R.B. v. Mrs. Baird\u2019s Bread, Dallas, 5 Cir. 1969, 420 F.2d 484; N.L.R.B. v. McLane Company, Inc., 5 Cir. 1968, 405 F.2d 483, 484, and N.L.R.B. v. Texas Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 5 Cir. 1966, 365 F.2d 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-6\">All other contentions of respondent are without merit. The order of the Board is</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-7\">Enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
