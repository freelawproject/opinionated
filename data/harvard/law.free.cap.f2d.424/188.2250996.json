Horace E. Hollis, an employee of Charleston Drydock, was injured when he slipped on a drop of oil on the vessel\u2019s deckplates as he attempted to lift and move a 75 pound governor, a machine used to synchronize the speeds of the ship\u2019s two diesel engines.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">Hollis brought suit against the United States under the Public Vessels Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 781. He alleged aggravation of a pre-existing left inguinal hernia discovered two days before the accident. Also he claimed that as a result of the accident he sustained a right hernia. Hollis underwent a number of surgical operations to correct these conditions. The operations, however, were not successful. Moreover, as a result of the operations, one of the plaintiff\u2019s testicles atrophied. The nerves and blood vessels into the scrotum were damaged and plaintiff became impotent. The plaintiff attributed his injuries and consequent suffering and disabilities to the unseaworthy condition of the vessel and the negligence of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">The United States impleaded Charleston Drydock, plaintiff\u2019s employer, and its Trustee in Bankruptcy, as third-party defendants, asserting a right of indemnity for any liability which might arise. The indemnity claim was predicated upon an express provision in the ship repair contract, as well as upon an implied contractual warranty of workmanlike performance. In relevant part the provision is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-13\">The Contractor indemnifies and holds harmless the Government * * * against all suits * * * (including, without limitation, * * * personal injury * * *) to which the Government * * * may be subject or put by reason of damage or injury * * * to the property or person of anyone other than the Government, its agencies, instrumentalities and personnel * * * arising or resulting <em>in whole or in part </em>from the fault, negligence, wrongful act or wrongful omission of the Contractor, or any subcontractor, his or their servants, agents or employees; * * *. Such indemnity shall include, without limitation, suits, actions, claims, costs or demands of any kind whatsoever, resulting from * * * personal injury * * * occurring during the period of work on the vessel * * * . (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-18\">In his first order, the District Judge found that the Navy, while repairing the ship\u2019s generator, created an unseaworthy condition and was negligent in failing \u201cto remove or clean up the oil after they knew or should have known that the same had been spilled * * He further found that the \u201cplaintiff was not negligent in handling the governor singularly\u201d (i. e., alone and without assistance) and \u201cthat the drydock [company] in no way contributed to plaintiff\u2019s accident or subsequent injury.\u201d There was, the trial judge concluded, no breach of either the express indemnity provision or the implied warranty of workmanlike performance. Judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff against the United States only.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-20\">However, the plaintiff was awarded only $2,750, the court\u2019s evaluation of the damage sustained up until the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s first hernia operation. The District Judge was of the view that Hollis had failed to meet his burden of showing a causal connection between the original hernia operation and the later aggravation of the plaintiff\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Hollis submitted a post-trial motion seeking an amendment of the order with respect to damages, or a new trial on the damage issue. The court then amended the original order, explaining that it had \u201coverlooked certain testimony before the South Carolina Industrial Commission * -* *\u201d which was submitted at trial. This testimony fully supported Hollis\u2019 contention that the aggravation of the left inguinal hernia and other sequelae directly resulted from the accident. The District Judge stated that he had not previously awarded for this injury, \u201cbeing under the impression that plaintiff was entitled to an award only for damages from a right inguinal hernia which was proximately and admittedly caused by the accident. Plaintiff had a pre-existing left inguinal hernia before the accident but was able to work and perform normal duties until it was aggravated by the accident.\u201d Taking into account the testimony before the South Carolina Industrial Commission, the court increased the award to $22,750.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Still adhering to the original holding that the \u201cdrydock was not guilty of any form of negligence and consequently the entire burden of liability rests with the United States * * *,\u201d the court nevertheless, in determining the amount of damages, later in the same order stated that \u201c [consideration of the fact that plaintiff was guilty of some contributory negligence in doing the lifting is also a part of the court\u2019s determination.\u201d As in his original order, the District Judge denied indemnity to the United States against Charleston Drydock.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The United States brought this appeal to determine \u201c[w] hether the district court\u2019s finding that plaintiff was eon-tributorily negligent necessarily compels a finding that, with respect to the damage award against it in Hollis\u2019 favor, the United States is entitled to indemnity from Charleston Drydock under the latter\u2019s express contract of indemnity and also under its implied warranty of workmanlike performance.\u201d The question of indemnity is the only one raised in this court; the appeal does not challenge the $22,750 award finally made in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">Charleston Drydock undertook to indemnify the United States for any damages arising from injury to anyone other than the Government or its employees caused \u201cin whole or in part\u201d by Charleston Drydock or its employees. Therefore, if the accident resulted from Hollis\u2019 negligence in any degree, the United States is entitled to indemnification from his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">This provision, admittedly broad, is in no way unconscionable. It has long been settled law that a party may expressly agree to be held liable, even if the accident stems solely from the fault of another. See,, e. g., Norris, Maritime Personal Injuries \u00a7 56 at p. 152. The courts have consistently enforced contractual indemnity provisions placing ultimate liability upon an indemnitor, even where the indemnitee\u2019s fault also contributed to the loss. Weyerhaeuser S. S. Co. v. Nacirema Operating Co., 355 U.S. 563, 78 S.Ct. 438, 2 L.Ed.2d 491 (1958); Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic S. S. Corp., 350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133 (1956); American Stevedores v. Porello, 330 U.S. 446, 67 S.Ct. 847, 91 L.Ed. 1011 (1947); Smith v. United States, 336 F.2d 165 (4th Cir. 1964); Shenker v. United States, 322 F.2d 622 (2nd Cir. 1963), cert. denied sub nom., American Stevedores, Inc. v. Shenker, 376 U.S. 907, 84 S.Ct. 659, 11 L.Ed.2d 606. Considering the variety of circumstances in which the courts allow recovery for injury to a seaman where the vessel is considered unseaworthy, Weyerhaeuser S. S. Co. v. Nacirema, <em>supra; </em>Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic S. S. Corp., <em>supra, </em>it is not surprising that the United States, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>owner of the vessel, has attempted, through an indemnity provision, to limit its liability in situations where it is not solely at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The appellees question whether the terms of the contract are explicit enough to hold them liable where the United States is also negligent. Recently, the Supreme Court has had occasion to consider what language in a contract is needed to hold an indemnitor liable where the indemnitee is at fault. United States v. Seckinger, 397 U.S. 203, 90 S.Ct. 880, 25 L.Ed.2d 224 (March 9, 1970). Mr. Justice Brennan, speaking for the majority, discussed the suggestion that it was necessary for the United States to include in the contract not only an indemnity clause, but also a \u201chold .harmless\u201d clause explicitly requiring indemnity even if the United States should be found at fault. In footnote 17 of the opinion, Justice Brennan said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">We specifically decline to hold that a clause which is intended to encompass indemnification for the indemnitee\u2019s negligence must include an \u201cindemnify and hold harmless\u201d clause or that it must explicitly state that indemnification extends to injuries occasioned by the indemnitee\u2019s negligence. * * * [W]e assign no talismanic significance to the absence of a \u201chold harmless\u201d clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">This reasoning accords with the cases previously cited. Therefore, while the contract provision in our case did not include a \u201chold harmless\u201d clause, the indemnity provision itself was clear and explicit and stated the contractor\u2019s obligation to indemnify the Government for any liability caused \u201cin whole or in part\u201d by the contractor. This- contractual provision clearly meets the requirements of <em>Seekinger.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">In the circumstances of this case, the indemnity provision would apply only if Hollis, Charleston Drydoek\u2019s employee, was eontributorily negligent. The judge intimated that Hollis was negligent. However, the appellee contends that the findings and conclusions of the District Judge are so inconsistent and irreconcilable with respect to Hollis\u2019 negligence that the case should be remanded for clarification of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">Manifestly, the District Judge, sitting without a jury, had the authority to amend his original order pursuant to plaintiff\u2019s motion. Rule 59, F.R.Civ.P. Appellee\u2019s argument is that since the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend was related to the quantum of the damage award, the judge was limited to a consideration of that point and was without authority to amend the order in respect to Hollis\u2019 negligence. The argument is without force, for a district judge is not restricted to the modifications suggested by the parties. Rule 59(a) takes a broader view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-15\">* * * [0]n a motion for a new trial in an action tried without a jury, the court may open the judgment if one has been entered, take additional testimony, amend findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new findings and conclusions, and direct the entry of a new judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-17\">The rule accords with reason. A district judge should not be forced to perpetuate a finding of fact or conclusion of law which he discovers to be erroneous. United States v. Jacobs, 298 F.2d 469 (4th Cir.1961); Continental Casualty Co. v. American Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co., 186 F.Supp. 173 (S.D.Ill.1959), aff\u2019d, 275 F.2d 381 (7th Cir.1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-19\">However, while there was ample authority to amend the original order, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>alone is not dispositive of the issue raised concerning the court\u2019s findings in respect to plaintiff\u2019s negligence. Still remaining is the fact that in the second and final order itself, there is apparent inconsistency on this question. The District Judge held Charleston Drydock not negligent, notwithstanding the further finding that its employee had been contributorily negligent \u2014 a conclusion which the judge declared he took into account in fixing the amount of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The United States maintains that the District Judge in fact found Hollis con-tributorily negligent. It argues that the judge simply repeated verbatim from his original order the findings absolving Hollis and Charleston Drydock from liability. This it would have us treat as a mere inadvertence that should be ignored. Highlighting the finding of contributory negligence in the final order, the United States argues that it is entitled to prevail against the appellee on the question of indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Upon the equivocal state of the record we cannot accept this explanation. We are not free to assume that the findings absolving Hollis and Charleston Drydock were left in the final order as a mere oversight. One cannot say with certainty whether the District Judge found negligence on the part of the plaintiff, but erroneously failed to attribute responsibility for it to his employer or found Hollis free of negligence but erroneously reduced the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">No facts are adduced to support the Government\u2019s proposed resolution of the conflicting findings. Where the record presents alternative interpretations, the task should not be'imposed on the appellate court of picking and choosing those findings which seem to it preferable. As noted by Judge Brown in Mlandinich v. United States, 371 F.2d 940, 942 (5th Cir.1967),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">In effect, the parties urge that we pick and choose [the fact findings] to come to conclusions each asserts is required * * *. But this is not our role. It deprecates the function of the trial. Armed with the buckler and shield of F.R.Civ.P. 52(a) * * * as findings come to us, we can perform our limited role only as we know with reasonable assurance just what the Judge has found.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">As we view the matter, the place to resolve mutually repugnant findings and conclusions is ordinarily in the District Court, not here. If the accident resulted solely from the negligence of the United States, without fault on Hollis\u2019 part, then the United States should not be indemnified. On the other hand, if Hollis was contributorily negligent, then the liability must fall on his employer, Charleston Drydock. Therefore the case will be remanded to the District Court for explicit findings clarifying whether or not Hollis was negligent, and to award or withhold indemnity accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-8\">. As in Shenker v. United States, 322 F.2d 622 (2nd Cir. 1963), cert. denied <em>sub nom., </em>American Stevedores, Inc. v. Shenker, 376 U.S. 907, 84 S.Ct. 659, 11 L.Ed.2d 606, and cases cited therein, it is here unnecessary to consider whether the United States should have been indemnified on the basis of the implied warranty of workmanlike performance, since the express contractual provision allows for indemnity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
