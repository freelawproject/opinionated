The board found that Local 633 violated section 8(b) (1) (A) and (2) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b) (1) (A), (b) (2) (1964), by causing certain nonmembers of the union either to be laid off or to be denied employment by certain employers within the union\u2019s jurisdiction, and by maintaining a discriminatory hiring hall, giving preference to members of Local 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The findings of the Board (affirming those of the Trial Examiner) are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">\u201c * * * Respondent [union] * * * sought and obtained the layoff of Joseph Tabor and revoked the work permit of Albert Earned because these men were not members of Respondent. This conduct was engaged in to obtain work for Respondent\u2019s members, Manion and Todd, at the Chicago job site. Heath\u2019s own testimony makes clear that Respondent caused Tabor\u2019s layoff and revoked Harned\u2019s work permit because they were not members of Respondent. The credited testimony of James Todd and Eldridge Milam supports the General Counsel\u2019s contention that Keller, Hargan, Kaysinger, Petree were laid off because of Heath\u2019s demand and because they, like Tabor and Harned, had to make room for members of Respondent. Keller\u2019s layoff at Ford also falls into the familiar pattern of conduct followed by Respondent with the slight modification that Keller\u2019s job was sought for Nixon Scott, a member of the International Union working on a travel card in Respondent\u2019s jurisdiction, who thus had preference for jobs over Keller who was not a member of Respondent or any of Respondent\u2019s sister locals. I cannot attach any significance to Respondent\u2019s contention that the positions obtained for the laid off employees by the Respondent were temporary and as journeymen, with more experience and seniority, became available, the laid off employees would be \u2018rolled.\u2019 The evidence is clear that Respondent maintained a practice of giving union members preference over nonunion employees. Respondent\u2019s reliance on Keller\u2019s testimony that \u2018when older men or older members come to take your job you have to give your place up and let them have it because they got seniority on you\u2019 is misplaced. It is clear from Heath\u2019s own testimony that seniority had nothing to do with job acquisition and retention but rather that union membership was the test.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">The Board seeks enforcement of an order requiring Local 633 to cease and desist from the discriminatory practices found above and to make the discrimina-tees whole by backpay.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">At the hearing before the Trial Examiner, the union took the position that it had not occasioned any of the discharges or refusals of jobs with which the Board\u2019s order dealt. While the facts were clearly in dispute before the Trial Examiner, he found (and the Board affirmed his findings) that Local 633 did occasion the discriminatory practices referred to. On this whole record, we find substantial evidence to support the findings of the Trial Examiner and the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">Before this court the union also takes the position that even if it had occasioned the discharges or refusal of jobs, it had a right to do so under section 8(f) of the Act, the construction trades\u2019 proviso, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJY\">\u201c(f) It shall not be an unfair labor practice under subsections (a) and (b) of this section for an employer engaged primarily in the building and construction industry to make an agreement covering employees engaged (or who, upon their employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>ment, will be engaged) in the building and construction industry with a labor organization of which building and construction employees are members (not established, maintained, or assisted by any action defined in subsection (a) of this section as an unfair labor practice) because (1) the majority status of such labor organization has not been established under the provisions of section 159 of this title prior to the making of such agreement, or (2) such agreement requires as a condition of employment, membership in such labor organization, after the seventh day following the beginning of such employment or the effective date of the agreement, whichever is later, or (3) such agreement requires the employer to notify such labor organization of opportunities for employment with such employer, or gives such labor organization an opportunity to refer qualified applicants for such employment, or (4) such agreement specifies minimum training or experience qualifications for employment or provides for priority in opportunities for employment based upon length of service with such employer, in the industry or in the particular geographical area: <em>Provided, </em>That nothing in this subsection shall set aside the final proviso to subsection (a) (3) of this section: <em>Provided further, </em>That any agreement which would be invalid, but for clause (1) of this subsection, shall not be a bar to a petition filed pursuant to section 159(e) or 159(e) of this title.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(f) (1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Section 8(f), however, does not give a construction trades union carte blanche in relation to hiring and discharge practices. On the contrary, the proviso is precisely worded, and it would take specific affirmative testimony by Local 633 concerning the existence of a lawful union shop agreement and the union\u2019s maintenance of qualification examination practices and a nondiscriminatory seniority list to give validity to the section 8(f) defense. We find, however, that there is no such evidence in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The hiring provision in the labor-management agreement provided for a nondiscriminatory hiring system:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">\u201cThe employer or the individual contracting firm agrees to notify the Union when additional or replacement employees are needed. The Union agrees to furnish applicants upon nondiscriminatory bases to perform the necessary work when so notified within 48 hours after receiving the request from the employer. The decision with regard to hire and tenure of all employees shall be made by the Employer. In consideration of the foregoing Agreement by the Employer, the Unions agree to furnish competent and qualified applicants for reference when requested, as provided in the above paragraph, upon a nondis-eriminatory basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">The undisputed testimony of the union\u2019s business agent, however, was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">\u201cMR. LANKER: Now, when you were in office as Business Agent of 633 Plumbers Union, you kept a running employment list, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: I kept an employment \u2014 an unemployment list of only my members of Local 633.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-12\">\u201cQ And this unemployment list, I assume, was for the purpose of referral of applicants to jobs, wasn\u2019t that the whole idea of this list?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-13\">\u201cA Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">The Trial Examiner and the Board found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-15\">\u201cThe record clearly shows that the controlling factor of the layoffs and the revocation of the referral at all three employment sites was lack of membership in Respondent of the men involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-16\">There clearly was substantial evidence on this whole record to support this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>This court has previously said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\">\u201cDischarge of an employee for non-membership in a union entitled to require such membership under a valid union security control is permissible but \u2018no other discrimination aimed at encouraging employees to join, retain membership, or stay in good standing in a union is condoned.\u2019 Radio Officers\u2019 Union v.

Houston Maritime Association, 337 F.2d 333 (5th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Whatever the merits of a system of hiring limited to membership in a particular construction trades local might be, such a system is clearly not in keeping with the provisions of present federal law. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (3), (f) (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
