Mr. Patnode's purpose was to interfere with Ms. Spicer's piano lesson business and to cause her severe distress. He failed in his first objective, but accomplished the second. The trial court found in favor of Ms. Spicer on her claim of outrage and awarded her $40,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b6 2 The primary question we answer is whether Mr. Patnode's conduct was sufficiently outrageous and extreme to sustain the trial court's award. Conduct that is done infrequently merely to annoy a person cannot form the basis of an outrage claim. But the same conduct, done frequently over a period of weeks or months with the intent to cause severe emotional distress to a person, can form the basis of an outrage claim. We hold that Mr. Patnode's conduct was sufficiently outrageous and extreme to present a question of fact. For this reason, we defer to the finder of fact and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   FACTS\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Background prior to purported tortious conduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Paul and Melissa Patnode live across Lyle Loop Road from Junghee and David Spicer. In 2009, Ms. Spicer began teaching private piano lessons in her home, mostly to children. That year, Mr. Spicer suffered a stroke. Three years later, he had to retire early. To supplement their income, Ms. Spicer increased the number of piano lessons she taught.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 In February 2012, Mr. Patnode complained to the Spicers about Ms. Spicer's piano teaching business. Unable\n   to resolve the problems, Mr. Patnode complained to Yakima County. His complaints included increased traffic, damage to a sprinkler in his front yard, noise from car doors shutting and remotely locking, and headlights coming into his house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 The complaints prompted Yakima County to require the Spicers to obtain a conditional use permit for their business. On July 11, 2012, the Spicers obtained a minor home occupation permit from Yakima County. The permit authorized Ms. Spicer to teach piano lessons for up to five students per day. Lessons were permitted from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, September through May. The permit required the Spicers to provide off-street parking for customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 In August 2012, Yakima County issued a modified permit that authorized Ms. Spicer to provide lessons for two additional months per year and increase the number of students to six per day. The Spicers were still required to provide off-street parking for customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7 Throughout 2012, Mr. Patnode continued complaining to Yakima County about Ms. Spicer's business. His complaints included Ms. Spicer teaching instruments other than piano and teaching outside the authorized hours. In addition, he complained that parents dropped their children off and picked them up along the street. He believed that this violated the off-street parking requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8 In December 2012, Mr. Patnode sued the Spicers and alleged that their piano business violated the restrictive covenants that applied to the neighborhood. In 2014, the Spicers prevailed on summary judgment. Mr. Patnode was ordered to pay more than $30,000 for the Spicers' attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 9 In 2014, the city of Selah annexed the parties' neighborhood. Mr. Patnode began complaining to the city of Selah that Ms. Spicer continued to violate her modified permit. That year, the Spicers formed Yakima Arts Academy, LLC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (YAA). Ms. Spicer, through YAA, continued to teach piano lessons, both in her house and also in a leased building in Yakima.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Purported tortious conduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 From around Thanksgiving 2015 to March 24, 2016, Mr. Patnode parked his Ford F-250 diesel pickup along the sidewalk next to the Spicers' residence where piano students entered the Spicers' home. Other vehicles belonging to Mr. Patnode or his household also parked along the Spicers' side of the street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 During this time, Mr. Patnode regularly and repeatedly remote-started his F-250 and set off its alarm when Ms. Spicer's students and their parents walked by the F-250. Ms. Spicer observed this conduct approximately 12 times. When Ms. Spicer observed this conduct, it frightened her and her students. Mr. Spicer observed this conduct about six times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Ms. Spicer's 2016 anti-harassment petition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 In 2016, Ms. Spicer petitioned for an anti-harassment order against Mr. Patnode. Based on evidence presented at the anti-harassment hearing, the court granted Ms. Spicer's request and entered an anti-harassment order. The order prevented Mr. Patnode from parking vehicles on Ms. Spicer's side of the street and required him to disable the remote-start and alarm for his F-250. Mr. Patnode complied with the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    This lawsuit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Partial grant of summary judgment for the Spicers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 In May 2016, the Spicers filed this lawsuit against Mr. Patnode. They sought damages for intentional interference with their piano business and damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Prior to trial, the Spicers moved for partial summary judgment. The motion sought to\n   preclude Mr. Patnode from disputing (1) his conduct had no legitimate or lawful purpose and (2) his conduct caused Ms. Spicer substantial emotional distress. The Spicers contended that these issues had already been litigated and necessarily decided when they obtained the anti-harassment order in March 2016. The trial court granted their motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14 At trial, Ms. Spicer testified that Mr. Patnode's conduct caused her severe emotional distress because she feared for her safety and the safety of her children and students. She explained that Mr. Patnode's remote-starting his truck scared her because she was concerned he would \"go to the next step and actually physically harm somebody.\" Report of Proceedings at 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15 Ms. Spicer testified that Mr. Patnode caused her to suffer from anxiety and insomnia, and that she began taking anti-anxiety medication in 2013. At some point after Mr. Patnode began remote-starting his truck, Ms. Spicer began taking an additional anti-anxiety medication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 Two parents and one piano student testified about arriving for and leaving from piano lessons between Thanksgiving 2015 and March 24, 2016. They testified they observed Mr. Patnode's F-250 remotely starting, its engine revving, and its alarm activating\n   on multiple occasions. One parent testified that this made her scared and concerned for her children's safety. One student testified that\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   time he had a piano lesson between those dates, he observed the F-250 remotely start, its engine rev loudly, and its alarm activate. The parents did not take their children out of piano lessons with Ms. Spicer, and the student who testified did not quit taking lessons from Ms. Spicer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 The trial court found that Mr. Patnode did not cause any loss of business to the Spicers. The court, however, did find that Mr. Patnode's conduct was sufficiently outrageous to constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court further found that Ms. Spicer, but not Mr. Spicer, had proved compensable damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 18 The trial court entered the following findings of fact to which Mr. Patnode assigns error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   23. In 2016, Ms. Spicer filed a petition for an anti-harassment order against Mr. Patnode. The Court takes judicial notice that following a hearing, the Yakima County Superior Court orally concluded that Mr. Patnode was remotely starting his F-250 and setting off vehicle alarms and doing so on purpose repeatedly for the purpose of harassing the Spicers, making their lives more difficult. ...\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   32. Junghee Spicer suffered severe emotional distress as a result of Mr. Patnode parking vehicles on the street alongside the Spicers [sic] house from Thanksgiving 2015 to March 24, 2016, and regularly and repeatedly remote starting his F-250 pickup (which included revving the engine, lights turning on) and remotely setting off the vehicle alarm while it was parked on the street alongside the Spicers' house, where children/students and their parents were walking to and from lessons at the Spicers' residence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   33. The conduct of Mr. Patnode described above was directed towards Ms. Spicer. Mr. Patnode sought to interfere with the Spicers' music business. Ms. Spicer was the direct recipient of Mr. Patnode's conduct even though she was not present for, and did not observe, all instances when Mr. Patnode remote-started his F-250 or remotely set off the vehicle alarm when students and/or parents were walking to or from piano lessons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   34. Ms. Spicer was fearful for her safety and for the safety of her students. ... Ms. Spicer suffered insomnia and anxiety as a result of Mr. Patnode's conduct. Ms. Spicer began taking anti-anxiety medication in 2013. At some time after the remote-start/alarm incidents described above, Ms. Spicer began to take\n   one additional anti-anxiety medication. At the time of trial Ms. Spicer was also taking a third anti-anxiety medication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 322-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 19 In addition, the trial court entered the following conclusion of law, to which Mr. Patnode also assigns error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   6. Mr. Patnode's conduct ... was outrageous conduct.\n   <em>\n    Ms. Spicer was the object of Mr. Patnode's course of conduct. Mr. Patnode's conduct was directed at Ms. Spicer through her piano students and their parents. Mr. Patnode's object was to interfere with the teaching business and cause distress to Ms. Spicer.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Patnode's conduct went beyond all possible bounds of decency, and was atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized society.\n   <em>\n    Mr. Patnode's conduct was intentional, he knew it would cause or inflict Ms. Spicer with emotional distress, and his conduct in fact caused Ms. Spicer severe emotional distress.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   CP at 327-28 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 20 The trial court awarded Ms. Spicer $40,000 in damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 21 Mr. Patnode timely appealed. A panel of this court granted oral argument, which occurred at Whitman College, in Walla Walla, Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 22 Mr. Patnode makes three arguments: (1) conduct that Ms. Spicer or her immediate family members did not observe cannot form the basis of Ms. Spicer's outrage claim, (2) his conduct does not rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct as a matter of law, and (3) substantial evidence does not support the trial court's finding that Ms. Spicer suffered severe emotional distress. We address the issues in the order argued by Mr. Patnode.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   1. EVIDENCE NOT DIRECTLY WITNESSED BY MS. SPICER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 23 Mr. Patnode argues the trial court erred by considering evidence not directly witnessed by Ms. Spicer or her\n   immediate family members. His argument implies that his conduct was directed at the young piano students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 24 When the outrageous conduct is directed at a third person, the plaintiff must be an immediate family member of the person who is the object of the defendant's action, and he must be present at the time of the conduct.\n   <em>\n    Grimsby v. Samson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1120447\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/85/52/#p60\">\n    85 Wash.2d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 60,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=530%20P.2d%20291\">\n    530 P.2d 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975) (citing RESTATEMENT ( SECOND ) OF TORTS \u00a7 46 cmt.\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ( AM. LAW INST. (1965))). This rule has no application here, where the outrageous conduct was directed at Ms. Spicer rather than at a third person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 25 Here, the trial court found:\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Ms. Spicer was the object of Mr. Patnode's course of conduct. Mr. Patnode's conduct was directed at Ms. Spicer through her piano students and their parents. Mr. Patnode's object was to interfere with the teaching business and cause distress to Ms. Spicer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   CP at 327.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 26 The above finding is well supported by the evidence. For years, Mr. Patnode sought to substantially prevent, Ms. Spicer from teaching piano lessons at her house. He began by acting within the legal process. He first complained to Ms. Spicer, later he complained to Yakima County, and still later he complained to the city of Selah. When these complaints failed, he brought a lawsuit to prevent Ms. Spicer from teaching piano lessons out of her house. He alleged that Ms. Spicer's piano lesson business violated the neighborhood's restrictive covenants. The Spicers had that lawsuit dismissed and were awarded their reasonable attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 27 Shortly after, Mr. Patnode began acting outside the legal process. Mr. Patnode began scaring Ms. Spicer's young\n   piano students by remote-starting his F-250, revving its engine, and activating its alarm. The young students, walking by his truck, did nothing to warrant being scared. In fact, Mr. Patnode testified he did not remote-start his truck for the purpose of scaring the piano students or their parents. The trial court reasonably found that Mr. Patnode's conduct was not directed at the young piano students, but instead was directed through them to Ms. Spicer. Because Mr. Patnode's conduct was directed at Ms. Spicer, the trial court did not err by considering evidence not directly witnessed by Ms. Spicer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   2. EXTREME AND OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 28 Mr. Patnode argues, as a matter of law, his conduct does not amount to extreme and outrageous conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 29 To constitute outrage, the conduct at issue \"must be 'so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.' \"\n   <em>\n    Reyes v.
