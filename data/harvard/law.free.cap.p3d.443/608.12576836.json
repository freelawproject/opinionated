Petitioner argues that the record in this case, which was decided 17 years before\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     , does not establish that the trial court made the required \"irreparable corruption\" finding and that his sentence therefore is invalid.

Premo (S065188)\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12576835\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/443/597/\">\n      365 Or. 1\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12576835\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/443/597/\">\n      443 P.3d 597\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (2019) (\n     <em>\n      White (Lydell)\n     </em>\n     ). There, we determined that Lydell's petition for post-conviction relief was not procedurally barred, that\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     applies to de facto life sentences, and that, given the particular circumstances presented in that case, Lydell's 800-month determinate sentence for one murder was subject to\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     's protections.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12576835\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/443/597/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12576835\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/443/597/\">\n      at 7, 9\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . The record in that case did not convince us that the sentencing court had reached the conclusion that Lydell was one of the rare juvenile offenders who is irreparably depraved and that no reasonable sentencing court could reach any other conclusion.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12576835\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/443/597/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12576835\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/443/597/\">\n      at 9\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . We therefore reversed the decision of the post-conviction court dismissing Lydell's petition and ordered that court to enter a judgment vacating his sentence\n     and remanding to the sentencing court for further proceedings.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12576835\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/443/597/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12576835\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/443/597/\">\n      at 9\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-13\">\n     Here, the facts and arguments that the parties present on those issues are almost identical to those presented in Lydell's case, and we write only to discuss one distinction-the slight difference in the sentencing court's stated rationale for imposing an 800-month sentence.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-14\">\n     As it did in imposing Lydell's sentence, the sentencing court focused on the fact that petitioner must have appreciated \"fully and vividly\" what he was doing and \"exactly the horror that was involved in the brutality\" that he was inflicting. Although there was evidence in the record that petitioner suffers from a psychological disorder,\n     <footnotemark>\n      3\n     </footnotemark>\n     the trial court did not find that petitioner suffers from any such disorder or that any such disorder motivated him to commit his crimes. Rather, the trial court explained that petitioner had had enough opportunities to learn how to control his behavior and that he had not been able to do so. The court further explained that it did not \"know the reason for [petitioner's] problems\" but that \"it doesn't matter anymore.\" The court concluded that \"the only thing left for us to do is to protect society from you, so that is my intent and firm desire.\"\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-15\">\n     As in Lydell's case, the superintendent here has attempted to cast the record as comparable to the record in\n     <em>\n      Kinkel v. Persson\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567302\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/417/401/#p28\">\n      363 Or. 1\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 28,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567302\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/417/401/#p28\">\n      417 P.3d 401\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (2018), where we determined that the petitioner's 112-year sentence complied with\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     because the trial court's findings demonstrated that the petitioner's crime did not reflect the transience of youth. But, as in Lydell's case, the superintendent's attempt falls short.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      White (Lydell)\n     </em>\n     , 365 Or. at ---- (distinguishing\n     <em>\n      Kinkel\n     </em>\n     ). It is true that petitioner's actions were heinous\n     and brutal. And it is possible that, on remand, the sentencing court may find that petitioner is one of the rare juvenile offenders whose crimes reflect irreparable corruption. However, we are not persuaded that the sentencing court \"[took] into account how children are different, and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.\"\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n      567 U.S. at 480\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n      132 S.Ct. 2455\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . We also are not persuaded that the sentencing court reached the conclusion that petitioner is one of the rare juvenile offenders who is irreparably depraved or that no reasonable sentencing court could reach any other conclusion. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the lower courts and remand to the post-conviction court for further proceedings.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-16\">\n     The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed. The judgment of the circuit court is reversed, and the case is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-19\">\n     Duncan and Garrett, JJ., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-21\">\n     Petitioner's sentences would see him released at 81 years old.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-22\">\n     The transcript of the sentencing hearing was not before the post-conviction court. Petitioner asks this court to take judicial notice of that transcript for purposes of determining whether petitioner's sentence complies with\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     . The superintendent also asks this court to take such notice, but he further requests that this court take notice of evidence and other records that were before the sentencing court when it sentenced petitioner. We will take judicial notice of the materials requested,\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Eklof v. Steward\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187511\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/717/\">\n      360 Or. 717\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 722 n. 4,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187511\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/717/\">\n      385 P.3d 1074\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (2016) (taking judicial notice of case registers), though we note that we will not make a habit of taking judicial notice of the kind of additional materials submitted by the superintendent. There are several determinations that would usually take place at the trial level before materials like that could be admitted.\n    </p>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
