(Backbone).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   There is no dispute that LifeVantage had the technical right to terminate the contract due to certain actions Backbone had taken. But because LifeVantage did not seem bothered by Backbone's actions when they were first taken, Backbone contends that LifeVantage did not terminate the contract for those permissible reasons, but instead claims that LifeVantage terminated the contract simply because it did not want to pay, and because of animosity toward Backbone's owner, Burke Hedges. Backbone contends that LifeVantage's termination of the contract under these circumstances was improper and a violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The district court was not persuaded by Backbone's arguments, and entered summary judgment in favor of LifeVantage, not only on Backbone's contract claim, but also on LifeVantage's separate counterclaim for conversion. We affirm the district court's entry of summary judgment in LifeVantage's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 In 2009, LifeVantage-already an existing, publicly-traded company-relaunched itself as a multi-level marketing company to promote sales of a nutritional supplement. As part of these efforts, LifeVantage sought the help of Hedges and his company, Backbone. Hedges was well-known within the multi-level marketing industry as an author and speaker. In May 2009, LifeVantage and Backbone entered into an agreement whereby Backbone would become a LifeVantage distributor and undertake additional duties to promote LifeVantage. To this end, Hedges, for and on behalf of Backbone, signed LifeVantage's standard Independent Distributor Agreement, which incorporated LifeVantage's Policies and Procedures; the parties also agreed to and executed a written amendment of that agreement (First Amendment) outlining Backbone's additional duties and compensation. The standard Independent Distributor Agreement, along with the First Amendment and the incorporated Policies and Procedures, constitute the full agreement between the parties, and are collectively referred to herein as \"the Agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Under the terms of the Agreement, LifeVantage agreed to make \"Support Payments\" to Backbone in the amount of $ 20,000 per month for the first three months of the Agreement, then $ 10,000 per month for the next nine months or until the \"cancellation of the Agreement for any reason in accordance with the Agreement.\" LifeVantage also agreed to compensate Backbone as a distributor, through commissions and various bonuses, at the highest level allowed by LifeVantage's compensation plan, regardless of whether Backbone actually qualified for that level through the usual measurements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 The Agreement defined \"Cancellation\" as \"the expiration or termination of an Independent Distributor's Business. Cancellation may be either voluntary or involuntary by either LifeVantage or an Independent Distributor, through non-renewal, inactivity or breach of the Agreement.\" \"Breach\" was defined as \"an actual or alleged transgression or violation of any part of this Agreement.\" The Agreement addressed remedies for breach and stated that \"[a]ny breach of the Agreement ... may result, at LifeVantage's discretion, in ... [c]ancellation of the [Agreement].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 While the Agreement required Backbone to \"develop sales aides\" for LifeVantage, it also required that \"supplemental marketing material of any kind, ... be submitted to [LifeVantage's] Compliance Department for approval before it can be used or made public.\" Moreover, the Agreement contained several restrictions on distributors' ability to develop websites to promote LifeVantage products, and required distributors to register any such websites with LifeVantage and receive written approval from LifeVantage before making any such site publicly available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 In June 2009-only weeks after entering into the Agreement-Backbone developed and made public a website (the Website) that it used for various purposes, including the promotion of LifeVantage products. Backbone, through Hedges, also pitched the Website to others in the LifeVantage network as a way for them to likewise market their LifeVantage business. On the Website, Backbone also made\n   health-related claims about LifeVantage products and income-related claims about working for LifeVantage, two actions that were expressly prohibited by the Agreement. Backbone further used the Website to sell not only LifeVantage products but also non-LifeVantage products, another activity prohibited by the Agreement. LifeVantage never provided Backbone with written approval for any marketing material, including the Website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 By October 2009, LifeVantage had developed cash flow problems, and it stopped paying Backbone the Support Payments required by the Agreement. LifeVantage proposed another amendment to the Agreement (Second Amendment) under which Backbone would agree to accept LifeVantage stock in lieu of the cash Support Payments. In anticipation that Backbone would agree to the Second Amendment, LifeVantage instructed its stock transfer agent (Transfer Agent) to issue a certificate for 240,000 shares of stock in Hedges's name, to be sent to LifeVantage. However, Backbone never agreed to the Second Amendment, and therefore LifeVantage maintained possession of the certificate and did not present it to Hedges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 In February 2010, LifeVantage emailed Backbone regarding the Website, and for the first time took the position that the Website should not have gone live without LifeVantage's prior approval, was not in compliance with the Agreement, and needed to be brought into compliance immediately. Shortly thereafter, LifeVantage began looking into other alleged misconduct by Backbone and Hedges. LifeVantage had received complaints about Hedges's personal behavior; these complaints ranged from Hedges \"not [being] a team player,\" to Hedges stealing the business of other LifeVantage distributors, all the way to sexual harassment. In May 2010, LifeVantage sent Backbone a letter restating its concerns with the Website, and stating that it had received complaints from other members of its organization about Hedges's conduct. Hedges denied the allegations of personal misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 After conducting an investigation, LifeVantage determined that at least some of the complaints of personal misconduct against Hedges were credible, and that Backbone had committed various breaches of the Agreement. At this point, in June 2010, LifeVantage terminated the First Amendment to the Agreement and placed Backbone on \"probation.\" After that, however, LifeVantage continued to receive complaints about Hedges's personal behavior, and it \"suspended\" Backbone's distributorship in July 2010. Less than a month later, LifeVantage terminated the Agreement entirely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 In July 2010, while LifeVantage was investigating and taking action against Backbone, Transfer Agent-apparently as a routine matter, without being specifically asked to do so by LifeVantage-sent Hedges a statement showing that he had been issued a certificate for 240,000 shares of LifeVantage stock. In early 2011, Hedges called Transfer Agent, and explained that he had never received a stock certificate for the shares. Transfer Agent asked Hedges to fill out some additional paperwork, including an affidavit attesting that he had never received a stock certificate, and Hedges complied. Transfer Agent acknowledged Hedges's non-receipt of the stock certificate in a letter dated March 9, 2011, and then issued Hedges a substitute stock certificate for the 240,000 shares. Transfer Agent did not inform LifeVantage about the new stock certificate issued to Hedges. Soon after receiving the certificate, Hedges proceeded to transfer all of his shares to his wife, who later sold the shares to a third party for approximately $ 380,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Backbone filed suit against LifeVantage in October 2011 asserting, among other claims, breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Its chief complaint was that LifeVantage had failed to pay all of the Support Payments due under the Agreement. Backbone would later\n   file two amended complaints, each of which contained a general breach of contract claim but omitted any separate claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. For its part, LifeVantage denied any wrongdoing. In March 2014, LifeVantage learned, through Backbone's counsel, that Hedges had acquired a substitute stock certificate and thereby had obtained the 240,000 shares of LifeVantage stock, and LifeVantage responded by filing counterclaims for conversion, fraud, and securities fraud against Hedges personally.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 Backbone's second amended complaint, filed in May 2015, stated that Backbone never agreed to amend the Agreement to allow LifeVantage to compensate it in stock instead of cash. Though it acknowledged that Hedges received the substitute stock certificate, and that the stock would have been given as compensation for the amount due Backbone under the original Agreement, it still claimed Backbone was damaged in the full amount of unpaid Support Payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 LifeVantage and Backbone each filed cross-motions for summary judgment on all relevant issues. The district court initially granted summary judgment in favor of LifeVantage on its conversion counterclaim against Hedges, but denied summary judgment on LifeVantage's counterclaims for fraud and securities fraud, as well as on Backbone's breach of contract claims. LifeVantage asked the court to reconsider its summary judgment ruling, and after additional briefing and argument, the court entered an order granting summary judgment in favor of LifeVantage on Backbone's breach of contract claims. The court determined that Backbone breached the contract by rolling out the Website without prior written approval, that this breach gave LifeVantage the contractual right to terminate, and that LifeVantage was not prohibited from terminating under Utah's first breach rule. The parties then settled the remaining issues and the district court entered an order and judgment dismissing them with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 Backbone and Hedges now appeal the district court's summary judgment orders, and ask us to review two issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, Backbone argues that the district court erred by granting summary judgment in LifeVantage's favor on Backbone's breach of contract claims against LifeVantage. Second, Hedges argues that the district court erred by granting summary judgment in LifeVantage's favor on its conversion counterclaim. \"We review a grant of summary judgment for correctness, granting no deference to the district court's legal conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    Salt Lake City Mission v.

In such situations, the contract by its terms gives a party the express right to terminate the contract upon objectively defined criteria; no discretion is contemplated or exercised in arriving at that decision. When this occurs, the implied covenant does not intervene to impose an objective reasonableness standard on the party's ability to terminate, because the express terms of the contract already objectively afford the party that right, and the implied covenant cannot operate to vary express contractual rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620\n   <em>\n    Load Zone\n   </em>\n   , relied upon by LifeVantage, is illustrative.

Specifically, Hedges asserts that the court erred by not drawing what he deems a reasonable inference in his favor, namely, that LifeVantage \"changed its mind\" about the Second Amendment and intentionally gave Hedges the stock in lieu of the Support Payments it owed, despite his refusal to sign the Second Amendment. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b629 To prevail on appeal, an appellant \"must explain, with reasoned analysis supported by citations to legal authority and the record, why the party should prevail on appeal.\" Utah R.

But no conversion claim was at issue in\n   <em>\n    Poteet\n   </em>\n   , and Hedges does not provide this court with so much as a\n   list of the elements of conversion, much less a reasoned analysis of how any reasonable inference in his favor would defeat summary judgment on any of the elements of a conversion claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b630 Hedges's citations to the factual record are similarly bereft of substance. In his opening brief, Hedges cites only to the district court's decision on the issue of conversion and his own pleadings. In his reply brief, he adds only two citations to the record, one to his own deposition testimony and one to an account statement from Transfer Agent evidencing the fact that a stock certificate was issued. None of this evidence provides a foundation for inferring LifeVantage's intent, if any, in issuing a stock certificate in Hedges's name. Although a nonmoving party is \"entitled to all favorable inferences, he is not entitled to build a case on the gossamer threads of whimsy, speculation and conjecture.\"\n   <em>\n    Ladd v.

The court therefore did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of LifeVantage on Backbone's claims for breach of contract, including any claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. And Hedges has not carried his burden of persuading us that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of LifeVantage on the conversion counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b633 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Backbone listed Hedges as a co-plaintiff in its initial complaint and in each subsequent amended complaint, but it did not then offer (and does not now offer) any explanation as to how Hedges could have been individually injured-other than in his capacity as Backbone's owner-by LifeVantage's failure to pay the Support Payments.

The counterclaim included an assertion that Backbone was the alter ego of Hedges, but the district court never resolved that claim. Absent its argument for alter ego, LifeVantage offered no explanation in its counterclaim-and offers none here-as to how Backbone can be liable for conversion of the 240,000 shares of stock. For the purposes of this opinion, we view the conversion counterclaim as having been pleaded only against Hedges personally.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    In their opening brief, Backbone and Hedges stated that they were raising seven issues on appeal. But many of these issues are sub-issues of the two issues we describe. For instance, Backbone's claim that the court erred in calculating its damages under the Agreement, by its own admission, \"is erroneous for the same reasons [the court's] termination decision is erroneous.\" Another issue raised by Backbone-whether a statement made in passing by the district court was correct-is inconsequential, because it was hypothetical and had no bearing on the outcome of the case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    LifeVantage asserts that Backbone waived any claim for breach of the implied covenant when it filed an amended complaint that-unlike its original complaint-did not contain a separately pleaded cause of action for breach of the implied covenant, though it did contain a general cause of action for breach of contract. It is certainly true that lawyers often plead a claim for breach of the implied covenant separately, but we wonder whether this is simply a matter of custom, or whether there is some legal reason the claim must be pleaded separately. After all, the implied covenant is simply a term of the contract like any other,\n    <em>\n     see generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Eggett v.

Indeed, even if the only options LifeVantage had in the event of Backbone's breach were to choose to terminate or elect not to, the analysis would not be different; parties generally have discretion to waive or postpone the exercise of an objectively determined right to terminate, and the implied covenant does not justify an inquiry into a party's motive for exercising (or not exercising) that right.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    LifeVantage argues that there exists another ground upon which the first breach rule is inapplicable in this case, and the district court's ruling espoused this alternative argument. We do not need to reach the merits of this alternative argument, because of our determination that Backbone cannot avail itself of the first breach rule given that it is the party that breached first.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Backbone also argues that its breaches involving the Website were not \"material\" breaches sufficient to be considered the \"first\" breach. We find this argument unconvincing, because the Agreement expressly states that \"any breach\" is sufficient to trigger the right to terminate, and is therefore material under the terms of the Agreement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
