On March 18, 2015, Salsgiver appeared for a video arraignment. Salsgiver pled not guilty to the charged offenses and was released on his own recognizance. As a condition of his release, Salsgiver was ordered to personally appear for all court proceedings and was warned that failing\n   to appear would result in a waiver of jury trial. The Municipal Court also informed Salsgiver that his next scheduled court hearing would be an omnibus hearing to take place on May 5, 2015. Salsgiver signed an acknowledgement of his conditions of release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 On March 23, 2015, the Municipal Court issued a Notice of Omnibus. The Notice of Omnibus reiterated that Salsgiver's personal presence was required and that failure to appear would result in a waiver of jury trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 5, 2015, Salsgiver did not appear for the omnibus hearing, but Salsgiver's defense counsel did appear. During the omnibus hearing, the Municipal Court found that Salsgiver waived his right to a jury trial due to his failure to personally appear. The Municipal Court set a bench trial for July 9, 2015, and issued a bench warrant for Salsgiver due to his failure to appear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 On October 15, 2015, Salsgiver was arrested and taken into custody. On October 16, 2015, Salsgiver was arraigned and again released on his own recognizance. The Municipal Court informed Salsgiver his bench trial would take place on November 12, 2015. On October 28, 2015, Salsgiver's defense counsel filed a Motion for a Jury Trial. On November 10, 2015, the Municipal Court denied the Motion, deeming the matter waived due to Salsgiver's failure to appear at the omnibus hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 On November 12, 2015, Salsgiver appeared with his defense counsel at the bench trial. Salsgiver's defense counsel noted Salsgiver's\n   continuing objection to the Municipal Court's finding that Salsgiver waived his right to a jury trial. At the conclusion of trial, Salsgiver was found guilty of PFMA and criminal mischief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 On the PFMA charge, the Municipal Court sentenced Salsgiver to 364 days of incarceration, with 362 days suspended, and gave him credit against his sentence for two days of time served in jail. The Municipal Court also ordered him to pay $ 300. On the criminal mischief charge, the Municipal Court sentenced Salsgiver to a 180-day suspended jail sentence, and imposed fines, fees, and surcharges in the amount of $ 400, including an additional $ 10 witness fee and $ 20 in court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 After Salsgiver indicated he could not pay the fine amount in full\n   within thirty days, the Municipal Court allowed Salsgiver to pay his fines, costs, and surcharges in installments in a signed written agreement, subject to an additional $ 10 contract fee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Municipal Court informed Salsgiver he had to make minimum payments of $ 25 per month and explained that Salsgiver would be charged a ten-percent annual interest rate on the unpaid principal balance until paid in full. An additional provision in the written agreement, but missing from the oral pronouncement of sentence, provided that \"[a]ll payments are due on a monthly basis and no monthly prepayments are allowed unless authorized ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 On November 18, 2015, Salsgiver appealed his conviction to the Flathead County District Court, challenging the denial of his Motion for a Jury Trial. On June 13, 2016, the District Court affirmed the Municipal Court's decision, determining that Salsgiver validly waived his right to a jury trial under Article II, Section 26 of the Montana Constitution and under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Salsgiver appeals the District Court's Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 We review decisions by a district court acting as an appellate court as if originally appealed to this Court.\n   <em>\n    City of Missoula v.

However, at the omnibus hearing, neither Salsgiver's counsel nor the Municipal Court had any information about Salsgiver's location or circumstances. Indeed, at that point, a pending motion filed by the Office of Public Defender sought to rescind the appointment of counsel for Salsgiver because of his failure to provide an eligibility application. Salsgiver had kept everyone in the dark. Thus, Salsgiver blew off the omnibus\n   hearing, quite intentionally, choosing not to participate in any fashion with the Municipal Court or his counsel. Consequently, the Municipal Court issued a warrant to again arrest Salsgiver, this time for his violation of the conditions of his release and to perhaps secure his presence for his own trial. The court also ruled that Salsgiver had waived his right to a jury trial, and set the matter for a bench trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b655 But the process before the Municipal Court did not result in an \"automatic waiver.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Opinion, \u00b6 28. Salsgiver had the opportunity to explain his violation of the court's orders, and seek reinstatement of his jury trial. When he was arrested pursuant to the warrant on October 15, 2015, the bench trial had been set for November 12, 2015. On October 28, 2015, almost six months after he failed to attend the omnibus hearing, Salsgiver filed a motion to reinstate his jury right. However, Salsgiver's motion offered no explanation whatsoever for his disobedience of the court's orders and for his failure to participate in the process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Salsgiver offered no explanation because the record was clear that he had no legitimate excuse. Instead, he argued-in contradiction to the record-that there was \"no evidence\" he had knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to trial by jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b656 Important in the consideration of all the circumstances is that these proceedings occurred in a limited jurisdiction court that processes thousands of misdemeanor cases each year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is not to say constitutional rights in limited jurisdiction courts or in misdemeanor prosecutions are any less critical than in felony prosecutions conducted in general jurisdiction courts. Rather, it is one circumstantial factor that must be understood to properly apply the right. Without a doubt, limited jurisdiction courts would collapse under the workload if they were required to conduct a jury trial for every defendant who initially requested one. There are simply not enough\n   hours in the year within all the courts of the State to do so. Instead, there must be an efficient and constitutional method of case processing that permits the winnowing down of jury trial requests to those that are appropriate jury cases, whether serious or petty offenses. In my view, a jury-appropriate case requires a defendant who is participating in the process, and not actively running away from it. The system employed by the Kalispell Municipal Court ensured the jury right for all such defendants. In contrast, a defendant who is running from the process is engaged in the \"abandonment of a known right or privilege.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10805\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/458/#p464\">\n    304 U.S. at 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10805\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/458/#p464\">\n    58 S.

He was clearly informed, and he acknowledged in writing, that he had a right to a jury trial and that he was required to personally appear at all court proceedings, the failure of which would result in the waiver of his jury right.

When given the opportunity, he could offer no excuse for his conduct. \"It is essential to the proper administration of criminal justice that dignity, order, and decorum be the hallmarks of all court proceedings in our country.
