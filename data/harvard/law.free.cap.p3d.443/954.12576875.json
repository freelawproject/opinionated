Defendants Arizona Acreage LLC (\"AZ Acreage\") and Sunny Lakes Ranchos LLC (\"Sunny Lakes\") (collectively \"Appellants\") appeal the superior court's denial of their cross-motions for partial summary judgment and grant of partial summary judgment in favor of representative plaintiffs Jean M. Monroe and Boyd Family Partnership (collectively \"Appellees\"). Co-defendant Leonard Mardian (\"Mardian\") also appeals the superior court's grant of judgment on the pleadings in favor of Appellees. For the following reasons, we hold: (1) the six-year statute of limitations in Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 47-3118(A) (2019)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   controls the underlying\n   debts, the deeds of trust, and the guaranties signed by Mardian; (2) Appellees had standing to seek foreclosure of the deeds of trust; (3) the certification of each class satisfied the requirements for initiating a foreclosure action as outlined in the deeds of trust; and (4) Nevada Revised Statutes (\"N.R.S.\") section 645B.340 did not apply to bar Appellees' claims. We further reject Appellants' arguments concerning issue and claim preclusion. Because Appellees properly demonstrated they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we affirm the judgments entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 In September 2006, Sunny Lakes executed a promissory note in favor of multiple lenders in exchange for $5,000,000. Over one hundred individuals and entities contributed money to the Sunny Lakes loan, and no lender contributed more than fourteen percent of the total loan value. The note was secured by a deed of trust encumbering several acres of undeveloped land in Mohave County (\"Plot A\"). In addition to the note and deed of trust, Mardian executed a guaranty agreement, promising to repay the loan in the event Sunny Lakes failed to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The execution of the promissory note was conditioned on Mardian providing a personal guaranty on the note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 In August 2007, AZ Acreage executed a promissory note in favor of multiple lenders in exchange for $4,000,000. Over eighty individuals and entities-many of whom contributed to the Sunny Lakes loan-contributed money to the AZ Acreage loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The loan was secured by a deed of trust encumbering another plot of undeveloped land in Mohave County (\"Plot B\"). No lender contributed more than twenty-one percent to the total loan value. Mardian also executed a guaranty agreement as a material condition for execution of the AZ Acreage loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Both Sunny Lakes and AZ Acreage made payments on their respective notes until July 2008, when both companies stopped making payments. In late June 2014, believing the statute of limitations was just days from expiration, Appellees filed two class action lawsuits to foreclose on Plot A and Plot B and recover any resulting deficiency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although many of the investors contributed money to both promissory notes, some contributed towards one note but not the other-resulting in two different classes. Sunny Lakes and Mardian were named defendants in one lawsuit (the \"\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   Case\"); and AZ Acreage and Mardian were named defendants in the other lawsuit (the \"\n   <em>\n    Monroe\n   </em>\n   Case\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Appellants moved to dismiss each case pursuant to Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 12(b)(6), arguing that the four-year statute of limitations under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-544(3) applied and had expired and that Appellees lacked standing because they did not obtain the requisite fifty-one percent (\"51%\") majority agreement outlined in the deeds of trust to declare a default and bring a judicial foreclosure action. The superior court denied Appellants' motions and later certified the classes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Mardian then moved for summary judgment in both cases, arguing the four-year statute of limitations period in A.R.S. \u00a7 12-544(3) barred the claim against him for enforcement of the guaranty contracts. Both sides briefed the issue and presented oral argument, and the court denied the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Thereafter, Appellees moved for partial summary judgment to: (1) establish the dollar amount due under each note; (2) establish that the classes were entitled to payment under the notes; (3) order a sheriff's sale of Plot A and Plot B; and (4) establish liability against each defendant for payment of any deficiency that may arise. Appellants each cross-moved for summary judgment, again arguing the claims were barred by a four-year statute of limitations and Appellants had failed to bring the actions in accordance with the terms of the deeds of trust and controlling Nevada law. In July 2018, the court granted the Appellees' motions in part-reserving the issue of Mardian's liability to pay a deficiency until after the properties were sold and a fair market value hearing could be held. In its Rule 54(b) order, the court determined Sunny Lakes owed $13,870,277.75 on its promissory note plus interest, and AZ Acreage owed $10,933,666.62 on its promissory note plus interest. Sunny Lakes and AZ Acreage timely appealed the superior court's order in August 2018, and the appeals were consolidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 While the first two appeals were pending, Plot A and Plot B were sold at a sheriff's sale in September 2018. Appellants and Mardian did not contest the sale price for either property, and the court vacated the fair market value hearing. Plot A sold for $80,000, resulting in a deficiency for Sunny Lakes. Plot B sold for $195,000, resulting in a deficiency for AZ Acreage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 A week later, Appellees moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing Appellants and Mardian admitted all the material facts in the complaints and failed to show any viable defense to their claims. Appellants and Mardian opposed the motions. The court ultimately granted the motions and entered final Rule 54(c) judgments in favor of Appellees. Mardian appealed the judgments, and those appeals have been consolidated with the previous appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-120.21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 The promissory notes, deeds of trust, and guaranties were all executed in Nevada and include choice-of-law provisions designating Nevada law as governing the agreements. We therefore review the substantive issues according to the laws of Nevada but apply Arizona law to resolve any procedural issues.\n   <em>\n    Ross v.

The Judicial Foreclosure Claims Were Timely Filed\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 Appellants failed to make payments on the notes starting in July 2008. The subject lawsuits were filed on June 27, 2014. Appellants contend the superior court erred by denying their cross-motions for summary judgment, arguing that the four-year limitations period under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-544(3) applies to bar Appellees' claims. Appellees assert the six-year limitations period under A.R.S. \u00a7 47-3118(A) applies and the claims were timely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 Section 12-544(3) provides, \"[t]here shall be commenced and prosecuted within four years after the cause of action accrues ... [an action] upon an instrument in writing executed without the state.\" Alternatively, A.R.S. \u00a7 47-3118(A) provides, \"an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay a note payable at a definite time must be commenced within six years after the due date or dates stated in the note or, if a due date is accelerated, within six years after the accelerated due date.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 Both Appellants and Appellees rely on the proposition that where one statute of limitations has general application and another arguably competing statute of limitations is specific, the specific statute should prevail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Evans v.

The parties disagree, however, as to which of these arguably competing statutes is specific and controlling. Appellants argue \u00a7 12-544(3) is specific because it applies to instruments created outside this state and is therefore directly applicable to the promissory notes and deeds of trust executed in Nevada. In contrast, Appellees argue \u00a7 47-3118(A) is more specific and should prevail because it outlines the limitations period for particular negotiable instruments created pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code (\"U.C.C.\"), including promissory notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 When the Legislature \"enacts a new statute that applies to preexisting statutes, we presume [the Legislature] intended some change in existing law.\"\n   <em>\n    Lavidas v.

At the time of execution, Mardian was the owner and managing member of both AZ Acreage and Sunny Lakes. He signed both promissory notes on behalf of each entity, and he executed each guaranty agreement as a material condition to obtaining each loan. The guaranty agreements were executed days before the promissory notes, and a copy of each promissory note was attached as an exhibit to each guaranty agreement. On these facts, it would be illogical to hold that A.R.S. \u00a7 12-544(3) applies and the limitations period governing Mardian's liability to repay the debts should be shorter than that of Appellants'.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Absent any prior agreements to the contrary by the parties, the applicable statute of limitations for bringing a claim on the guaranty agreements should not expire before the statute of limitations on the underlying promissory notes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Resolution Tr.

They did not do so, however, and have not shown any reversible error regarding the 51% requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Civ. P. 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    C. N.R.S. \u00a7 645B.340 's 51% Majority Requirement Does Not Apply to The Deeds of Trust\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b639 Appellants argue in the alternative that N.R.S. \u00a7 645B.340 required written\n   consent by at least 51% of the lenders under each note thirty days before the lawsuits could be filed, and Appellees' claims therefore should be barred for failure to adhere to the statute's requirements. Appellees assert that the class certification process and order satisfied the requirements of the statute, or alternatively, the statute does not apply because the terms in the deeds of trust outline and control the requirements for foreclosure proceedings. The superior court found that the class certification sufficiently complied with the terms of N.R.S. \u00a7 645B.340.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b640 Without deciding whether the superior court erred in finding the class certification complied with the thirty-day requirement in N.R.S. \u00a7 645B.340(2), we conclude the statute does not apply to bar Appellees' claims because the deeds of trust-and not the statute-controlled the parties' agreements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031698\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/354/#p360\">\n    236 Ariz. at 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031698\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/354/#p360\">\n    340 P.3d at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b641 Section 645B.340 states it is applicable only when the parties have not made other agreements for when the \"holders of [the] majority\" may act. Under the express terms of the statute, either the statute or the deeds of trust-but not both-control in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b642 The default clause demonstrates the parties expressly contemplated the procedure for when the majority could initiate \"foreclosure proceedings.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unlike the statute, the deeds of trust impose no thirty-day written notice requirement on the lenders before filing a judicial foreclosure. If the parties intended to require a written notice be distributed before a foreclosure action was commenced, they were free to explicitly state as much in the deeds of trust. Indeed, other clauses in the contracts include a written notice requirement, but the default clause does not. We therefore conclude N.R.S. \u00a7 645B.340 does not apply to Appellees' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    IV. Attorneys' Fees and Costs on Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b643 Appellees request an award of attorneys' fees and costs on appeal pursuant to ARCAP 21 and A.R.S. \u00a7 12-341.01. Appellants do not oppose the request. Each promissory note and guaranty agreement provided that Appellees may recovery their attorneys' fees and costs in actions arising from the execution of the loan agreements. We therefore award Appellees their reasonable attorneys' fees and costs upon compliance with ARCAP 21.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b644 For the stated reasons, we affirm the superior court's grant of partial summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings in favor of Appellees.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Unless otherwise specified, we cite to the current version of the applicable statutes because no revisions material to this opinion have since occurred.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Mardian's wife also executed a guaranty agreement for both loans. However, she filed for bankruptcy once the two lawsuits commenced and was subsequently dropped as a defendant in both cases.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The interest in the promissory note was originally distributed as follows: eighty percent to a mortgage brokerage firm and the remainder to eighteen different lenders. The brokerage firm subsequently assigned its interest to several other investors, resulting in the current class of approximately eighty entities and individuals.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Although a promissory note secured by a mortgage and a promissory note secured by a deed of trust are different kinds of transactions, when a deed of trust is judicially foreclosed in Arizona, Arizona procedural law treats the foreclosure action the same as a judicial foreclosure of a mortgage.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    A.R.S. \u00a7 33-807(A). Therefore, A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 33-721 to -730 apply to the foreclosure actions in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Even assuming the issue was properly preserved for appeal, Appellants' argument misses the mark. In\n    <em>\n     Karayan\n    </em>\n    , the federal district court determined that Nevada's statutorily-created \"one action rule,\" N.R.S. \u00a7 40.435(2)(a) -and alternatively the \"51% rule\" set forth in N.R.S. \u00a7 645B.340 -applied to the plaintiff's claim and granted the defendants' motion to dismiss. Without addressing the \"51% rule,\" the Ninth Circuit affirmed the ruling based on the \"one action rule,\" determining the district court properly dismissed the claim without prejudice. A dismissal without prejudice does not preclude later litigation, and therefore is not considered a judgment \"on the merits\" for purposes of preclusion. Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 cmt. n (1982). As such, the Karayan Family Trust was free to file another action on the same claim; however, it chose instead to remain a class member in the current litigation. That choice was not precluded by the Ninth Circuit's ruling.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Mardian also argues the purported waiver of the statute of limitations defense provided for in the express terms of the guaranty agreements is void as against public policy.
