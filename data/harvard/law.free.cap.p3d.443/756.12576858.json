In light of the plain language of, and the well-recognized purposes for, the Crime Victims Restitution Act, we conclude that a prior civil settlement does not preclude enforcement of a restitution judgment provided that the victim does not obtain a double recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Following a jury trial in 2013, Allan Bruun and James Diderickson (collectively, Defendants) were convicted of twelve counts of theft and one count of engaging in a pattern of unlawful activity, growing out of their criminal conduct perpetrated against Utah County landowners (Victims).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2007, Defendants and Victims entered into a joint business venture to develop 29 acres of land in Saratoga Springs (the Property) that Victims had purchased decades earlier to fund their retirement. Victims partnered with an entity owned by Defendants, Equity Partners LLC, to form Tivoli Properties LLC, whose purpose was to \"carry[ ] on the business of acquiring, managing, improving, subdividing, developing, leasing and selling the Property or any other enterprise that members may mutually agree upon.\" Victims held a 25% interest in Tivoli, and Equity Partners owned the remainder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 As part of the joint venture, Victims also agreed to sell the Property to Equity Partners for $ 3.5 million, with $ 750,000 due as a down payment. Prior to closing on the sale of the Property, Defendants informed Victims that they were unable to make the $ 750,000 down payment and convinced Victims to take out a loan secured by the Property for that amount to enable commencement of the Property's development. Approximately $ 350,000 of the loan proceeds was used to pay off existing mortgages and taxes on the Property, and the remaining $ 400,000 was transferred to Tivoli's business checking account, whereupon that sum became the company's only operating funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Approximately six months later, Victims discovered that Defendants had written a host of checks on Tivoli's account that did not appear to be related to the development of the Property. Following Victims' complaints and ensuing negotiations, Victims and Defendants entered into a settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement) in which Defendants agreed to transfer title to all but .6 acres of the Property back to Victims. Defendants had already sold the remaining .6 acres to the Utah Department of Transportation, but they agreed to also transfer the proceeds from that sale, $ 174,000, to Victims. In exchange, Victims paid Equity Partners $ 25,000 and agreed to \"waive any claim or right to assert any cause of action\" against Defendants related to their management of Tivoli. The checks that later gave rise to the theft charges against Defendants were identified in the Settlement Agreement, which recited that Victims released any claims they had concerning the checks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Two years later, the State charged Defendants with 28 counts of theft and one count of engaging in a pattern of unlawful activity for writing unauthorized checks on Tivoli's account. A jury determined that 12 of the 28 checks were unauthorized by Tivoli's operating agreement and convicted Defendants on twelve counts of theft and one count of engaging in a pattern of unlawful activity. As part of their sentence, the district court ordered Defendants to jointly and severally pay Victims $ 189,574.33 in complete and court-ordered restitution-the aggregate sum of the 12 checks underlying the theft convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Defendants previously appealed their convictions and the district court's order of restitution, resulting in our decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Bruun\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Bruun I\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346009\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/405/905/\">\n    2017 UT App 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346009\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/405/905/\">\n    405 P.3d 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In challenging the restitution order, Defendants argued (1) \"that the release of claims in the Settlement [Agreement], signed by both Defendants and the Victims, precluded restitution as a matter of law\"; and (2) \"that the consideration the Victims received as part of the Settlement [Agreement] should have been taken into account in the court's restitution order.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.

And regarding Defendants' second argument, we held it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to determine that evidence of the Property's value was too speculative and unreliable to conclude that return of the Property necessarily compensated Victims in full for the unauthorized checks,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98, and that \"Defendants ha[d] also failed to persuade us that the trial court's actual restitution award amounted to a double recovery,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 During the pendency of\n   <em>\n    Bruun I\n   </em>\n   , Defendants moved the district court for an order of satisfaction of judgment pursuant to rule 58B of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. They argued that because the Settlement Agreement referenced the 12 checks that were the subject of the restitution order and included an express release of Victims' claims concerning the same, they were entitled to an order of satisfaction of judgment once the complete restitution order was entered as a judgment on the civil docket.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2077\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -38a-401(1) (LexisNexis Supp. 2018).

Civ. P. 58B(b) (providing that a district court \"may, upon motion and satisfactory proof, enter an order declaring [a] judgment satisfied\"). Specifically, Defendants contend that their compliance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement-the one they and Victims executed two years prior to the commencement of criminal proceedings and which referenced the 12 checks Defendants wrote on the Tivoli account-served as \"satisfactory proof\" that the judgment had been satisfied. Defendants assert that through their efforts to re-zone the Property, its value increased between the time Victims sold it to Equity Partners and the time it was conveyed back to Victims pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, and that this increase in value was sufficient to satisfy the complete restitution amount of $ 189,574.33.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 Defendants correctly state that upon agreement between the parties, a judgment debtor's obligation to the judgment creditor may be satisfied under rule 58B(b) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure by means other than direct monetary payment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Red Bridge Capital LLC v.

But that rule contemplates agreement between the parties\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   judgment is entered. We are still left with the task of determining whether the Act permits a settlement entered into\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to entry of a restitution judgment on the civil docket to satisfy that judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 In support of their position, Defendants cite\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Laycock\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether a civil settlement between a defendant and a victim barred the imposition of restitution in a subsequent criminal action arising from the same incident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. The Court determined that such civil settlements did not bar the imposition of restitution by the district court because the controversy between the State and the defendant was not finished and the twin purposes of restitution, i.e., to compensate the victim and to act as a deterrent, had not been satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. But, without expressly deciding, the Court concluded by musing as to the effect the settlement agreement would have on the order of complete restitution once it was entered as a judgment on the civil docket, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   In the context of this case, once [the district court] completes the task assigned to [it] on remand-to determine complete restitution-that sum will be reduced to a civil judgment, a judgment that may only be enforced through the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. At that point, a serious question will arise over whether [the victim] may execute on her judgment when she has released [the defendant] from all of her claims against him. While this question is one we need not answer today, we likely will be required to answer it someday.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    It would appear that under our statutory scheme, the rationale we used to reject [the defendant's] mootness claim may lose much of its persuasive force after a civil judgment is entered\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33 (emphasis added).

Specifically, because the Court merely speculated on the legal issue and expressly reserved it for future resolution, the comments to which Defendants direct our attention represent no more than \"a remark or expression of opinion that [the C]ourt uttered as an aside,\" rendering it nonbinding obiter dicta.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ortega v.

The Legislature's choice of the word \"enforceable\"-as opposed to a more neutral word, such as \"governed\"-provides guidance to our resolution of this issue. \"Enforceable\" is an adjective that stems from the verb \"to enforce,\" which means \"to compel obedience to [something]\" or \"[l]oosely, to compel a person to pay damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Enforce\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary 608 (9th ed. 2009).\n   <em>\n    See also Enforce\n   </em>\n   , New Oxford American Dictionary 574 (3d ed. 2010) (defining \"enforce\" as the act of \"compel[ling] observance of or compliance with [something]\" or \"caus[ing] (something) to happen by necessity or force\");\n   <em>\n    Enforcement\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary 608 (9th ed. 2009) (defining \"enforcement\" as \"[t]he act or process of compelling compliance\"). The Legislature's choice of the word \"enforceable\" therefore emphasizes the victim's right to seek to collect on the civil judgment under the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure rather than recognizing the defendant's right to seek relief from the judgment under the rules or to have them more generally apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b616 And insofar as the Act directs us to the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, those rules do not contemplate the situation presented by this case.

Quite the contrary, any compensatory, rehabilitative, or deterrent aims of the Act would be only symbolically met, if not undermined, by such a scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b620 It must be noted that settlement agreements, typically the result of negotiation and compromise, often will not fully compensate victims for the pecuniary damages suffered by them, which complete restitution, by its very terms, is intended to do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2077\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -38a-302(2)(a) (LexisNexis 2017) (\" 'Complete restitution' means restitution necessary to compensate a victim for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   losses caused by the defendant.\") (emphasis added).
