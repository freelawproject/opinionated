The last business day before trial, the Department of Commerce, State of Utah, and Francine Giani (collectively, the Defendants) filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under rule 12(c) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, asserting that they were immune from suit due to governmental immunity. The district court deferred consideration of the motion until after trial. The jury found the Defendants liable for wrongful termination and awarded Conner $ 240,000 in damages. After trial, the district court granted the rule 12(c) motion on the ground that the claim tried to the jury-wrongful termination in violation of public policy-is a tort claim for which the government has not waived immunity. The court rejected Conner's argument that her amended complaint could be reasonably read to state a statutory claim for wrongful termination. The court also denied Conner's subsequent motion under rule 15(b) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure to amend the pleadings to reflect that claim. Accordingly, the court vacated the jury's verdict for wrongful termination and entered judgment on the pleadings, effectively immunizing the Defendants from the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 We conclude that the district court properly entered judgment on the pleadings. Even when construed in the light most favorable to Conner, her amended complaint did not state a viable statutory claim for the simple reason that the statute on which she relies does not provide for a private right of action. For that same reason, the district court also properly denied Conner's motion to amend the pleadings to state such a non-existent cause of action. We further conclude that the Defendants did not waive their governmental immunity defense and that the district court did not exceed its discretion when it chose to entertain the Defendants' rule 12(c) motion filed on the eve of trial. Finally, Conner did not preserve her procedural due process claim below and does not argue an exception to preservation on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Therefore, we affirm the district court's judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Conner sued the Defendants after she was fired in 2013 from her job at the Department of Commerce. Conner had served as the administrative assistant to the director, Giani, for eight years. As a schedule AD employee in a confidential relationship with and reporting directly to the department head, Conner was exempt from the career service provisions of the Utah State Personnel Management Act (USPMA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2067-19-15\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 67-19-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2013).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Conner, Giani did not like or trust the leadership of the Utah Attorney General's Office, where Conner's husband worked as a special agent. Conner claims that she was fired \"based on Giani's troubled relationship with the A.G.'s office and the mere fact that Conner's husband was employed there.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 This appeal relates to the first cause of action alleged in Conner's amended complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Conner titled this cause of action as \"Wrongful Termination Against Public Policy (Vindication of Rights Created by Statute to be Free from Discrimination on the Basis of Political Affiliation or Other Nonmerit Factor).\" Conner cited Utah Code section 67-19-18(2) of the USPMA and rule R477-2-3(2) of the Utah Administrative Code, both of which provide that an employee may not be dismissed because of \"political affiliation.\" Conner alleged that the statute and rule reflect a substantial public policy against terminating an employee based on political affiliation, which the Defendants violated by firing Conner based on her husband's employment. She also alleged that she \"has a statutory right to be free from discrimination on the basis of political affiliation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 The Defendants filed an answer to the amended complaint alleging two immunity-based affirmative defenses. The thirteenth defense stated that Conner's claims were \"barred by the doctrines of absolute and qualified immunity.\" The fourteenth defense stated that Conner's claims were barred because she had \"failed to comply with the applicable requirements of the Governmental Immunity Act\" (GIA). Although the Defendants later withdrew the fourteenth defense concerning whether Conner had complied with the requirements of the GIA, they did not withdraw the thirteenth defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 The Defendants did not move for judgment based on their immunity from suit prior to the pretrial motion deadline. The district court denied the Defendants' motion for partial summary judgment based on other grounds, and the case was set for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 One business day before trial, the Defendants filed a rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that Conner's wrongful termination claim was barred by governmental immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Civ. P. 12(c). Specifically, the Defendants argued that Conner's first cause of action was a tort claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy for which governmental immunity had not been waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Conner moved to strike the motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that it was untimely and that the governmental immunity\n   defense had been waived and abandoned by the Defendants. The district court requested briefing on the rule 12(c) motion but did not continue the trial. The district court \"made it clear that [it] was deferring on ruling on the motion and that [it] ... would rule on the motion after trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 The jury returned a verdict in favor of Conner, finding that Conner was terminated due to her political affiliation and awarding her $ 240,000 in compensatory damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 After full briefing post-trial, the district court heard argument on the rule 12(c) motion. The district court recognized that it \"could have denied this motion for being untimely\" as the motion \"was filed literally on the eve of trial.\" Although the court observed that governmental immunity \"should have been raised in a 12(b)(6) or in a 12(c) [motion] right after the answer was filed,\" it elected to entertain the motion because of the \"importance of the issues raised in the motion\" and because, when suing a governmental entity, a plaintiff is \"responsible for understanding [governmental immunity], knowing it, preparing for it, [and] arguing alternative causes of action.\" On the merits, the district court construed Conner's amended complaint to assert \"a wrongful termination tort\" for which governmental immunity had not been waived under the GIA. Accordingly, the court granted the Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 In its oral ruling from the bench, the district court indicated it was vacating the jury's verdict. In a subsequent written ruling, however, the court concluded that vacating the jury's verdict was \"unnecessary and improper.\" The court explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The question of governmental immunity was not put to the jury. Rather it was reserved for judgment by the Court on the pleadings. Because the jury never decided the issue of governmental immunity, there is no reason to vacate the jury's verdict with respect to the first cause of action. Instead, the jury's verdict stands and the Court's order has the effect of immunizing [the] Defendants from the verdict and dismissing the cause of action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 Conner subsequently filed a rule 52(b) and 59 motion to alter or amend the judgment and for a new trial, along with a rule 15(b) motion to amend the pleadings to conform to the evidence at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Civ. P. 52(b), 59(a)(7), 15(b)(1). Conner argued that her wrongful termination claim could be construed either as a claim sounding in tort, which would be barred by governmental immunity, or as a statutory enforcement claim. Conner argued that in granting the Defendants' rule 12(c) motion, the district court erred in not construing the pleadings more liberally to include a claim that she was terminated in violation of a statutory right. In the alternative, she argued that such a statutory enforcement claim was tried by implied consent and that the pleadings must be amended under rule 15(b) to reflect the claim actually tried to the jury. The court denied Conner's motions, concluding that the \"pleadings correctly reflect the claim that was actually tried to the jury: wrongful termination in violation of public policy,\" which was \"a tort claim of wrongful termination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 Conner appeals the district court's grant of the Defendants' rule 12(c) motion, which resulted in the dismissal of the wrongful termination claim, and the denial of her rule 15(b) motion, in which the court refused to amend the pleadings to include a claim of statutory enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 Conner makes two related arguments as to why her first cause of action should not have been dismissed. She argues, first, that the district court erred in granting the Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings under rule 12(c) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, and second, that the district court erred when it declined to amend the pleadings to conform to the evidence presented at trial under rule 15(b) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. Specifically, she argues that the district court should have either construed her amended complaint or amended the pleadings to assert a statutory cause of action that could survive the affirmative defense of governmental immunity. Both issues require us to consider the threshold question of whether such a statutory\n   cause of action exists. \"Whether a particular statute provides a private right of action is a question of statutory interpretation,\"\n   <em>\n    Buckner v.

App. 1996). Therefore, if Conner's first cause of action is properly characterized as a tort claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy, immunity has not been waived and there is no need to look for an exception to waiver under the third part of the test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 Thus, the crux of this appeal is whether Conner's first cause of action could be properly construed or amended to state a \"statutory enforcement\" claim instead of a wrongful termination tort claim for which governmental immunity has not been waived.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because we conclude that the statute on which Conner relies does not create a private right of action, Conner's claims could not be construed or amended in a way that would survive the defense of governmental immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   I. No Statutory Cause of Action\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620 On appeal, Conner makes two alternative arguments that rely on the assumption that there is a private statutory cause of action for violation of Utah Code section 67-19-18(2) and rule R477-2-3(2) of the Utah Administrative Code. As an initial\n   matter, Conner contends that the district court should have denied the Defendants' rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings because, when construed in the light most favorable to her as the nonmoving party, her amended complaint could be read as stating a statutory enforcement claim. Alternatively, she argues that such a statutory enforcement claim was tried by implied consent and that the district court should have granted her motion to amend the pleadings under rule 15(b) to reflect the claim actually tried to the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fisher v.

Although the terms absolute and qualified immunity are more commonly used to\n   refer to a type of immunity arising under federal law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Utah Supreme Court has also applied those terms when discussing immunity conferred by the GIA.

While the court recognized that the Defendants could \"have phrased [their thirteenth defense] more artfully in their answer,\" it ultimately concluded that \"by asserting the defenses of qualified immunity and absolute immunity,\" the Defendants \"affirmatively raised the defense of immunity under the GIA.\" Given our liberal pleading standards and in light of the case law using the terms absolute and qualified immunity in the context of the GIA, the district court correctly ruled that the answer adequately asserted the affirmative defense of governmental immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b640 Conner also argues that the Defendants waived the governmental immunity defense when they agreed to withdraw their fourteenth defense. The fourteenth defense alleged that Conner had \"failed to comply with the applicable requirements of the [GIA] and, therefore, her claims in this civil action [were] barred.\" The GIA provides that a plaintiff's claim against a governmental entity or employee is barred unless the plaintiff complies with the requirement of filing a timely written notice of claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 63G-7-402 (LexisNexis 2016). Withdrawing this defense related to whether Conner had complied with the applicable procedural requirements of the GIA did not waive the argument that the Defendants were immune from suit. Indeed, in the same correspondence withdrawing the fourteenth defense, the Defendants' attorney stated, \"My client will not agree to withdraw its Thirteenth Defense in this matter.\" Thus, the Defendants' conduct in this case is readily distinguishable from the type of express abandonment that occurred in\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b641 Second, the Defendants in this case did not wait until after trial to raise the governmental immunity defense. As we pointed out in\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   , the defendant has the burden of proving an affirmative defense at trial. By failing to raise governmental immunity until six months after trial, the County in\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   failed to meet that burden.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11894604\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/945/125/#p132\">\n    945 P.2d at 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Conner has not directed us to any authority that would require a defendant to establish an affirmative defense prior to trial, although doing so by means of a dispositive motion would surely be more efficient and, in this case, may have obviated the need for discovery and trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The affirmative defense of governmental immunity, in particular, \"conceptually arises subsequent to the question of whether there is tort liability in the first instance.\"\n   <em>\n    Ferree v.

Rule 12(c) requires that the motion be brought \"after the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the trial.\" Utah R. Civ. P. 12(c). In this case, the motion was filed one business day before the scheduled trial.

Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8355777\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/163/615/\">\n    2007 UT 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8355777\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/163/615/\">\n    163 P.3d 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that \"a trial court does not abuse its discretion when it denies as untimely last minute motions on the eve of trial\"). But the question on appeal is whether rule 12(c) prohibits the district court from entertaining the motion under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b643 The district court did not violate the rules of civil procedure or exceed its discretion by reserving its ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings until after trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maxfield v. Herbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6982316\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/284/647/\">\n    2012 UT 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6982316\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/284/647/\">\n    284 P.3d 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that \"[w]ithin the bounds set by rule and statute, ... a district court's management of its docket and trial schedule is reviewed for an abuse of discretion\" (quotation simplified)). Given the district court's handling of the rule 12(c) motion, the late filing did not in fact delay trial. Although the motion could not have been fully briefed and resolved \"within such time as not to delay trial,\" the rules do not require district courts to hear and resolve a rule 12(c) motion prior to trial. To the contrary, the rules expressly allow a court to defer its ruling on a rule 12(c) motion. Rule 12(d) provides that a rule 12(c) motion \"shall be heard and determined before trial on application of any party, unless the court orders that the hearings and determination thereof be deferred until the trial.\" Utah R. Civ. P. 12(d). Significantly, rule 12(d) expressly contemplates a deferred ruling even though, by definition, a motion for judgment on the pleadings would not rely on the evidence developed or the facts found at trial. When Conner moved to strike the rule 12(c) motion as untimely, the district court \"made it clear that [it] was deferring on ruling on the motion and that [it] ... would rule on the motion after trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b644 Although rule 12(d) speaks of deferring a ruling \"until the trial,\" the district court's decision to rule on the matter after trial is consistent with the concept that governmental immunity does not conceptually arise until after liability is determined.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferree\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10382933\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/784/149/#p153\">\n    784 P.2d at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Generally, it is appropriate to address liability issues ... prior to addressing the affirmative defense of the defendant's immunity from suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Lyon v.

As the district court explained, \"[t]he question of governmental immunity was not put to the jury,\" because it was a purely legal issue that the district court \"reserved for judgment by the Court on the pleadings.\" Once the jury found the Defendants liable, the court's ruling had \"the effect of immunizing [the] Defendants from the verdict.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b645 Judicial economy may be better served by performing the immunity analysis first, especially where, as here, that analysis ends the inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ledfors v.

But, while a pretrial ruling in this case may well have been preferable, we cannot say that the district court was required to resolve the question of governmental immunity before the jury determined liability. Therefore, the district court's handling of the rule 12(c) motion did not violate the rules of civil procedure or otherwise constitute an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   III. Due Process\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b646 Finally, Conner contends that the timing of the rule 12(c) motion and the court's ruling deprived her of due process. \"Procedural due process requires, at a minimum, timely and adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard in a meaningful way.\"\n   <em>\n    McBride v.

Conner has failed to establish that the statute on which she relies creates a private right of action. Because the government has not waived immunity for Conner's only viable claim-wrongful termination in violation of public policy-the district court correctly granted the Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, denied Conner's motion to amend, and dismissed the claim notwithstanding the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b651 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    At-will employees are statutorily classified under Schedule A of the USPMA while career service employees are statutorily classified under Schedule B. \"Career service systems were designed to protect public employees from unfair personnel practices occurring with political changes.\" Report to the Utah Legislature,\n    <em>\n     A Limited Review of the State's Career Service System\n    </em>\n    (July 2010), https://le.utah.gov/audit/10_08rpt.pdf [https://perma.cc/K8VL-LD6W].
