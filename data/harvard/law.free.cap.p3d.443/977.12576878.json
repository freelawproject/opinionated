We reverse and remand the decree's parenting-time provisions because they are the product of impermissible presumptions about equal parenting time and gender. We also reverse portions of the decree that violate federal law governing military retirement pay and vacate and remand the attorney's fees award. In all other respects, we affirm the decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 The parties (\"Husband\" and \"Wife,\" respectively) were married in 2004 and have three children, all girls, born in 2006, 2008 and 2010, respectively. The family moved to Arizona in 2013, when Husband, a helicopter pilot on active duty with the United States Marine Corps, was transferred to Yuma. Wife filed a petition for dissolution in August 2015, but the couple remained together in the marital home until shortly after the superior court issued temporary orders in March 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Following a three-day trial, the superior court entered a decree of dissolution in May 2017. Relevant to this appeal, the decree continued joint legal decision-making but reduced Husband's parenting time to 130 days a year, plus specified holidays and a summer vacation, and divided the community's interest in Husband's military retirement. The court declined both parties' requests for equalization payments and awarded attorney's fees to Wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 We have jurisdiction of Husband's timely appeal pursuant to Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution and Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") sections 12-120.21(A)(1) (2018) and -2101(A)(1) (2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Parenting Time.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 By agreement, the temporary orders had allowed Husband more parenting time than Wife because Wife was in training to become a firefighter/emergency medical technician. The parties shared joint legal decision-making, but temporary orders granted Husband parenting time every Thursday through Sunday until Wife finished her training and \"bec[ame] employed.\" Wife completed her training within a few months but did not take a full-time job and did not petition the court for weekend parenting time. The dissolution decree, entered 14 months after issuance of temporary orders, reduced Husband's parenting time to one overnight a week plus every other weekend from Friday afternoon through Monday morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 On appeal, Husband argues the superior court abused its discretion in failing to order equal parenting time. We review a parenting-time order for an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Nold v.

The past, present and potential future relationship between the parent and the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   2. The interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child's parent or parents ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   3.

The mental and physical health of all individuals involved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 8 In findings and conclusions issued in support of the decree's parenting-time provisions, the superior court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The primary focus concerning parenting time is the best interest of the children and not the parents. If the interests of parents are more important than children, then children, like timeshares, would always be equally time-shared.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A totality of circumstances tip the scales in favor of designation of [Wife] as primary residential parent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A. [Wife] has been the primary care provider for the children prior to this action. The children have historically spent more time with [Wife] than [Husband] since their birth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   B. The children have not fully adjusted to equal parenting time during the pendency of the temporary orders. The court finds the children want and need to spend more time with [Wife].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   C. The military duties of [Husband] often make him unavailable during his parenting time resulting in the children spending too much time with the paternal grandparents relative to time they could be with [Wife].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   D. The children are girls who naturally will gravitate more to [Wife] as they mature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   E. The experience during the temporary orders has been unreasonable occasionally.... The court finds [Husband] has been comparatively more unreasonable and inflexible than [Wife] [in agreeing to trade parenting time]. In particular, [Husband] has placed his interest over the best interest of the children in not allowing more frequent weekend parenting time by [Wife] regardless of the strict terms of the stipulated temporary order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   F. It is unlikely the parties will both reside in Yuma during the minority of all the children. Significant geographical separation of the parties precludes equal parenting time. Changing equal parenting time now would be less disruptive than in the future.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   G. Children should have a primary home and bedroom where special items like collections, posters and private things are maintained as opposed to forcing children to equally divide their time and things and clothes equally between two homes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   H. A primary residence promotes stability and continuity for children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 9 With one exception, we agree with Husband that the findings the court made in determining parenting time are contrary to law and not supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 10 First, the court legally erred by applying a presumption against equal parenting time. Nearly all of the court's findings disregarded the statute's starting point, which is that, when consistent with a child's best interests,\n   each party's parenting time should be maximized. A.R.S. \u00a7 25-403.02(B). Wife offers no legal argument in defense of the court's broad generalization that \"[c]hildren should have a primary home and bedroom ... as opposed to forcing children to equally divide their time and things and clothes equally between two homes.\" And no evidence in the record supports application of that principle here. By its nature, dissolution of a marriage compels children to divide their time between the homes of their two parents. That being the case, nothing in the law allows a court considering the best interests of the children to presume that one of those homes must be the children's \"primary\" residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 11 At trial, Wife rejected the notion of equal parenting time, protesting without offering specifics that her \"children need more consistency of staying in one place.\" But the court's broad finding that \"[a] primary residence promotes stability and continuity for children\" is supported neither by the law nor the evidence in the record. When each parent can provide a safe, loving and appropriate home for the children, there is no place in a parenting-time order for a presumption that \"stability and continuity\" require the children to spend more time in one home than the other. Here, Wife offered no evidence that Husband is not a good parent, nor that his home is inappropriate for the children. To the contrary, she testified Husband has the girls' best interests at heart, and, when asked to describe his strengths as a parent, she testified he is \"very loving,\" plays with the girls and is good \"at discipline.\" She also testified the girls enjoy spending time at Husband's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 12 Second, the court erred by basing parenting time on its finding that the parties' three girls \"naturally will gravitate more to [Wife] as they mature.\" The implicit premise of this finding is that, as a general proposition, girls need to spend more time with their mother than their father. Nothing in the law nor the record supports that proposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 13 Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, gender-based presumptions by the government require an \"exceedingly persuasive justification.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Virginia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730076\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/515/#p531\">\n    518 U.S. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 531,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730076\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/515/#p531\">\n    116 S.Ct. 2264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730076\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/515/#p531\">\n    135 L.Ed.2d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). In this inquiry, \"overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females\" cannot suffice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730076\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/515/#p531\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730076\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/515/#p531\">\n    at 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730076\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/515/#p531\">\n    116 S.Ct. 2264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Arizona legislature has recognized this principle by mandating that in determining parenting time, a \"court shall not prefer a parent's proposed plan because of the parent's or child's gender.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 25-403.02(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 14 Wife argues it was \"reasonable for the court to anticipate that the children's needs for a stable maternal influence would increase rather than decrease as they entered puberty.\" She cites no factual or legal authority, however, for that proposition. Nor does she offer any explanation for why an equal parenting-time plan would not allow her to maintain a \"stable maternal influence\" over her girls. Wife also argues the finding is supported by \u00a7 25-403(A)(2), which directs a court considering best interests to take into account \"[t]he interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child's parent or parents.\" But there was no evidence before the court that Wife's relationship or interaction with the children was better than Husband's. By Wife's logic, all things being equal, the gender of the children necessarily would drive parenting time, a governing principle flatly inconsistent with principles of gender equality and \u00a7 25-403.02(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 15 Third, the court erred by favoring parenting time for Wife over Husband based on the fact that Wife had been the children's primary caregiver during the marriage. Whether one or the other parent was the primary caregiver during the marriage used to be one of the factors the court was required to consider in deciding parenting time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 25-403(A)(7) (2005) (\"Whether one parent, both parents or neither parent has provided primary care of the child.\"). But the legislature removed that factor in 2012 when it substantially revised the decision-making and parenting-time statutes. 2012 Ariz. Sess. Laws, Ch. 309, \u00a7 5 (2d Reg. Sess.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 16 Dissolution necessarily will disrupt the family dynamic whenever one parent has been the primary earner while the other has stayed home to care for the children. Upon dissolution, the wage earner usually must find child care and the stay-at-home parent must find work. To be sure, each parent's relationship with a child before dissolution is one of the factors a court must consider in determining parenting time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 25-403(A)(1) (court shall consider \"past, present and potential future relationship between the parent and the child\"). Absent evidence in the record that a parent will be unable to properly care for a child, however, the superior court errs when it presumes - as the court did here - that the child's best interests necessarily are served by affording more parenting time to the former stay-at-home parent than to the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 17 Fourth, the court also erred by basing its parenting-time determination on a finding that, given it was unlikely that Husband and Wife would remain in Yuma until the children were grown, \"[c]hanging equal parenting time now would be less disruptive than in the future.\" Over their 11-year marriage, Husband's various reassignments as a Marine required the couple to relocate a half-dozen times. Although the court did not err by implicitly finding that Husband may be reassigned again, no evidence in the record supports the pronouncement that it would be less disruptive to the children to reduce their time with their father now than to do so later. Indeed, as Husband argues, it belies logic to limit a military member's parenting time simply because he or she may be deployed in the future. If and when Husband is reassigned, A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 25-408 (2018) and -411 (2018) will govern how parenting time is to be altered under the circumstances then presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 18 Fifth, the court erred by limiting Husband's parenting time based on its finding that his military duties \"often make him unavailable during his parenting time resulting in the children spending too much time with the paternal grandparents.\" Husband's parents sold their house in Oregon and moved to Yuma shortly before Wife petitioned for dissolution, and they now share a home with Husband so that they may care for the children when he is unable to do so. During the marriage, Husband's job took him away from home during a pair of seven-month overseas deployments and on training missions for a few weeks at a time. Husband testified, however, that since June 2016, his assignment in Yuma had allowed him to work \"[b]anker's hours.\" At the same time, Wife testified that her work as a firefighter/emergency medical technician may require shift work long past regular business hours, including some nights and weekends. In short, both parents' jobs will require extended periods of child care, and Husband's parents have agreed to care for the children whenever\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   parent is unable to do so. Further, Father's proposed parenting plan included a \"first right of refusal\" under which each parent would offer the other the opportunity to care for the children when the first parent is unavailable for a period of four hours or longer. Mother, meanwhile, offered no criticism of the girls' grandparents as care providers, and in fact testified that she would be fine with them watching the girls after school in\n   the afternoons if her work did not allow her to do so. Under these circumstances, the superior court abused its discretion when it found that Husband's use of his parents for child care weighed against his request for equal parenting time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 19 Sixth, the court also erred by denying equal parenting time based on its findings that the girls \"have not fully adjusted to equal parenting time during the pendency of the temporary orders\" and that they \"want and need to spend more time with\" Wife. Crafted to accommodate the demands of Wife's school and training regimes, the stipulated temporary orders granted Husband parenting time over what became a four-day weekend, from noon on Thursday through Sunday evening, week in, week out. On that schedule, the girls naturally missed being able to spend weekends with Wife. Although Wife testified the girls said they wanted to spend weekends with her, she acknowledged that was because they had been with Husband every weekend under the temporary orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 20 The only other evidence supporting the court's finding that the children had \"not fully adjusted\" to equal parenting time during temporary orders was Wife's testimony in September 2016 that one of the girls complained of stomach pain and sleeplessness, issues Wife attributed to the child's unwillingness to leave Wife's home for Husband's. But by the time trial resumed two months later, Wife testified the girl's problems with sleeping were \"getting better now.\" Further, both parents testified the girls were doing well in school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 21 On this record - and in the absence of testimony of a therapist, counselor or other expert - the evidence was entirely insufficient to support the court's implicit finding that the children would not be able to \"adjust\" to an equal parenting time schedule that afforded a fair measure of weekends to Wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 22 As for the court's lone remaining finding in support of its parenting-time determination, Husband argues there was no evidence that he was more unreasonable and inflexible than Wife in negotiating trades of parenting time before trial. Husband contends he offered Wife additional parenting time on four occasions during the period of temporary orders even though Wife had more parenting time overall. He also contends Wife was more unreasonable regarding a summer vacation dispute and never responded to the equal parenting plan he offered in settlement. For her part, Wife testified Husband did not offer\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   parenting time, but only offered weekend parenting time in\n   <em>\n    exchange\n   </em>\n   for an equal amount of her parenting time. She also recounted several instances in which Husband refused to allow her to pick up the children from school when he was working or take them overnight when he traveled. Although Husband was strictly following the temporary orders in these instances, the court properly could view his conduct as unreasonably inflexible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 25-403(A)(6) (\"Which parent is more likely to allow the child frequent, meaningful and continuing contact with the other parent.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 23 We generally defer to the weight the superior court gives to conflicting testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gutierrez v. Gutierrez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747634\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/193/343/#p347\">\n    193 Ariz. 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 347-48, \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747634\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/193/343/#p347\">\n    972 P.2d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 680-81 (App. 1998).

Applying that principle, the superior court divided the community's interest in Husband's military retirement. It also ruled that if Husband voluntarily continues to serve after he becomes eligible to retire, he must pay Wife what she would have received from the government if he had retired. On appeal, Husband argues the court erred by effectively ordering him to indemnify Wife against a choice he might make to work more than 20 years.

The decree states, \"In the event [Husband] elects a ... survivor annuity in favor of\n   <em>\n    any other person\n   </em>\n   , such election shall\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   reduce\" Wife's share of Husband's retirement pay. (Emphasis added.) By mandating that Wife's share of Husband's retirement pay will not be reduced by the cost of any survivor's annuity Husband might purchase, the decree disregards the statutory mandate that retirement pay subject to division as community property\n   <em>\n    shall be reduced\n   </em>\n   by amounts deducted for an annuity in favor of \"a spouse or former spouse to whom payment of a portion [of military retirement] is being made pursuant to a court order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 34 Wife's defense of the decree's treatment of survivor-annuity premiums is based on its application to an annuity Husband might purchase for a new spouse if he remarries. Wife argues the statute mandates that the cost of an annuity for a current or former spouse shall be deducted from retirement pay only if the annuity is court-ordered. Thus, under her interpretation of the statute, if Husband were to remarry and voluntarily buy an annuity for his new spouse, Wife's\n   interest in his retirement pay would not be reduced by the cost of that annuity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 35 We do not interpret the statute that way. In the normal case, there is no need for a court order requiring a military member to purchase an annuity for his or her current spouse - generally speaking, only payments on behalf of a\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   spouse require a court order. The text of the statute is consistent with that principle. The provision at issue applies when one receives a portion of a military member's retirement pay \"pursuant to a court order\n   <em>\n    under this section\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201408\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A)(iv) (emphasis added). The \"section\" to which the text refers, of course, is \u00a7 1408 - which was enacted specifically to grant state courts the power to apply state law to divide military retirement pay upon dissolution of a military member's marriage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201408\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (\" 'court order' means a final decree of divorce, dissolution, annulment or legal separation ...\");\n   <em>\n    Howell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604091\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1400/#p1402\">\n    137 S.

The statute has nothing to say about an intact marriage; contrary to Wife's argument, its reference to one who receives a distribution of retirement pay \"pursuant to a court order under this section\" logically cannot refer to a\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   spouse because \"this section\" only applies in proceedings to dissolve or otherwise effectively end a marriage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 36 Accordingly, under \u00a7 1408(a)(4)(A)(iv), military retirement pay subject to division by a state court as community property is reduced by amounts a serviceperson pays for an annuity to (1) a spouse or (2) a former spouse when the payment to the former spouse is mandated by a court order. The decree here violates that provision by ordering that Wife's interest in Husband's retirement shall not be reduced by Husband's purchase of an annuity for \"any other person.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Cost-of-living increases and REDUX/career status bonus.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 37 Husband argues the superior court erred by awarding Wife a proportionate share \"of any cost of living or other post-retirement\" increase in his military retirement pay. Husband acknowledges that \u00a7 1408(a)(4)(B) allows division of certain specified cost-of-living increases, but argues the decree goes beyond the statute in dividing any \"other post-retirement\" increases. Husband is correct. Pursuant to \u00a7 1408(a)(4)(B), military retirement pay subject to division as community property includes expressly defined cost-of-living increases; the statute makes no reference to any other increases. On remand, the superior court shall remove the reference to \"other post-retirement increases\" from the decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 38 The decree also provides that in the event Husband elects to receive retirement benefits pursuant to the Military Reform Act of 1986 (\"REDUX benefits\") and receives a Career Status Bonus (\"CSB\"), Wife shall be entitled to a proportionate share of these benefits. Husband contends the superior court erred in dividing these benefits because Wife did not make any claim to them in her pretrial statement or at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 39 Wife indeed did not ask the superior court to allocate these benefits, and the record contains no evidence as to how they are calculated. Nonetheless, because we are remanding the military retirement provisions of the decree, and REDUX and CSB may be retirement-type benefits in which the community\n   is entitled to share, the superior court on remand shall determine how to allocate these benefits should Husband elect to receive them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Equalization Payment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 40 The superior court denied Husband's request for an equalization payment based on $36,539 in community expenses (mainly the mortgage, utilities and groceries) he paid after Wife served the dissolution petition. Husband paid more than $30,000 of the expenses at issue during the several months leading up to entry of temporary orders, when he was working but Wife had no full-time job and was without temporary spousal maintenance, and when he continued to live with her in the marital home. The superior court reasoned that, \"in fairness,\" it could not grant Husband's request for an equalization payment without also retroactively modifying temporary orders, implying that, under the circumstances, Wife had an equitable right to financial assistance from Husband during the applicable period. At the same time, the court also denied Wife's request for an equalization payment for an additional $20,000 in property and private retirement savings accounts Husband received under the decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 41 Husband argues the court erred as matter of law, citing\n   <em>\n    Bobrow v.

Based on their comparative earnings, the court found that Husband should bear 67 percent of the attorney's fees incurred in the case; Wife, 33 percent.

Nevertheless, in reducing the rates, the superior court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   The court finds that $175 and $150 an hour for paralegal time is unreasonable and without sufficient evidence of local practice. Such a rate approximates three times the hourly rate of a judge....

The $150 rate charged by Wife's Yuma counsel, and her failure to object to Husband's $175 rate, belies the court's finding that the parties had offered no evidence of rates charged by Yuma practitioners for work done by paralegals. More broadly, the court's pronouncement that \"[m]any lawyers do not charge anything for so-called paralegal time\" is demonstrably incorrect. To the contrary, trained, experienced paralegals can be invaluable in providing efficient legal services to the clients of a law firm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ahwatukee Custom Estates Mgmt.

And the court's reference to a judge's \"hourly rate\" is simply inapplicable. The effective hourly rates of judges - like those of public defenders, prosecutors and other government lawyers - are not evidence of a reasonable hourly rate in private practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 49 As he did in the superior court, Husband also argues the court erred by finding that Wife did not act unreasonably in the litigation. He contends Wife was unreasonable in failing to make or respond to settlement offers and by providing untimely discovery responses. Wife, on the other hand, contends Husband failed to follow through with a settlement agreement reached early in the litigation and failed to provide requested discovery. The superior court was in the best position to consider these competing allegations of unreasonableness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gutierrez\n   </em>\n   , 193 Ariz. at 347, \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747634\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/193/343/#p347\">\n    972 P.2d at 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
