Accordingly, we affirm dismissal of their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Riley cross-appeals the trial court's determination that Riley owed and breached a statutory duty to communicate a rental inquiry to the Beauregards. Riley did not have a duty to communicate rental inquiries under RCW 18.86.030(1)(c). Therefore, we reverse the trial court's conclusion to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The Beauregards retained Riley to list and sell their property in Bellevue, Washington. Riley is a realtor with Windermere Real Estate/East, Inc. in Bellevue. During Riley's initial meeting with the Beauregards at their\n   Bellevue home, the Beauregards mentioned they were also considering another real estate broker. Ultimately the Beauregards chose Riley because she estimated the property could be listed at $ 2,488,000, higher than the other agent's estimate. Riley recalls merely \"shar[ing] with them that other clients ... were buying a similar sized home one block over that was listed at $ 2,488,000\" and offered that amount as an example, only after the Beauregards insisted on her opinion. The Beauregards maintain that Riley inflated the price to induce them to enter the Exclusive Sale and Listing Agreement (the Listing Agreement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Ms. Beauregard told Riley that, if they did not get offers within their desired price range, they were also interested in renting their property. Riley concedes this alternative was discussed, but the Listing Agreement contracts Riley to \"sell\" the property, and specifically indicates that the \"[f]irm need not submit to Seller any offers to lease, rent, execute an option to purchase, or enter into any agreement other than for immediate sale of the Property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 The parties signed the Listing Agreement on November 11, 2015. The Listing Agreement did not include a list price, but listed the property as viewable by \"Appointment,\" \"Call Listing Office,\" and through the\n   \"Multiple Listing Service (MLS) Keybox.\" Riley also listed the property as owner-occupied despite it being vacant because for \"premier properties,\" Riley prefers to go to the property before a showing, turn on the lights and heat, discuss key features of the home with the buyer's broker, and ensure the doors are locked after the showing. Additionally, Riley maintains that the property was not truly vacant because some of the Beauregards' furniture was present, and a vacant property is more susceptible to theft. The Beauregards maintain that Riley never fully explained to them that the property was listed as owner-occupied or as viewable by appointment, and had they known, the Beauregards would have never agreed to those terms. Those terms, however, were clearly listed in the Listing Agreement signed by the Beauregards.\n   \u00b6 6 On December 4, 2015, Riley e-mailed the Beauregards, recommending a list price between $ 1,950,000 and $ 2,150,000. Ms. Beauregard replied that she thought they had discussed a higher starting price range. Riley arrived at the suggested list price after conducting market research, which included two comparable properties in the same neighborhood. The first was listed for $ 2,488,000, but sold for $ 2,285,000. The second was listed for $ 2,249,000, but sold for $ 2,175,000. The property is a stacked three level floorplan, lacking an open floorplan, and with recent market preference trending towards open floorplans, Riley suggested a lower list price to compensate for the market trends. The Beauregards disagreed with Riley's recommendation and the property was listed for $ 2,288,000 with a $ 5,000 \"paint/deck stain credit\" and went active on December 9, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 The parties characterize the discussions about listing the property over the holiday period differently. The Beauregards maintain they contacted Riley about delisting the property over the holiday season, but Riley never responded because she was vacationing in France. Riley maintains that there was less inventory on the market, and listing over the holiday period would capitalize on buyers trying to relocate before the New Year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 During the months following the initial listing, Riley's office hosted at least 18 open houses at the property. No prospective buyers submitted offers during that period. The Beauregards contend that the lack of offers was because Riley failed to follow-up with prospective buyers and used old photographs in the listing. At several points during her representation, Riley recommended that the Beauregards drop the list price because other nearby properties had recently lowered their prices and attracted buyers. On February 3, 2016, the Beauregards agreed to reduce the price to $ 2,173,000, stating \"[w]e had always felt the 2.28 was ambitious, but wanted to try it.\" Riley recommended a further price reduction on March 20, 2016, to $ 1,998,000, but the Beauregards disagreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 On March 6, 2016, the Beauregards notified Riley they wanted to switch real estate agents because they felt Riley was not following up with prospective buyers and had too many other listings in the Bellevue area. Riley convinced the Beauregards to give her a second chance. Riley and the Beauregards made several changes to the property and updated the listing photos, which showcased the re-sodded backyard, the exterior paint job, and updated interior photos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 Ultimately, the Beauregards terminated their Listing Agreement with Riley in April 2016, and entered a new agreement with Nancy Klinck. The property sold on August 17, 2016 for $ 1,850,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11 The Beauregards filed their complaint alleging Riley breached statutory duties, was negligent, and violated the CPA. The Beauregards advanced a theory that Riley's cumulative breaches caused their property to remain on the market for too long, leading to low offers from prospective buyers. The Beauregards claimed that Riley fraudulently induced them to enter the Listing Agreement by inflating the value of their property to $ 2,488,000, which was an unfair and deceptive act under the CPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12 During discovery, the Beauregards recovered an e-mail inquiry from Mark Williams, another realtor with Windermere, sent to Riley on April 6, 2016. Williams inquired whether the Beauregards would be interested in renting as opposed to selling\n   because he had a client looking to move in mid-June from San Francisco, and rent a 2000+ sq/ft house for $ 3,500 a month. Riley replied that the Beauregards were not interested in renting the property. Ultimately, the prospective renter never rented a property in Bellevue, and stayed in a hotel only for a couple of months before moving back to San Francisco. The Beauregards contend that Riley was required by RCW 18.86.030(1)(c) to inform them of this \"offer\" to rent their property, failed to do so, and if this \"offer\" was conveyed, they would have accepted.\n   \u00b6 13 Riley moved for summary judgment. In response, the Beauregards retained Lawand Anderson, a realtor and attorney, as an expert. The Beauregards filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. Riley filed a motion to strike the declaration of Anderson, contending Anderson was not qualified as an expert and her opinion was based on speculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 14 The trial court denied the motion to strike, indicating \"the basis of speculation may be argued as part of the summary judgment motion.\" The trial court granted Riley's motion for summary judgment as to the Beauregards' CPA claim and negligence claim, but denied summary judgment as to the Beauregards' statutory duties claim, finding Riley had a duty to convey the rental inquiry and breached it, but reserved further ruling on causation and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 15 Riley filed a second motion for summary judgment on the issue of causation, contending the Beauregards were unable to prove that Riley proximately caused the Beauregards' claimed injuries. The trial court granted Riley's second motion for summary judgment and dismissed all of the Beauregards' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 16 The Beauregards appeal the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Riley. Riley cross-appeals the trial court's finding that she owed the Beauregards a duty under RCW 18.86.030(1)(c) to transmit the rental inquiry and breached that duty. Riley also appeals the trial court's consideration of the Beauregards' expert declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 17 Common to each of the Beauregards' claims is the issue of whether Riley's actions proximately caused the Beauregards' claimed injuries. The Beauregards contend the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because they presented sufficient evidence to establish an issue of material fact for proximate causation. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 18 We review a trial court's grant of summary judgment de novo, considering \"all reasonable inferences from\n   the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Keck v.

As discussed above, the amendment to chapter 18.86 makes clear that \"[t]he duties under this chapter are statutory duties and not fiduciary duties. This chapter supersedes the fiduciary\n    duties of an agent to a principal under the common law.\" RCW 18.86.110.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    \u00b6 31 At issue in this appeal is the duty described in RCW 18.86.030(1)(c), which imposes statutory duties on real estate brokers:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    (1) Regardless of whether a broker is an agent, the broker owes to all parties to whom the broker renders real estate brokerage services the following duties, which may not be waived: ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n    (c) To present all written offers, written notices and other written communications to and from either party in a timely manner, regardless of whether the property is subject to an existing contract for sale or the buyer is already a party to an existing contract to purchase.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Brokers owe these duties \"to all parties whom the broker renders real estate brokerage services.\" RCW 18.86.030. \"Real estate brokerage services\" is defined as \"the rendering of services for which a real estate license is required under chapter 18.85 RCW.\" Chapter 18.85, which governs real estate licensure, defines \"real estate brokerage services\" to mean \"any of the following services offered or rendered directly or indirectly to another, or on behalf of another for compensation or the promise or expectation of compensation.\" RCW 18.85.011(17). Thus, while the statute explains that the duties are not waivable, they are owed when only a broker is acting for \"compensation or the promise or expectation of compensation.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    \u00b6 32 To ascertain the scope of Riley's agency we must look to the Listing Agreement to determine the compensation Riley expected to receive for her services. The\n    Listing Agreement defines \"sell\" to include a \"contract to sell; an exchange or contract to exchange; an option to purchase; and/or a lease with option to purchase.\" \"Sell\" is used in the commission section of the Listing Agreement as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n    COMMISSION. If during the Listing Term (a) Seller\n    <em>\n     sells\n    </em>\n    the Property and the buyer does not terminate the agreement prior\n    to closing; or (b) after reasonable exposure of the Property to the market, Firm procures a buyer who is ready, willing, and able to purchase the Property on the terms in this Agreement, Seller will pay ... Firm a commission of 6% of the sales price.... Further, if Seller shall, within six months after the expiration of the Listing Term,\n    <em>\n     sell\n    </em>\n    the Property to any person to whose attention it was brought through the signs, advertising or other action of Firm, or on information secured directly or indirectly from or through Firm, during the Listing Term, Seller will pay Firm the above commission.\n    <sup>\n     [\n    </sup>\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    <sup>\n     ]\n    </sup>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    By the terms of the Listing Agreement, \"selling\" includes \"leasing with option to purchase.\" Thus, the scope of the Listing Agreement included leasing, but only when coupled with an option to purchase.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    \u00b6 33 In the e-mail Riley received from Williams, the e-mail specifically asked if the Beauregards would be interested in renting their house, as opposed to selling.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    The e-mail communication does not fall within the \"real estate brokerage services\" that the Beauregards contracted with Riley because Williams clearly indicated that the interested party only wanted to rent the property. Since Riley's scope of agency was limited to selling the property, Riley was not expecting compensation from renting the property. Therefore Riley did not have a duty to communicate the rental inquiry under RCW18.86.030(1)(c).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    \u00b6 34 We affirm dismissal of the Beauregards' claims.
