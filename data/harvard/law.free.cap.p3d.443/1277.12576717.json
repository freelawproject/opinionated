Leech and several other individuals-including defendant Viliamu Seumanu-held, bound, and transported Middleman and Victim to a remote location in Weber Canyon. There, Leech shot Victim and then told Middleman to shoot Victim or else Leech would kill Middleman. Middleman complied. Seumanu, under the orders of Leech, later destroyed all physical evidence of the murder. Seumanu was charged with murder, aggravated kidnapping of Victim and Middleman, and obstruction of justice. A jury convicted Seumanu on all charges. He appeals one of the aggravated kidnapping convictions for which he was sentenced to life without parole. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    The Murder\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 Middleman was supposed to deliver four ounces of methamphetamine to a distributor (Soules) waiting at a local residence (Residence). Middleman could not reach his supplier and, therefore, could only procure two ounces. During the additional two-day wait to get more methamphetamine, Middleman confided his problem to Victim, who offered to get the remaining two ounces for a little more money. After Middleman was yet again unable to reach his supplier, he accepted Victim's offer to get the additional two ounces without notifying Soules of the deal or the price increase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Middleman waited at a friend's house while Victim went to get the drugs. Victim took longer than expected and stopped answering his phone when Middleman called. This caused Middleman to begin ignoring\n   Soules's repeated requests for an update on where the drugs were.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 After waiting several hours, Middleman had Soules pick him up. Together, they went to the Residence, where Middleman told Soules about Victim and how Victim was now in charge of procuring the additional two ounces of methamphetamine. Soules complained that she had customers waiting and urged Middleman to get the problem taken care of before Leech arrived. Soon thereafter, Leech arrived at the Residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Upon arrival, Leech pulled out a gun and asked Middleman what was going on. Middleman tried to assure Leech that he was dealing with it, to which Leech replied that he had better get it done \"or it was [Middleman's] ass.\" After this exchange, Leech left a man with a gun in the garage with Middleman and refused to let Middleman leave. Around this time, Seumanu and several others arrived at the Residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 In an effort to find and punish Victim, four men-Leech, Seumanu, Middleman, and one other (Myore)-left the Residence and went to an apartment where Victim was supposed to meet Soules. When Victim arrived at the apartment, Leech pulled a gun out and ordered Victim and Middleman to lie face down, side-by-side, on the floor. Leech then frisked them both, removed their shoes, and emptied their pockets. Victim tried to explain that he had the additional two ounces of drugs, but Leech told him to shut up. Leech then ordered Myore to blindfold both men and tie their hands behind their backs, which he did. While there were other people present in the room, including Seumanu, no one tried to stop Leech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 In the early morning hours, Myore transferred Middleman and Victim to the backseat of Myore's truck. Seumanu sat in the backseat next to Middleman and Victim. Myore then drove Leech, Seumanu, Victim, and Middleman to an abandoned road in Weber Canyon, stopping once for gas. During their travels, Victim pleaded for his life and asked them not to follow through with their plan. He promised not to say anything to anyone, but Leech said it was already \"too late.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Leech asked Myore for his firearm, and Myore complied. On Leech's order, Seumanu opened the door of the truck and escorted Middleman and Victim approximately 100 yards down a hill. There, after their faces were uncovered, Middleman looked to Victim, who said, \"I guess this is it,\" and, \"I'm sorry, bro.\" Leech then shot Victim in the back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Next, Leech unbound Middleman's hands. He then handed his gun to Middleman and said, \"There's your home boy, you finish it or I'm going to kill you.\" Middleman attempted to fire a single shot at Victim, but the gun jammed. Middleman quickly gave the gun back to Leech, who ordered Seumanu to point a different gun at Middleman's head. Seumanu did so, and once the original gun was unjammed, Leech gave it back to Middleman. With a gun pressed against the back of Middleman's head, Middleman shot Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 Victim was left alone where he was shot, and the four other men-Leech, Seumanu, Myore, and Middleman-left in the truck. On the way back to the Residence, Leech directed everyone to pretend they were still trying to find Victim. Leech further ordered Myore to clean, vacuum, and shampoo the truck, and he told Seumanu to burn everything belonging to Victim and Middleman. Myore and Seumanu complied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    The Investigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 Several months later, detectives from the West Valley City Police Department discovered Victim's body. Police interviewed many of the people present the night of the murder, including Seumanu. During Seumanu's interview, he claimed that he did not know what the officers were talking about and stated that \"it had been a while since he'd seen\" Middleman; and he last saw Victim three or four months earlier smoking outside an apartment complex in Taylorsville. When pressed further, Seumanu changed his story, admitting that he had been at the Residence with Soules, Myore, Leech, Middleman, and Victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 Seumanu then admitted that he waited for Victim at the Residence along with Soules, Myore, Middleman, and Leech; he\n   got into Myore's truck and went into the mountains; the group stopped for gas on the way to Weber Canyon; they drove about an hour; and they parked near a gate and everyone else got out while he remained at the truck. Seumanu eventually told police that Leech and Myore walked Middleman and Victim down a hill while he followed, that he watched Leech shoot Victim, saw Leech and Middleman walk toward Victim's body, and saw Middleman shoot Victim. Finally, Seumanu stated that when they returned from Weber Canyon, Myore and Leech took care of destroying evidence while he went home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    The Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 Over a year before trial, the State filed charges against Seumanu as an accomplice to one count of murder, two counts of aggravated kidnapping, and one count of obstruction of justice (Information).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Count 3 in the Information is titled \"AGGRAVATED KIDNAPPING\" and makes specific reference to the aggravated kidnapping statute: Utah Code section 76-5-302. The Information also contains the State's probable cause statement describing Seumanu's role in the kidnapping and that during the course of Middleman's kidnapping, Victim was shot and killed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 On the morning of trial, Seumanu received the State's proposed verdict form (Verdict Form), proposed special verdict form (Special Verdict Form), and proposed jury instruction 40 (Instruction 40). The Verdict Form listed the charges-including count 3 for aggravated kidnapping-and required the jury to indicate whether Seumanu was guilty or not guilty on each charge. The Special Verdict Form required the jury to indicate whether it found \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" that \"[d]uring the course of the commission of the Aggravated Kidnapping of [Middleman,] [Seumanu], as a party, caused serious bodily injury to [Victim]\"-which, if found, could result in a sentence of life without parole. Instruction 40 defined the \"as a party\" language used in the Special Verdict Form. Specifically, Instruction 40 stated that \"a person can commit a criminal offense even though that person did not personally do all of the acts that make up the offense\" if \"(1) the defendant had the mental state required to commit the offense, and (2) the defendant solicited, requested, commanded, encouraged, or intentionally aided another to commit the offense, and (3) the offense was committed.\" When Seumanu's counsel received the Verdict Form, the Special Verdict Form, and Instruction 40, he did not object, request a continuance, or indicate that he was unprepared to proceed with trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 At trial, Seumanu claimed that his presence at the murder was coerced by Leech and that his actions did not contribute to the murder. His wife (Wife) also testified that she attempted to persuade Leech not to do anything, but he was \"gone in his mind\" and would not listen. She claimed that she attempted to prevent Leech from taking Seumanu with him, but in response, Leech pointed his gun at her and insisted that Seumanu would be leaving with him. And only then did Seumanu agree to go. Finally, she testified that Seumanu returned the next morning and called her to pick him up at the Residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 At least two accomplice witnesses also testified that (1) Seumanu had a gun at some point on the night of the murder; (2) Leech handled two guns at the murder scene while Seumanu stood close by; (3) Seumanu was present for the drive up Weber Canyon; (4) Seumanu hiked to the murder scene with Leech, Middleman, and Victim; (5) Seumanu returned to the Residence with the others; and (6) Leech ordered Seumanu to burn everything belonging to Middleman and Victim. The trial court did not specifically provide a cautionary instruction on accomplice testimony, but it did provide a general credibility instruction educating jurors generally on witness credibility, including explicit instructions to consider whether any witnesses had a personal interest in the outcome of the trial or had some other bias or motive to testify a certain way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 After the evidence phase of trial, the parties discussed the jury instructions and\n   verdict forms. This time, Seumanu objected to the Special Verdict Form on the grounds that he had not received notice in the Information that the State was seeking a life without parole sentence. The court overruled the objection and allowed the State's Special Verdict Form to be submitted to the jury. The court also allowed the Verdict Form and Instruction 40 as proposed by the State to be submitted to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b618 The jury convicted Seumanu on all charges and further found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Seumanu had caused serious bodily injury to Victim during the commission of the aggravated kidnapping of Middleman. The judge ultimately imposed the statutory indeterminate sentences for three of the four felony convictions and life without parole for one of the aggravated kidnapping convictions. Seumanu appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 Seumanu raises three issues on appeal. First, he asserts that he is entitled to a new trial because his Sixth Amendment right to be given fair notice of the charges against him was violated when the State failed to provide adequate notice that it would seek a factual finding of \"serious bodily injury\" under the aggravated kidnapping statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"A claim of inadequate notice presents a question of law that we review for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Bragg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7257984\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/317/452/\">\n    2013 UT App 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7257984\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/317/452/\">\n    317 P.3d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b620 Second, Seumanu argues that his defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by not objecting to the \"as a party\" language in the Special Verdict Form and/or Instruction 40, which defined the term. When a defendant argues that his counsel was ineffective for the first time on appeal, there is no ruling for this court to review and the issue presents a question of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Ott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988245\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/344/\">\n    2010 UT 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988245\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/247/344/\">\n    247 P.3d 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b621 Third, Seumanu argues that the trial court plainly erred by not sua sponte providing a cautionary jury instruction on accomplice testimony. Ordinarily, claims regarding alleged errors in the jury instructions are reviewed for correctness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Malaga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8427156\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/132/703/\">\n    2006 UT App 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8427156\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/132/703/\">\n    132 P.3d 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But because Seumanu failed to preserve the issue, we review for plain error.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8427156\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/132/703/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   I. Notice of Intent to Seek a Finding of \"Serious Bodily Injury\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b622 Seumanu contends that the State violated his Sixth Amendment right to fair notice of the charges against him because it failed to provide adequate notice that it intended to seek a factual finding of \"serious bodily injury\" which, if found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury, would result in a sentence of life without parole. After oral argument, we ordered supplemental briefing for clarification on two key issues: (A) whether a finding of \"serious bodily injury\" is an\n   element of the offense under\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v.

Ineffective Assistance\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b634 Next, Seumanu argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to (1) the \"as a party\" language in the Special Verdict Form and/or (2) Instruction 40, which defined the phrase \"as a party\" in terms of accomplice liability. His position is grounded on the premise that the aggravated kidnapping statute requires that he personally cause serious bodily injury to another during the kidnapping to be subject to a sentence of life without parole. In other words, Seumanu argues that accomplice liability cannot attach to aggravated kidnapping because that statute is phrased in terms of direct liability, not indirect liability. And therefore, his counsel's failure to object constitutes ineffective assistance. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b635 First, we reject Seumanu's argument that accomplice liability cannot attach to criminal statutes that are phrased in terms of direct, rather than indirect, liability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-302\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3)(b) (LexisNexis 2017) (providing that aggravated kidnapping is punishable by a term of life without parole \"if the trier of fact finds that during the course of the commission of the aggravated kidnapping\n   <em>\n    the defendant caused\n   </em>\n   serious bodily injury to another\" (emphasis added));\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-302\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-5-202(1) (\"Criminal homicide constitutes aggravated murder if\n   <em>\n    the actor\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    causes\n   </em>\n   the death of another.\" (emphasis added)).

The general rule is that an accurate instruction upon the basic elements of an offense is required.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Utah's accomplice liability statute provides that a defendant is liable for criminal conduct if, \"acting with the mental state required for the commission of an offense,\" he \"solicits, requests, commands, encourages, or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-2-202\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-2-202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2017). Instruction 40 stated that \"a person can commit a criminal offense even though that person did not personally do all the acts that make up the offense\" if \"(1) the defendant had the mental state required to commit the offense, and (2) the defendant solicited, requested, commanded, encouraged, or intentionally aided another to commit the offense, and (3) the offense was committed.\" In our view, Instruction 40 properly instructed the jury that Seumanu could be found guilty, \"as a party,\" under the theory of accomplice liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b638 Similarly, the Special Verdict Form correctly instructed the jury on aggravated kidnapping. The aggravated kidnapping statute, in relevant part, provides that the crime is \"a first degree felony punishable by a term of imprisonment of ... life without parole, if the trier of fact finds that during the course of the commission of the aggravated kidnapping the defendant caused serious bodily injury to another.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-302\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3)(b). The Special Verdict Form stated that the jury was required to indicate whether it found \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" that \"[d]uring the course of the commission of the Aggravated Kidnapping of [Middleman,] [Seumanu], as a party, caused serious bodily injury to [Victim].\" Thus, aside from the \"as a party\" phrase, the Special Verdict Form is a verbatim recital of the serious bodily injury clause of the aggravated kidnapping statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b639 Taken as a whole, Instruction 40 and the Special Verdict Form correctly instructed the jury on accomplice liability as applied to aggravated kidnapping. In light of the fact that accomplice liability can, and does, extend criminal liability arising from statutes that are phrased in terms of direct liability,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945934\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/322/761/\">\n    2014 UT App 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 55,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945934\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/322/761/\">\n    322 P.3d 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that Instruction 40 adequately describes the theory of accomplice liability,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-2-202\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-2-202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the phrase \"as a party\" as used in the Special Verdict Form and Instruction 40 was not erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b640 Accordingly, we also reject Seumanu's claim of ineffective assistance. \"To succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, [Seumanu] must show both that counsel's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beckering\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879699\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/346/672/\">\n    2015 UT App 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879699\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/346/672/\">\n    346 P.3d 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).

Thus, Seumanu's ineffective assistance claim must fail if objections to the Special Verdict Form and Instruction 40 would have been futile if raised.

Cautionary Instruction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b641 Finally, Seumanu argues that the trial court plainly erred by not sua sponte providing an accomplice instruction. Specifically, Seumanu argues that the trial court erred by ignoring its \"obligat[ion] to properly apprise the jury of the potentially unreliable nature of the accomplices' testimony by means of a special cautionary instruction.\" (cleaned up). An accomplice instruction is required only when (1) an accomplice (2) gives uncorroborated testimony, and (3) the judge finds the testimony \"to be self contradictory, uncertain or improbable.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

To demonstrate plain error, Seumanu must show that \"(i) [a]n error exists; (ii) the error should have been obvious to the trial court; and (iii) the error is harmful, i.e., absent the error, there is a reasonable likelihood of a more favorable outcome for the appellant, or phrased differently, our confidence in the verdict is undermined.\"\n   <em>\n    Dunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10366314\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/850/1201/#p1226\">\n    850 P.2d at 1208-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b643 Here, Seumanu cannot show error-let alone obvious error-because no accomplice instruction was required for two reasons. First, any accomplice testimony of Seumanu's whereabouts on the night of the kidnapping and murder was corroborated by non-accomplice testimony. Specifically, Seumanu admitted,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Wife testified at trial, that he was at the Residence while Victim and Middleman were held at gunpoint and tied-up; he left the Residence with Leech, Myore, Victim, and Middleman; and Wife picked him up at the Residence in the morning. Thus, accomplice testimony placing Seumanu at the scene of the crime was sufficiently corroborated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b644 Second, Seumanu has not demonstrated that other accomplice testimony relevant to Seumanu's conduct and participation in the kidnapping and murder,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16, was so obviously self-contradictory, uncertain, or improbable that the court's decision not to give an accomplice instruction was plainly in error. Seumanu's sole argument on this point is that each accomplice admitted generally to not being completely honest with police during the investigation. This falls short of showing that an accomplice instruction was obviously required.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Marquina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%20219\">\n    2018 UT App 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 49,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12574771\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/437/628/\">\n    437 P.3d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that uncorroborated accomplice testimony was sufficient when \"as to the core issue-[the defendant's] involvement in the [crime]-the stories were consistent\" and that \"it was for the jury to weigh the evidence and to determine the credibility of the witnesses\" (cleaned up)). Indeed, Seumanu's general argument that accomplices were not honest with police during their initial investigation does not demonstrate that the accomplice testimony at trial was inconsistent as to any specific fact, let alone a \"core issue.\" And certainly, the nuance of the argument Seumanu now makes on appeal would not have been obvious to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b645 Because the aforementioned material testimony was either corroborated by Seumanu and his own witness, or otherwise not so obviously inconsistent that a cautionary accomplice instruction was required,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2077-17-7\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 77-17-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (LexisNexis 2017), we conclude that the court did not commit plain error by not providing such an instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b646 Moreover, even if the trial court's decision not to give an accomplice instruction was obvious error, Seumanu cannot show that the error was harmful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10366314\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/850/1201/#p1226\">\n    850 P.2d at 1208-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, the trial court instructed jurors generally on witness credibility, including explicit instructions to consider whether any witnesses had a personal interest in the outcome of the trial or had some other bias or motive to testify a certain way. Under these circumstances, an accomplice instruction \"was simply not necessary to prompt the jury to question [the] veracity\" of the accomplice witnesses, because the testimony, the arguments, and the general instructions had already \"alerted the jury to [their] possible motives[s] for testifying\n   with less than total candor.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Additionally, Seumanu's trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the Special Verdict Form and/or Instruction 40 because those instructions correctly informed the jury of accomplice liability theory potentially applicable to this appeal.
