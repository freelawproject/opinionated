In\n   <em>\n    Kanahele\n   </em>\n   , the Hawai'i Supreme Court held that conflicting information contained in declarations in support of a motion for summary judgment, without sufficient explanation by the moving party, could render untrustworthy, and thus inadmissible, the record evidence under HRE Rule 803(b)(6), even if the witnesses were otherwise qualified and the evidence was otherwise admissible.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201931703\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *8 &amp; *10. The supreme court clarified, however, that \"not all mistakes, or allegations of mistake, in a company's business records will render that company's record-keeping practices untrustworthy, and therefore render their records inadmissible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. \"[V]ague testimony that a company 'kept bad paperwork,' without more, [does] not warrant a conclusion that the company's records as a whole were untrustworthy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (brackets omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v. Forman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313905\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/125/417/#p424\">\n    125 Hawai'i 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424-25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313905\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/125/417/#p424\">\n    263 P.3d 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 134-35 (App. 2011) ). Thus, while the totality of the circumstances must be considered when evaluating the trustworthiness of a business record, application of the business records rule cannot be avoided on the basis \"that a regular practice is occasionally broken.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the present case, the Gaspars contend on appeal that the records authenticated by the Fullmer Declaration raise questions regarding whether Citibank actually possessed the Note at the time the Complaint was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Fullmer Declaration states that the mortgage on the Gaspars' property was assigned to Citibank and recorded on April 27, 2009. There is no information as to whether the original, physical copy of the Note, and indorsement in blank, were delivered to Citibank's (or its agent's) possession at that time. Paragraph three of the Fullmer Declaration states that \"\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff [Citibank] does not hold or maintain any of the loan level business records\n   </em>\n   , and thus Plaintiff [Citibank] does not have loan level business records to integrate into SPS's records.\" (Emphasis added). However, paragraph twelve of the Fullmer Declaration states that \"\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff [Citibank], directly or through an agent, has possession of the [N]ote\n   </em>\n   in this instant action[ ], which has been duly endorsed,\n   <em>\n    and was in possession of the Note at the time of the filing of the complaint\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphases added). The Fullmer Declaration further states that Exhibit 4 to the MSJ was an excerpt from SPS's internal records indicating that the original Note, and attached indorsement in blank, were located in a specific SPS facility as of April 12, 2017, prior to Citibank's filing of the Complaint on April 21, 2017. Thus, the Fullmer Declaration is internally inconsistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Additionally, the Fullmer Declaration and its exhibits do not establish that on April 12, 2017, SPS held the Note\n   <em>\n    on behalf of Citibank\n   </em>\n   . According to Exhibit 8 to the Fullmer Declaration, SPS did not become attorney-in-fact for JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (JPMorgan), the \"Master Servicer\" for Citibank, until October 24, 2017; and JPMorgan did not become attorney-in-fact for Citibank until October 4, 2017. Thus, the record is devoid of any evidence showing that SPS held the Note on behalf of Citibank when the Complaint was filed on April 21, 2017. Because Citibank has not shown that it was entitled to enforce the Note when the Complaint was filed on April 21, 2017, summary judgment was inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    Reves-Toledo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314812\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/139/361/#p367\">\n    139 Hawai'i at 368-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=390%20P.3d%201255\">\n    390 P.3d 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Gaspars also contend on appeal that various prior assignments of the mortgage were invalid because they involved persons named as \"robo-signers\" in other cases and they were in violation of the relevant pooling and servicing agreement (PSA). As we resolve the case on other grounds, a determination of the legal effect of robo-signing is not necessary at this time.\n   <em>\n    Mattos\n   </em>\n   , 140 Hawai'i at 34, 398 P.3d at 623.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Regarding whether the assignments of the mortgages violated the relevant PSA, the Gaspars do not provide the actual text of the PSA, so there is no evidence that the prior mortgage assignments violated the terms of the PSA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35, 398 P.3d at 624. As third parties, unrelated to the PSA, the Gaspars lack \"standing to challenge assignments based on alleged violations of the PSA's terms unless the violation would render the assignment void.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, because the PSA is not in evidence, we do not decide whether any of its terms were violated and, if so, whether any such violation renders an assignment void or voidable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the May 18, 2018 \"Judgment\" filed in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit is vacated. This case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Hawaiian Ocean View Estates Road Maintenance Corporation is also named as a Defendant-Appellee, but did not participate in the appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The Honorable Henry T.

While it is true that HRAP Rule 28(b) requires that an opening brief on appeal contain certain elements, we acknowledge that Hawai'i's appellate courts \"consistently adhere[ ] to the policy of affording [pro se] litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible[.]\"\n    <em>\n     Hous.
