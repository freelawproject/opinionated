Norman and Gerry Molotsky (\"Movants\") appeal the superior court's denial of their motion to intervene and corresponding award of attorneys' fees to Heritage Village II Homeowners' Association (\"Heritage\") and Richard and Laine Weinberg. The Weinbergs cross-appeal the court's partial denial of their application for attorneys' fees. The superior court denied intervention for two reasons: (1) Movants did not seek intervention in a timely manner, and (2) Movants' ability to protect their interests would not be impaired or impeded because they could pursue a separate cause of action. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that Movants were not untimely and that the availability of a separate cause of action does not create a per se prohibition to intervention of right. Accordingly, we reverse the superior court's order denying the motion to intervene and vacate the orders awarding fees and dismissing the lawsuit. We remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 The Weinbergs own a home located in Heritage Village II, which is part of the McCormick Ranch master-planned community in Scottsdale. In July 2014, Heritage sued the Weinbergs alleging they violated the applicable covenants, conditions, and restrictions\n   (\"CC&amp;Rs\") in building their new home. The complaint included claims for declaratory relief, breach of contract, and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 After a three-day hearing, the superior court granted declaratory relief, concluding the Weinbergs had violated the CC&amp;Rs and ordering them to bring their home into compliance. Thereafter, the court awarded Heritage $111,711.53 in attorneys' fees and $3,932.22 in costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 The superior court then entered an order directing the Weinbergs to take specific remedial measures to bring their home into compliance with the CC&amp;Rs. Nine months later, Heritage moved to compel compliance with the order. Granting the motion in part, the superior court noted that the parties were still unable to agree on modifications necessary to bring the Weinbergs' home into compliance with the CC&amp;Rs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Meanwhile, Heritage's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") began to disagree on litigation strategy, dividing into a four-member majority and a three-member minority. In July 2017, the Board majority voted to settle with the Weinbergs, who agreed to make minor changes to their home in exchange for Heritage's promise to release them from liability for all attorneys' fees, including the $111,711.53 already awarded. The majority reasoned that there was \"no end in sight\" to the litigation and that Heritage was not financially able to further pursue the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Movants are homeowners and members of Heritage. One day before Heritage and the Weinbergs filed their notice of settlement, Movants filed an emergency motion to intervene pursuant to Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 24(a)(2), and filed an independent lawsuit in superior court against the Weinbergs.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Maricopa County Superior Court Case No. CV2017-009249.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Heritage and the Weinbergs opposed Movants' intervention motion. Following oral argument, the superior court denied the motion to intervene and awarded Heritage and the Weinbergs some, but not all, of their attorneys' fees incurred in responding to the motion. The court then entered final judgment approving the settlement and dismissing all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Movants appealed, and the Weinbergs cross-appealed from the partial denial of their request for attorneys' fees.

Under this rule, the superior court must permit intervention when four conditions are satisfied: (1) the motion is timely; (2) the movants claim an interest relating to the subject of the action; (3) the movants show that disposition of the action may, as a practical matter, impair or impede their ability to protect their interests; and (4) the movants show that existing parties do not adequately represent their interests.\n   <em>\n    Woodbridge Structured Funding, LLC v.

Timeliness hinges on two discrete questions: \"the stage at which the action has progressed before intervention is sought and whether the applicant was in a position to seek intervention at an earlier stage of the proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Winner Enterprises, Ltd. v.

Ariz. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2). Because Movants could not seek intervention of right until their interests diverged from those of Heritage, the Rule implicitly provides that timeliness must be measured from the stage in the proceedings at which Heritage no longer represented Movant's interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 Our supreme court reached the same conclusion in interpreting an earlier version of the Rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    John F.

In denying the motion to intervene, the superior court did not determine whether the resolution of this case could possibly have an impact on the Movants' interest in enforcing the CC&amp;Rs against the Weinbergs.

When proposed intervenors meet the minimal burden of showing that disposition of the action may impair or impede their ability to protect their interest, then the availability of an alternative forum, by itself, does not preclude intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b623 Thus, even if Movants can independently sue to enforce the CC&amp;Rs,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   intervention is proper if Movant's ability to enforce the CC&amp;Rs may be impaired by the resolution of the current action. At a minimum, without intervention, Movants are denied the ability to weigh in on the merits of any settlement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2258148\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/500/349/#p353\">\n    500 F.2d at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (allowing intervention where proposed intervenors sought \"to influence the manner in which the school district exercises its admitted discretion\" in resolving the underlying action). In light of the remedial nature of Rule 24 and the minimal burden placed on proposed intervenors, we conclude that the disposition of the underlying case may, as a practical matter, impair or impede Movants' ability to protect their claimed interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b624 Accordingly, we reverse the superior court's order denying intervention and remand for further proceedings. Because we reverse the denial of intervention, we must vacate the judgment approving the settlement agreement and dismissing all claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McGough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"745144\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/143/26/#p30\">\n    143 Ariz. at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"745144\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/143/26/#p30\">\n    691 P.2d at 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that if an order denying intervention is reversed, the entire judgment will be reversed).
