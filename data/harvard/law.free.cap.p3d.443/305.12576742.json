BLUME, Respondent.\n </parties>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-2\">\n  No. 119,027\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-3\">\n  Supreme Court of Kansas.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-4\">\n  Opinion filed June 28, 2019.\n </decisiondate>\n <attorneys id=\"p-5\">\n  Penny R. Moylan, Deputy Disciplinary Administrator, argued the cause, and Stanton A.

Blume, an Overland Park attorney admitted to the practice of law in Kansas in 1977.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On September 8, 2017, the office of the Disciplinary Administrator filed a formal complaint against the respondent alleging violations of the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct (KRPC). The respondent timely filed an answer to the complaint on October 2, 2017. A hearing was held on the complaint before a panel of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys on November 21, 2017, where the respondent was personally present and was represented by counsel, Jonathan C. Becker. The hearing panel determined that respondent violated KRPC 3.1 (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 349) (meritorious claims and contentions); 3.3(a)(1) (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 350) (candor toward tribunal); 3.4(d) (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 353) (compliance with discovery request); 4.4(a) (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 363) (respect for rights of third persons); 8.4(c) (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 387) (conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and 8.4(d) (conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The hearing focused on whether the respondent's behavior with respect to four issues should lead to disciplinary sanction under the rules cited in the complaint. The first issue arose out of the inadequacy of his response to a discovery request. The second and third arose out of two incidents that occurred during a deposition, when he called the videographer a Nazi and, in common parlance, flipped off a representative of an opposing party. The fourth issue arose out of his motion to set aside an earlier agreed judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After the hearing, the panel made findings of fact and arrived at conclusions of law and a disciplinary recommendation for this court. They read in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Findings of Fact\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"8.

According to L.O., he explained to J.S. that G.O. was not available to sign the agreement. Also according to L.O., J.S. instructed L.O. to sign G.O.'s name because [J.S.] needed the pledge agreement signed that day. L.O. did not have authorization from G.O. to sign her name.

Because of the bankruptcy stay, [L.O.] did not respond to his set of RPDs.

The respondent did not include J.S.'s March 27, 2012[,] email within these documents. FNBO's counsel replied to the respondent on July 27, 2012, stating, '[i]f the PDF contains a copy of all documents currently in your possession, then I see no reason to come out to your office tomorrow and review the hard copies at this time.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"23. The respondent did not reply to this email message or otherwise indicate that he had any other additional documents in\n   his possession that were not contained within the 80-page attachment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"24. The respondent did not produce the March 27, 2012, email until J.S.'s deposition on August 18, 2015. After FNBO's counsel completed his direct examination of J.S., the respondent offered the March 27, 2012, email as Exhibit 26 to the deposition. FNBO's counsel objected to the introduction of [the] March 27, 2012, email message because it had not been previously produced to FNBO in response to its request for production of documents. The respondent indicated that he did not provide the email message during discovery because '[i]t's a document produced by [L.O.]. His document requests are not due yet' [due to the bankruptcy filing].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"25. On September 4, 2015, FNBO filed an adversary proceeding in L.O.'s bankruptcy, seeking to have its judgment declared to be nondischargeable, claiming that L.O. forged G.O.'s signature on several loan documents and overstated real property values on two personal financial statements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"26. On September 10, 2015, FNBO filed a motion for sanctions based on the respondent's failure to timely produce the March 27, 2012, email message. The respondent filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion for sanctions on September 28, 2015, arguing that (1) the email message was FNBO's document and G.O. was not obligated to produce a copy of a document which FNBO had in its possession, (2) FNBO failed to produce this document to the respondent, (3) the respondent's failure to produce the email message was inadvertent, and (4) counsel for FNBO neglected to contact the respondent about the omission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"27. That same day, on September 10, 2015, [District Judge James F. Vano] held a status conference. During the status conference, the respondent stated that he did not produce the email message during discovery because 'it's an impeachment document.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"28. On November 13, 2015, [Judge Vano] held a hearing on the motion for sanctions. Regarding the March 27, 2012, email message, the respondent stated, 'Judge, we didn't withhold it. I considered it an impeachment document.' But, yet, still later in that same hearing, the respondent stated, '[i]t was [L.O.]'s document. When he took bankruptcy, I couldn't go near him.' Ultimately, the following exchange between the respondent and the court occurred:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   'THE COURT: You're admitting you did not include that in your responses to the request for production of documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   'MR.

BLUME: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   'THE COURT: And you knew at that point in time you had not produced it in response to the request for production of documents. Is that what you are saying?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   'MR. BLUME: No, sir. I am saying I considered it an impeachment document at that time that I probably wouldn't need, because I couldn't believe they would submit perjurious testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   'THE COURT: Did you produce it in response to the request for production of documents?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   'MR. BLUME: I did-as a supplement response? I did not produce it at the time, because I didn't have it at the time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   'THE COURT: Prior to the deposition of [J.S.]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   'MR. BLUME: No. I did not. Gave it to me a week before the deposition.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Based upon the evidence presented to [him], [Judge Vano] found:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   'THE COURT: All right. It appears to the Court that [G.O.] had access to, if not the actual document in hand, Exhibit 26, the attachment to the motion for sanctions at the time of drafting the petition. The language in Paragraphs [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] 11 of the petition referencing communication between [J.S.] and [L.O.] and [G.O.]'s petition in Paragraph 11 and in Paragraph 38 so closely mirrors the language in the e-mail that it appears to the Court that [G.O.] had the document at the time of the petition. The document's [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] clearly covered by the request for all production of documents, Paragraph 6, 15, and 27, at a minimum; and it clearly was not produced. It was held back as indicated on purpose for the purposes of impeachment. That defeats the purpose of discovery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   '... The only sanction that appears to be appropriate is dismissal of the case. So, [G.O.]'s petition is dismissed on that basis.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Even though G.O.'s claims were dismissed, the litigation remained pending because FNBO had previously filed counterclaims and cross-claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \"29. On February [16], 2016, the respondent filed a motion to alter or amend the February 3, 2016, journal entry. In the motion, the respondent asserted that he had properly disclosed the March 27, 2012, email message. The respondent stated, '[it] was clear that [G.O.] disclosed the [J.S.] email and had it ready and available for counsel to pick up on June 9, 2015' and he 'clearly made the document available.' The respondent did not acknowledge that prior to the agreed inspection date, the respondent assured opposing counsel that he had scanned and emailed all responsive documents in his possession.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \"30. On March 4, 2016, counsel for FNBO opposed the respondent's motion to alter or amend the journal entry, arguing that the respondent had taken 'at least five different positions' regarding the disclosure of the March 27, 2012, email.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \"31. During a March 22, 2016, deposition of G.O., the respondent called the deposition videographer, D.M., a 'Nazi.' From a previous encounter, the respondent had come to learn that D.M. had German ancestry. D.M. did nothing to provoke this attack and was offended by the respondent's comment. During this same deposition, the respondent intentionally gestured using his middle finger toward J.W., a[n] FNBO representative. Both J.W. and D.M. witnessed this gesture. J.W. was offended by the respondent's gesture.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \"32. Consequently, on April 20, 2016, FNBO filed a motion asking the court to hold the respondent in indirect contempt of court. While the respondent filed a memorandum in opposition to FNBO's motion to hold the respondent in indirect contempt on May 9, 2016, the respondent failed to address the allegations that on March 22, 2016, he called D.M. a Nazi and he gestured using his middle finger to J.W. The respondent complained that FNBO's counsel was 'going after' the respondent 'for allegations that occurred two years ago.' However, the allegations regarding the respondent's conduct at the deposition occurred just less than one month prior to the filing of the motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \"33. On June 27, 2016, [Judge Vano] took up the respondent's motion to alter or amend as well as FNBO's motion to hold the respondent in indirect contempt. During that hearing, the respondent testified that he did not recall calling D.M. a Nazi, that he gestured using his middle finger toward J.W. after being provoked, and that he apologized to J.W. According to J.W., he did not provoke the respondent and the respondent never apologized to him. The district court concluded that there 'seems to be a continuing lack of civility on the part of [the respondent].' However, the court concluded that because he did not previously adopt civility guidelines, he did not make a contempt finding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \"34. On June 29, 2016, FNBO filed [a disciplinary] complaint against the respondent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \"35. On July 1, 2016, [Judge Vano] issued a memorandum decision and order denying respondent's motion to alter or\n   amend the February 3, 2016, journal entry. The court stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   'This dispute is centered upon a document (herein referred to as \"Exhibit 26\" or as \"the document\" or \"the exhibit\") that was not produced until [G.O.] was about to begin cross-examination of a defense witness during his deposition held in Kearney, Nebraska, as an out-of-state witness to be used for trial in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   'The findings previously made by the Court are again adopted in this decision.

The document was not produced until [G.O.] began her cross-examination of the witness, [J.S.], in Nebraska. [G.O.] and [the respondent] had the document in their possession or control from the beginning of this case. The [respondent] willfully and intentionally withheld the document from production, either on his own accord or with consent of [G.O.], believing he could do so for \"impeachment purposes\" rather than answer the discovery responses timely and truthfully and without the subterfuge and the duplicity that they have used in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   'As pointed out by the Defendant, [the respondent] has adopted differing versions of the facts surrounding production of Exhibit 26. They are not consistent and appear disingenuous. This Motion is difficult to address as we fight our way through a tangled web of some irrelevant ramblings and vagaries raised by [the respondent].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   'At one time, [the respondent] claimed the document, an email from [J.S.] to [L.O.], was available for inspection at [the respondent]'s office. He even cites to that response in this Motion to Alter or Amend currently before the Court. He says that on June 9, 2015, he sent the following to counsel for the Defendant in response to a request for production of documents:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   \"One email from [J.S.] to Defendant [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] will be produced at the Law Offices of Gregory V.

However, on July 27, 2015, [the respondent] sent an email to [FNBO's counsel] in which he indicated that he had scanned what [G.O.] has and sent a PDF attachment to [FNBO's counsel] to review in the hope of saving him \"some time and gas\" to review the hard copies. [FNBO's counsel] took the PDF attachment as an indication that all documents were then produced. However, the document was not in the 80-page file which [the respondent] sent and which [FNBO's counsel] was led to believe contained all of the documents for production without any need for him to visit [the respondent]'s office for others. Nevertheless, in his Motion to Alter or Amend, [the respondent] writes,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   \"However, [Defendant's] counsel never contacted the undersigned regarding the [J.S.] email after receiving [G.O.]'s disclosure, the very email for which counsel requested sanctions [\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 26, the March 27, 2012, [J.S.] email].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Furthermore, despite [the respondent]'s indication that he told [FNBO's counsel] he had the exhibit in his office on June 9, 2015, [the respondent] stood before this Court on November 13, 2015, and told the Court he did not produce the document because he did not have it and that he did not have it until \"a week before the deposition.\" The deposition of [J.S.] was on August 18, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   'Even if [the respondent]'s incongruent versions of the facts were carefully parsed in order to extract facts favorable to [G.O.], [the respondent] clearly had Exhibit 26 in his possession before he drove to Nebraska for the deposition and before the start of the deposition of [J.S.]. He could have given the document to [FNBO's counsel] at\n   that time. [G.O.] had a duty to supplement her discovery responses even then. Clearly, [the respondent] had intended all along to withhold the document and use it to impeach or at the very least embarrass [J.S.] when [G.O.] had a plain duty to comply with discovery. The facts found support the conclusion that [the respondent] was intentionally less than forthcoming in the discovery process. In fact, it appears that by producing the PDF to [FNBO's counsel] the day before his planned visit to [the respondent]'s law office, without including what was later marked as Exhibit 26, [G.O.] intended to obfuscate, confuse, and mislead [FNBO's counsel].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   '...

The first is the discovery concern,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the failure to produce the document. [G.O.] had the document when the Petition for Damages was drafted, included language from the document in her pleadings, and in response to discovery [G.O.] told the Defendant it had the document on June 9, 2015. But then, [the respondent] decided to send all documents which [G.O.] had and that Defendant requested via her PDF attachment to save \"time and gas\" yet failed to include the very document which she knew she had and had identified as being available for inspection. Finally, despite not producing it in response to discovery and despite having clear possession of the document in Nebraska prior to the beginning of [J.S.]'s deposition, still did not timely supplement her discovery responses or produce it until beginning cross-examination of the witness, indicating it was intentionally withheld for impeachment of what [the respondent] calls \"perjurious testimony\" from the Defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   'The second concern is the lack of candor to the Court and opposing counsel. [The respondent] told the Court he did not have the document until a week before the Nebraska deposition. That is an obvious misstatement made clear now in the Motion to Alter or Amend. [The respondent] told Defendant's counsel he had the document in June, two months before the deposition and it is clear he had used the document prior to that time when he drafted the Petition for Damages. Then [the respondent] sent the incomplete and misleading PDF attachment to [FNBO's counsel] the day before he was scheduled to inspect all of the requested documents at [the respondent]'s office. [The respondent], a very experienced courtroom lawyer, told the Court he did not think he had to produce the document because he was going to use it for cross-examination. His conduct appears, therefore, to have been calculated and intentional.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   'There must certainly be alternative remedies the Court could further consider. However, the Court cannot divorce the two major concerns and does not think it is appropriate to consider alternative sanctions or conditions for reinstatement of [G.O.]s' case so long as [the respondent] refuses to acknowledge his lack of candor with opposing counsel and with the Court concerning his and his client's intentional failure to comply with discovery. A mere discovery abuse could be dealt with by sanctions and conditions,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , including disallowing Exhibit 26 and any testimony concerning that document or its contents, and disallowing any cross-examination of [J.S.], among other considerations. However, without any acknowledgment of the discovery abuse and without any acknowledgment of the duplicity and lack of candor to any degree coming from [G.O.], the judicial process is undermined and any less sanction appears to be unjust punishment and unfair to both sides of this case. Under the circumstances, dismissal of [G.O.]'s claims is the only appropriate remedy.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   \"36.

Based on the language used in the petition, the hearing panel likewise believes that the respondent received the March 27, 2012, email prior to filing suit on behalf of G.O. However, in order to find a violation of Rule 3.3(a)(1), the hearing panel is not required to make that finding. The respondent admits that he had the email prior to June 9, 2016, when he filed G.O.'s responses to FNBO's first request for production of documents. When the respondent stated to the court that he had not received the March 27, 2012, email message until one week prior to the August 18, 2015, deposition of J.S., the respondent made a false statement of material fact.

The hearing panel further recommends that prior to reinstatement, the respondent be required to undergo\n   a hearing pursuant to Kan. Sup. Ct. R. 219. At the reinstatement hearing, the hearing panel recommends that the respondent establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that he understands how he violated the rules and that he understands the disrepute he brought to the profession by his actions.

Even if each of these accusations had merit, which we do not decide, that merit would have no impact on whether the respondent committed the violations at issue before us today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   On admissions, at various points in his exceptions, the respondent asserts that he has offered to apologize to D.M. and pay $200 to D.M.'s favorite charity for calling D.M. a Nazi; he does not, and, according to his testimony at the panel hearing, cannot deny having made the offensive remark in the first place. We note that this position marks a departure from the respondent's statement in the district court hearing on the motion to hold respondent in contempt that followed the name calling. At that point, the respondent said he did not remember calling D.M. a Nazi and asserted that \"[s]omebody by the name of Blume would not\" say that. With regard to the respondent's vulgar gesture toward the FNBO representative at G.O.'s deposition, the respondent asserts that the gesture was a spontaneous response to the representative's reference to being \" 'sick of this low rent guy,' \" referring to respondent. Again, even if the representative engaged in less than appropriate behavior, the respondent does not deny that the vulgar gesture was made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The variability in respondent's representations with respect to the discovery violation demonstrates his total inability to keep his story straight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The petition the respondent filed on behalf of G.O. repeated unusual language from the email that was not produced until the deposition of J.S. And, when the respondent listed the materials that would be provided in response to the discovery request, he identified an email from J.S. Nevertheless, the next month, when he produced what he represented as all of the responsive documents in G.O.'s possession, he did not produce the email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Three weeks later, the respondent attempted to use the unproduced email to impeach J.S. at his deposition. When this effort was challenged by opposing counsel, the respondent said he had not produced the email on behalf of G.O. because it was L.O.'s document and L.O.'s bankruptcy stay meant that L.O.'s discovery responses were not yet due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Less than a month later, the respondent instead told Judge Vano that he had not produced the email because it was an \"impeachment document.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   In his still later written response to FNBO's motion for sanctions, the respondent gave multiple conflicting reasons the email had not been produced. None focused on the email's use for impeachment. The respondent took the position that he did not have to produce the opposing party's own document. He also said that counsel for FNBO was at fault for failing to question his representation that everything in G.O.'s possession had been produced, when the respondent earlier listed the email and it was not included. He also referred to the failure to produce the email as \"inadverten[ce]\" and \"an oversight.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   When Judge Vano held a hearing on the motion for sanctions, the respondent expressed his opinion that it was legally impossible for him to have withheld an \"impeachment\" document, revisited L.O.'s bankruptcy as an obstacle to production, and said for the first time that he gained possession of the email only one week before the deposition of J.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Later, when challenging Judge Vano's dismissal of G.O.'s claim as a sanction for the discovery violation, the respondent again insisted in his motion to alter or amend that he had disclosed the document and made it\n   available to opposing counsel before the deposition. He did not mention that he had left it out of the group of documents produced and described by him as the entire universe of what was accessible to G.O.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   At the hearing before the panel, the respondent confirmed on direct examination that on June 9, 2015, he had listed the email from J.S. as a document to be produced. He said that the email was L.O.'s and \"not [G.O.'s] to hold\" but nevertheless thought he had produced the document. He also confirmed that he had a copy of the document in his possession before the deposition of J.S. On cross-examination, the respondent said that he did not believe he had the email at the time he drafted the petition on behalf of G.O.; did have it on June 9, 2015; and yet received a copy for the first time in late July 2015, shortly before the J.S. deposition. When questioned by the panel itself, the respondent said he had not turned over the email because he \"figured [FNBO] had it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Finally, in his exceptions to the Final Hearing Report, the respondent asserted that he had reviewed the email when drafting the petition filed for G.O. but did not keep a copy of it. He suggested that L.O. may have retrieved it from the respondent's office. He then said that the email again was in his possession about a week before the deposition of J.S. He also appeared to attribute the failure to produce the document to his opponent to a \"flurry of activity\" on related litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Respondent's exceptions, overall, share the incoherence of his shifting position on the discovery violation. As a result, they are almost entirely unavailing to prevent our adoption of the hearing panel's findings of fact and conclusions of law. We have only two reservations, but the respondent's victories on these points are ultimately hollow for the reasons we now detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   In both Paragraph 43 and Paragraph 48 of the Final Hearing Report, the panel agrees with Judge Vano's unflattering assessment of the respondent's motion to alter or amend the dismissal of G.O.'s claim and with Judge Hauber's similarly unflattering assessment of the respondent's motion to set aside the 2013 agreed journal entry of judgment. Both pleadings were, in the panel's ultimate estimation, frivolous. Thus their filings supported the panel's conclusions that the respondent violated Supreme Court Rule 3.1 requiring advocacy of only meritorious claims and contentions and Supreme Court Rule 8.4(d) (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 387) prohibiting conduct \"that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   The respondent's exceptions do not take a swing at Paragraph 43, but he states in response to Paragraph 48 that the \"[t]he February 11, 2013[,] motion to [alter] or amend was not a frivolous filing\" because he had a good faith belief that Judge Hauber should have set aside the earlier judgment. Although the use of the phrase \"motion to alter or amend\" is confusing, the respondent's inclusion of the date makes it obvious that he intended to refer to the motion to set aside he filed on July 5, 2016. His support for the motion at the time and through today is Judge Hauber's Division 7 Rule 9, a copy of which the respondent admitted as an exhibit before the hearing panel. The rule reads in pertinent part: \"[A]greed orders ... truly should reflect a signature of all impacted parties to avoid having such orders set aside if a party has not consented.\" Because only counsel for L.O. and not L.O. himself had signed the agreed journal entry in 2013, the respondent argued, the local rule made the agreed journal entry void ab initio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Denial of a party's claim \"does not, in and of itself, indicate the claim was frivolous,\" and the \"party who asserts a pleading has no basis in fact and is not asserted in good faith has the burden of proving that assertion.\"\n   <em>\n    Giblin v. Giblin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1509918\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/253/240/\">\n    253 Kan. 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Syl. \u00b6\u00b6 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1509918\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/253/240/\">\n    854 P.2d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Here, the 2013 agreed journal entry speaks for itself on the signatures it does or does not contain. The Disciplinary Administrator's office has not made any legal argument on why Rule 9 would have been inapplicable to the journal entry. And we do not regard the language of Rule 9 as so crystal clear that it could not be understood in the manner that the respondent argued it should, meaning there is room for good faith rather than bad faith in his filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   This analysis means that we do not see clear and convincing evidence to support the panel's conclusions that the respondent violated Rule 3.1 and Rule 8.4(d) by filing a frivolous motion to set aside. Yet we have no hesitance in ruling that the respondent committed two violations of each rule. The first of the violations of each rule is attributable to his filing of the motion to alter or amend; we detect no infirmity in the panel's conclusions on those issues. The second of the violations of each rule is new and occurred during the proceedings in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   As discussed above, the respondent sought a continuance of oral argument before this court, insisting that he must have additional time to obtain new counsel to assist him. Although his previous multiple pro se filings seemed to indicate otherwise, in an abundance of caution, this court granted the continuance. It is now evident that the respondent never intended to obtain new counsel. At oral argument, on questioning from this court, he admitted he never sought such counsel, giving a new cost-based excuse. Thus we now know the respondent made a frivolous request for a continuance. He took advantage of this court's grace, wasting judicial and Disciplinary Administrator resources, and violated both Rule 3.1 and Rule 8.4(d) a second time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Thus, save our reservations on the material in paragraphs 43 and 48 of the Final Hearing Report explained above, we adopt the panel's findings of fact and conclusions of law. As the panel concluded, the respondent violated Rule 3.1 when he filed his motion to alter or amend; Rule 3.3(a)(1) when he was not candid about why the J.S. email was not produced before the J.S. deposition; Rule 3.4(d) when he failed to respond completely to discovery; Rule 4.4(a) when he attempted to use the unproduced document during cross-examination at the deposition of J.S., when he filed various motions for the purpose of delay and to burden the opposing party, when he called the deposition videographer a Nazi, and when he flipped off the representative of the opposing party; Rule 8.4(c) when he failed to be candid about when he acquired the J.S. email; and Rule 8.4(d) when he filed the motion to alter or amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   We further find that the respondent filed a frivolous request for a continuance of oral argument before us, and we conclude as a matter of law that the filing constituted a second violation of Rule 3.1 and a second violation of Rule 8.4(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   We next consider the appropriate disciplinary sanction. \"This court is not bound by the recommendations of the Disciplinary Administrator or the hearing panel. [Citation omitted.] The court is free to impose a sanction that is either greater or lesser than that which is recommended.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Fickler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415932\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/303/504/#p511\">\n    303 Kan. 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 511,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415932\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/303/504/#p511\">\n    362 P.3d 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) ; see Supreme Court Rule 212(f) (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 261).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The respondent's failure to grasp the seriousness of his misconduct and his repeated dishonesty when that misconduct became the focus of the district court, the hearing panel, and this court persuade us that a severe sanction is necessary to force him to reflect and reform. Simply put, up until now, the respondent does not appear to have learned from his mistakes. He apparently still believes that, as long as he can convince himself he is a well-meaning, zealous advocate for the downtrodden, he can flout the rules of the court and the conventions of basic civility at will. His brief states that a \"punch in the snout\" would have been better medicine than a vulgar gesture for J.W. His oral argument was a textbook illustration for how to show zero understanding of what he did wrong or why he should be punished. He merely continued to urge the members of this court to \"look over there,\" that is, anywhere but at his misconduct, the root of his disciplinary predicament.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Under these circumstances, an indefinite suspension from the practice of law is warranted. In addition, should the respondent seek reinstatement at some point in the future, he must undergo a Rule 219 hearing to demonstrate that he appreciates the wrongfulness and gravity of the misconduct leading to the suspension and intends to avoid a repeat of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   CONCLUSION AND DISCIPLINE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that respondent GREGORY V. BLUME be and he is hereby\n   disciplined by indefinite suspension from the date of filing of this opinion in accordance with Supreme Court Rule 203(a)(2) (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 240). Should the respondent seek reinstatement, he will be subject to a reinstatement hearing under Supreme Court Rule 219.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the respondent comply with Supreme Court Rule 218 (2019 Kan. S. Ct. R. 268).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the costs of these proceedings be assessed to the respondent and that this opinion be published in the official Kansas Reports.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
