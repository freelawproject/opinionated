We conclude the Board's determination was based on an erroneous interpretation and application of the law, and Nielsen has been substantially prejudiced by its error. We therefore set aside the Board's order and instruct it to hold further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 In 2013, Nielsen had accrued 20.65 years of service credit in the URS Plan working with various participating employers. That year, she began working for the University in a position statutorily classified to participate in a non-URS retirement system (Alternate Plan). Because she had service credit in the URS Plan before the date of her University employment, she was entitled to a \"one-time irrevocable election to continue participation\" in the URS Plan.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-13-204\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 49-13-204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(c) (LexisNexis Supp. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Nielsen claims she accepted her position at the University in part because she knew she could continue participating in the URS Plan. Before beginning her new employment, Nielsen claims she telephoned the Utah State Retirement Office (URS) and asked if she needed to take any steps to maintain active participation in the URS Plan. According to Nielsen, a URS representative told her she was \"good to go\" and did not need to take any affirmative steps. Nielsen does not remember the name of the URS representative, and URS has no record of any such conversation. In any event, upon commencing her employment with the University, Nielsen did not affirmatively choose to participate in the Alternate Plan and-perhaps in reliance on her phone call with URS-she did not take any steps to continue participating in the URS Plan. Accordingly, the University enrolled her by default in the Alternate Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Nielsen participated in the Alternate Plan for about two years, but claims not to have noticed she was not enrolled in the URS Plan until January 2015. Because Nielsen would lose a significant amount of retirement benefits by not participating in the URS Plan, she and the University discussed how she might re-enroll. An email dated January 28, 2015, from a University staff member said, \"I have told [Nielsen] that she needs to resign from her position at the [University] then we will re-hire her in the same position after 32 days. At that time, she can enroll in the [URS Plan].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 In February 2015, Nielsen resigned from her University position. Thirty-six days later, the University rehired Nielsen to the same position from which she resigned. When she was rehired, Nielsen \"signed an Irrevocable Retirement Plan Election to request participation [in the URS Plan].\" The University certified to URS that, beginning the day Nielsen was rehired, she was eligible to participate in the URS Plan. About seven months after Nielsen was rehired, URS notified her she was not entitled to participate in the URS Plan. It explained that, because she made an \"irrevocable election ... to participate in [the Alternate Plan]\" in 2013, she was not eligible to participate in the URS Plan while employed at the University.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Nielsen appealed URS's decision to the Board's executive director. The executive director upheld URS's decision, explaining that when Nielsen \"began employment with the\n   University of Utah, ... [she] had a one time opportunity under statute to elect to continue with [the URS Plan] but did not do so.\" His letter to Nielsen added, \"Unfortunately, I do not have the discretion to contradict the statute and allow you another election to rejoin [the URS Plan].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Nielsen filed a \"Request for Board Action,\" and the University was joined as a third-party respondent. Nielsen, the University, and URS each filed a motion for summary judgment. Nielsen and the University argued that, under the plain language of Utah Code section 49-13-204(2)(c), she was entitled to continue participation in the URS Plan. Nielsen presented evidence showing she would \"lose over $ 550,000 in retirement benefits if she [was] not permitted to continue with [the URS Plan].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 After considering the undisputed evidence and the parties' arguments, the Board granted summary judgment in favor of URS. The order began by noting that, under Utah Code section 49-13-204(2)(c), Nielsen \"had a statutory one-time irrevocable election to continue her participation [in the URS Plan] when she began employment with the University in 2013.\" The Board then interpreted the statute and applied it to Nielsen's case. First, it noted that, \"[u]nder the plain language of the statute, the election must be made when beginning employment.\" The Board explained that \" '[i]rrevocable,' on its own, would necessarily require that the election be made only once-once you've made it, it cannot be undone or changed.\" It then interpreted the word \"one-time\" to mean \"there is one limited period, once an employee begins employment, to make the election.\" Based on this statutory interpretation, the Board concluded that, because Nielsen \"failed to exercise her election when she began employment [in 2013], and instead was enrolled in the [Alternate Plan], she was unable to make the election at a later date.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Nielsen and the University seek judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 The issue before this court is whether the Board erred in determining that Nielsen was not entitled to make an election to continue participating in the URS Plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This issue requires us to review the Board's interpretation and application of Utah Code section 49-13-204(2)(c). \"We review the Board's application or interpretation of a statute as a question of law under the correction-of-error standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Whitaker v.

It is undisputed that, at least at some point, Nielsen was entitled to make a one-time irrevocable election to continue in the URS Plan. That is, Nielsen is a regular full-time employee at an institution of higher education who began employment after May 11, 2010, and she had service credit in the URS Plan before the date of her employment. It is also undisputed that Nielsen made her first and only affirmative election to continue participating in the URS Plan in 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 The Board concluded, however, that section 49-13-204(2)(c) required Nielsen to make her election within some \"limited period\" after she first began employment at the University in 2013. As we explain below, the Board's interpretation of section 49-13-204(2)(c) is contrary to the plain meaning of the statute's unambiguous language. Because the statute does not limit the time frame within which employees must make their one-time irrevocable elections, and because Nielsen made her first and only election in 2015, we conclude she is entitled to continue participating in the URS Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 First, the Board erred when it determined that the clause \"who begins employment ... on or after May 11, 2010,\" means \"the election must be made\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   beginning employment.\" (Emphasis added.) The Board now clarifies its interpretation, arguing that \"a regular full-time employee who\n   <em>\n    begins employment\n   </em>\n   \" means \"the election is available only ... for a short period of time following and anchored to the hire date.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 We reject this interpretation because it is contrary to proper grammar and usage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

In section 49-13-204(2)(c), \"who begins employment with an institution of higher education on or before May 11, 2010,\" is a relative clause that modifies the term \"regular full-time employee.\" Thus, not\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   regular full-time employees have the right to a one-time irrevocable election; only such employees who begin employment on or after May 11, 2010, have that right. Contrary to the Board's interpretation, the clause \"who begins employment ... on or after May 11, 2010,\" does not establish a period in which the relevant employees must make their elections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 Second, the Board erred in determining that the term \"one-time irrevocable election\" means \"there is one limited period ... to make the election.\" \"Absent a contrary indication, we assume that the legislature used each term advisedly according to its ordinary and usually accepted meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Muddy Boys, Inc. v.

The word \"one-time\" means \"occurring only once: one shot.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 824.

But defining an election as \"one-time irrevocable\" does not, by itself, establish a restriction on when the election must be made. The Board argues that this interpretation renders meaningless the word \"one-time.\" It asserts that \"[o]nce the irrevocable election is made, there would not be another opportunity to make it by virtue of its irrevocability because it would remain in force, unable to be revoked or altered.\" According to the Board, because \" 'one-time' must add something to the meaning,\" it \"signifies that ... there is one limited period, once an employee begins employment, to make the election.\" We are not convinced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b620 To be sure, this court seeks to interpret statutes \"to give meaning to all parts, and avoid rendering portions of the statute superfluous.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

We therefore set aside the Board's final order and instruct it to hold further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Nielsen remains a member of the URS Plan with vested benefits based on her 20.65 years of service credit.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-13-401\">\n     Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 49-13-401\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1) (LexisNexis Supp. 2018). The issue is whether she may elect to \"continue\" participating while employed at the University-that is, accrue additional service credit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Nielsen's arguments are consistent with the University's position. The University argues that the Board \"erred in its interpretation of [Utah Code section 49-13-204(2)(c) ],\" and requests that we set aside \"the Board's final agency action.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The Board argues that, because \"Nielsen did not make the necessary election to participate in the [URS Plan],\" her default enrollment in the Alternate Plan \"had the effect of irrevocably limiting her retirement participation to the Alternate Plan.\" That is, it asserts Nielsen's failure to take affirmative action regarding her participation in a particular retirement plan \"result[ed] in irrevocable application of [a] default election.\" We reject this argument because it is contrary to the statute's plain language. The right to an \"election\" includes the right to make an affirmative choice.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 400 (9th ed. 1986) (defining \"election\" as \"the right, power, or privilege of making a choice\"). In proceedings before the Board, the parties stipulated that Nielsen \"did not make an election to continue her retirement participation with URS upon beginning employment with the University in February 2013.\" And we are not convinced that a \"non-election\" (the default enrollment), without some affirmative choice of the employee, can qualify as an \"election\" as the term is used in Utah Code section 49-13-204(2)(c).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Many of the Board's arguments rely on \"federal law and guidance.\" That is, the Board argues that its interpretation of Utah Code section 49-13-204(2)(c) \"keeps URS and its employers and members within the established bounds to maintain its tax qualified status\" under federal law. We acknowledge that the Board has a duty to \"ensure that the [retirement] systems, plans, programs, and funds are administered according to law\" and \"on an actuarially sound basis,\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-11-203\">\n     Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 49-11-203\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1)(c), (g) (LexisNexis 2015), and that the Board \"may take actions necessary to protect the tax-qualified status of the systems, plans, and programs under its control,\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-11-203\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 49-11-801(5). But this statutory authority does not permit the Board to ignore a statute's plain language.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Allred v. Utah State Ret. Board\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10342995\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/914/1172/#p1175\">\n     914 P.2d 1172\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1175 (Utah Ct. App. 1996) (\"If the Board believes that the current language of the Act produces an actuarially unsound retirement system, the Board should seek relief from the Legislature through an amendment to the Act.\"). Further, the \"federal law and guidance\" cited by the Board does not support the Board's claim that the legislature used the term \"one-time irrevocable election\" as \"a defined term of art with respect to retirement plan participation elections.\" We tend to agree with Nielsen that the phrase is not well-defined, and we are not convinced that it has \"a settled meaning in the law.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Truck Ins.
