After dealing with a noisy neighbor and other problems with the premises, Tenant moved out before the expiration of the parties' lease agreement (the Lease). Landlord sued Tenant, claiming that Tenant breached the Lease when it vacated the premises early. Tenant denied liability for breach, asserting that Landlord first breached the Lease by constructively evicting it from the premises when Landlord breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Tenant also asserted that before it vacated the premises, Landlord breached the warranty of suitability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 After the district court granted partial summary judgment to Landlord regarding four of Tenant's complaints about the premises, the case proceeded to trial. The jury found in favor of Landlord, concluding that Landlord did not breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment or the warranty of suitability and that Tenant breached the Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Tenant now appeals the district court's judgment in favor of Landlord, raising three main issues for our consideration. First, Tenant contends that the district court erred in granting partial summary judgment on four of its complaints about the premises. Second, Tenant contends that the court abused its discretion in excluding evidence at trial that Landlord allegedly promised to address those four complaints. Third, Tenant contends that the court erred in awarding attorney fees to Landlord. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 In September 2011, Tenant leased a commercial property from Landlord for a term of five years and eight months. Soon after moving in, Tenant discovered that the abutting neighbor was a dance studio and that loud music from the studio interfered with its business. Tenant complained to Landlord about the loud music, and it also\n   complained to Landlord about other perceived problems with the premises. When the noise and other issues continued, Tenant vacated the premises in April 2013 even though more than four years remained on the Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Landlord sued Tenant, claiming that Tenant breached the Lease when it left the premises early. In response to the complaint, Tenant asserted that Landlord had constructively evicted Tenant by failing to address a number of Tenant's complaints about the premises: (1) heating and cooling problems with the HVAC system in Tenant's unit; (2) the front door of Tenant's unit would swing open from wind; (3) the below-standard height of the loading dock; (4) inadequate parking for Tenant and its customers; (5) pervasive insect problems; (6) unmaintained parking and common areas; and (7) noise emanating from the dance studio.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Landlord moved for partial summary judgment on Tenant's counterclaims to the extent they were based on the first four of these complaints: the HVAC, the front door, the loading dock, and the inadequate parking (collectively, the Four Alleged Defects). According to Landlord, it had no obligation under the Lease to remedy those specific complaints. The district court agreed and granted partial summary judgment in favor of Landlord. It ruled that Tenant's \"counterclaims for quiet enjoyment and warranty of suitability, to the extent they concern [the Four Alleged Defects were] dismissed with prejudice and on the merits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Before trial, and in light of the district court's ruling that Landlord had no obligation to fix the Four Alleged Defects, Landlord moved to exclude from trial emails with unredacted references to the Four Alleged Defects. Landlord asserted that, under rule 403 of the Utah Rules of Evidence, that evidence would unfairly prejudice Landlord by exposing the jury to \"what appear[ed] to be facts of [Landlord] not doing something that, in fact, it didn't have to do under the [Lease].\" Tenant opposed the motion, asserting that its evidence regarding the Four Alleged Defects-including emails in which Landlord allegedly told Tenant that it would fix those problems, as well as Landlord's internal emails wherein Landlord mentioned its efforts to address Tenant's complaints-was relevant to its theory of constructive eviction because it showed Landlord's pattern of stalling, which allegedly induced Tenant to stay longer in the premises than it otherwise would have. The court granted Landlord's motion, stating that it would not admit evidence regarding the Four Alleged Defects \"when it's contrary to the summary judgment ruling.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 The case proceeded to a five-day jury trial. Landlord sought approximately $ 40,000 from Tenant for unpaid rent; Tenant sought $ 300,000 from Landlord for alleged lost profits and other losses arising from Landlord's alleged breaches of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and the warranty of suitability. As a result of the court's partial summary judgment ruling and evidentiary decision, Tenant's constructive eviction theory at trial was based only on Landlord's alleged failures to fix the insect and noise problems and to maintain the parking and common areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 The jury returned a verdict in favor of Landlord. On the special verdict form, the jury indicated it found that Landlord did not breach the covenant of quiet enjoyment by constructively evicting Tenant and that Landlord did not breach the warranty of suitability. Rather, the jury found that Tenant breached the Lease by vacating the premises early and awarded $ 14,452.14 in damages to Landlord.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Landlord moved for an award of attorney fees on the ground that it was entitled to fees under the terms of the Lease. The district court granted Landlord's motion, concluding that Landlord was the prevailing party and that its incurred fees, with a few exceptions, were reasonable. Accordingly, the district court awarded attorney fees and costs to Landlord in the amount of $ 124,429.97, and it entered a judgment against Tenant in the total amount of $ 138,882.11. Tenant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Tenant advances three main challenges on appeal. First, Tenant contends that the district court erred in granting partial summary judgment on its claims as they related to the Four Alleged Defects. A motion for summary judgment shall be granted \"if the moving party shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Utah R. Civ. P. 56(a). \"In reviewing a trial court's grant of summary judgment, we consider only whether it correctly applied the law and correctly concluded that no disputed issues of material fact existed.\"\n   <em>\n    Pigs Gun Club, Inc. v.

When reviewing a district court's exclusion of evidence, we grant the court \"broad discretion to admit or exclude evidence and will disturb its ruling only for abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Daines v.

The Partial Summary Judgment Ruling\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 Tenant first challenges the district court's grant of partial summary judgment to Landlord on Tenant's claims for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and breach of the warranty of suitability. Tenant asserts that the premises had the Four Alleged Defects, which it believes Landlord was obliged to remedy. In Tenant's view, Landlord was obligated to make the repairs pursuant to the Lease and, at a minimum, the jury should have been allowed to decide whether Landlord was required to fix any of the Four Alleged Defects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 Landlord responds that because it \"had no obligation to address the Four Alleged Defects,\" it was not in breach and the district court correctly granted summary judgment. According to Landlord, \"the Four Alleged Defects do not fall within the plain language of [the] limited repair obligation\" contained in the Lease, and therefore it \"could not be held liable for failure to address\" them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 Before reaching the specific arguments of the parties, we note that in challenging the district court's grant of partial summary judgment, Tenant does not engage with the nature of, or the particular protections afforded by, its affirmative claims for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and breach of the warranty of suitability. But because Tenant's arguments focus on whether the Lease, or modifications of the Lease, expressly required Landlord to repair the Four Alleged Defects,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   we likewise focus on the Lease to resolve its challenge to the district court's summary judgment decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 In turning our attention to the terms of the Lease, we employ the rules for contract interpretation.

Paragraph 6 states that \"Tenant accepts the Premises in the condition they are in at the inception of this Lease.\" Paragraph 8 states that Tenant agrees \"to pay for all labor, materials and other repairs to the ... heating and air conditioning systems in or serving the Premises.\" And Paragraph 9 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Landlord agrees for the term of this Lease, to maintain in good condition and repair any latent defects in the exterior walls, floor joists, and foundations of the building in which the Premises is located, and to repair any defects in the plumbing and electrical lines, facilities and equipment in the common areas, (subject to the provisions of paragraph 3(b)), for one year after date of occupancy, as well as any damage that might result from acts of Landlord or Landlord's representatives. Landlord shall not, however, be obligated to repair any such damage until written notice of the need of repair shall have been given to Landlord by Tenant and, after such notice is so given, Landlord shall have a reasonable time in which to make such repairs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 We begin by addressing Tenant's argument that the district court should have allowed the jury to decide the meaning of the Lease's terms. We then address each of the Four Alleged Defects. Finally, we address Tenant's arguments regarding the doctrines of waiver, estoppel, and unclean hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A. Whether the Jury Should Have Decided the Meaning of the Lease\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620 Tenant argues that Landlord \"was obligated to make the subject repairs\" pursuant to the Lease. Invoking Paragraph 9 of the Lease, Tenant argues that the issues it complained of \"were latent defects (either because the defect existed prior to the Lease or the defect was caused by 'acts of Landlord or Landlord's representatives'), or [Landlord] otherwise promised to remediate the issue.\" According to Tenant, whether any of the Four Alleged Defects \"was 'latent' or a 'defect' should have been left to the jury.\" It claims that \"[t]he parties understood 'latent defect' to include issues that arose within the first year of the Lease.\" Further, \"[Landlord's] [various] representations that it was addressing the [Four Alleged Defects] is evidence proving the defects fall under Paragraph 9 of the Lease, meaning the jury should have resolved that factual dispute-not the trial court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b621 We conclude that Tenant has not shown that there was a factual question for the jury. It is well established that when contractual terms are unambiguous, the court determines the parties' intentions \"from the plain meaning of the contractual\n   language, and the contract may be interpreted as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Skolnick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%20209\">\n    2018 UT App 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12574764\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/437/584/\">\n    437 P.3d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up). Tenant makes no effort on appeal, nor did it before the district court, to show that the Lease's terms are ambiguous-that is, \"capable of more than one reasonable interpretation because of uncertain meanings of terms, missing terms, or other facial deficiencies.\"\n   <em>\n    Daines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8177934\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/190/1269/\">\n    2008 UT 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8177934\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/190/1269/\">\n    190 P.3d 1269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).

Natixis Real Estate Capital, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6971725\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/311/1042/\">\n    2013 UT App 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6971725\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/311/1042/\">\n    311 P.3d 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But because Tenant has not established any ambiguity in the Lease's terms, it also has not shown that the district court erred in interpreting the Lease as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   B. The Four Alleged Defects\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   1. The HVAC System\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b622 Tenant argues that the district court erred in dismissing the portion of its claims based on its contention that Landlord failed to fix heating and cooling problems in the HVAC system, maintaining its position that the HVAC was part of Landlord's repair obligations under Paragraph 9 of the Lease. Tenant also suggests that \"material facts were in dispute\" including \"whether the HVAC issues were caused by [Landlord] and/or [Tenant], and whether based on the course and scope of [Landlord's] dealings it was obligated to repair the HVAC.\" In other words, Tenant suggests that the HVAC problems might have qualified as \"damage ... result[ing] from acts of Landlord\" that Landlord had an obligation to repair under Paragraph 9 or that Landlord modified the Lease by assuming the obligation to repair the HVAC. In granting summary judgment on this claim, the district court adopted Landlord's reasoning, namely, that Tenant's claim failed as a matter of law because the Lease obligated Tenant, not Landlord, to make the HVAC repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b623 Tenant has not shown error in the district court's decision. Paragraph 8 states that\n   <em>\n    Tenant\n   </em>\n   agrees \"to pay for all labor, materials and other\n   <em>\n    repairs to the ... heating and air conditioning systems\n   </em>\n   in or serving the Premises.\" (Emphasis added.) Under Paragraph 8's unambiguous language, the obligation to pay for repairs to the HVAC system fell on Tenant, not Landlord. Yet Tenant ignores this language and argues that Paragraph 9 covers the HVAC system in Tenant's unit. It does not. The plain language of Paragraph 9 limited Landlord's repair obligations to latent defects in \"the exterior walls, floor joists,\" and building foundations; and to \"defects in the plumbing and electrical lines, facilities and equipment in the common areas.\" The HVAC system in Tenant's unit is not one of the items identified in Paragraph 9. Because Tenant had the obligation to repair the HVAC in accordance with Paragraph 8, the district court correctly ruled that Tenant could not maintain a claim related to the HVAC against Landlord.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b624 As for Tenant's argument that disputed material facts exist with regard to whether Landlord caused the HVAC problems, the issue is not preserved for appeal. \"When a party fails to raise and argue an issue in the trial court, it has failed to preserve the issue, and an appellate court will not typically reach that issue absent a valid exception to preservation.\"\n   <em>\n    Warrick v. Property Reserve Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%20197\">\n    2018 UT App 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12574745\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/437/439/\">\n    437 P.3d 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up). \"An issue is preserved for appeal when it has been presented to the district court in such a way that the court has an opportunity to rule on it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12574745\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/437/439/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (cleaned up). In opposing Landlord's motion for summary judgment on the HVAC problems, Tenant never asserted that Landlord was liable under Paragraph 9 because Landlord damaged the HVAC. As a result, Tenant did not give the district court an opportunity to rule on the issue and did not preserve it for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b625 Tenant also suggests that disputed facts exist about whether, \"based on the course and scope of [Landlord's dealings],\" Landlord assumed an obligation to repair the HVAC. The Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure require an appellant's brief to \"explain, with reasoned analysis supported by citations to legal authority and the record, why the party should prevail on appeal.\" Utah R.

The Front Door\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b626 Tenant contends that the district court erred in dismissing the portion of its claims relating to the broken front door. Tenant argues that Landlord was obligated to make the repair because Landlord allegedly promised to fix the front door and because Landlord attempted to repair it and \"made the problem worse (thereby owning the problem).\" In granting summary judgment regarding the front door, the district court accepted Landlord's reasoning that, per the Lease, Landlord was not required to repair and maintain the front door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b627 Instead of attacking the district court's interpretation of the Lease, Tenant asserts-without citing authority-that \"it is axiomatic that [Landlord] became responsible for repairing the door once it undertook efforts to do so, continued to promise to do so, and never represented to [Tenant] that it\n   <em>\n    was not\n   </em>\n   obligated to repair the door.\" Because Tenant has not provided legal authority and reasoned analysis based on that authority in support of this argument, Tenant has not devoted adequate attention to the issue and thus has not met its burden of persuasion on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339702\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/196/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And Tenant's unsupported position on appeal that Landlord \"made the problem worse\" is belied by its position at the summary judgment hearing when Tenant's counsel stated, \"They've sent a maintenance guy in there to fix a door. ...\n   <em>\n    [W]e don't know whether he made it worse\n   </em>\n   . It didn't work from that night out. They've now taken on that obligation to fix that.\" (Emphasis added.)

The Loading Dock\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b628 Tenant contends that the district court erred in dismissing its claim that Landlord failed to fix the shorter-than-standard loading dock. The district court granted summary judgment on the loading-dock claim because Landlord had \"no Lease-related obligation respecting the warehouse dock\" and because Tenant had agreed to accept the premises, including the height of the loading dock, in the condition they were in at the inception of the Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b629 Tenant contends that the loading dock height falls within the definition of a latent defect in the exterior walls or the foundations of the building, or even a defect in part of the \"common areas\" of the building, obligating Landlord to fix the dock pursuant to Paragraph 9 of the Lease. But Tenant does not undertake a meaningful analysis to show why it should prevail in this regard. Tenant does not engage with the language of Paragraph 9 and explain why the district court erred in concluding that the loading dock was not a \"defect\" within the meaning of the Lease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adamson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339702\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/196/\">\n    2017 UT 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339702\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/196/\">\n    391 P.3d 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that an \"appellant that fails to devote adequate attention to an issue is almost certainly going to fail to meet its burden of persuasion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b630 And, to the extent Tenant contends that the \"irregular dock height defect could possibly fall within the Lease's catch-all\" of any damage that might result from acts of Landlord, Tenant has not rebutted Landlord's\n   argument that because Landlord \"did not modify or otherwise act respecting the warehouse dock\" while Tenant occupied the premises, the warehouse dock height could not constitute \"damage that ... result[ed] from acts of Landlord.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b631 Further, and perhaps most importantly, the Lease provides, \"Tenant accepts the Premises in the condition they are in at the inception of this Lease.\" Tenant asserts that this provision does not bar its loading-dock claim against Landlord for three reasons: (1) Landlord and its property manager \"were better situated and had expertise that [Tenant] lacked\" and therefore Tenant \"cannot be expected to uncover each and every latent defect\"; (2) \"whether [Tenant] should have been able to uncover [the irregular loading dock height] is a question of fact precluding summary judgment\"; and (3) \"[Landlord] failed to explain why it was unreasonable for [Tenant] to assume that [the] loading dock was built to industry standard loading dock heights.\" But because Tenant did not raise any of these three arguments in opposing Landlord's summary judgment motion, Tenant did not give the district court an opportunity to rule on them and therefore did not preserve them for appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Warrick v.

As a result, Tenant has not shown that the district court improperly limited the scope of its claims for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and breach of the warranty of suitability to Landlord's alleged failures to remedy the noise problem, the insect problem, and the maintenance of the common areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   II. The Evidence Excluded at Trial\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b640 Tenant next contends that the district court abused its discretion in excluding at trial evidence that Landlord promised to remedy the Four Alleged Defects. Even if Landlord was not obligated to redress the Four Alleged Defects under the terms of the Lease, Tenant asserts that the jury nevertheless should have been allowed to consider evidence that Landlord assured Tenant that Landlord would take care of the problems\n   surrounding the Four Alleged Defects. As Tenant explains, \"[Landlord's] promises concerning those issues [with the premises] explained why [Tenant] waited as long as it did to vacate,\" and the jury was precluded from considering whether \"it was reasonable for [Tenant] to rely on [Landlord's] assurances.\" Tenant thus argues that the excluded evidence had bearing on its assertion that Landlord constructively evicted it from the premises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b641 \"An appellant challenging the exclusion of evidence bears the burden of showing the harmfulness of the error.\"\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. v.

To begin with, Tenant represents generally that Landlord promised to resolve the Four Alleged Defects, but Tenant has not sufficiently identified the particular evidence that was excluded from trial. After the district court ruled and decided not to admit evidence regarding the Four Alleged Defects \"when it's contrary to the summary judgment ruling,\" Tenant redacted content from some of the emails that it introduced at trial to remove references to the Four Alleged Defects. We can discern from viewing the redacted exhibits that in some instances single words were redacted, while in other cases entire sentences appear to have been removed, but Tenant does not direct us to where in the record we can review the evidence that was excluded. Apart from Tenant's general representations that Landlord promised to address the Four Alleged Defects, Tenant's argument similarly does not identify or discuss the excluded evidence in enough detail to allow us to assess the potential harm from its exclusion. As a result, we are left with many unanswered questions about exactly what evidence was excluded and whether it was significant enough in context to change the result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b643 Further, though \"we are under no obligation\" \"to scour the record to save an appeal by remedying the deficiencies of an appellant's brief,\"\n   <em>\n    Wohnoutka v.

For example, one email from Landlord's manager to Tenant stated, with the emphasized language excluded at trial, \"I will continue to monitor\n   <em>\n    the parking\n   </em>\n   and noise levels and see if we can't get this resolved.\" This evidence shows that Landlord was engaging with Tenant on the subject of parking, and Tenant contends it supports its position that Landlord's assurances delayed it from vacating sooner. Yet because the admitted portion of this email shows Landlord made assurances, it is not evident that had the words \"the parking\" been retained the evidentiary balance would have tipped in Tenant's favor on the reasonableness of the timing of its abandonment of the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b644 Importantly, our consideration of harmfulness in this case is also hindered by the fact that Tenant has not furnished an adequate trial record. In particular, Tenant\n   has provided the transcripts of only two days of the five-day trial. The transcripts include the testimony of two witnesses, but the testimony of eight other witnesses is not available. And although the parties' opening statements are included in the record, their closing arguments are not. These omissions are particularly significant in this case because the evidentiary ruling did not exclude all evidence of Landlord's assurances to Tenant. But without knowing the full extent of what the jury heard and what specifically was excluded, we are unable to gauge how the excluded evidence altered the evidentiary picture of the relevant issues without engaging in pure speculation. Given this lack of an adequate record on appeal, we are thus prevented from \"undertaking a meaningful harmless error analysis,\" and we cannot grant Tenant appellate relief on this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Black v.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b649 As our supreme court observed in\n   <em>\n    R.T.

Among the factors relevant to the determination are: (1) the language of the attorney fee provision, (2) the number of claims brought by the parties, (3) the importance of each claim relative to the others and their significance considering the lawsuit as a whole, and (4) the amounts awarded on the various claims.\n   <em>\n    Utah Transit Auth. v.

As the district court correctly noted, this is not a case where both parties \"achiev[ed] some level of success.\" Rather, Landlord brought and prevailed upon its single claim against Tenant while it also defeated both of Tenant's counterclaims, for which Tenant sought damages in excess of $ 300,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b651 Despite being completely shut out on the verdict, Tenant argues that the district court should have concluded that neither party prevailed. Specifically, Tenant reasons that the litigation was not \"a successful endeavor\" for Landlord because it recovered only about one-third of the damages it sought at trial. Although the comparison of Landlord's award to its claim is a relevant factor\n   under the prevailing party analysis,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856743\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/355/947/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , the factor cannot be weighed in isolation. Landlord may have recovered only one-third of its $ 40,000 damage claim for breach of contract, but it successfully defended against counterclaims worth $ 300,000. Under these circumstances, we would be hard-pressed to say that the district court abused its discretion in identifying Landlord as the prevailing party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856743\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/355/947/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[W]e employ an abuse of discretion standard when reviewing a district court's prevailing party determination.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   2. Reasonableness\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b652 Next, Tenant contends that the amount of Landlord's attorney fees was unreasonable because of Landlord's \"universal failure to allocate\" and to \"deduct any fees expended on issues to which it clearly did not prevail at trial.\" For instance, Tenant asserts that Landlord cannot recover fees incurred pursuing unsuccessful motions. Tenant also contends that Landlord impermissibly \"block billed\" by lumping multiple tasks under the same time entry and thereby prevented an accurate determination of the reasonableness of its fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b653 The district court's determination of the reasonableness of fees may be based on a variety of factors, including\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   the difficulty of the litigation, the efficiency of the attorneys in presenting the case, the reasonableness of the number of hours spent on the case, the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar services, the amount involved in the case and the result attained, and the expertise and experience of the attorneys involved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Dixie State Bank v.

Here, the district court identified these and other factors and ultimately awarded Landlord $ 124,429.97 in attorney fees, after it reduced the award by $ 7,658.23 for fees related to some pre-litigation expenses, postage expenses, and expenses related to an interlocutory appeal. The court found that the case \"involved complex, somewhat novel areas of law, requiring extensive research and argument,\" and that most of Landlord's claimed attorney fees were \"reasonable given the facts and circumstances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b654 With regard to Tenant's complaint that Landlord did not adequately allocate its fees, the district court found that \"claim allocation is inapplicable\" because \"all of [Landlord's] claims were successful and carried with them an entitlement to attorney fees.\" \"[A]n attorney fee application must reasonably allocate time incurred between compensable and non-compensable claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Here, the district court essentially determined that all of Landlord's claims were compensable because they were all based on the Lease and all \"properly categorized as 'successful claims for which there may be an entitlement to attorney fees.' \" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    Foote v.

We agree with the district court. The governing attorney fees provision broadly permits an award of reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in \"any legal proceeding brought by either party against the other under the Lease.\" Tenant summarily claims that there were \"issues to which [Landlord] clearly did not prevail at trial,\" but it does not identify a single claim (or even issue) that was not covered by the specific terms of the Lease. Thus, given that Landlord had no non-compensable claims under the Lease's attorney fees provision, the district court did not err in determining that there was no need to allocate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b655 Tenant also complains that the district court erred in awarding fees to Landlord for\n   its time spent on unsuccessful pre-trial motions. With one exception, the court rejected Tenant's challenge to Landlord's fees on this basis because it found that those motions \"led to [Landlord's] ultimate success.\" In so doing, the court relied on\n   <em>\n    Dejavue, Inc. v.

As a result, Tenant has not carried its burden of persuasion on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R. App. P. 24(a)(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b656 Similarly, Tenant has not demonstrated that the district court erred in not rejecting certain of Landlord's time entries as unreasonable solely on the basis that they were block billed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court concluded that \"block billing does not prevent a prevailing party from recovering attorney fees under Utah law,\" citing two Utah cases where fees were allowed despite the use of block billing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shurtleff v.

Tenant does not address those cases but instead relies on an unpublished case from the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in which the court identified some difficulties associated with block billing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BP Pipelines (N.

Because an entry is not per se unreasonable simply because it was block billed, Tenant has failed to show that the district court exceeded its discretion in determining the reasonableness of Landlord's attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   B. Landlord's Request for Attorney Fees on Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b658 Finally, Landlord requests an award of the attorney fees it incurred in defending this appeal. \"When a party is entitled to attorney fees below and prevails on appeal, that party is also entitled to fees reasonably incurred on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Dillon v.

Because Landlord was awarded attorney fees in the district court and has prevailed on appeal, we grant Landlord's request for an award of reasonable attorney fees on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b659 We conclude that Tenant has not established error in the district court's grant of partial summary judgment to Landlord on Tenant's claims as they related to the Four Alleged Defects. Tenant also has not shown reversible error in the district court's exclusion of evidence that Landlord allegedly promised to address the Four Alleged Defects. We also conclude that Tenant failed to show that the district court exceeded its discretion in awarding attorney fees to Landlord. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's decisions, and we remand for the limited purpose of calculating Landlord's reasonable attorney fees incurred on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Tenant made these assertions in support of its counterclaims, styled as breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment and breach of the warranty of suitability, and in defense to Landlord's claim for breach of contract.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    This focus may be because the Lease itself includes a \"Quiet Enjoyment\" provision, which states that \"Tenant shall quietly enjoy the Premises,\n    <em>\n     subject, however, to the terms of this Lease\n    </em>\n    .\" (Emphasis added.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    \"If a contract contains no ambiguity, the court will not consider extrinsic evidence and will enforce the contract according to its terms.\"\n    <em>\n     Brodkin v.

But \"if a party contends that an apparently unambiguous contract contains a latent ambiguity,\" as opposed to a facial ambiguity, \"the court will consider extrinsic evidence to determine whether the contract contains a latent ambiguity.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 20. Tenant has not contended that a latent ambiguity exists in the Lease.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Tenant also contends that Landlord was obligated to repair the HVAC because Landlord replaced the HVAC in a neighboring unit that involved a comparable lease. But we agree with Landlord that even if Landlord fixed another tenant's HVAC, that fact alone does not establish the rights and obligations as between Landlord and Tenant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Tenant does not expressly identify the claims or defenses it contends this evidence is relevant to, but argues generally that it is relevant to the issue of constructive eviction and particularly whether its delay in vacating was reasonable. The jury was instructed that the issue of constructive eviction was relevant to Landlord's claim for breach of the Lease and Tenant's claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Based on those instructions, we understand Tenant to be arguing that the excluded evidence was relevant to Landlord's breach of contract claim and Tenant's breach of quiet enjoyment claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Tenant argues that its $ 300,000 counterclaims should not factor into the prevailing party equation because those claims were based on the same arguments supporting the theory of constructive eviction Tenant advanced in defense of Landlord's breach of contract claim. We are not persuaded. Tenant's claims put Landlord at risk of a $ 300,000 judgment. The fact that Landlord may have defeated Tenant's counterclaims for the same reasons it succeeded on its breach of contract claim does not make it any less successful. Similarly, we reject Tenant's arguments that Landlord was not a prevailing party because it declined pre-litigation settlement offers in excess of its recovery and because the amount of Landlord's fees exceeded the amount of its award. Once again, in making these arguments, Tenant fails to account for Landlord's defeat of Tenant's $ 300,000 counterclaims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Block billing involves recording only an overall time-total for a set of tasks performed rather than separately recording time spent on each task.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Brown v.
