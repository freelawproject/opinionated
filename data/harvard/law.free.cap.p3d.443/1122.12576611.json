Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County; Ronald J. Israel, Judge.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-10\">\n     This court's review of this appeal reveals a jurisdictional defect. Specifically, no decision had been made on the petition when appellant filed his appeal on June 10, 2019. Rather, the district court set a status check for 90 days. Thus, the notice of appeal is premature.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     NRS 177.015(3). Accordingly, this court\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-11\">\n     ORDERS this appeal DISMISSED.\n    </p>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
