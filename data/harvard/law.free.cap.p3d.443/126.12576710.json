In looking at Haw. Rev. Stat.

Second, where the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning.

HRS \u00a7 634J-1 provides \" 'Litigation' means any civil action or proceeding, commenced, maintained, or pending in any state or federal court of record.\" It is undisputed that Au filed his counterclaims as well as numerous motions, and that several of these filings prolonged the proceedings after the granting of summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Au further appears to argue that, because some of his counterclaims were compulsory, the Circuit Court could not consider the Motion for Reconsideration to constitute a basis for deeming him a vexatious litigant. Au cites no authority supporting this argument. In- any event, the issue is not whether the counterclaims were compulsory, but whether a counterclaimant meets the definition of plaintiff for the purposes of a vexatious litigant provided by HRS \u00a7 634J-1 as determined by his conduct of litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Therefore, Au's first argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   2, 3, and 4.

In his September 25, 2013 motion for reconsideration, Au argued that the Circuit Court should have considered matters that were on file at the time of KS's motion for summary judgment on their claims. As this court held in\n   <em>\n    Au I\n   </em>\n   , Au's April 22, 2015 HRCP Rule 60(b) motion presented an argument based on information-the county's property tax refund--that Au knew or should have known about at the time of the summary judgment motions (the Overcharge Argument).\n   <em>\n    Au I\n   </em>\n   , at *3. In his May 21, 2015 motion for reconsideration, Au again asserted the Overcharge Argument, that there was a \"gross error\" in the computation of the summary judgment's damage award. The May 29, 2015 motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment granted on his counterclaim again makes the Overcharge Argument and adds Au's claim that KS unilaterally imposed financial qualifications on his assignee and repeats arguments in opposition to the summary judgment. In his June 29, 2015 motion to vacate the June 12, 2015 Judgment, he argues the judgment was premature because a motion to reconsider had not been decided but also makes the Overcharge Argument. Au's August 25, 2015 HRCP Rule 60(b) motion alleged that the June 12, 2015 Judgment was not in fact the final judgment and was a mistake, depriving him of his right to appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, more than six months after the June 12, 2015 Final Judgment was entered, Au filed a motion to stay enforcement of the same, and again making the Overcharge Argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thus, Au meets the HRS \u00a7 634J-1(2) definition of a vexatious litigant because he continued to relitigate or attempt to relitigate issues of law or fact finally determined against him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

Therefore, the Circuit Court could infer bad faith from Au's insistence on refiling the same issues in differently titled motions absent a specific finding of bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because there is a sufficient basis in the record to find Au a vexatious litigant under HRS \u00a7 634J-1(2), we need not address Au's specific argument with regard to HRS \u00a7 634J-1(3) that there was no finding the motions were \"unmeritorious, frivolous, or solely intended to cause delay\". Thus, Au's claim is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In point of error (3), Au argues the Circuit Court abused its discretion by concluding Au's April 22, 2015 HRCP Rule 60(b) motion constituted an impermissible second motion for reconsideration. We note that Au spends the entirety of the body of this point of error relitigating the merits of the Overcharge Argument, which this court recently found without merit.\n   <em>\n    Au I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206614566\">\n    2017 WL 6614566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. However, taking what we can of the argument from the point of error itself, it appears Au is arguing the designation of the April 22, 2015 motion as a Rule 60(b) was somehow taken into account in the determination that Au is a vexatious litigant. This argument does not comport with the facts. The Circuit Court's order specifies, \"\n   <em>\n    [n]otwithstanding the different titles of these motions\n   </em>\n   , the motions in essence ask the Court to reconsider, to correct, to modify, or to adjust the Summary Judgment Order and to in essence relitigate the merits of the issues that the Court already disposed of by granting the Summary Judgment Motion\" (emphasis added). Here, irrespective of the depiction of the nature of the motion by the court, the court made the finding Au was a vexatious litigant based on the content of the motions. We agree with the Circuit Court's depiction of these motions. Thus, Au's argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In point of error (4), Au argues the Circuit Court erred by not specifying all seven motions in its Order, thereby forcing Au and this court to speculate as to the basis for concluding Au is a vexatious litigant. Moreover, Au argues that, because these motions were on appeal in CAAP-15-0000466, our determination of whether those motions were meritorious or justified was relevant to the Circuit Court's vexatious litigant determination. While the Circuit Court did not specify the seven motions in its Order, the record is clear what the basis of its Order was because the hearing transcript and KS's motion makes clear which seven motions the court relied on in deeming Au a vexatious litigant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Au also argues the court placed an undue burden on him on appeal by failing to detail where in Au's motions the court found attempts to relitigate matters already decided. In our review of the motions identified in the transcript of the hearing, we find an adequate basis in the record to support the court's determination Au is a vexatious litigant for his repeated assertion of the Overcharge Argument. Therefore, Au's argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Au also appears to argue that we must determine the merits of the motions underlying the Circuit Court's ruling to determine whether it was correct in concluding that Au was a vexatious litigant, or that the Circuit Court could not deem Au a vexatious litigant on the basis of motions that had been appealed.

The court was therefore entitled to rely on its prior rulings. Thus, Au's argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   5. Au contends the Circuit Court was required by HRCP Rule 52(a) to make FOFs and COLs to support the Order. To make this argument, Au draws a parallel between HRS ch. 634J penalties and HRS \u00a7 607-14.5 (2016), a fee and cost shifting provision. This reliance is inapposite because HRS \u00a7 607-14.5(b) requires \"the court\n   <em>\n    must find in writing\n   </em>\n   that all or a portion of the claims or defenses made by the party are frivolous and are not reasonably supported by the facts and the law in the civil action.\" (emphasis added). HRS Chapter 634J has no such parallel requirement. HRCP Rule 52(a) provides, in pertinent part, \"[f]indings of fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary on decisions of motions under Rules 12 or 56 or any other motion\" except those concerning amendment of a judgment or judgment on partial findings. HRCP Rule 52 does not apply, and therefore, it was unnecessary for the court to make findings or conclusions of law. Therefore, Au's claim is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the February 29, 2016 \"Order Granting Plaintiffs/Counterclaim Defendants' Motion to Declare Ronald G.S.
