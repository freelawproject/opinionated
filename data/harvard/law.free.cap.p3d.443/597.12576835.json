In this post-conviction proceeding, petitioner, a juvenile offender, contends that the 800-month sentence he is serving for a single homicide is the functional equivalent of life without parole and was imposed without a hearing that satisfied the procedural and substantive requirements of the Eighth Amendment. For the reasons that follow, we hold that petitioner is not procedurally barred from seeking post-conviction relief and that his sentence is subject to\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     's protections. Because this record does not convince us that the sentencing court determined that petitioner's crime reflects irreparable corruption, we reverse the decisions of the Court of Appeals and the post-conviction court and remand to the post-conviction court for further proceedings.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-12\">\n     We begin our discussion with the fact that\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     was decided almost 20 years after petitioner and his twin brother, Laycelle, both then 15 years old, murdered an elderly couple.

Each of those escape clauses permit a petitioner to bring a claim that would be procedurally barred if the \"grounds\" on which the petitioner relies were not asserted\n     and could not reasonably have been either asserted or raised in certain described circumstances.\n     Petitioner argues that because\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     had not yet been decided when he filed his direct appeal and his earlier post-conviction claims, he did not assert and reasonably could not have asserted or raised the \"grounds\" on which he now relies in those earlier proceedings. The superintendent counters that the term \"grounds\" refers not to a particular legal argument, but to a general type of claim-here, a claim that a sentence imposes cruel and unusual punishment-and that petitioner asserted that type of claim on direct appeal and in his earlier post-conviction proceeding. Alternatively, the superintendent contends that, even if the term \"grounds\" contemplates more specificity, petitioner previously asserted a claim that was \"close\" to a\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     claim or reasonably could have asserted such a claim, and, therefore, his present claim is procedurally barred. As we will explain, two of our recent cases demonstrate that petitioner has the better argument.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-14\">\n     In the first case-\n     <em>\n      Verduzco v.

And, we, like the court in\n     <em>\n      Chavez\n     </em>\n     , are not persuaded that petitioner reasonably could have raised a\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     claim within two years of his conviction or his later post-conviction proceedings.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-21\">\n     To explain why we reach that conclusion, it is necessary to briefly describe the state of the law before\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     was decided in 2012.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Chavez\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12575003\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/438/381/\">\n      364 Or. at 659-61\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12575003\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/438/381/\">\n      438 P.3d 381\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (describing the state of the law before\n     <em>\n      Padilla\n     </em>\n     was decided).

On the first point, the superintendent contends that, in his direct appeal, petitioner raised a claim that was so \"close\" to a\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     claim that it constitutes a procedural bar to this proceeding. The superintendent is correct that, in his direct appeal, petitioner noted his age at the time of his offense as a reason why the court should find his sentence unconstitutional. However, the whole of petitioner's argument was as follows:\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-27\">\n     \"There can be no doubt that the crimes in this case were violent and offensive to society. However, defendant was only 15 at the time the crimes were committed and 17 at the time of sentencing.

The sentence of 800 months imposed upon defendant\n     was excessive, and for the reasons given, constituted cruel and unusual punishment.\"\n     <footnotemark>\n      5\n     </footnotemark>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-29\">\n     As to the superintendent's second point, we are not convinced that petitioner reasonably could have asserted a\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     claim at the time of his direct appeal or his earlier post-conviction proceeding. At those times, the Court had not yet held that juveniles typically possess traits that make them less blameworthy than adults, and certainly had not held that mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles who commit homicide violate the Eighth Amendment. The state may be correct that, in the years preceding\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     , certain offenders were arguing that sentencing authorities must take their youth into consideration, but, under\n     <em>\n      Chavez\n     </em>\n     , the statutory question is not whether a claim\n     <em>\n      conceivably\n     </em>\n     could have been raised, but, rather, whether it\n     <em>\n      reasonably\n     </em>\n     could have been raised.\n     <em>\n      Chavez\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12575003\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/438/381/\">\n      364 Or. at 663\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12575003\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/438/381/\">\n      438 P.3d 381\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . The rule that the Court articulated in\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     , in 2012, was sufficiently \"novel, unprecedented, [and] surprising\" that we cannot conclude that petitioner reasonably could have anticipated it within two years of his conviction in 1995 or at the time of his later post-conviction proceeding.\n     <em>\n      See\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12575003\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/438/381/\">\n       id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     (describing\n     <em>\n      Padilla\n     </em>\n     ). We hold that petitioner's claim for post-conviction relief is not procedurally barred, and we turn to its merits.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-30\">\n     As noted, petitioner and his brother murdered an elderly couple. Petitioner was convicted of three crimes-aggravated murder of one of the victims, murder of the other victim, and first-degree robbery. On the aggravated murder charge, petitioner was sentenced to life in prison\n     <em>\n      with\n     </em>\n     the possibility of parole; on the murder charge, petitioner was sentenced to a determinate 800-month minimum sentence; and on the first-degree robbery charge, petitioner was sentenced to 36 months, to run consecutively to his sentence\n     for murder. The 800-month sentence-almost 67 years-for the murder of one victim is the only sentence that petitioner challenges as violative of the Eighth Amendment. Petitioner will be 81 years old when he is released on that charge. Petitioner argues that, although that sentence was not explicitly a sentence to life without parole, it is a sentence that exceeds his life expectancy and is the functional equivalent of such a sentence and subject to the protections of\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-31\">\n     The superintendent acknowledges that petitioner's sentence for murder is lengthy, but he argues that it does not violate the Constitution for three reasons. First, he argues, because petitioner was sentenced to a term of years and not to life,\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     does not apply. Second, the superintendent argues, even if some determinate sentences may be subject to\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     , petitioner's sentence is not\n     so long as to make it certain that he will die in prison; in fact, the superintendent notes, petitioner is eligible for good-time credit and possibly other forms of relief that could reduce his nearly 67-year sentence to 54 years, permitting his release when he is 68 years old.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     OAR 291-097-0215 (setting out rules for credits that reduce time of incarceration). Such a sentence, the superintendent contends, is not a sentence to which\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     applies. Finally, the superintendent argues, the sentencing court did not impose a mandatory sentence; it took petitioner's age into consideration and imposed a sentence that reflects the brutality of petitioner's crime-a crime that demonstrates that petitioner is irreparably corrupt.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-32\">\n     The superintendent's first point-that this court should not extend\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     to any term-of-years sentence, no matter how long, finds little support. In\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     , the Court stated that the Eighth Amendment \"forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile offenders\" but then quoted from its decision in\n     <em>\n      Graham\n     </em>\n     : \" 'A State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom,' \" but it must provide \" 'some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.' \"\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n      567 U.S. at 479\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n      132 S.Ct. 2455\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (quoting\n     <em>\n      Graham\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n      560 U.S. at 75\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n      130 S.Ct. 2011\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ).

The superintendent does not cite any additional penological justifications for a sentence that is the functional equivalent of life, and we see no reason to treat such a sentence differently.\n     Whether petitioner's sentence is, in fact, functionally equivalent to a life sentence is the next question we must answer. Here, as noted, petitioner's 800-month sentence would result in his release at age 81, and he argues that that is a de facto life sentence because his life expectancy is only 75-76 years. In making that argument, petitioner relies on the life expectancy of black males-a statistic from the Center for Disease Control-and the superintendent does not take issue with that measure. Instead, the superintendent\n     cites regulations that demonstrate that petitioner may be released after serving 54 years of his sentence, at age 68, potentially giving him 7-8 years of life outside of prison.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-33\">\n     Courts that have grappled with the issue of how lengthy a sentence must be to trigger the protections of\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     often reference\n     <em>\n      Graham\n     </em>\n     's instruction that juvenile offenders must retain a meaningful opportunity for release.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Null\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7055640\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/836/41/#p71\">\n      836 N.W.2d at 71-72\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (explaining that it does \"not regard the juvenile's potential future release in his or her late sixties after a half century of incarceration sufficient to escape the rationales of\n     <em>\n      Graham\n     </em>\n     or\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     \");\n     <em>\n      Casiano\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%2052\">\n      317 Conn. at 74-75\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20A.3d%201031\">\n      115 A.3d at 1044-45\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (noting that most courts that have considered the issue have determined that a sentence that exceeds life expectancy or that would make the individual eligible for release near the end of her life expectancy is a de facto life sentence).

Whether gender, race, or a juvenile's particular medical condition should be taken into consideration and, if so, how and when, are significant questions.

First, the parties' briefing on those issues is scanty. The superintendent does no more than to state, summarily, and without case citation, that, with good-time credit, petitioner's sentence is not a sentence that offers \"no hope or incentive for reformation.\" Second, even allowing for good-time credit, petitioner will serve at least 54 years and will be released, at the earliest, when he is 68 years old. We know of no state high court that has held that a sentence in excess of 50 years for a single homicide provides a juvenile with a meaningful opportunity for release.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Contreras\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514241\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/229/249/#p361\">\n      4 Cal.5th at 369\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514241\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/229/249/#p361\">\n      411 P.3d at\n     </extracted-citation>\n     455 (citing cases and so noting).\n     <footnotemark>\n      8\n     </footnotemark>\n     Given those particular circumstances, we conclude that petitioner's sentence is sufficiently lengthy that a\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     analysis is required. We do not mean to foreclose a future argument that a sentence in excess of 50 years would leave a particular juvenile offender with a meaningful opportunity for release. But in this case, that argument has not been developed. Accordingly, we turn to the superintendent's better-developed argument that petitioner's 800-month sentence was not mandatory, that the sentencing court in fact provided petitioner with the individualized sentencing process that\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     requires,\n     <footnotemark>\n      9\n     </footnotemark>\n     and that the sentence it imposed was not excessive under\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-35\">\n     The superintendent is factually correct in his observation that the 800-month\n     sentence that the sentencing\n     court imposed was not a mandatory sentence and that the court took petitioner's individual characteristics into consideration in imposing it. But, as noted,\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     did more than require that a trial court engage in individualized sentencing; it prohibited a trial court from irrevocably sentencing a juvenile to life in prison without determining that the juvenile is one of the \"rare\" offenders \"whose crimes reflect irreparable corruption.\"\n     <em>\n      Montgomery\n     </em>\n     , --- U.S. ----, 136 S.Ct. at 734.\n     <footnotemark>\n      10\n     </footnotemark>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-36\">\n     As to that substantive limitation, the superintendent contends that, although the sentencing court did not use that precise phrasing, its rationale in sentencing petitioner, as well as its findings, are consistent with a determination that petitioner's criminal conduct resulted not from the transience of youth, but from his irreparable corruption. The superintendent argues that, as in\n     <em>\n      Kinkel v. Persson\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567302\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/417/401/\">\n      363 Or. 1\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567302\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/417/401/\">\n      417 P.3d 401\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (2018), the sentencing court in this case took petitioner's age and mental condition into consideration and nevertheless imposed a lengthy sentence. The court found that petitioner's crime was premeditated and particularly brutal, and society, the court said, could not \"afford to take a chance\" on petitioner \"ever again.\"\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-37\">\n     Before we discuss our decision in\n     <em>\n      Kinkel\n     </em>\n     , we think it important to note two aspects of the Supreme Court's ruling in\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     (as discussed in\n     <em>\n      Montgomery\n     </em>\n     ) that bear on our analysis. First, the fact that the trial court considered a juvenile's age in sentencing the juvenile does not mean that the sentence comports with\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     's requirements.\n     <em>\n      Montgomery\n     </em>\n     , --- U.S. ----,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/\">\n      136 S.Ct. at 734\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (\"Even if a court considers a child's age before sentencing him or her to a lifetime in prison, that sentence still violates the Eighth Amendment for a child whose crime reflects 'unfortunate yet transient immaturity.' \" (Quoting\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n      567 U.S. at 479-80\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n      132 S.Ct. 2455\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .)).

Petitioner planned for over a week to steal a car and obtained a weapon and wore gloves to do so. Petitioner was aware that he might murder someone in the process and sought out victims who would be unable to fight back-a couple in their 80s with significant health problems. When petitioner and his brother broke into their home, they brutally beat both victims, striking them with their fists and weapons. The trial court described that brutality in detail:\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-44\">\n     It does not appear, however, that the sentencing court in this case \"[took] into account how children are different, and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.\"\n     <em>\n      Miller\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n      567 U.S. at 480\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n      132 S.Ct. 2455\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . The sentencing court recognized that petitioner lacked internal controls, but it expressed an inability to determine the cause of that inability. The court said,\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-46\">\n     The court did not make a finding, as the sentencing court did in\n     <em>\n      Kinkel\n     </em>\n     , that petitioner's crime was motivated by an incurable psychological condition, but, instead, expressed its hope that petitioner would be rehabilitated. That rehabilitation, the court said, should occur \"inside the walls [of prison] rather than outside the walls.\" This record does not convince us that the sentencing court reached the conclusion that petitioner is one of the rare juvenile offenders who is irreparably depraved or that no reasonable trial court could reach any other conclusion.
