We conclude that the district court did not err in determining that appellant failed to demonstrate a due process violation as appellant received written notice of the alleged parole violations, appellant was provided 11 opportunities to attend the parole revocation hearing and he refused to attend, there is no allegation that the parole hearing officers were not neutral and detached, the Parole Board provided a written statement of the evidence relied upon and the reasons for revoking parole, and appellant did not request the appointment of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morrissey v.
