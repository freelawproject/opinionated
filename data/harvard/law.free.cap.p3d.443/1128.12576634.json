Breslow, Judge.</p><p id=\"p-9\">Review of the documents submitted to this court pursuant to NRAP 3(g) reveals a jurisdictional defect. Specifically, the order designated in the notice of appeal is not substantively appealable. <em>See</em> NRAP 3A(b). This court has jurisdiction to consider an appeal only when the appeal is authorized by statute or court rule. <em>Taylor Constr. Co. v. Hilton Hotels</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2412285\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/100/207/\">100 Nev. 207</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2412285\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/100/207/\">678 P.2d 1152</extracted-citation> (1984). No statute or court rule provides for an appeal from an acceptance of arbitrator's decision. Moreover, this court notes that appellant's appeal from the final judgment on the arbitration award is currently pending in this court in <em>Dell'Oro v. Kemp,</em> Docket No. 78852. This court lacks jurisdiction, and therefore</p><p id=\"p-10\">ORDERS this appeal DISMISSED.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
