Ms. Gallagher contends that the district court improperly partitioned the property. She also contends that the district court erred in determining the amount of property taxes Mr. Townsend paid. We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] Ms. Gallagher raises two issues, which we restate as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. Did the district court err when it partitioned the property?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2.

In 2008, Mr. Townsend purchased a vacant lot for $25,014.20 with his own funds. The warranty deed conveyed the property to the parties as joint tenants with rights of survivorship. The parties each paid property taxes through the years-Ms. Gallagher paid $510 in property taxes and Mr. Townsend paid the remaining property taxes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Ms. Gallagher moved to Colorado in July 2013, Mr. Townsend invoiced Ms. Gallagher for maintenance costs as they arose, but she did not pay the invoices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b64] In August 2017, Ms. Gallagher filed suit seeking partition of the lot. The district court appointed partition commissioners, who determined that the property could not be partitioned in kind without manifest injury to its value and should be sold. The district court agreed, ordered the sale of the lot if neither party elected to purchase the other party's share, and valued the property at $33,500. Although the district court determined that each party owned a one-half interest in the lot, it ordered that Mr. Townsend be paid the first $25,017.20\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -the amount he paid to purchase the property-from the sale or election proceeds and that any excess proceeds be divided equally between the parties. The district court determined that an equitable division of the proceeds was proper because \"Mr. Townsend paid the entire purchase price, maintained[ ] the property, and paid the majority of the expenses associated with the property during the parties' short relationship.\" Ms. Gallagher timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b65] \"Following a bench trial, this court reviews a district court's findings and conclusions using a clearly erroneous standard for the factual findings and a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard for the conclusions of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Hofstad v.

Because unity of interest\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   is not necessary to create a joint tenancy,\n   <em>\n    Oatts v.

The district court based its determination on the parties' admission that \"they were in a dating type relationship which produced a child[,]\" and evidence that they \"purchased the property with the intent to develop it jointly.\" Mr. Townsend attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Hofstad\n   </em>\n   , but more generally relies on broad equitable powers he asserts the district court properly exercised to distribute the proceeds from the partitioned property. Neither party argued, and we found nothing in the record to suggest, that the district court's findings of fact are clearly erroneous, or that the district court's corresponding conclusion that Mr. Townsend failed to rebut the presumption of equal shares constitutes legal error. We therefore uphold the district court's conclusion that \"each party owns an undivided, one-half interest in the property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Distribution \"according to their just rights therein.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b612] The district court expressly relied on the phrase \"according to their just rights therein[,]\" in Wyoming Statute \u00a7 1-32-114, to divide the property's value equitably, rather than evenly, considering \"the party through whom the property was acquired\" and other factors that apply to fair and equitable division of marital property. For the reasons provided below, we conclude that Wyoming Statute \u00a7 1-32-114 limits, rather than sanctions, a district court's equitable powers to distribute partition proceeds after the court has determined the parties' respective shares in the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b613] We have never interpreted Wyoming Statute \u00a7 1-32-114.
