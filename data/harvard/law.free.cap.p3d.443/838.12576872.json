Finley's principal place of business is in Fort Worth, Texas, and EP Energy's principal place of business is in Houston, Texas. Both entities conduct oil and gas activities in Wyoming. According to the First Amended Complaint, the Agreement required EP Energy to assign all of its interests under various leases to Finley, without limit to the depths and formations. EP Energy, however, failed to do so despite Finley's \"repeated requests and demands.\" The dispute crystalized on September 13, 2017, when EP Energy sent an e-mail to Finley stating EP Energy retained the deep rights in certain lands described in the leases assigned to Finley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b64] Finley filed this lawsuit against EP Energy in the Wyoming District Court for the Eighth Judicial District. The First Amended Complaint set forth five claims for relief: (1) quiet title; (2) declaratory judgment; (3) breach of contract; (4) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (5) adverse possession. EP Energy filed a motion to dismiss seeking to enforce the choice-of-law and forum-selection clauses contained in the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b65] Section 13.10 of the Agreement provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) This Agreement is governed by the Laws of the State of Texas, excluding any choice of law rules that may direct the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (b) The Parties agree that\n   <strong>\n    any suit, action or proceeding\n   </strong>\n   seeking to enforce any provision of, or\n   <strong>\n    based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby shall be brought\n   </strong>\n   in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas or any Texas state court sitting in Houston,\n   <strong>\n    so long as one of such courts shall have subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action or proceeding,\n   </strong>\n   and that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in the State of Texas, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding ... has been brought in an inconvenient forum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (First emphasis in original; later emphases added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b66] In its Motion to Dismiss, EP Energy argued Finley's entire First Amended Complaint fell within the constraints of the forum-selection clause and must be dismissed. The district court applied Texas law and concluded, because the non-contract claims \"certainly implicate the terms of the contract,\" the claims fell within the scope of the\n   forum-selection clause.

However, Finley argues the forum-selection clause excludes its equitable causes of action because they arise independent of the Agreement. Instead, Finley contends its equitable claims arise from Finley's open, notorious, exclusive, and continuous: (1) exercise of ownership over lands covered by the Lease and lands not included in the assignment; (2) operation of all oil and gas wells located on lands covered by the Lease as well as those located on lands not included in the assignment; and (3) receipt of all proceeds generated from these wells. According to Finley, EP Energy's 2017 e-mail claiming ownership of the deep rights in the Kaye Teapot Sandstone Unit located on lands covered by the leases-an e-mail received nearly ten years after the Agreement was signed-was the impetus for this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b611] Under Texas law, a \"forum-selection clause should be denied force only if the facts alleged in support of the claim stand alone, are completely independent of the contract, and the claim could be maintained without reference to the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Pinto Tech.

Roush\n    </em>\n    , we considered a dispute between the owner of surface land claiming a partial interest in a mineral estate by virtue of adverse possession.\n    <em>\n     Roush v. Roush\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10455941\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/589/841/#p842\">\n     589 P.2d 841\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 842 (Wyo. 1979). We held without mining operations on the disputed premises, the elements necessary to show adverse possession could not exist.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10455941\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/589/841/#p842\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10455941\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/589/841/#p842\">\n     at 843\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . EP Energy contends Finley could not have conducted mining operations on the premises in dispute here because the requirements of state and federal statutes relating to oil and gas operations would not approve operations in the deep formation. Therefore, as in\n    <em>\n     Roush\n    </em>\n    , Finley's adverse possession claim is meritless because Finley cannot show it conducted operations on the disputed premises. We need not reach this argument here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
