The Clinic cross-appeals the District Court's denial of its trial motion for judgment as a matter of law, the $ 220,000 in damages awarded by the jury on Warrington's breach of contract claims, and asserted trial evidentiary errors. We affirm the appeal and cross appeal, and restate the parties' issues as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Did the District Court err by failing to rule and instruct the jury that the contract was for a one-year term pursuant to \u00a7 39-2-602(1), MCA ?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b62 In 2014, after working at Benefis Hospital in Great Falls for approximately 22 years, Warrington applied for a job with the Clinic as a clinical manager. This position paid a higher annual salary than her job at Benefis, in addition to benefits. The Clinic offered the job to Warrington on October 7, and she accepted the next day. Warrington then notified Benefis that her last day of work would be Friday, October 24. On October 10, Warrington signed a written employment contract for an indefinite term with the Clinic, and the parties agreed that Warrington would begin work there on October 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 On October 24, Warrington's last day at Benefis, the Clinic called Warrington and advised it would not be employing her after all. The Clinic would not provide a reason for withdrawing its offer of employment. Later, the Clinic indicated that Benefis officials had informed the Clinic that Warrington would not be a good fit for the\n   Clinic. In actuality, a Clinic employee who formerly worked at Benefis had opined to the Clinic that Warrington would not be a good fit there. Warrington tried to return to her former job at Benefis, but Benefis would not re-hire her. Ultimately, Warrington moved to Helena to take fulltime employment there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 Warrington brought this action against the Clinic for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and promissory estoppel. After discovery, the District Court entered partial summary judgment against the Clinic, holding it had breached the employment contract with Warrington and that the Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act (WDEA) did not apply, because the case involved an executory contract. The Clinic petitioned this Court for\n   supervisory control, arguing the District Court was proceeding under a mistake of law. This Court affirmed the District Court's summary rulings that the WDEA did not apply and the Clinic had breached the contract, and remanded the matter \"for further proceedings consistent with\" our order.\n   <em>\n    Great Falls Clinic LLP v.

The District Court concluded Warrington could not satisfy the elements of a special relationship, and granted summary judgment in favor of the Clinic on the issue, ruling that \"if the jury does conclude that the Clinic breached the implied covenant, Ms. Warrington can recover her contract expectancy damages but not tort damages.\" The District Court denied Warrington's request to amend her complaint to add additional tort claims, including negligence, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and wrongful failure to employ, and, accordingly, did not instruct the jury on any of Warrington's tort claims or on punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 During trial, the District Court admitted evidence offered by Warrington to which the Clinic objected as beyond the issues to be tried under the court's rulings. The court also denied the Clinic's motion for judgment as a matter of law on Warrington's damages and rejected the Clinic's proposed jury instruction regarding the term of employment contract. The jury awarded Warrington $ 220,000 in contract damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 Warrington appeals the District Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the Clinic on her claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and the denial of her instructions regarding her other tort claims.

In this regard, Warrington's circumstances were quite different than the employee at issue in\n   <em>\n    Wallis\n   </em>\n   . At the time Warrington applied with the Clinic, she had been employed at Benefis for 22 years, working in a variety of positions with increasing responsibilities, including management. Her education and experience in the healthcare industry made her employable elsewhere: she was qualified and hired for the Clinic position, found temporary employment within 10 days after the Clinic breached her employment contract, and then transitioned to a permanent position with the Montana State Fund in Helena. Warrington left her longstanding employment with Benefis for a higher paying job at the Clinic. Thus, Warrington was not in the kind of \"precarious financial position\" as the employee in\n   <em>\n    Wallis\n   </em>\n   , who was 10 years from retirement when laid off, did not have work skills outside furniture manufacture, relied upon the monthly check from his former employer as his only income, had not been offered further employment with the company, and signed a covenant not to compete with his former employer.\n   <em>\n    Wallis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2164031\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/160/1109/#p1118\">\n    160 Cal.

Further, Warrington's contract was not for what was essentially unemployment compensation in\n   <em>\n    Wallis\n   </em>\n   , but for a higher paying job, one that she voluntarily sought. As the District Court reasoned, this weighed against a finding of unequal bargaining power because, \"when she negotiated this contract, she was safely employed at an existing job.\" She wanted the Clinic job because it \"paid more,\" had \"more challenging responsibilities,\" and \"carried more prestige.\" Warrington had not signed a non-compete agreement like the employee signed in\n   <em>\n    Wallis\n   </em>\n   , and, as cited by the District Court, on the basis of the market economy, was able to demand and obtain \"a very high price\" for providing her services to the Clinic. Warrington was not faced with \"no option but to sign the contract as defendant dictated,\" because she had the choice to accept or decline the new employment position and keep her current employment, in contrast to the employee in\n   <em>\n    Wallis\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Wallis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2164031\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/160/1109/#p1118\">\n    160 Cal.

Given this record, we cannot conclude the District Court erred in holding that the \"special relationship\" factors of unequal bargaining power and non-profit motivation were not established.

This argument is related to the long procedural history of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b621 The District Court determined in its December 22, 2017 order on summary judgment that the only issue to be tried was the damages owed to Warrington for the Clinic's breach of contract (and any contract-based breach of the implied covenant), and that Warrington's then-pled tort claims would not be considered. The court reiterated this ruling in a telephone conference with the parties on January 18, 2018, explaining Warrington's special relationship claim had been dismissed by summary judgment. Six months later, shortly before trial, Warrington sought leave to amend her complaint to plead additional tort claims, which the District Court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b622 Warrington frames her argument as instructional error, which we typically review for abuse of discretion,\n   <em>\n    Cechovic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4577733\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/273/104/#p116\">\n    273 Mont. at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4577733\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/273/104/#p116\">\n    902 P.2d at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and to determine if \"the jury instructions in their entirety state the applicable law of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 22. However,\n   the issue is more accurately about the District Court's rulings on the motion to amend and on Warrington's tort claim for breach of the implied covenant, the denial of which is affirmed above. Montana statute expressly prohibits recovery of emotional distress damages in a contract action. Section 27-1-310, MCA. The District Court properly determined that the only claim to be tried was the damages for breach of contract and, therefore, there was no instructional error for failing to instruct the jury on further tort claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b623\n   <em>\n    2. Did the District Court err by admitting evidence of the Clinic's liability and Warrington's emotional distress?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b624 On cross appeal, the Clinic argues the District Court abused its discretion and committed reversible error when it allowed Warrington to present evidence regarding the Clinic's contract liability and her emotional distress. The Clinic argues that, despite a pre-trial ruling, upheld by this Court by Writ of Supervisory Control, that the Clinic had breached the contract, the District Court nonetheless permitted Warrington to introduce liability evidence about the breach that served only to prejudice the Clinic in the eyes of the jury, as did evidence the District Court permitted Warrington to introduce regarding her emotional distress, when distress claims were not before the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b625 Montana Rule of Evidence 104(a) provides that \"the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court.\" Moreover, \"[a] district court has broad discretion when determining the relevance and admissibility of evidence,\" thus this determination is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Significant issues of fact remained about the harm suffered by Warrington, which the District Court believed necessitated evidence and explanation about context. Noting that the parties' contract referenced a future \"successful career\" Warrington would have with the Clinic, but also subjected her to six-month probationary period, the District Court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The parties dispute what full performance by the Clinic would have looked like.... Genuine fact disputes remain about how the situation would have unfolded if the Clinic had not breached the contract on October 24.... Jurors who hear all of this need not necessarily believe ... that Ms. Warrington would not have lasted through her first day.... This will require deciding whether the Clinic would have fired Ms. Warrington at all, when it would have\n   done so, and how much she would have earned before it happened.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The court further ruled that, although the Clinic was entitled to summary judgment on the special relationship issue that precluded tort damages, the jury would determine whether the Clinic \"breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.... Therefore, if the jury does conclude that the Clinic breached the implied covenant, Ms. Warrington can recover her contract expectancy damages but not tort damages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b627 Consequently, evidence of Warrington's expectations, had the Clinic not breached the contract, and the fallout from the breach, including Warrington's concerns over the impact of the loss upon her reputation and employability at her age, and the steps she took to find comparable work, involving relocating to another city, was potentially relevant to the determination of expectancy damages, which is the amount reasonably expected to put the non-breaching party in the position it would have been absent the breach. Section 27-1-311, MCA\n   <em>\n    ; see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arrowhead Sch. Dist.

Thus, the District Court was tasked with assessing the evidence offered in these regards, and applying the rules of evidence in the exercise of its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b628 The District Court also gave some latitude for Plaintiff's counsel to, in the District Court's words, \"personalize\" Warrington. Unfortunately, Plaintiff's counsel, given an inch, attempted to take a mile, and, in response to the Clinic's continuing objections, the District Court admonished: \"You can't get emotional distress damages ... Over and over and over again, this is what she did in the Army. She was a nurse for babies.... She's saved people's lives. She's saved [her husband's] life many times. It's not what this case is about. It's not a tort case. It's a contract case....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b629 The District Court may have permitted Plaintiff's counsel to go too far, but our review of the record leads us to the conclusion that any error did not ultimately result in prejudice to the Clinic requiring reversal. The court admonished Plaintiff's counsel to stop overreaching, and instructed the jury that Warrington could only recover contract expectancy damages, that she could not be awarded damages for emotional distress, and that the Clinic could not be assessed punitive damages. The District Court had broad discretion to admit evidence, and in a case involving significant personal expectancy damages for which evidence about the consequences of the breach upon Warrington was potentially relevant, as discussed above, we cannot conclude the District Court's evidentiary rulings constituted reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b630\n   <em>\n    3.

Warrington argued the Clinic should have reasonably contemplated this employment dilemma at the time of contracting, knowing that Warrington had worked exclusively in the healthcare industry for many years; that its facility was one of two hospital-based healthcare providers in Great Falls; and that Warrington would have to leave Great Falls to pursue her career track if her employment with the Clinic fell through and she was ineligible for re-hire at Benefis. Warrington's move to Helena could have been determined by the jury to be proper mitigation of her damages, in which she also incurred costs she otherwise would not have incurred had the Clinic not breached the employment contract, including a mortgage payment on her house in Helena, and commuting expenses between Great Falls and Helena.
