As to the injury to a child conviction, Miller argued the jury instruction, combined with the prosecutor's closing argument, created a fatal variance with the information. Miller also argued the prosecutor committed prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments by appealing to the emotions, passions, and prejudices of the jury, and by misstating the evidence. Miller appealed his judgment of conviction and sentence to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed. Miller timely filed a petition for review which this Court granted. We affirm the district court's judgment of conviction and clarify the fundamental error doctrine articulated in\n   <em>\n    State v.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In April 2016, Miller's wife, Rochelle, called police after she and Miller had a verbal dispute that resulted in Miller driving off aggressively with the couple's minor son, S.A.M., in the car. Officer Sanchez arrived at the Millers' home and was speaking with Rochelle when Miller drove near the house. Rochelle pointed out Miller's vehicle, and Officer Sanchez walked towards his patrol car, at which time Miller quickly reversed his vehicle and drove away. Officer Sanchez began to pursue Miller and activated his siren and overhead lights. Miller drove away quickly and Officer Sanchez estimated Miller was driving 40 miles-per-hour in a 15 miles-per-hour zone. Miller drove past a number of pedestrians near the roadway. Miller eventually stopped his vehicle in a field and S.A.M. exited the vehicle and ran to a nearby residence. Miller exited the vehicle and started walking away from Officer Sanchez. Miller was then ordered to the ground at gunpoint and arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Miller was charged with felony eluding a police officer pursuant to Idaho Code section 49-1404(2) and misdemeanor injury to a child pursuant to Idaho Code section 18-1501(2). Miller's trial counsel did not object to the proposed jury instructions. A jury convicted Miller on both counts, and he was sentenced to a term of four years, one year fixed, for the eluding charge, and was given credit for time served for the injury to a child charge. Miller appealed to the Court of Appeals, alleging two instances of fundamental error.\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, based on the application of\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   in the years that have followed the decision, as well as oral arguments made by appellate counsel in this case, we wish to take this opportunity to clarify\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, we address the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   that states \"the error must be clear or obvious, without the need for any additional information not contained in the appellate record, including information as to whether the failure to object was a tactical decision.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077800\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/150/209/#p226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We reemphasize that in order to satisfy this prong of\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   a defendant bears the burden of showing clear error in the record. This means the record must contain evidence of the error and the record must also contain evidence as to whether or not trial counsel made a tactical decision in failing to object. If the record does not contain evidence regarding whether counsel's decision was strategic, the claim is factual in nature and thus more appropriately addressed via a petition for post-conviction relief. As the Court of Appeals observed, when stating the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   is satisfied, appellant's counsel often contends \"it is clear from the record that the failure to object was not tactical\" and that \"failing to object could not have benefitted the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , No. 45028,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203413827\">\n    2018 WL 3413827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 n. 2. However, neither of those statements demonstrates that it is clear that the record contains evidence that the failure to object was a tactical decision. Thus, we clarify that whether trial counsel made a tactical decision in failing to object is a claim that must be supported by evidence in the record. Appellate counsel's opinion that the decision could not have been tactical does not satisfy the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Perry.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Next, we clarify the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   that states \"the defendant must demonstrate that the error affected the defendant's substantial rights, meaning (in most instances) that it must have affected the outcome of the trial proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077800\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/150/209/#p226\">\n    150 Idaho at 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077800\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/150/209/#p226\">\n    245 P.3d at 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In dicta that followed the holding in\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   , this Court articulated that, as to the third prong, the defendant bears the burden of showing there is a \"reasonable possibility\" that the error affected the outcome of the trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077800\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/150/209/#p226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the years following\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   , we have cited both the \"error affected the outcome\" and the \"reasonable possibility\" language when discussing the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bernal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=164%20Idaho%20190\">\n    164 Idaho at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570256\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/427/1/#p4\">\n    427 P.3d at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We take this opportunity to clarify that the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   requires that the defendant demonstrate that the clear error in the record-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the error identified in the first and second prongs-actually affected the outcome of the trial proceedings. Whether the error affected the trial proceedings must be clear from the appellate record.

There is nothing in the information that indicated the State's arguments about the injury to a child charge would be limited to events that occurred while the automobile was still moving.

Though Miller contends his defense counsel did not explore the allegation in the prosecutor's closing statement, the record shows that trial counsel rebutted the theory in closing.

Or if he gets there, give the kid a chance to run off. The reality is he did pretty much all of this not for selfish reasons, but he wanted to make sure his kid didn't wind up having to go with his mom who was incredibly mad at him and because he didn't want to have his kid watching him possibly being arrested and being accused of who knows what it was he was being accused of.

About 10 feet from a group of children when he turned up on to 3rd Street from Jefferson. Those also were near hits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Miller contends that this statement was inflammatory by appealing to the emotions and prejudices of the jury. Miller also argues this was a misstatement of evidence because Officer Sanchez testified that the group of elderly people was 3 to 5 feet\n   <em>\n    from\n   </em>\n   the roadway, not\n   <em>\n    on\n   </em>\n   the roadway. Miller also contends that Officer Sanchez was testifying as to where the people were when the Officer passed them, but did not see where they were when Miller passed them. Miller argues that there was no evidence he drove off the road, and thus there were not \"near hits\" as the prosecutor alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Here again, the prosecutor's statement was a reasonable inference from the evidence and within the considerable latitude afforded to prosecutors during closing argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alwin\n   </em>\n   , 164 Idaho at 169,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570019\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/426/1260/#p1269\">\n    426 P.3d at 1269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Officer Sanchez testified that there was a group of elderly persons outside a church that were \"3 to 5 feet from the roadway also watching as we went by. I know some of them were particularly close to the road.\" Officer Sanchez also testified that he saw a \"group of kids\" within \"3 to 5 feet from the edge of the roadway.\" Officer Sanchez testified he could not see where the children were when Miller was approaching them, but they were 3 to 5 feet from the roadway when the Officer went by and they were watching the cars pass. Officer Sanchez also stated he saw a \"group of kids on tricycles or Big Wheels playing right in the middle of the road\" that \"were within 10 feet from the southernmost curb line of Jefferson Road.\" Officer Sanchez also testified that Miller's driving occasionally kicked up dust, which the officer took to mean that Miller was driving too close to the edge of the road. Based on the testimony, the prosecutor's statement was a reasonable inference of the evidence. While Officer Sanchez stated the elderly were near, rather than on, the road, he also testified that \"some of them were particularly close to the road\" and that Miller was driving close enough to the road to kick up dust. Accordingly, it was not a mischaracterization of evidence to call Miller's coming within 5 feet of pedestrians as \"near hits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   And, here again, even if the prosecutor committed misconduct, Miller cannot show fundamental error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077800\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/150/209/#p226\">\n    150 Idaho at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077800\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/150/209/#p226\">\n    245 P.3d at 980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed previously regarding the bicyclist, Miller's counsel rebutted the prosecutor's statements regarding the sidewalk pedestrians in closing argument.

When he stopped in that field and let that child run out of there knowing that the police were right there, right there behind him, you remember Officer Sanchez pulls his gun, anything could have happened. So this was definitely a dangerous situation that he placed his child right smack in the middle of.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   This is the same statement challenged above in the fatal variance analysis. Miller contends it was prosecutorial misconduct because the evidence shows S.A.M. had already run off by the time Officer Sanchez got out of his car and drew his gun. Officer Sanchez testified that when he approached Miller's car that had stopped in the field Officer Sanchez \"saw the young child run off.\" Officer Sanchez also said, \"first the child ran out the passenger side, and as I'm still pulling up the driver gets out slowly ....\" The body-camera footage does not show the child in the frame of the camera during Miller's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Officer Sanchez's testimony and the body camera footage show that S.A.M. was not present at the time the gun was drawn and Miller was arrested. However, Officer Sanchez's testimony that he \"saw the young child run off\" indicates that S.A.M. was still at the scene when Officer Sanchez arrived in his patrol car, but that S.A.M. ran off before Officer Sanchez exited the car and drew his gun. Thus, the statement by the prosecutor that Miller \"stopped in that field and let that child run out of there knowing that the police were right there, right there behind him ....\" is supported by the evidence. However, the prosecutor's next statement \"you remember Officer Sanchez pulls his gun, anything could have happened\" is not supported by the testimony or body-camera footage because S.A.M. was gone when the gun was drawn.
