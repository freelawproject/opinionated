We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Did the District Court err by denying Questo's Motions to Suppress?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 At approximately 6:00 p.m. on April 24, 2017, the Lewistown Police Department received a call from two employees at the local Boys and Girls Club reporting that an adult male, who \"smelled of [an] alcoholic beverage,\" had just picked up his minor children from the Club and was leaving with them in a muddy blue truck. The callers identified themselves, provided dispatch a description of the vehicle, and identified the driver as Randall Questo. Lewistown Police Officer William Routzahn, who received this information from dispatch while on patrol, was familiar with Questo. Routzahn proceeded to the area near the Boys and Girls Club, attempting to locate Questo and the vehicle described by the callers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Officer Routzahn located a truck matching the description provided by the Club employees parked at a gas station fuel pump, and observed an adult male, who he recognized as Questo, standing beside the truck and filling it with fuel. Routzahn had not observed Questo driving. Routzahn drove his patrol car into the gas station's parking lot and parked next to the curb, away from the fuel pumps. He did not activate his vehicle's overhead lights. Routzahn's vehicle was facing the front of Questo's truck, but was parked on the opposite side of the parking lot's driveway. Routzahn estimated that he parked thirty or more feet away from Questo's truck, which provided space enough for Questo to exit and a \"right of way so that people in the parking lot could get in and out as well.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Officer Routzahn approached Questo on foot and advised him a call had been received from the Club, reporting that Questo had smelled of alcohol when he picked up his children. Questo admitted driving the truck from the Club to the gas station, and indicated his girlfriend and two children were inside the vehicle, but denied that he smelled of alcohol. Routzahn said that he detected an odor of alcohol coming from Questo or his truck. Questo replied that he had empty beer cans in the back of his truck and suggested those might be causing the smell. Routzahn expressed doubt that the empty cans could be causing such a smell, given the windy conditions. He then asked if Questo had been drinking. Questo answered no, stating he had drunk alcohol the night before but not that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Routzahn asked if Questo would perform some field sobriety tests, and Questo agreed. To conduct the test out of the wind, Routzahn and Questo moved across the parking lot to a location near the gas station\n   building. Routzahn testified that, removed from the truck, he could \"still detect an odor of alcoholic beverage\" emanating from Questo. Routzahn conducted the horizontal gaze nystagmus test and noted that Questo scored a three out of six, which he testified indicates \"a certain level of impairment.\" Routzahn advised Questo of the test results and again asked whether he had been drinking. This time, Questo stated that \"he'd had a couple beers a few hours prior\" and had recently consumed Dayquil. Routzahn asked Questo if he would perform a preliminary breath test (PBT), and Questo agreed. Questo provided a breath sample, which registered an illegal blood-alcohol content for purposes of driving. Officer Honeycutt, who had arrived as backup, did not formally arrest Questo at the time, but transported him to the Sheriff's office for additional testing. A breath test conducted at the Sheriff's office indicated Questo had a blood-alcohol content of 0.121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Questo was arrested and charged by Information in Count I with Criminal Endangerment, a felony in violation of \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA, and in Count II with Driving Under\n   the Influence of Alcohol (DUI), a misdemeanor in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401(1)(a), MCA. Questo filed a motion to suppress the evidence, arguing Officer Routzahn \"lacked particularized suspicion for the investigatory stop based on a citizen's report.\" After an evidentiary hearing, at which Questo was represented by counsel, the District Court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Questo then discharged his attorney and obtained new legal counsel. After the State filed an Amended Information, adding Count III, DUI per se, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA, Questo's new counsel filed a second motion to suppress, requesting the District Court reconsider his initial motion and also consider additional arguments. The District Court granted the request. In his second motion, Questo again argued that, \"prior to the 'stop' of his vehicle,\" the officer lacked particularized suspicion to investigate him for DUI, and also argued \"there is zero evidence of observable impairment prior to his arrest and therefore no probable cause for his arrest.\" The District Court conducted another evidentiary hearing and entered an order again denying Questo's motion, reasoning the citizen tip satisfied the reliability factors in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Pursuant to a plea bargain agreement, Questo pled guilty to Count III, misdemeanor DUI per se, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA, reserving his right to appeal the District Court's denial of his motion to suppress,\n   and the State dismissed Counts I and II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 Questo appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 We review a district court's ruling on a motion to suppress evidence to determine whether the court's factual findings are clearly erroneous and whether the court's interpretation and application of the law are correct.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Dupree\n   </em>\n   , after receiving a tip that the defendant would be in possession of illegal drugs when she arrived at a train station later that day, two police officers \"proceeded to the station to investigate.\"\n   <em>\n    Dupree\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 4. The officers located the defendant standing \"in a public place of her choosing,\" approached her, identified themselves, and told her about the tip. They proceeded to ask, \"in permissive terms,\" if the defendant was willing to be searched and she agreed. We held a seizure had not occurred because the officers \"did not utilize threats or use a show of force to compel compliance\" or in any way restrain the defendant's liberty \"by means of physical force of show of authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Dupree\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15 (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b618 Here, Officer Routzahn's actions are similar to those of the officers in\n   <em>\n    Wilkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ballinger\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Dupree\n   </em>\n   . Although Routzahn was responding to a tip and had an investigative motive when he approached Questo, he did nothing, as explained above, to restrain Questo's liberty. The facts found by the District Court do not support a conclusion that Questo was seized when Routzahn approached and engaged him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b619 While the District Court found that Officer Routzahn had particularized suspicion to investigate Questo pursuant to a\n   <em>\n    Pratt\n   </em>\n   analysis, and denied Questo's motions to suppress on that basis, we conclude Officer Routzahn's approach to Questo at the fuel pump was a routine police encounter that did not require particularized suspicion. He thereafter acquired particularized suspicion for further investigation upon Questo's voluntary participation in his questioning and testing. We will affirm a district court when it reaches the right result, even if it reaches that result for the wrong reason.\n   <em>\n    State v.
