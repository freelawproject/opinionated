Specifically, the district court entered the order denying the motion to amend the judgment of conviction on April 24, 2019. Appellant did not file the notice of appeal, however, until June 5, 2019, well after the expiration of the 30-day appeal period prescribed by NRAP 4(b). Because an untimely notice of appeal fails to vest jurisdiction in this court,\n     <em>\n      Lozada v.
