The jury recommended a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The Honorable Doug Haught, District Judge, presided at trial, and sentenced Moore in accordance with the jury's verdict. Moore now appeals.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    <strong>\n     FACTS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    \u00b6 2 The State's evidence showed that Appellant attacked and killed his cellmate, Todd Bush, on the evening of March 6, 2014. Appellant and Bush were inmates from California incarcerated at the privately-run Northfork Correctional Center in Sayre.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    Appellant and Bush were under lockdown in Cell 261 of the Fox South Unit at approximately 7:45 p.m. when Christopher Hill, a corrections counselor, stopped by to verify their respective account balances. Hill did not unlock the cell door during this process although he had a key. Instead, he knocked on the cell door and spoke with each inmate through the window. Bush was laying on the bottom bunk bed when Hill read Bush's account balance. Bush did not get up but responded with a simple \"okay.\" Appellant was laying on the top bunk, reading a book when Hill asked whether he wanted his balance. Appellant hopped down off his bunk, walked to the door and Hill read his account balance. Appellant said \"okay\" and returned to the top bunk where he resumed reading. Appellant and Bush were the only two inmates inside the cell.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    \u00b6 3 Before walking away from Cell 261, Hill tugged at the handle of the cell door to confirm it was locked. Then Hill moved down the line to the other cells, repeating the\n    process of balance checks with the other inmates. At approximately 8:00 p.m., Hill finished his shift and had just walked outside the Fox South Unit when an emergency medical call for Appellant's and Bush's cell was broadcast. Robert Hubbard, a correctional officer, was conducting a lockdown of the inmates on the bottom row of the Fox South Unit when someone yelled about an inmate down on the top tier.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    \u00b6 4 Hubbard raced upstairs to Cell 261. There, he observed through the window of the locked cell door Appellant holding onto Bush. Both inmates were on the floor with Appellant's legs folded underneath him; Bush was on his knees. Appellant had his arms wrapped around Bush and was doing something to Bush's chest. According to Hubbard, Appellant was \"[k]ind of like shaking\" Bush's chest. No other inmates were inside the cell. Hubbard called over the radio for medical assistance then unlocked the cell with his key and went inside. Hubbard quickly determined that Bush had no pulse and that his condition was not good. Hubbard conveyed this information over the radio, laid Bush's body flat on the floor and began CPR while waiting for the medical team to arrive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    \u00b6 5 Hill arrived to find Hubbard inside Cell 261 performing CPR on Bush. Hill ushered Appellant away from the cell and told him to sit on a bench in the common area. Hill then relieved Hubbard and commenced CPR on Bush. The prison's medical team soon arrived. Bush was loaded onto a gurney and transported to a local hospital by ambulance. Bush was in full cardiac arrest and never responded to the continuous efforts of the prison medical staff, paramedics and emergency room personnel to save his life. Bush was pronounced dead at the hospital.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    \u00b6 6 When asked by Northfork officials what happened to Bush, Appellant said he didn't know. Appellant explained that Bush \"liked to drink\" and had fallen off his bunk bed. Appellant offered too that he and Bush were from the same neighborhood. Bruising and abrasions were observed on Bush's face, neck and upper chest by investigators and medical personnel that were inconsistent with falling roughly two feet off the lower bunk bed. A small laceration was observed at the base of Bush's neck and an abrasion was apparent on Bush's left rib cage where the skin had rubbed off. Petechial hemorrhaging was observed in both of Bush's eyelids. These injuries suggested to investigators evidence of attack, struggle and asphyxia. By contrast, two small scratches were observed on Appellant's neck.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    \u00b6 7 Inside Cell 261, investigators found utter disarray. Spilt \"hooch\" or contraband prison alcohol (commonly made from fermented food like bread, fruit and sugar) was spilt on the floor along with one of Bush's overturned tennis shoes. In the corner of the cell near a mounted table and chairs was an overturned cup and wet towel. Passive blood drips were found in this same area suggesting the source was directly above the blood drops. Blood swipes were observed on the cell wall that were consistent with someone trying to get up off the ground.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    \u00b6 8 Dr. Ruth Kohlmeier, the state medical examiner, autopsied Bush and determined that the manner of death was homicide with the cause of death being asphyxiation due to strangulation. Her external examination revealed bruising on Bush's hands, forearm and chest area. Bush also had an abrasion on his left chest. Bush had bruises on his nose, above his left eyebrow and on his right eyebrow; he also had a black left eye. These injuries were fresh and were inflicted during the same time frame. Dr. Kohlmeier opined that these injuries were consistent with Bush receiving multiple blows to the head and were not consistent with Bush having fallen down.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    \u00b6 9 Dr. Kohlmeier's internal examination revealed that Bush's brain had swollen but there was no blood on the brain. The absence of blood on the brain meant Bush's head injuries were not lethal. Bush had petechial hemorrhages in both eyes, along with injuries to his neck, which were consistent with strangulation. Indeed, Bush's hyoid bone inside his neck was fractured which, according to Dr. Kohlmeier, would take \"tremendous force\" to break in a younger person like Bush. Toxicology of Bush's blood showed he was intoxicated: his blood alcohol level was positive for alcohol at 0.18 percent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    \u00b6 10 The defense presented no evidence at trial and rested at the conclusion of the State's case. However, the defense theory at trial-advanced both through cross-examination and closing argument-was that the victim's death may have been caused by an accidental fall, consistent with Appellant's statement to prison officials.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    <strong>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    \u00b6 11\n    <strong>\n     Proposition I.\n    </strong>\n    The trial court admitted evidence under 12 O.S.2011, \u00a7 2404(B)\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    showing that Appellant attacked an inmate and a detention officer in separate incidents occurring at the county jail while Appellant awaited trial in the present case. The first incident occurred on January 9, 2016 when, according to detention officer Chris Yeager, Appellant \"balled up\" his fists and struck his cellmate, Kevin Ezzell, on the back of the head inside their cell. This incident occurred after Yeager opened the cell door and responded to Ezzell's request for bedding. Appellant and Ezzell were the only two inmates inside the cell. Yeager testified that Appellant \"was getting his hands up close to [Ezzell's] neck and shoulder region\" while standing behind Ezzell. Yeager intervened and separated the two as Ezzell attempted to run out the open cell door. Yeager testified that Appellant's hands weren't coming off of Ezzell's neck and shoulder area, prompting him to pull Appellant off Ezzell. Appellant later said to the detention officer \"tell that dude that I did him a favor because I could have waited 'til y'all did meds and killed him.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    \u00b6 12 The second incident occurred on February 18, 2016, as detention officer Jason Crook was passing out medications in Appellant's pod. Appellant attempted to walk out of the pod to confront a jail captain about that morning's oatmeal rations when he was stopped by another detention officer. Appellant then knocked off a stack of trays from the medication cart, pushed the cart out of the way and walked towards a hallway door. When Crook stepped around the medicine cart, Appellant came at the officer and put his hands on Crook's \"head and shoulder area.\" Crook and Appellant then fell to the ground. Crook was able to subdue Appellant despite Appellant having both hands on Crook's face with his thumbs going forward into the officer's eyes. When Crook knocked Appellant's hands away, Appellant grabbed the back of the officer's shirt.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    \u00b6 13 The trial court admitted this evidence under Section 2404(B) as proof showing absence of mistake or accident. The trial court included in the written charge the uniform Oklahoma limiting instruction for other crimes or bad acts evidence.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    On appeal, Appellant argues the trial court abused its discretion by admitting this evidence. Appellant urges this error denied him due process and was not harmless. Appellant requests either a new trial or modification of his sentence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    \u00b6 14 At trial, Appellant timely objected to this evidence on the grounds raised here thus preserving this claim for our review.

When asked what happened, Appellant told prison officials that Bush \"liked to drink\" and had fallen off his bunk bed. Defense counsel's cross-examination of the State's witnesses, like his closing argument, advanced the defense that Appellant's version of events was possible despite the considerable evidence showing Bush was beaten and strangled. Thus, the issue of Appellant's intent was squarely before the jury as was the defense's attempt to show reasonable doubt by defending the case with the notion that the victim's death was an accident.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    \u00b6 17 Evidence that a defendant committed acts similar to the charged offense may be admissible at trial to prove absence of mistake or accident. Relevant evidence \"means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" 12 O.S.2011, \u00a7 2401. The probative nature of the other crimes evidence offered in this case depends upon the similarity of the conduct involved. As recently explained by another court in addressing this issue:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n    The use of a defendant's other misconduct to prove lack of accident is premised upon Wigmore's theory of improbability. 1 E. Imwinkelried, Uncharged Misconduct Evidence \u00a7 5:11 (Updated 2017) (citing 2 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 363 (3rd ed.) ).\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    22B Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Evid. \u00a7 5255. Under the theory of improbability, which is also known as the doctrine of chances, \"the credibility of the accident explanation decreases as the number of instances of similar conduct increases.\" Imwinkelried \u00a7 5:11. Stated another way, \"the more often an accidental or unusual event occurs, the more likely it is that any subsequent reoccurrence is not the result of a mistake or accident.\" R.

Such evidence is not offered to show a defendant's propensity for violence and the defendant's action in conformity therewith. Rather, it is offered for the limited purpose of proving absence of mistake or accident as authorized under the express terms of Section 2404(B).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    \u00b6 19 In the present case, evidence of Appellant's separate jail altercations occurring after Bush's killing was relevant to prove absence of mistake or accident as to the charged offense. The January 9, 2016, incident is highly similar to the charged offense. The record shows Appellant attacked his cellmate by punching him in the back of the head and grabbing his cellmate around the throat and shoulders. This attack occurred inside the jail cell both men shared. The February 18, 2016, incident is somewhat different from the charged offense but nonetheless similar enough to be admissible. During this second incident, Appellant attacked a detention officer outside his cell, put his hands on the officer's head and shoulder area and both men ended up on the floor before Appellant was subdued.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    \u00b6 20 The setting and nature of the attacks for these two incidents are highly similar to the circumstances surrounding the charged offense. Although Appellant's subsequent victims were not fatally injured, all three incidents reveal similar attacks in which Appellant confronted a cellmate or detention officer. The repeated commission by Appellant of similar attacks was directly probative of the credibility of his claim that Bush's death was accidental. That is particularly so where, as here, Appellant expressly stated that he could have killed Ezzell, the victim of the January 9th attack, had he waited until the jail staff was handing out medication.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    \u00b6 21 Despite Appellant's contrary assertions, the similarities of the charged offense and Appellant's attack against Ezzell and the detention officer were substantial enough to create a visible connection between all three. The other crimes evidence introduced in this case was highly probative of a material issue in the present case and was necessary to the State's burden of proof, in particular, refuting the defense claim at trial (based on Appellant's own words) that Bush's death could have been an accident.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Welch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11208723\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/2/356/\">\n     2000 OK CR 8\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 13,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11208723\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/2/356/\">\n     2 P.3d at 367\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . \"In dealing with the relevancy of evidence, we begin with the presumption that in determining whether to admit such evidence, the trial judge should lean in favor of admission.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11208723\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/2/356/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11208723\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/2/356/\">\n     2000 OK CR 8\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 14,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11208723\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/2/356/\">\n     2 P.3d at 367\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotation omitted). \"When balancing the relevancy of evidence against its prejudicial effect, the trial court should give the evidence its maximum probative force and its minimum reasonable prejudicial value.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    \u00b6 22 In the present case, the State bore the burden of proving that Appellant intentionally killed Bush. The challenged evidence tends to refute Appellant's claim that Bush's death was accidental and bolstered the State's considerable evidence showing malice aforethought.

Further, the medical examiner observed with this photograph that there was no blood on the brain, signifying the blows to the head Bush received were nonfatal. These challenged photographs depicted the victim's injuries, illustrated the testimony of the medical examiner, and demonstrated the nonfatal nature of Bush's head injuries.

The medical examiner acknowledged that the neck organ looked like a \"red blob\" in the overview picture. She used the two close-up shots of the broken hyoid bone and the related hemorrhage, as pointed out by the forceps shown therein, to identify the location of this injury.

However, trial judges should exercise extreme caution when a defendant's counsel announces during a trial proceeding that their client does not wish to testify. The best practice unquestionably is to take the time to swear in the defendant on the record and outside the presence of the jury and ask simple questions regarding their choice not to testify in their own behalf.
