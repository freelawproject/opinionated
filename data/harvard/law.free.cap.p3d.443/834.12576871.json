The assailants kicked open the front door and went inside. Wade Dugger, a house guest who was sleeping in the front room on a couch, awoke to the sound of a shotgun blast which hit the Bairds' dog as it ran into the room. Mr. Dugger stood up and he too was shot. The blast knocked him backwards into the adjoining bedroom in which the Baird children were sleeping. Dennis and Christina Baird jumped out of bed to investigate the commotion. As they approached the door into the front room, Dennis pushed his wife back into the bedroom and indicated that she should wait. He then went around the door and was instantly shot. His body, recoiling from the shotgun blast, landed at Christina's feet. Desperate for help, she headed out of the bedroom and then saw Derrick Parkhurst, one of the appellants, running out the front door. When she went to check on her children, she discovered that Mr. Dugger was seriously injured. She asked if he was all right and he responded, \"no,\" and then said, \"Derrick.\" Ms. Baird then ran next door for help.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   When the police arrived, a witness told them that he had seen two males fleeing the scene in a blue or green Ford Fairlane and that he had followed the car far enough to see it heading out of town towards Douglas, Wyoming. The police, upon entering the house, determined that Dennis Baird was dead but that Wade Dugger was still alive. While awaiting the arrival of an ambulance, Ms. Baird informed the police that Dennis and Derrick Parkhurst were the assailants. A police officer then asked Mr. Dugger if he knew who shot him. Unable to understand the response, the officer queried if it had been Derrick and Mr. Dugger indicated yes; Dugger survived to testify.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10442005\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/628/1369/#p1372\">\n    628 P.2d 1369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1372 (Wyo. 1981) (footnote omitted).

The district court denied the motion because Mr. Parkhurst's claims were not raised in a timely petition for post-conviction relief and were otherwise barred by res judicata.

In his petition, Mr. Parkhurst alleged that his trial counsel, Wyatt Skaggs, was ineffective because: (1) he was operating under a conflict of interest after Mr. Parkhurst's father allegedly threatened Mr. Skaggs' life shortly before trial and, due to the threat, the district court permitted Mr. Skaggs' investigator to be armed during trial; and (2) Mr. Skaggs did not present any defense and erred by failing to request a jury instruction on manslaughter, because Mr. Parkhurst acted out of fear and terror.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also alleged that the State violated his due process rights because he believed the State lost the trial transcripts.
