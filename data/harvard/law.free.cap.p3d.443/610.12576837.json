His convictions for six of those counts depended almost entirely on the testimony of his accomplices, who had entered into a cooperation agreement with the state. Defendant contended that he was entitled to a judgment of acquittal on those counts, because the accomplice testimony had not been corroborated by \"other evidence\" as required by ORS 136.440(1). The Court of Appeals agreed with defendant and reversed his convictions on those counts.\n   <em>\n    State v. Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=288%20Or.%20App.%20807\">\n    288 Or.

On review, we affirm the Court of Appeals. We reverse the relevant portions of the circuit court's judgment of conviction and remand to that court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The legal issue in this case turns on the proper interpretation of ORS 136.440(1). That statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"A conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless it is corroborated by other evidence that tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense. The corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the offense or the circumstances of the commission.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The issue for determination is whether the evidence was legally sufficient, as required by that statute, to support defendant's convictions for several of the charged crimes. Specifically, we must decide whether the accomplice testimony against defendant had been sufficiently corroborated by other evidence tending to connect defendant with those offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, we construe all facts in favor of the state.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v. Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415001\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/672/#p674\">\n    361 Or. 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 674,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415001\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/672/#p674\">\n    399 P.3d 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). The following facts are supported by testimony of defendant's accomplices. However, under ORS 136.440(1), those facts are not legally sufficient to convict defendant unless we conclude that they were sufficiently corroborated by \"other evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant was arrested on April 16, 2014. Defendant, Paul Ropp, and Steven Young had broken into a uniform\n   store and stolen ballistic vests and police uniforms. They left in an SUV and were pursued by police. After a chase, defendant and his accomplices crashed the SUV. Defendant and Young were pulled from the vehicle and arrested. Ropp fled on foot with an assault rifle; he shot a police officer and killed a police dog before being arrested. For purposes of our review, it is undisputed that, two days earlier, the group had been involved in another crime. Defendant, Ropp, and Young had scaled a fence and broken into two Comcast vans, stealing various items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After their arrests, Ropp and Young negotiated cooperation agreements with the state. At defendant's trial, they offered testimony that the group-including defendant-had engaged in a much larger set of crimes. Two of those criminal plans are at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The first criminal plan involved an attempted kidnapping and robbery. According to the accomplices, the group had planned to rob a jewelry store chain. They intended to kidnap the manager of the chain and force him to open safes at various store locations. The group followed the manager on several occasions to learn his habits. Then they broke into an animal shelter hoping to find an injectable sedative to aid in the kidnapping. They did not locate a sedative, but they stole syringes and uniforms. They obtained a van and removed the middle seat, tying zip ties and rope to the seat anchors so they could secure the manager. They planned to wait in a parking deck near the manager's car and grab him after setting off smoke bombs. In the end, the plan fell apart at the last minute-and only after a smoke bomb had been detonated-because a family had entered the parking deck elevator with the manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The second criminal plan was an attempted robbery of a T-Mobile store. The armed group planned to enter the store at closing time and burn the safe open with thermite. The group waited outside the store in an SUV-the one that would be wrecked early the next morning. When a bicyclist arrived at a nearby business, however, the group abandoned the plan and drove away. The accomplices testified that they then went to the uniform store to carry out the burglary that ultimately led to their arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant was charged with 18 counts of various crimes. One count was later dismissed; defendant was convicted on the remaining 17 counts. Of those 17 counts, only six are at issue here. Four of those counts related to the attempted jewelry store robbery and kidnapping, and two counts related to the T-Mobile episode. At the end of the state's case, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal on those six counts. He argued that the only evidence connecting him to those crimes was the testimony of Ropp and Young and that there was insufficient evidence to corroborate their testimony as required by ORS 136.440(1). The trial court denied defendant's motion for judgment of\n   acquittal and convicted him on all of the 17 remaining counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The state argues that the ruling below was correct because the accomplice testimony had been sufficiently corroborated under ORS 136.440(1). It itemizes the following evidence as corroborating the testimony of the accomplices and argues that this evidence supports the trial court's ruling: (1) the SUV itself in which defendant was arrested; (2) firearms (defendant had a pistol on his person, and other weapons had been found in the SUV); (3) walkie-talkies (when Young was arrested in the SUV, he had a walkie talkie on his person); (4) thermite (the SUV contained thermite and magnesium strips that could be used to ignite the thermite); and (5) an animal shelter jacket and syringes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On defendant's appeal to the Court of Appeals, however, that court agreed with defendant.\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=288%20Or.%20App.%20807\">\n    288 Or.

Explaining that the statute had been materially unchanged since it was originally enacted, (citing General Laws of Oregon, Crim Code, ch. XXII, \u00a7 217, p. 478 (Deady 1845-1864)), the court stated that the statute \"reflects the long-standing policy that the testimony of one implicated in the crime is inherently untrustworthy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=288%20Or.%20App.%20807\">\n    288 Or.

The court noted that firearms, syringes, and thermite were lawful items that, in the absence of some reference to the accomplice testimony, did not connect defendant with the charged crimes.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 816,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=407%20P.3d%20946\">\n    407 P.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The animal shelter jacket was proceeds of a crime, but not one of the crimes with which defendant was charged, and the court concluded that it did not\n   <em>\n    independently\n   </em>\n   corroborate the accomplices' testimony about the jewelry store attempted kidnapping (that is, an animal shelter jacket had no self-evident connection to an attempted kidnapping of a jewelry store manager; it had significance only in light of the accomplices' testimony).\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 816-18,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=407%20P.3d%20946\">\n    407 P.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ANALYSIS\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    To aid us in our analysis, we begin with this court's recent decision in\n    <em>\n     State v. Washington\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5881387\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/355/612/\">\n     355 Or. 612\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5881387\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/355/612/\">\n     330 P.3d 596\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     cert. den.\n    </em>\n    , --- U.S. ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12593568,12593569,12593570,12593571,12593572,12593573\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/685/\">\n     135 S.Ct. 685\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=190%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20397\">\n     190 L.Ed.2d 397\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2014). In\n    <em>\n     Washington\n    </em>\n    , we rejected the defendant's argument that\n    ORS 136.440(1) requires the state to prove a degree of corroborating evidence that would be inconsistent with innocence. Before reaching that conclusion, we summarized the requirements of ORS 136.440(1) as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    \"This court has long held that\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    \" '[t]he corroboration need not be of itself adequate to support a conviction *** \"Any corroborative evidence legitimately tending to connect a defendant with the commission of the crime may be sufficient to warrant a conviction, although standing by itself it would be only slight proof of defendant's guilt and entitled to but little consideration, and even though it is not wholly inconsistent with the innocence of the defendant.[\"]'\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    \"\n    <em>\n     State v. Reynolds\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5061125\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/160/445/#p459\">\n     160 Or. 445\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 459,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5061125\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/160/445/#p459\">\n     86 P.2d 413\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1939). Consistently with those principles, the court more recently summarized the requirements of ORS 136.440 as follows:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    \" 'By its terms, ORS 136.440(1) requires only that the corroborating evidence tend to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense, here, aggravated murder. That statute does not require corroboration of a particular\n    <em>\n     theory\n    </em>\n    of the commission of the offense.'\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n    \" 'It is not necessary that the corroborating evidence be direct and positive; it may be circumstantial. Nor is it necessary that there be independent corroborating evidence with respect to every material fact necessary to be established to sustain a conviction for the commission of a crime. Where there is any evidence apart from that of the accomplice tending to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime, the question of whether the accomplice's testimony is corroborated is one for the trier of fact.'\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    \"\n    <em>\n     State v.

To be sure, evidence of a defendant's association with an accomplice at a\n    particular location,\n    <em>\n     by itself\n    </em>\n    , is insufficient to satisfy the corroboration requirement of ORS 136.440.\n    <em>\n     State v.

Other than New York (see\n    365 Or. at 56 n. 6, 443 P.3d at 617 n. 6), all other jurisdictions with accomplice statutes appear to have continued to apply the independent evidence rule.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    In attempting to persuade us that this court was wrong in adopting the independent evidence rule, the state argues that, \"most fundamentally, the 'independent' evidence principle is irreconcilable with the statutory text [of ORS 136.440(1) ].\" We disagree. As we have explained, the\n    <em>\n     Brake\n    </em>\n    court's interpretation of \"other evidence\" in ORS 136.440(1) was consistent with the dictionary meaning of \"other\" in use when the statute was first enacted in 1853.\n    <em>\n     Webster's Dictionary\n    </em>\n    (1828) (\"Not the same; different; not this or these.\"). That construction is also consistent with the\n    <em>\n     Brake\n    </em>\n    court's recognition of the legislative policy behind the statute:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    \"[L]ike the statutes in many other states, [Oregon's accomplice statute] is in effect a legislative declaration that it is dangerous to permit convictions upon the uncorroborated testimony of the accomplice ***.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    <em>\n     Brake\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4832977\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/99/310/\">\n     99 Or. at 313\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4832977\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/99/310/\">\n     195 P. 583\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis omitted). Accordingly, we conclude that the state has not met its substantial burden to persuade us that the independent evidence rule is an incorrect interpretation of ORS 136.440(1).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    In this case, the state has conceded that the corroboration requirement of ORS 136.440(1) is not satisfied under an independent evidence rule. Since the accomplices already knew the details of the crimes, evidence confirming those details does not corroborate that the defendant participated in those crimes.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ORS 136.440(1) (requiring that evidence must \"connect the defendant with the commission of the offense\"; evidence does not sufficiently corroborate accomplice testimony if it \"merely shows the commission of the offense or the circumstances of the commission\");\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Wigmore, 7\n    <em>\n     Evidence\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 2059 at 423-24 (quoting authorities to same effect). Further, given that the items of personal property in question were all in the SUV, the presence of those items merely confirms that the accomplices had attempted the crimes. Ropp and Young admitted committing the T-Mobile attempted crimes and the jewelry store attempted kidnapping, so the presence of the items in the SUV-which Ropp was driving-does not tend to show that defendant also participated in those crimes. Without reference to the accomplice testimony, the available evidence does not \"connect\n    <em>\n     the defendant\n    </em>\n    with the commission of\" either the attempted jewelry store robbery and kidnapping or the attempted T-Mobile robbery. ORS 136.440(1) (emphasis added). The trial court accordingly erred in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on those counts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. The judgment of conviction of the circuit court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-64\">\n     For ease of reference, we refer to that requirement as the \"independent evidence rule.\"\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-65\">\n     At common law, the testimony of an accomplice-even if not corroborated-could be sufficient to support a criminal conviction if the evidence satisfied the standard of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n     <em>\n      State v. Brake\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4832977\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/99/310/\">\n      99 Or. 310\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 313,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4832977\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/99/310/\">\n      195 P. 583\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (1921). The corroboration of accomplice testimony \"was widely understood (except by a few courts) as amounting to no rule of evidence, but merely to a\n     <em>\n      counsel of caution\n     </em>\n     given by the judge to the jury.\"\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     John Henry Wigmore, 7\n     <em>\n      Evidence in Trials at Common Law\n     </em>\n     \u00a7 2056, 408 (James H.
