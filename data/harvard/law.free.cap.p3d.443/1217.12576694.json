The court of appeals held that it had limited appellate jurisdiction over this matter and that the district court's orders regarding child support and parent-time should be upheld. We agree and now affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Trial and Amended Divorce Decree\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b62 Kristen Pulham and William Kirsling were married in September 2008. In November 2008, Pulham gave birth to the couple's only child (Child). In March 2010, Pulham filed a petition for divorce. In June 2012, the district court entered a bifurcated decree of divorce, reserving issues such as custody and child support for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 The district court held a bench trial in June 2014 and entered detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law that are reflected in an amended divorce decree issued November 4, 2014 (the Amended Decree). Relevant to this appeal are the issues of custody and child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 Regarding custody, the district court found that Pulham had been Child's primary caregiver since birth and was acting as a full-time caregiver in her home in Tooele, where she lived with her new husband. It also found that Kirsling had resided in a number of places since the divorce, including Taylorsville, Brigham City, and Phoenix. Kirsling requested the district court to order that Child be enrolled at a school near his home in Taylorsville for three years and then Child's enrollment should be shifted to a school near Pulham's home in Tooele. The district court considered this arrangement impractical and unworkable, noting that this plan would require Child to spend a considerable amount of time commuting by car.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court also noted that Kirsling's plan would require Child to go through an unnecessary adjustment by switching schools and therefore his plan was not in the best interests of the child. Accordingly, the district court awarded Pulham and Kirsling joint legal and physical custody, but designated Pulham as Child's primary caretaker and Pulham's home as Child's primary residence. Kirsling was awarded parent-time with Child that amounted to approximately forty percent of the possible nights per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 With respect to child support, the district court found that the parties had stipulated to Pulham's income for child support purposes at $ 30 per month and Kirsling's income for child support purposes at $ 4,580 per month. Accordingly, the district court ordered Kirsling to pay Pulham $ 548 per month for child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Motion for a New Trial and First Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b66 Kirsling moved for a new trial pursuant to Utah Rule of Civil Procedure 59, claiming: (1) accident or surprise under rule 59(a)(3) ; (2) newly discovered material evidence under rule 59(a)(4) ; (3) insufficiency of the evidence under rule 59(a)(6) ; and (4) error in law under rule 59(a)(7). As to accident and surprise, Kirsling argued that he expected the\n   trial to be focused on past events, but the district court's focus on going forward was a surprise that ordinary prudence could not have guarded against. As to newly discovered evidence, Kirsling stated that he was able to locate a copy of a money order that Pulham had denied receiving at trial and he was now able to prove that Pulham had cashed the money order. As to insufficiency of the evidence, Kirsling argued that the district court erred in not imputing income to Pulham pursuant to Utah Code section 78B-12-203, that the parties did not stipulate to any imputation of income but the district court nonetheless imputed $ 30 per month income to Pulham based on a supposed stipulation, and that the district court did not provide an explanation for a number of rulings on parent-time and miscellaneous fees. Finally, as to error in law, Kirsling argued that the district court was required to provide a detailed explanation as to why it had not followed the recommendations of a custody evaluator and that the district court did not show why Pulham's income imputation was not calculated pursuant to Utah Code section 78B-12-203.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 On June 17, 2015, the district court entered an order denying Kirsling's motion for a new trial. With respect to accident or surprise, the district court noted that, while the court had advised the parties that their time would be best spent focusing on issues going forward, the court did not prevent the parties from discussing past events. Furthermore, the parties did spend a significant amount of the trial focused on past events. With respect to newly discovered evidence, the district court ruled that Kirsling had failed to establish whether and why he was unable to obtain the copy of the money order before trial. With respect to insufficiency of the evidence, the district court explained that many of Kirsling's claims confused conclusions of the court with evidence presented to the court. In other words, Kirsling's insufficiency of evidence arguments were actually complaints about the district court's reasoning and application of facts to law-not complaints regarding the sufficiency of the underlying evidence. Finally, with respect to error in law, the district court held that any alleged errors complained of by Kirsling did not rise to errors of law and that it was within the court's discretion to issue the order it did regarding custody, parent-time, and child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 On July 17, 2015, Kirsling filed a notice of appeal from the district court's order denying his motion for a new trial (the First Appeal) stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Kirsling appeals to the Utah Court of Appeals the final Decree of Divorce ... entered in this matter on June 17, 2015. The Appeal is taken from such parts of the judgment as follow[s]:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (1) Paragraph 3 regarding child support calculation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (2) Paragraph 4 wherein Mr. Kirsling was ordered to pay $ 1,791.00 in child support and ORS fees and $ 2,512.00 in child care expenses; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (3) Paragraph 8 wherein all charges of Contempt are dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Petition to Modify the Amended Decree and Second Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b69 On the same day that he filed his notice of appeal in the First Appeal, Kirsling filed a petition to modify the Amended Decree. In that motion, Kirsling argued that a \"significant change of circumstances\" had occurred as a result of his relocation to Stansbury Park, which is a short drive from Pulham's home in Tooele. Kirsling claimed that this change entitled him to a modification of his parent-time because the sizable distance between Tooele and Taylorsville-acknowledged by the district court in the denial of his original custody request-was no longer an issue. The petition also noted that Kirsling had filed the First Appeal \"on three sections of the Decree of Divorce\" but that \"none of these sections pertain to or affect\" the petition to modify the Amended Decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b610 In an order dated February 25, 2016, the district court denied Kirsling's petition to modify the Amended Decree. The district court noted that Kirsling had historically been migratory in nature and expressed concern that his stop in Stansbury Park would be similarly brief. Additionally, the district court stated that it was concerned that Kirsling made the move for the sole purpose of\n   \"creat[ing] a change of circumstances\" in an effort to modify the Amended Decree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In denying the petition, the district court stated that \"the 'change of circumstances' threshold is high\" and concluded that Kirsling's move to Stansbury Park, in and of itself, was \"wholly insufficient to create a sufficient change in circumstances to warrant reconsideration\" of the Amended Decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b611 On March 28, 2016, Kirsling filed a notice of appeal regarding the district court's denial of his petition to modify the Amended Decree (the Second Appeal).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Court of Appeals Opinion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b612 The court of appeals consolidated the First Appeal and Second Appeal for purposes of its opinion. It affirmed the district court's orders in both appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b613 With respect to the First Appeal, the court of appeals identified a threshold question regarding the scope of the appeal: whether Kirsling had limited the issues on appeal to the three sections of the Amended Decree that he identified in the notice of appeal. Kirsling argued that the reference to specific sections of the Amended Decree did not waive his right to appeal the entire order denying his motion for a new trial. The court of appeals disagreed, holding that Kirsling's notice of appeal manifested an intent to appeal the district court's order only as to the three sections of the Amended Decree mentioned in the notice of appeal. Accordingly, the court of appeals limited its jurisdiction in the First Appeal to those three issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b614 On the issue of child support, the court of appeals noted that the district court may have erred in finding that Pulham had a monthly income of $ 30 based on a seemingly nonexistent stipulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the court of appeals concluded that, even if this was error, no reversal was required because that alleged error most likely benefited Kirsling by attributing to Pulham income that she did not in fact have. In other words, the alleged error likely resulted in Kirsling's monthly child support obligations being lowered. The court of appeals also rejected Kirsling's argument that the district court erred in not imputing income to Pulham under Utah Code section 78B-12-203. The court of appeals noted that imputation of income is discretionary and that the record was devoid of any of the information necessary for an imputation of income. Accordingly, the court of appeals held that it could not conclude the district court had committed legal error in not imputing income to Pulham.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b615 Regarding child care expenses, the court of appeals held that Kirsling's arguments failed because he did not address the district court's reasoning for denying his motion. Specifically, Kirsling did not provide evidentiary support for his assertion that he could not obtain certain evidence prior to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b616 With respect to the Second Appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the district court's denial of Kirsling's petition to modify the Amended Decree. The court of appeals found that the district court did not apply a \"substantial change of material circumstances\" standard in denying Kirsling's petition. Additionally, the court of appeals noted that the district court considered the merits of Kirsling's petition rather than rejecting Kirsling's petition on an application of a standard. Furthermore, the court of appeals held that Kirsling's argument regarding the correct\n   standard to use failed for lack of preservation. Because Kirsling never identified the standard under which his petition should be reviewed-let alone a standard less strict than substantial change of material circumstances-the court of appeals held that he could not now argue that the district court applied the wrong standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b617 We exercise jurisdiction under Utah Code section 78A-3-102(3)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b618 \"On certiorari, we review for correctness the decision of the court of appeals ....\"\n   <em>\n    Baumann v.

First, he argues that the court of appeals erred by construing his notice of appeal to limit the scope of the court of appeals' appellate jurisdiction in the First Appeal. Second, he argues that the court of appeals erred in affirming the district court's order regarding his child support obligations. And finally, he argues that the court of appeals erred in affirming the district court's order denying his petition to modify the Amended Decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b621 We affirm the court of appeals on all three counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   I. KIRSLING'S NOTICE OF APPEAL LIMITS THE SCOPE OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b622 Kirsling's first alleged point of error is that the court of appeals erred in limiting the scope of the First Appeal to the three issues specifically listed in his notice of appeal. Kirsling argues that his notice of appeal vested the court of appeals with appellate jurisdiction over the Amended Decree and the order denying his motion for a new trial in their entirety. We disagree and affirm the court of appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b623 Utah Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(d) provides in relevant part that \"[t]he notice of appeal ... shall designate the judgment or order, or part thereof, appealed from.\" We have held that \" rule 3(d) 's requirement is jurisdictional.\"\n   <em>\n    Jensen v.

In context, then, the reference to the \"final Decree of Divorce\" manifests an intent to appeal from the Amended Decree and the reference to the order \"entered in this matter on June 17, 2015\" manifests an intent to appeal from the related order denying Kirsling's motion for a new trial. Because Kirsling's notice of appeal sufficiently identifies both the Amended Decree and the related order denying his motion for a new trial, we agree with the court of appeals that those are \"the judgment[s] or order[s] ... appealed from.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570504\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/427/261/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alterations in original) (quoting UTAH R.

But this is not what Kirsling's notice of appeal says. Instead, the notice of appeal continues, \"The Appeal is taken from such parts of the judgment as follow[s]:\" and then lists three specific paragraphs from the Amended Decree. In other words, Kirsling's notice of appeal identifies these three paragraphs of the Amended Decree as \"the part[s] thereof\" appealed from. UTAH R. APP. P. 3(d). The court of appeals held that \"[b]y expressly identifying the parts of the trial court's ruling from which the appeal was taken, Kirsling manifested an intent not to appeal the other parts of the trial court's Amended Decree and its related order denying his post-trial motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Pulham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%2065\">\n    2018 UT App 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570504\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/427/261/\">\n    427 P.3d 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b626 On certiorari, Kirsling argues that because his notice of appeal stated an intent to appeal from \"the final Decree of Divorce ... entered in this matter on June 17, 2015,\" it conferred appellate jurisdiction on the court of appeals as to the Amended Decree and the order denying his motion for a new trial in their entirety. Stated differently, Kirsling contends that his reference to the Amended Decree and the order denying his motion for a new trial satisfied rule 3(d) 's requirement that a notice of appeal \"designate the judgment or order ... appealed from\" and that his subsequent reference to three specific issues in the Amended Decree did not limit appellate jurisdiction to those issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b627 We read Kirsling's notice of appeal differently. His notice of appeal does reference the Amended Decree and the related order denying his motion for new trial. But, in context, they are referenced only to set up the rest of the notice of appeal. The initial reference to the Amended Decree and the order denying his motion for new trial is a necessary antecedent to the next sentence: \"The Appeal is taken from such parts of the judgment as follow[s]: ....\" Indeed, it would be impossible to specify the parts of a judgment from which an appeal is being taken without first identifying the judgment itself. This is exactly what Kirsling's notice of appeal does. It identifies the Amended Decree and the related order denying his motion for a new trial as the relevant judgment and then proceeds to identify the specific parts of that judgment that Kirsling intended to appeal from. We therefore agree with the court of appeals' conclusion that Kirsling's notice of appeal demonstrates a clear intent to appeal only from the three specific portions of the Amended Decree and that appellate jurisdiction is accordingly limited to those three issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b628 We note that this construction of the notice of appeal is consistent both with our own precedent and the precedent of the federal circuit courts, whose notice of appeal requirements are substantially similar to those of rule 3(d).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. APP. P. 3(c)(1)(B) (\"The notice of appeal must ... designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed ....\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b629 As we stated in\n   <em>\n    Nunley\n   </em>\n   , \"the object of a notice of appeal is to advise the opposite party that an appeal has been taken from a specific judgment in a particular case.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8862177\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah-2d/15/126/\">\n    388 P.2d at 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Kirsling's notice of appeal advised Pulham that he was appealing from the three specific portions of the Amended Decree related to child support, ORS fees, and contempt. Nothing in the notice of appeal indicates an intent to appeal from any other portions of the Amended Decree or the related order denying Kirsling's motion for a\n   new trial such as the portions addressing child custody and parent-time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Kirsling wanted to appeal those other portions he could have (1) indicated a specific intent to appeal those portions in his notice of appeal or (2) simply indicated that he was appealing from the Amended Decree and the related order denying his motion for a new trial without specifying any particular portions of the judgment or order. To read Kirsling's notice of appeal as demonstrating an intent to appeal the Amended Decree or the related order denying his motion for a new trial would be to disregard the plain language of the notice of appeal and would run contrary to our long-held conviction that the notice of appeal must provide the opposing party with notice of what is being appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b630 This result also tracks the general approach of the federal circuit courts, which \"appear to apply the\n   <em>\n    expressio unius\n   </em>\n   principle, reasoning that a notice of appeal that specifies only part of a final judgment ... will not suffice to appeal other parts of the judgment (or other orders merged therein).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Charles Alan Wright et al., 16A FEDERAL PRACTICE &amp; PROCEDURE JURISDICTION \u00a7 3949.4 (4th ed. 2019) (citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Finch v.

THE COURT OF APPEALS CORRECTLY UPHELD THE DISTRICT COURT'S ORDER REGARDING CHILD SUPPORT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b632 Having established that Kirsling's notice of appeal limits appellate jurisdiction over the First Appeal, we now turn to the issue of whether the court of appeals erred in affirming the district court's order regarding child support. Kirsling alleges that the court of appeals' error was twofold. First, Kirsling contends that he is entitled to a new trial under rule 59(a)(6) because there was insufficient evidence to support the district court's\n   child support calculations. Specifically, Kirsling takes issue with the fact that the district court found that the parties stipulated as to Pulham's monthly income, even though no such stipulation seems to exist. Second, Kirsling contends that he is entitled to a new trial under rule 59(a)(7) because the trial court did not impute income to Pulham pursuant to Utah Code section 78B-12-203. The court of appeals held that Kirsling was not entitled to a new trial based on these alleged errors. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    A. Any Alleged Error Related to Pulham's Monthly Income Was Harmless\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b633 The district court found that, for child support purposes, Pulham's monthly income was $ 30 per month. In the Amended Decree, the district court stated that this figure originated in a stipulation between the parties. On appeal, neither party is able to identify where the district court came up with the $ 30 per month figure. In other words, it appears that no such stipulation exists in the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kirsling argues that this finding was in error and that he is therefore entitled to a new trial based on insufficiency of the evidence related to the district court's child support calculation. The court of appeals held that, even if the district court erred in finding that the parties stipulated to Pulham's monthly income, any such error would not merit reversal.

At trial, Pulham testified that she was unemployed and was acting as a full-time stay-at-home parent. When asked why she stopped working in favor of becoming a stay-at-home parent, Pulham responded that she was \"barely making anything\" once she subtracted child care expenses from her income and that \"it just wasn't enough to be worth working.\" Additionally, Kirsling's counsel never challenged Pulham's testimony regarding her employment status and income on cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b637 The import of Pulham's trial testimony is that, if the district court erred in finding that Pulham had a monthly income of $ 30, the error most likely benefited Kirsling. Given the evidence adduced at trial, it seems the most probable alternative outcome is that the\n   district court would have found that Pulham had no income at all.

Indeed, Kirsling's briefing is completely devoid of any explanation of how he was harmed by the district court's alleged error. Instead, Kirsling's briefing simply states his belief that it was somehow improper for the court of appeals to find that any error did not merit reversal. In failing to proffer any real explanation for his belief that the court of appeals wrongly decided this issue, Kirsling has not demonstrated \"that there is a reasonable likelihood that ... there would have been a result more favorable to\" him if the district court had not found Pulham to have a monthly income of $ 30.\n   <em>\n    Childs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11637181\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/972/425/#p431\">\n    972 P.2d at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b639 Accordingly, we hold that, even if it was error for the district court to find that the parties stipulated to a monthly income of $ 30 for Pulham, any such error was harmless and Kirsling is not entitled to a new trial on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    B.

Finally, Utah Code section 78B-12-203(8)(d)(i) provides that income may not be imputed if \"the reasonable costs of child care for the parents' minor children approach or equal the amount of income the custodial parent can earn\" and this condition \"is not of a temporary nature.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b642 In his motion for a new trial, and on appeal, Kirsling claims that he is entitled to a new trial on this issue because the Amended Decree does not explain why Pulham's income was not calculated pursuant to section 203. But this argument misses the point. Imputation of income is not a mandatory exercise that every district court must undertake in determining child support obligations. Quite the opposite. Section 203 makes clear that imputation is optional, and even places restrictions on when imputation can take place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-12-203(8)(a) (\"Income\n   <em>\n    may not\n   </em>\n   be imputed to a parent\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   ... in contested cases, a hearing is held and the judge ... enters\n   findings of fact as to the evidentiary basis for the imputation.\" (emphases added)). In this case, Kirsling never requested imputation and so no evidentiary hearing was held. Indeed, it would have been error for the court to impute income to Pulham pursuant to section 203 in the absence of an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b643 In addition to the fact that it would have been error for the court to impute income to Pulham in the absence of an evidentiary hearing, the lack of an evidentiary hearing left a substantial void in the record. As the court of appeals pointed out, the record is almost entirely devoid of the requisite evidence regarding Pulham's \"employment potential and probable earnings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6991206\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/242/787/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-12-203(8)(b).

Kirsling's petition states that \"[a] significant change of circumstances has occurred\" and in a response to Pulham's motion to dismiss the petition, Kirsling cited a portion of the Utah Courts website that states \"Examples of material and substantial changes after the controlling custody order may include that ... the parents have moved to new communities ....\" But because we conclude that Kirsling did not preserve this issue, we need not determine whether Kirsling actually invited any error in the district court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
