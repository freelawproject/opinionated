On October 10, 2017, the Hearing Officer issued his Hearing Officer Decision and Notice of Issuance of Administrative Decision, which found that Bright was subjected to racial discrimination in his employment by KB.

In support of this contention, KB essentially asks this Court to believe the testimony of its witnesses over that of Bright's witnesses. The basic facts of this case are that Bright testified that Gustafson called him a \"nigger\" on four separate occasions during his employment at KB, Gustafson testified that he did not, and the other witnesses generally testified that they did not hear it.

Finding of Fact No. 23 relatedly concerns Misty Franklin's testimony\n   that she did not remember any incidents of Gustafson using the \"N-word.\" Substantial credible evidence exists to support each of these Findings of Fact as noted by the District Court in its Order.

Findings of Fact Nos. 11-17 and 23 are not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b611 Finding of Fact No. 18 concerns Gustafson admitting to using the \"N-word\" at work in 2012, when speaking with William Sanders, an African American man who was then employed by KB. Finding of Fact No. 18 further notes that Gustafson had been accused of being a racist by Kevin Beck's father, Dave Beck, when he was the owner of the company. KB claims that this Finding of Fact is clearly erroneous because Dave Beck was no longer an owner of the company when Dave Beck called Gustafson a racist, however Gustafson testified that he was accused by Dave Beck of being a racist \"during [his] employment at KB Enterprises\" and \"after the November 30th incident.\" While Dave Beck was no longer the owner of KB in 2015, the testimony of Gustafson does not preclude that Dave Beck did call Gustafson a racist during a period when he was the owner of the company. Dave Beck founded KB, was an owner for a period of time, and eventually gave control to Kevin Beck. Dave Beck and Kevin Beck had multiple meetings with Gustafson over the years regarding Gustafson's racist statements. Even after ceding control of KB to Kevin Beck, Dave Beck maintained apparent authority at the company-he could call all-hands employee meetings and was involved in the meetings with Kevin Beck and Gustafson regarding Gustafson's use of the \"N-word\" at work. Finding of Fact No. 18 is not clearly erroneous, because even though there is not a preponderance of the evidence that Dave Beck called Gustafson a racist while he was the owner of KB, substantial evidence is found in the record to support the Hearing Officer's conclusion that he did.\n   <em>\n    Peretti\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b612 Finding of Fact No. 19 concerns Bright's admitted use of the term \"nigga\" as a term of endearment with other African American employees at work. KB claims that Bright can therefore not claim to be offended when his direct supervisor, who is not an African American, calls him a \"nigger.\" This argument is nonsensical and ignores years of cultural history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daniel v.

There is a clear difference between African Americans using the term \"nigga\" amongst one another and a non-African American calling an African American man a \"nigger.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bailey v.

The Hearing Officer found that at the time of each offer, Gustafson was still employed at KB. Substantial evidence supports this Finding of Fact, as Gustafson testified that he did not leave his job at KB until the end of June, while both of KB's offers to Bright were made in May. Bright obtained employment prior to the second offer, at an admittedly lower wage than he made at KB, but it is reasonable for him to reject KB's offers of reemployment at a company which still employs a supervisor who had repeatedly branded him with racial slurs. KB could toll the accrual of damages by offering\n   Bright his job without conditions attached.\n   <em>\n    Martinell v. Montana Power Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4559256\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/268/292/#p323\">\n    268 Mont. 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 323,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4559256\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/268/292/#p323\">\n    886 P.2d 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 440 (1994). It did not do so in this case by offering Bright a job being supervised by Gustafson. KB's offer of reemployment to Bright was therefore conditioned on Bright possibly being subject to even more racial abuse. Findings of Fact Nos. 26 and 35 are not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b614 Finding of Fact No. 32 concerns Bright being hurt by being called a \"nigger\" by Gustafson. Bright testified to how these experiences hurt him. \"The experience of being called 'nigger,' 'spic,' 'Jap,' or 'kike' is like receiving a slap in the face. The injury is instantaneous.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is abundantly clear that throughout the history of the United States, the term \"nigger\" has been used as a vicious racial slur to degrade and demean African Americans. The Hearing Officer's Finding of Fact No. 32 that Bright was hurt by this experience is supported by substantial evidence and not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b615 Finding of Fact No. 33 concerns Kevin Beck being aware of Gustafson's racist conduct toward Bright. Bright reported that Gustafson was using \"the (N) word\" in a written statement to KB. KB admits that it received the statement. Kevin Beck was therefore aware of Bright's allegations and did nothing to protect Bright from\n   Gustafson's racist abuse. Finding of Fact No. 33 is not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b616 KB asserts that Finding of Fact No. 20 regarding Josh Blaz witnessing Gustafson using the \"N-word\" toward Bright is clearly erroneous because not all of Blaz's testimony at the hearing was truthful. \"The jury is to be instructed by the court on all proper occasions that ... a witness false in one part of the witness's testimony is to be distrusted in others[.]\" Section 26-1-303(3), MCA. KB claims that the Hearing Officer should have disregarded Blaz's testimony due to this statute. Section 26-1-303, MCA, is, by its plain language, a jury instruction statute and therefore irrelevant to the proceedings before the Hearing Officer in this case. The Hearing Officer is entitled to judge witness credibility and \"the findings of the hearing examiner, especially as to witness credibility, are ... entitled to great deference.\"\n   <em>\n    Benjamin\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 37. Finding of Fact No. 20 is not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b617 Finding of Fact No. 34 concerns the Hearing Officer's conclusion that the racial harassment of Bright was sufficiently severe so as to alter the conditions of Bright's employment. There is no precise test to determine whether instances of discriminatory conduct have created a work environment that it so hostile or abusive that it alters the conditions of an employee's employment-each case must be judged by looking at all the circumstances from the perspective of a reasonable person.\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

There is simply no question that the use of the word \"nigger\" by a supervisor toward an African American employee objectively creates a hostile and abusive working environment that alters the conditions of that employee's employment. Kevin Beck, the owner of KB, testified to as much during the HRB hearing.

Specifically, Finding of Fact No. 41 awarded Bright $ 20,000.00 for emotional distress. KB claims that this award is excessive and out of line with previous cases, and cites several decisions with lower damages awards in its briefing-though quite notably none where a plaintiff was subjected to the slur used by Gustafson\n   in this case.

The Ninth Circuit noted \"[t]hat sum would appear to be the minimum that finds support in recent cases and takes into account inflation, the purpose of [ 42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1982, and other factors[,]\" and stated that the district court \"may, of course, award more after reviewing the authorities cited above.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1834647\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/13/1351/\">\n    13 F.3d at 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Taking inflation into account, as the Ninth Circuit did in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , and noting that the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   were subjected to a single instance of racial abuse from a prospective landlord, rather than multiple instances of racial abuse by a direct supervisor, we do not find the Hearing Officer's emotional distress award of $ 20,000.00 to be excessive. Substantial evidence supports the emotional distress award in Findings of Fact Nos. 36 and 41 and those findings are not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b619 The Hearing Officer's Findings of Fact were not clearly erroneous, did not misapprehend the effect of evidence, and this Court's review of the entire record does not convince us that a mistake has been made. The District Court correctly affirmed the HRC's Final Agency Decision and dismissed KB's petition for judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b620 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   LAURIE McKINNON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   DIRK M.
