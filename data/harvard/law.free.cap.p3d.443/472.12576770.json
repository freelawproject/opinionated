They paid $ 5,512 down and financed the balance of $ 63,388, to be paid in monthly installments of $ 701 for a period of fifteen years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 The Agreement gave the Clauses a security interest in the mobile home. The Agreement included the following provision regarding potential default by the Christmans:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Default\n   </strong>\n   . If [the Christmans] fail[ ] to perform any of the covenants or promises called for hereunder such failure shall, at the election of [the Clauses] constitute a default in the performance of this agreement. If [the Christmans] fail[ ] to cure any such default within [ ] THIRTY (30) days after written notice thereof to [the Christmans], [the Clauses] may, without further notice or period of grace, declare the entire unpaid balance of the purchase price, principal and accrued interest, immediately due and payable. Upon nonpayment thereof, after the same shall become due and payable, [the Clauses] may as an alternative to any other remedy provide [sic] at law or equity, terminate this agreement and retain all payments made as liquidated damages for breach of this agreement and rent for the use of the property. [The Christmans] and [the Clauses] agree that THIRTY (30) days notice is a reasonable time period for notice of termination of this agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 From 2009-2015, the Christmans continually missed payments on their mobile home, only to then make large lump sum payments to bring the loan current. The Clauses made accommodations, including adjusting the loan in November 2014 to put the delinquent amount at the end of the loan, but the Christmans again fell behind on payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 21, 2015, the Clauses sent the Christmans a Notice of Default. On September 18, 2015, the Christmans paid $ 2,900 in an attempt to become current. Four days later, the Clauses sent a notice that they were invoking the acceleration clause in the default provision of the Agreement and demanded the outstanding balance on the Agreement plus notice fees, a total of $ 57,397.64, within thirty days. In December 2015, after receiving the acceleration notice, the Christmans moved out of the mobile home and voluntarily returned it to the Clauses. At that point, the Christmans owed a balance of $ 54,205.54. The Clauses testified they then spent $ 3,273.83 refurbishing and repairing the mobile home. Two months later, the Clauses sold the mobile home to a new buyer for $ 59,800.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 On January 18, 2017, the Christmans brought suit against the Clauses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 14, 2017, the Christmans filed an amended complaint, alleging that the Clauses violated provisions of Article 9A of Montana's adopted version of the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.). The Christmans alleged that the Clauses failed to resell the mobile home in a commercially reasonable manner as required by \u00a7 30-9A-625(4), MCA. The Christmans sought $ 69,672 in damages under \u00a7 30-9A-625(3)(b), MCA : the time price differential plus ten percent of the cash price. Alternatively, Christmans alleged that they were entitled to any surplus realized for the resale of the mobile home pursuant to \u00a7 30-9A-615(4)(a), MCA. The Christmans asserted they owed a balance of $ 17,169.50, and that the Clauses resold the mobile home for $ 59,800, amounting to a surplus of $ 42,630.50. The Christmans also contended that the Clauses were barred from collecting any late fees, finance charges or collection costs on the Agreement because the Agreement violated various provisions of Montana's Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 On June 13, 2017, the Christmans moved for summary judgment. On March 9, 2018, the District Court denied the Christmans' Motion. The District Court held there were material facts in dispute as to both the application of the U.C.C. to the Agreement and whether the Christmans were equitably estopped from asserting their claims against the Clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 On March 26-28, 2018, the District Court presided over a jury trial. On March 28, 2018, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the\n   Clauses. The jury unanimously agreed that the Clauses proved that the Agreement terminated when the Christmans moved out of the mobile home in December 2015. Following the jury verdict, the District Court entered a Final Judgment in which it ordered that the Christmans' action against the Clauses be dismissed on the merits, and that the Christmans pay the Clauses' costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 On May 2, 2018, the Christmans moved for a new trial pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59(a)(1)(A).

The District Court concluded that the Christmans voluntarily abandoned their mobile home in December 2015 and gave every indication they were cancelling the Agreement and walking away from the mobile home and their payment obligations. Thus, the U.C.C. no longer governed the parties' relationship. The District Court further concluded that even if Article 9 of the U.C.C. applied to bar the parties from terminating the Agreement, there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether equitable estoppel precluded the Christmans' claims. Accordingly, the District Court could not grant summary judgment to the Christmans on the issue of the Clauses' liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b622 The Christmans argue the material facts of this case are not in dispute, and they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. They contend that Article 9 of the U.C.C. establishes set procedures that must be followed once a secured party takes possession of the collateral that secures a debt, and that the undisputed facts demonstrate that the Clauses failed to follow those procedures. The Christmans contend that the Clauses failed to give proper notice and to account for any surplus as required by the U.C.C. The Christmans contend that they never waived any rights, either orally or in writing, regarding the mobile home. Finally, the Christmans argue that the Clauses may not assert the defense of equitable estoppel, and that the District Court was wrong when it permitted the Clauses to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b623 The Clauses counter that the District Court properly denied the\n   Christmans' Motion for Summary Judgment in light of the disputed issues of material fact. The Clauses argue that the Christmans agreed to terminate the Agreement, vacated the mobile home, and left it to the Clauses. This series of events served to absolve the Christmans of any further obligation they had to pay under the Agreement and transferred their rights in the mobile home back to the Clauses in exchange for discharging the Clauses' contractual obligations to them. The Clauses argue that once the Christmans terminated the Agreement, the security interest the Clauses had in the mobile home dissolved, and the Agreement was no longer governed by Article 9 of the U.C.C. The Clauses contend that even if Article 9 continued to govern the parties' relationship, the Clauses would be entitled to recover a deficiency from the Christmans, and the Christmans would not be entitled to any surplus or damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b624 Finally, the Clauses argue the District Court properly denied the Christmans' Motion for Summary Judgment on the grounds that disputed issues of material fact existed regarding whether the Christmans were equitably estopped from asserting their claims. The Clauses contend they provided substantial evidence to establish all six elements of equitable estoppel, and the District Court correctly concluded there were disputed material issues not proper for resolution on a motion for summary judgment. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b625 There is no dispute that when the parties entered into the Agreement for the sale of the mobile home, the Agreement was governed by Article 9 of the U.C.C. There is also no dispute that the Clauses did not provide notice of the resale of the collateral or account to the Christmans for any potential surplus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 30-9A-611, -616, -608(1)(d), -615, MCA. The Christmans were\n   in default and vacated because they were unable to pay the more than $ 50,000 due upon invocation of the acceleration clause. A voluntary repossession indicates a debtor has defaulted, but it does not mean a debtor waived all post-default rights and remedies under the U.C.C. or abandoned interest in any potential surplus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-9A-602, MCA. Regardless of whether the Clauses voluntary repossessed the mobile home after the Christmans vacated the premises, notice to the Christmans was still required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Westmont Tractor Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2609841\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/224/516/#p523\">\n    224 Mont. at 523-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2609841\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/224/516/#p523\">\n    731 P.2d at 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b626 The Christmans' situation is even more attenuated than that of the debtors in\n   <em>\n    Kapor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hutzenbiler\n   </em>\n   who signed releases that purportedly waived U.C.C. applicability. The protections and obligations under the U.C.C. still governed the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kapor\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14 ;\n   <em>\n    Hutzenbiler\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. The Clauses did not provide notice of the\n   resale of the mobile home as required by \u00a7 30-9A-611, MCA. The Clauses were obligated to give notice to the Christmans of how they intended to dispose of the mobile home, and they were required to account to the Christmans for any surplus realized from the sale of the collateral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 30-9A-611, -624, MCA. Although the Christmans theoretically could have waived their right to notice prior to the resale of the collateral, to legitimately do so, any waiver of the notice would have had to take the form of an authenticated writing signed after default.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-9A-624, MCA. In this case, no notice was sent, no authenticated writing was signed, and, consequently, there was no waiver of the right to notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30-9A-624, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b627 There were no genuine issues of material fact as to the Clauses' U.C.C. violations, and the Christmans were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on that issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yorlum Props. Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12 ; M. R. Civ. P. 56. Accordingly, the District Court erred in denying the Christmans' Motion for Summary Judgment as it pertained to the continued application of the U.C.C. to the Christmans' claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McClue\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8 ;\n   <em>\n    Yorlum Props. Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b628 Finally, the Christmans also argue that the Clauses may not assert the defense of equitable estoppel, and that the District Court was wrong when it concluded the Clauses were permitted to do so. We recently concluded that \"the doctrine of equitable estoppel may apply to cases governed by the U.C.C. unless displaced by specific U.C.C. provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Kapor\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 32. The Christmans argue that equitable estoppel cannot apply here for four reasons: (1) the Clauses do not have clean hands; (2) public policy dictates that equitable estoppel not apply; (3) estoppel is not available to defeat U.C.C. remedies; and (4) the Clauses' argument of equitable estoppel is disingenuous. The Christmans' argument does not assert any U.C.C. provisions in Article 9 relevant to this case that may displace equitable estoppel. Thus, although the District Court erred by holding that the U.C.C. did not apply to the Christmans' claims, it correctly held that the Clauses may assert equitable estoppel as it may pertain to those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b629 The District Court erred when it denied the Christmans' Motion for Summary Judgment on the grounds that Article 9 no longer applied to the Agreement. We reverse and remand this case to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   LAURIE McKINNON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   BETH BAKER, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   DIRK M.

Section 30-9A-102(1)(w), MCA, defines a \"consumer good\" as \"goods that are used or bought for use primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\" The Christmans testified that they resided in the mobile home and did not use it to conduct any business or rent any portion of it.
