We affirm the court's ruling as to ownership of the existing structures and transmission lines, but we reverse the ruling as to valuation date. Under the right-of-way clause of Article 2, Section 17 of the Arizona Constitution, a private corporation with statutory eminent domain authority cannot effect a taking (which establishes the valuation date) by simply occupying property. Instead, the taking occurs only after the jury determines damages and the private corporation pays full compensation. Because the superior court chose a pre-taking valuation date, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 On May 15, 1981, the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\"), granted a 30-year right of way to Arizona Electric Power Cooperative, Inc., across public lands in Mohave County for use as an easement for 69kV electric transmission lines. Both 69kV and 230kV transmission lines were built within the right of way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 By 1990, the BLM had transferred title to the property subject to the right of way into private hands. DJL 2007 LLC, DJL Enterprises LLC, East Coast Investor Group 535, LLC, Mark and Carol Knorr, Silver Creek Land Co., Michael Suda, and Donald Suda (collectively, \"Landowners\") are the current owners of the relevant parcels. Southwest Transmission Cooperative, Inc.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as a successor in interest, obtained Arizona Electric Power's interest in the right of way in the early 2000s, and Southwest Transmission sold the 69kV line to Mohave Electric Cooperative, Inc., a few years later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 The BLM right-of-way grant expired on May 14, 2011. But Southwest Transmission and Mohave Electric continued to operate the transmission lines thereafter, and in January 2013, Landowners sent Southwest Transmission a letter alleging that it was trespassing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Southwest Transmission is a nonprofit electric generation and transmission cooperative corporation under Title 10, Chapter 19, Article 4 of the Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") and, as such, has statutory authority to exercise the power of eminent domain for purposes of maintaining or operating electric transmission lines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 10-2127(A)(11) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1111(10). Accordingly, in January 2014, Southwest Transmission filed these eminent domain actions to condemn rights of way for the transmission lines. Mohave Electric intervened as the owner of one of the transmission lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 The superior court ruled that Southwest Transmission was not entitled to an order of immediate possession under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1116. Instead, recognizing the practical reality that Southwest Transmission would need to continue to operate, maintain, and repair the lines during the pendency of the condemnation proceedings, the court entered a preliminary injunction allowing ongoing access to and operation of the lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Landowners then moved the court to determine the valuation date for purposes of calculating just compensation to be paid for the property subject to condemnation. Landowners argued that the land should be valued as of the date the court eventually enters the final order of condemnation. Southwest Transmission countered that the land should be valued as of May 15, 2011, the date it remained in possession immediately following expiration of the BLM right-of-way grant. After briefing and oral argument, the court adopted a middle ground, ruling that the valuation date would be January 15, 2014: the date the summons issued in the condemnation suit. The court further ruled that Landowners would be entitled to rental damages from expiration of the grant to the summons date, and that interest would accrue from the valuation date on the amount of compensation ultimately awarded. The court denied Landowners' subsequent motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 The parties then filed cross-motions for partial summary judgment concerning ownership of the transmission lines and support structures, which would determine whether just compensation for the taking includes the value of those improvements or just of the underlying real property interest. The superior court ruled in favor of Southwest Transmission, finding no indication that title to the improvements had passed to Landowners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 At the parties' request, the superior court then entered a partial final judgment related to the two issues (valuation date and ownership of the improvements).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Landowners timely appealed, and Southwest Transmission and Mohave Electric timely cross-appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 This court initially dismissed the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2101(A)(1) (appeal from final judgment), noting that the judgment was not subject to Rule 54(b) certification because it did not resolve any claims of any of the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

Accordingly, we stayed the appeal and revested the superior court with jurisdiction to determine whether (A)(6) certification was appropriate.

Valuation Date.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 The superior court ruled that Southwest Transmission lacked authority to condemn property simply by occupying it (a \"taking by occupation\"), so Southwest Transmission and Mohave Electric were holdover tenants between expiration of the BLM right-of-way grant and the date of the taking, and Landowners would be entitled to rental damages for that period. The court further reasoned that Southwest Transmission became an agent of the state for condemnation purposes when it filed the direct condemnation action,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1115(C), at which point the taking occurred because the government (through Southwest Transmission) was in actual physical possession of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 Although the parties agree that the valuation date must reflect the date of the taking, both sides challenge the court's determination of the valuation date. Southwest Transmission (joined by Mohave Electric) asserts that the taking occurred by occupation immediately following expiration of the BLM right-of-way grant. Landowners counter that, because Southwest Transmission is exercising eminent domain power as a non-municipal corporation, the taking cannot occur until a jury determines and Southwest Transmission tenders payment of just compensation. Neither side challenges the superior court's ruling as to holdover tenancy pending the date of taking (regardless of when it occurred) or Landowners' entitlement to rental damages, although accepting Southwest Transmission's proposed taking date would in effect moot these issues. We review the superior court's ruling de novo as a pure question of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    League of Ariz. Cities &amp; Towns v.

And\n   <em>\n    Gardiner\n   </em>\n   construed the requirements for taking by means of an order for immediate possession under \u00a7 12-1116, which\n   <em>\n    Hughes Tool\n   </em>\n   had already ruled was not available to a private corporation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"631184\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/103/420/\">\n    103 Ariz. at 423, 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"631184\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/103/420/\">\n    443 P.2d at 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short,\n   <em>\n    Gardiner\n   </em>\n   did not consider the right-of-way clause's restrictions on taking by a private corporation. Although this language would support Southwest Transmission's position if read broadly,\n   <em>\n    Gardiner\n   </em>\n   's dicta cannot override the express language of the constitutional right-of-way clause or the express holding of\n   <em>\n    Hughes Tool\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b623 For the same reasons, the superior court's ruling that the taking occurred on the date of the summons also fails. That conclusion made practical sense under the circumstances of this case: it recognized that Southwest Transmission could not unilaterally exercise eminent domain by occupation, but also that Southwest Transmission was in fact in possession when it began to exercise its eminent domain power properly by filing the direct condemnation action. But the right-of-way clause as construed in\n   <em>\n    Hughes Tool\n   </em>\n   forecloses this result. As a private corporation, Southwest Transmission cannot take possession of property as a condemnor until after trial and payment of just compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hughes Tool\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"616403\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/91/154/#p156\">\n    91 Ariz. at 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"616403\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/91/154/#p156\">\n    370 P.2d 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To hold otherwise would, in effect, allow the result that\n   <em>\n    Hughes Tool\n   </em>\n   reversed: a private corporation could achieve the same result as an order for immediate possession\n   (even though \u00a7 12-1116 is unavailable) by simply entering the property during the pendency of the condemnation action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b624 Southwest Transmission's other arguments are similarly unavailing. It suggests that Landowners could have formalized the taking by filing an inverse condemnation action immediately after expiration of the BLM right-of-way grant (locking in that date as the date of the taking), so the date of the taking should not be controlled by Landowners' decision not to do so. But this argument assumes that the taking occurred when Southwest Transmission outstayed the BLM right-of-way grant, which the right-of-way clause forbids. Moreover, Southwest Transmission itself could have eliminated this delay by pursuing a direct condemnation claim years earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b625 Southwest Transmission further argues that using the end of the condemnation action as the valuation date provides an incentive for delay, as one party or the other (depending on whether property values were rising or falling) would wish to delay resolution for economic gain. But such policy concerns cannot override the constitutional limitations on a private corporation's condemnation authority. And the argument ignores that, in straight-condemnation proceedings under federal law, the date of the taking is similarly the date the government tenders payment after final judgment on just compensation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kirby Forest\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193157\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/1/#p9\">\n    467 U.S. at 3-4, 11-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193157\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/1/#p9\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead, Southwest Transmission simply became a hold-over tenant on that date, and under the right-of-way clause of Article 2, \u00a7 17, could not take Landowners' property in a constitutional sense until after trial and payment.

Accordingly, the value of the improvements would not be included when calculating just compensation for the taking.

Teller Native Corp.\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the Supreme Court of Alaska acknowledged the general rule that a condemnor need not pay for its own pre-condemnation improvements unless those improvements were made under a contract giving the landowner the right to keep them.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10343151\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/904/847/#p850\">\n    904 P.2d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 850 (Alaska 1995). Because the condemnor in that case had specifically agreed to build certain improvements (an airport, taxiway and runway, roadway, and parking area) as partial consideration for the lease and to leave them for the landowner's benefit after termination of the lease, the condemnor would have to pay the landowner compensation for the improvements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10343151\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/904/847/#p850\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10343151\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/904/847/#p850\">\n    at 849-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 850-51 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, in contrast, the fact that the grant allowed and required Southwest Transmission to remove the improvements means it owned the improvements and need not pay compensation for those improvements upon condemnation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b632 Landowners contend, however, that Southwest Transmission and Mohave Electric became trespassers after expiration of the BLM right-of-way grant and, by failing to pay rent or promptly remove the improvements, forfeited their ownership of the transmission lines and structures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Russell v.

But Landowners did not demand that Southwest Transmission remove the improvements after the right-of-way grant expired. And the rule Landowners propose simply does not apply in the same way to an entity with eminent domain authority that constructs improvements to facilitate the public use for which it has the authority to condemn the land, and then in fact exercises its power to condemn the property.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Anderson-Tully Co. v.
