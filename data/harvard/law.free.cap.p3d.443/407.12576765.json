Ford Motor Company\n   </em>\n   , ADV-18-247(b), denying its motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. We accept supervisory control, conclude Montana has specific personal jurisdiction over Ford in this case, and accordingly affirm the District Court's order. This Opinion and Order addresses the following issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Does Montana have specific personal jurisdiction over Ford regarding Lucero's design defect, failure to warn, and negligence claims when the vehicle accident occurred in Montana but the vehicle was not designed, manufactured, or first sold by Ford in Montana?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Markkaya Jean Gullett, a Montana resident, drove a 1996 Ford Explorer. Ford did not design or manufacture the Explorer in Montana. Ford assembled the Explorer in Kentucky and sold it for the first time to a dealer in Washington. Over ten years later, the Explorer was\n   resold and registered in Montana. In 2015, as Gullett drove the Explorer on the interstate in Montana, one of the Explorer's tires suffered a tread/belt separation. The vehicle lost stability, rolled into a ditch, and came to rest upside down. Gullett died at the scene. Gullett's personal representative, Charles Lucero (Lucero), filed this suit against Ford in Montana state district court on behalf of Gullett and her heirs. The complaint alleges three claims against Ford: strict liability for design defect, strict liability for failure to warn, and negligence. Lucero seeks compensatory and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Defendant Ford moved to dismiss, arguing Montana does not have specific personal jurisdiction over Ford regarding Lucero's claims and specifically reasoning that there is no link between Ford's Montana contacts and Lucero's claims. The District Court disagreed and ultimately concluded it had specific personal jurisdiction over Ford.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Ford now asks this Court to exercise supervisory control over the District Court, conclude no specific personal jurisdiction exists, and dismiss the case against Ford. Ford faults the District Court for resting its analysis on Ford's in-state contacts and the fact that Gullett was injured in Montana, arguing the court erred when it failed to identify a link between Ford's contacts with Montana and Lucero's claims. Lucero asserts the court's exercise of specific personal jurisdiction is appropriate in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 This Court has supervisory control over Montana courts.

Urgency makes the normal appeal process inadequate in this case involving personal jurisdiction, because the\n   District Court must have power over the parties in a proceeding to afford adequate relief. The question is purely legal and of state-wide constitutional importance: Ford's due process rights are at issue and this decision will clarify when persons injured in Montana may appropriately file suit in Montana courts.

P. 4(b)(1) which provides, in pertinent part: \"[A]ny person is subject to the jurisdiction of Montana courts as to any claim for relief arising from ... the commission of any act resulting in accrual within Montana of a tort action.\" M. R. Civ. P. 4(b)(1)(B). In this case, Lucero's claims for relief arise from Ford's alleged actions of design defect, failing to warn, and negligence. Lucero alleges those actions resulted in the accrual of a tort action in Montana: Gullett was driving the Explorer in Montana when the accident occurred. Accordingly, we conclude Lucero's claims for relief arise from Ford's actions allegedly resulting in a tort action accruing within Montana.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bunch v.

A Montana court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant is limited by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. U.S. Const. amend. XIV.

According to the stream of commerce plus theory, a defendant's mere awareness that its product may enter the forum state is not enough to demonstrate purposeful availment; the defendant must also engage in some additional conduct establishing its intent or purpose to serve the forum state's market.\n   <em>\n    Asahi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131449\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/102/#p112\">\n    480 U.S. at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131449\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/102/#p112\">\n    107 S.

Ford delivers its vehicles and parts into the stream of commerce with the expectation that Montana consumers will purchase them. Further, Ford engages in additional conduct establishing its intent to serve the market in Montana. Ford advertises in Montana, is registered to do business in Montana, and operates subsidiary companies in Montana. Ford has thirty-six dealerships in Montana. Ford also has employees in Montana. It sells automobiles, specifically Ford Explorers-the kind of vehicle at issue in this case-and parts in Montana. Ford also provides automotive services in Montana, including certified repair, replacement, and recall services. Ford's conduct clearly establishes channels that permit it to provide regular assistance and advice to customers in Montana; Ford serves the market in Montana and expects consumers to drive its automobiles in Montana. Ford's conduct satisfies the more-stringent stream of commerce plus theory, and we accordingly find it purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in Montana, thereby invoking Montana's laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b618 Second, we consider whether Lucero's claims arise out of or relate to Ford's forum-related activities. The Supreme Court recently clarified the mandatory nature of this prong. Due process requires a\n   connection between a defendant's in-state actions and a plaintiff's claim: \"the suit must arise out of or relate to the defendant's contacts with the forum.\"\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   , 582 U.S. at ----, 137 S. Ct. at 1780 (internal quotations and alterations omitted). Ford argues that, because it did not design or manufacture the Explorer at issue in Montana and because Ford first sold the Explorer outside of Montana, Lucero's claims do not arise out of or relate to any of Ford's Montana activities. Ford's position is supported by courts in other jurisdictions finding no specific personal jurisdiction in similar factual scenarios because of a lack of connection between the plaintiffs' claims and the defendants' in-state contacts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lucero counters, urging us to find the\n   second due-process consideration satisfied because the claims relate to Ford's in-state activities. Lucero's position is also supported by courts in other jurisdictions finding due process satisfied in similar factual scenarios as long as a defendant has some other connection to the forum state and could have reasonably foreseen its product being used there.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the following reasons, we agree with Lucero and conclude the second prong is satisfied here: Lucero's claims relate to Ford's Montana activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b619 In a products liability action where the defendant purposefully availed itself of the privilege of doing business in Montana based on the stream of commerce plus theory, the question of whether the plaintiff's claims arise out of or relate to the defendant's\n   forum-related activities presents a challenging legal inquiry. The defendant's out-of-state conduct-placing the product into the stream of commerce-technically led to the plaintiff's in-state use of the product and resulting claim. In that sense, the defendant's forum-related activities did not directly result in the plaintiff's use of the product in that forum. However, due process does not require a direct connection; it only requires that the plaintiff's claims \"arise out of\" or \"relate to\" the defendant's forum-related activities. Therefore, we must determine when the plaintiff's claims \"arise out of\" or \"relate\n   to\" the defendant's Montana-related activities when the defendant purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in Montana based on the stream of commerce plus theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b620 \"[I]f the sale of a product of a manufacturer or distributor ... is not simply an isolated occurrence, but\n   <em>\n    arises from\n   </em>\n   the efforts of the manufacturer or distributor to serve directly or indirectly, the market for its product in other States, it is not unreasonable to subject it to suit in one of those States if its allegedly defective merchandise\n   <em>\n    has there been the source of injury\n   </em>\n   ....\"\n   <em>\n    World-Wide Volkswagen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306135\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/286/#p297\">\n    444 U.S. at 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306135\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/286/#p297\">\n    100 S.

Where a plaintiff alleges a nonresident defendant, acting outside of the forum, placed a product into the stream of commerce that ultimately caused harm in the forum, the \"[f]low of a manufacturer's products into the forum ... may bolster an affiliation germane to\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v.

Therefore, when the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities in a specific forum by placing a product into the stream of commerce, the plaintiff's claims will relate to the defendant's forum-related activities as long as the connection between the defendant's in-state conduct and the plaintiff's claim is sufficient enough to not offend due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b621 At its core, due process is concerned with fairness and reasonableness: Is it fair and reasonable to ask an out-of-state defendant to defend a specific lawsuit in Montana? Companies build vehicles specifically for interstate travel. Irrespective of where a company initially designed, manufactured, or first sold a vehicle, it is fair to say that a company designing, manufacturing, and selling vehicles can reasonably foresee (even expect) its vehicles to cross state lines. When a company engages in the design, manufacture, and distribution of products specifically designed for interstate travel, it is\n   both fair and reasonable to require the company to defend a lawsuit in a state where the product caused injury as long as the company has otherwise purposefully availed itself of the privilege of doing business in that state and if a nexus exists between the product and the defendant's in-state activity. Where a company first designed, manufactured, or sold a vehicle is immaterial to the personal jurisdiction inquiry, and focusing on those limited factors would unduly restrict courts of this state from exercising specific personal jurisdiction that comports with due process over nonresident defendants in cases such as this one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b622 Accordingly, we now hold that if a defendant's actions resulted in the accrual of a tort action in Montana (that is, if M. R. Civ. P. 4(b)(1)(B) is satisfied), and if the defendant purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in Montana under the stream of commerce plus theory, the plaintiff's claims \"relate to\" the defendant's forum-related activities if a nexus exists between the product and the defendant's in-state activity and if the defendant could have reasonably foreseen its product being used in Montana. In this case, M. R. Civ. P. 4(b)(1)(B) is satisfied and Ford purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducing activities in Montana under the stream of commerce plus theory. Therefore, Lucero's claims \"relate to\" Ford's Montana activities if a nexus exists between the Explorer and Ford's Montana activities and if Ford could have reasonably foreseen the Explorer being used in Montana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b623 A nexus exists between Gullett's use of the Explorer and Ford's in-state activity. Ford advertises, sells, and services vehicles in Montana. Ford makes it convenient for Montana residents to drive Ford vehicles by offering maintenance, repair, and recall services in Montana. Gullett's use of the Explorer in Montana is tied to Ford's activities of selling, maintaining, and repairing vehicles in Montana. Further, Ford could have reasonably foreseen the Explorer-a product specifically built to travel-being used in Montana. We accordingly conclude that Lucero's claims \"relate to\" Ford's Montana activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b624 Ford cites recent Supreme Court opinions\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Walden\n   </em>\n   , reasoning they support its argument that Lucero's claims do not arise out of or relate to its forum-related activities because it did not design, manufacture, or first sell the Explorer in Montana. Those cases, however, do not limit the specific personal jurisdiction analysis in the way Ford argues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b625 In\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs filed a products liability action against Bristol-Myers in California state court, alleging they were injured by the pharmaceutical company's drug Plavix.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   , 582 U.S. at ----, 137 S. Ct. at 1778. Over 600 plaintiffs participated in the action: 86 plaintiffs alleged Plavix injured them in California, while 592 plaintiffs alleged Plavix injured them in other states.\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   , 582 U.S. at ----, 137 S. Ct. at 1778. Bristol-Myers challenged the California court's jurisdiction over the claims arising from the out-of-state injuries. Notably, the court's jurisdiction over the claims arising from the in-state injuries was not at issue. The Supreme Court ultimately held the California state court could not exercise specific personal jurisdiction over the claims arising from out-of-state injuries because the plaintiffs bringing those claims \"were not prescribed Plavix in California, did not purchase Plavix in California, did not ingest Plavix in California, and were not injured by Plavix in California.\"\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   , 582 U.S. at ---, 137 S. Ct. at 1781. This case is distinguishable. Gullett was injured while driving the Explorer in Montana. Therefore, while Bristol-Myers did not have sufficient California contacts regarding the claims arising from out-of-state injuries, the Court's holding from\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   does not impact our analysis regarding whether Lucero's claims relate to Ford's Montana contacts because Gullett was injured while driving the Explorer in Montana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b626 In\n   <em>\n    Walden\n   </em>\n   , a police officer seized a large sum of cash from airline passengers at an airport in Georgia, believing the cash was connected to drug-related activity.\n   <em>\n    Walden\n   </em>\n   , 571 U.S. at 279, 134 S. Ct. at 1119. The passengers filed suit in Nevada. The Supreme Court ultimately held the officer was not subject to personal jurisdiction in Nevada because he lacked any connection to the state. The Court recognized that in order for personal jurisdiction to comport with due process, the \"defendant's suit-related conduct must create a substantial connection with the forum State\" and the \"relationship must arise out of contacts that the 'defendant himself' creates with the forum State.\"\n   <em>\n    Walden\n   </em>\n   , 571 U.S. at 284, 134 S.

The Court reiterated that the specific personal jurisdiction analysis must focus on the \"relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Walden\n   </em>\n   , 571 U.S. at 291, 134 S. Ct. at 1126.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b627 This case presents a much different factual scenario. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Walden\n   </em>\n   , where the plaintiffs were the only connection between the defendant and the forum state, here, Gullett is by no means the only\n   connection between Ford and Montana. Rather, Ford's own actions link its Montana contacts to Lucero's claims. Ford markets, sells, and services vehicles in Montana, demonstrating a willingness to sell to and serve Montana customers like Gullett, who was injured while driving an Explorer in Montana. Focusing on the relationship between the defendant (Ford), the forum (Montana), and the litigation (Lucero's design defect, failure to warn, and negligence claims arising from a vehicle accident that occurred in Montana), we conclude Lucero's claims relate to Ford's in-state activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b628 Third in our due process analysis, we consider whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction is reasonable. After finding that a defendant purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities, we presume that the exercise of personal jurisdiction is reasonable. A defendant can only overcome that presumption by presenting a compelling case that exercising jurisdiction would be unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    B.T. Metal Works\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 34. Because we found that Ford purposefully\n   availed itself of conducting activities in Montana under the stream of commerce plus theory, we presume that exercising personal jurisdiction is reasonable unless Ford can overcome that presumption by presenting a compelling case that jurisdiction would be unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b629 The reasonableness analysis generally depends on an examination of factors that illustrate the concept of fundamental fairness, such as: (1) the extent of the defendant's purposeful interjection into Montana; (2) the burden on the defendant of defending in Montana; (3) the extent of conflict with the sovereignty of the defendant's state; (4) Montana's interest in adjudicating the dispute; (5) the most efficient resolution of the controversy; (6) the importance of Montana to the plaintiff's interest in convenient and effective relief; and (7) the existence of an alternative forum.\n   <em>\n    Simmons Oil Corp. v.
