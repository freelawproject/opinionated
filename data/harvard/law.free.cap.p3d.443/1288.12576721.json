He was charged with and pled no contest to a single count of criminal nonsupport. Hedgcock now challenges the district court's restitution determination. Because we agree that the district court did not make separate findings as to complete restitution and court-ordered restitution as required by statute and precedent, we vacate the restitution determination and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Further, Hedgcock challenges the district court's refusal to reduce complete restitution by amounts Hedgcock claims he would not have owed had he filed a petition to modify the divorce decree in the intervening years. We affirm the district court on this point of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Following his divorce, Hedgcock was ordered to pay $ 701 per month in child support (Decree). The child support amount was based on an imputed wage that was allegedly more than Hedgcock's actual wage. Hedgcock, however, stipulated to the higher imputed wage and child support amount. The Decree provided that \"[t]he current Child Support amount shall remain in effect unless modified by [the Office of Recovery Services (ORS) ]\" and that \"each party to this action may request that [ORS] review the Court's child support order for this action to determine whether a modification of the Court ordered child support be pursued.\" ORS was also joined as a party to the divorce action to clarify and determine Hedgcock's child support obligations moving forward. Although ORS appeared, it did not seek to modify the child support as ordered in the Decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 In December 2014, Hedgcock moved the divorce court to \"address the issue of his child support.\" A commissioner declined to set a hearing on the motion but outlined the correct procedure for pursuing an adjustment of child support in a minute entry. The minute entry noted that Hedgcock could seek an adjustment by filing a petition to modify and a financial declaration pursuant to rules 101 and 106 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. Hedgcock did not object to the minute entry and never filed a petition to modify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 In January 2016, Hedgcock was charged with criminal nonsupport based on an alleged total arrearage, with interest, of $ 61,310. In other words, from the time the Decree was entered in 2011, to the time he was charged in January 2016 (Charged Period), Hedgcock paid a total of $ 780 in child support-rather than the $ 701 per month ordered in the Decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 At a preliminary hearing, Hedgcock argued that the total arrearage for the Charged Period was incorrect because ORS should have modified the child support amount when it was joined as a party. But a representative for ORS testified that despite being joined as a party, it typically \"would not ... modify a child support order unless [it had] a written request from one of the parties to do so.\" And although ORS received written requests from Hedgcock, \"the determination was made ... not to proceed with a modification review because [Hedgcock's] circumstances had not changed from the date that the initial order had been stipulated to.\" Hedgcock did not petition the divorce court to review ORS's determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The State filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude from trial-among other things-evidence that Hedgcock disagreed with the amount of child support ordered in the Decree. The district court granted the motion, concluding that Hedgcock's \"disagreement with the amount of child support he has been ordered to pay is not a relevant issue in this case, and therefore any argument regarding this matter is inadmissible.\" The court further explained that the Decree is a final order and the only way that Hedgcock's arguments would be relevant is if he had filed a petition to modify in the divorce proceeding. But the court noted, \"[T]hat's not what's happened. That's not the facts that are before this court. The facts\n   before this court are there's an order for $ 701, and that's the existing order [the State is] claiming criminal nonsupport on.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Hedgcock pled no contest to a single count of criminal nonsupport in return for the State's recommendation of no jail time and a 402 reduction \"upon successful completion of payment of restitution.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At sentencing, Hedgcock requested a restitution hearing, \"not necessarily to question the amounts ... but because he would like the Court to consider some of the same things ... discussed when arguing the motion in limine as toward restitution.\" The court responded that the criminal proceeding was \"not the appropriate place\" to challenge the Decree. And because there was no pending petition to modify the Decree, the court clarified that the only permissible arguments at the restitution hearing would be to establish the amounts that Hedgcock already paid against the existing arrearage. After a brief recess, Hedgcock entered his no-contest plea,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and requested to be sentenced immediately without a pre-sentencing report (PSR) or review of his financial declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 The district court held a restitution hearing in December 2016. At the outset, Hedgcock renewed his objection to the amount owed during the Charged Period. The court responded that, absent a pending petition to modify the Decree, Hedgcock's past-due child support obligation was a fixed amount and \"there's no possibility this order is going to be anything different than what it is.\" Hedgcock then submitted to the court that the parties had reached a stipulation on the amount of arrearage based on the operative Decree-which was determined to be $ 51,833. The court asked the parties if there was anything else that needed to be taken care of at the hearing, and Hedgcock's counsel replied, \"I don't believe so.\" Specifically, Hedgcock did not ask the district court to consider anything other than (1) whether child support had actually ever been ordered under the Decree and (2) whether the support order should have been modified at some point in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 The district court entered a stipulated sentencing order on December 27, 2016. The order provided that \"[r]estitution ... owed to [Hedgcock's ex-wife] as of December 8, 2016, is entered for $ 51,883.\" The district court did not indicate whether the ordered amount was for complete restitution, court-ordered restitution, or both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Hedgcock appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Hedgcock raises two issues on appeal. He first contends that the district court misapplied the Crime Victims Restitution Act (Restitution Act)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   when it merged complete restitution with court-ordered restitution without making separate findings. \"We will not disturb a district court's restitution order unless it exceeds that prescribed by law or otherwise abused its discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Restitution Act\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 Hedgcock argues that the district court erred \"by conflating complete restitution with court-ordered restitution.\" Generally, complete restitution is \"necessary to compensate a victim for all losses caused by the defendant\" and is determined by taking into account \"all relevant facts\" of the case.\n   <em>\n    State v. Mooers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2036\">\n    2017 UT 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569371\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/424/1/\">\n    424 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up) (listing relevant facts to be considered in determining complete restitution). Court-ordered restitution, on the other hand, is a subset of complete restitution that the court \"orders the defendant to pay as a part of the criminal sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10 (cleaned up). To determine the amount of court-ordered restitution, courts consider the facts for complete restitution and additional factors set forth in the Restitution Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, \"[t]he plain language of the Restitution Act contains a clear directive that district courts are to make two separate restitution determinations, one for complete restitution and a second for court-ordered restitution,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8 (cleaned up), and failure to do so, or even \"merg[ing] them into one order,\" is error,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 Here, the district court did not make separate findings, nor did it indicate whether it was ordering complete restitution or court-ordered restitution. Simply put, the district court's failure to engage in this analysis was error.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, because Hedgcock failed to preserve this issue, he must also show that the court's error was obvious and harmful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, the law governing restitution is both clear and plainly settled. First, relevant portions of the Restitution Act-which was enacted in 2001-mandate that \"[i]n determining restitution the court shall determine complete restitution and court-ordered restitution,\" Crime Victims Restitution Act, ch. 137, \u00a7 8,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20Utah%20Laws%20699\">\n    2001 Utah Laws 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 704; \"the court shall make the reasons for the decision part of the court record,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20Utah%20Laws%20699\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; and \"[i]n determining the monetary sum and other conditions for court-ordered restitution, the court shall consider the factors\" for complete restitution as well as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (i) the financial resources of the defendant and the burden that payment of restitution will impose, with regard to the other obligations of the defendant; (ii) the ability of the defendant to pay restitution on an installment basis or on other conditions to be fixed by the court; (iii) the rehabilitative effect on the defendant of the payment of restitution and the method of payment; and (iv) other circumstances which the court determines may make restitution inappropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20Utah%20Laws%20699\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20Utah%20Laws%20699\">\n    at 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, our supreme court settled the law governing complete restitution and court-ordered restitution,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Laycock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994842\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/214/104/\">\n    2009 UT 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 20-24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994842\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/214/104/\">\n    214 P.3d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that district courts are \"clearly required to determine ... restitution, as set out in [the Restitution Act]\"), seven years prior to entry of the stipulated sentencing order. In light of the plain language in the Restitution Act and the holding in\n   <em>\n    Laycock\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the requirement to make separate and distinct findings for complete restitution and court-ordered restitution was obvious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 Next, Hedgcock argues that the district court's error was harmful. We agree. As Hedgcock contends, the entire portion of restitution in this case is being treated as court-ordered,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and he faces \"criminal enforcement\n   mechanisms\" such as contempt of court or the imposition of a sentence for failure to pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mooers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2036\">\n    2017 UT 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569371\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/424/1/\">\n    424 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Conversely, had the court conducted the proper analysis and determined that any portion of the amount owed was complete restitution, rather than court-ordered restitution, that portion would be enforceable only as a civil judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569371\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/424/1/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We conclude that the district court's error is at least potentially harmful because it exposes Hedgcock to criminal penalties for amounts of restitution that may not have been court-ordered restitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 We are unpersuaded by the State's argument that Hedgcock invited this error by stipulating to the amount of restitution and/or failing to object to the stipulated sentencing order. Even where, as here, a defendant stipulates to \"complete\" restitution, the plain language of the Restitution Act still requires that the court make separate findings for complete restitution and court-ordered restitution. Accordingly, Hedgcock's failure to object to the stipulated sentencing order is a preservation defect but nothing more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b618 We readily understand that, given the sentencing stipulation made by the parties, the district court may well have intended to order complete and court-ordered restitution in the same amount. But the court did not articulate that. And given the bright-line precedent of\n   <em>\n    Mooers\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Laycock\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the district court's failure to indicate what type of restitution was being ordered-and its failure to justify its conclusion with adequate factual findings-was plain error. Therefore, we vacate the restitution order and remand to the district court to clarify the amount of complete restitution and court-ordered restitution it imposed in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II. Restitution Amount\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b619 Relatedly, Hedgcock argues that the district court erred when it calculated restitution, whether complete or court-ordered, without considering whether the child support owed during the Charged Period should have been adjusted in the domestic case. In other words, Hedgcock contends that the district court should have allowed him to launch, in his criminal case, essentially, a petition to modify the Decree retroactively for the Charged Period. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b620 When Hedgcock entered his no-contest plea, he effectively conceded that the State had sufficient evidence to prove the elements of criminal nonsupport.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Crim. P. 11(e)(4)(A) (\"The court ... may not accept the plea until the court has found ... the defendant understands the nature and elements of the offense to which the plea is entered ....\"). In other words, Hedgcock conceded that during the Charged Period he had children under the age of eighteen, for whom he knowingly failed to provide support; his children would have been in needy circumstances but for support received from a source other than him; and the total arrearage was in excess of $ 10,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-7-201\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-7-201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) (LexisNexis 2017) (listing the elements of criminal nonsupport).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b621 Given that Hedgcock knew of his child support obligations, he could have filed a petition to modify in the divorce proceedings prior to being charged with criminal nonsupport. His failure to do so does not alleviate his obligation to pay child support under the Decree, nor does it change the fact that his\n   children were dependent on his support, which he nevertheless failed to pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-7-201\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-12-112(3) (\"Each payment or installment of child ... support under any support order ... is, on and after the date it is due: a judgment with the same attributes and effect of any judgment of a district court ...
