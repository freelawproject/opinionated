To address these claims, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Arizona certified the following questions to this Court:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   1. Does a manager of an Arizona limited liability company (\"LLC\") owe common law fiduciary duties to the company?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   2. Does a member of an Arizona LLC owe common law fiduciary duties to the company?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   3. Can an Arizona LLC's operating agreement lawfully limit or eliminate those fiduciary duties?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b62 We answer the first question in the affirmative. We answer the second question in the affirmative, provided that the member is an agent of the LLC. We answer the third question in the affirmative but note that the operating agreement may not eliminate the implied contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b63 Arizona enacted its first limited liability company act (\"LLC Act\") in 1992.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1992 Sess. Laws 395 (2d Reg. Sess.). The statutory scheme is codified at A.R.S. \u00a7 29-601 et seq. Last year, Arizona's legislature enacted a new Arizona Limited Liability Company Act (\"ALLCA\") to eventually replace the LLC Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20Ariz.%20Sess.%20Laws%20833\">\n    2018 Ariz.

We thus apply common law agency principles to answer the certified questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b65 Arizona case law has not addressed these issues directly.

Thus, the nature of the fiduciary relationship for agents includes a duty of loyalty, a duty of good faith, and a duty of care.

However, if an LLC's management is vested in one or more managers, members are not automatically agents \"solely by reason of being a member except to the extent that authority has been delegated to the member by\" the manager or the operating agreement. \u00a7 29-654(B)(1). If management is vested in one or more managers, by law they are deemed agents of the LLC \"for the purpose of carrying on its business in the usual way.\" \u00a7 29-654(B)(2). Thus, if an LLC is managed by one or more managers, such managers are agents, and under \u00a7 29-854 and agency law, they would owe common law fiduciary duties to the LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b69 The answer to the second question depends on whether management has been vested in one or more managers. If not, then all members are deemed agents of the LLC and thus would owe common law fiduciary duties to the LLC. If, however, the LLC is managed by one or more managers, members\n   are considered its agents to the extent they have been delegated authority by the managers or the operating agreement under \u00a7 29-654(B)(1). Thus, a member owes common law fiduciary duties to the LLC if the member acts as an agent of the LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b610 Although the common law recognizes that an LLC's managers or members, when acting as agents of the LLC, owe fiduciary duties to the company, these duties may be lawfully limited by a valid operating agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b611 The LLC Act provides for an operating agreement to govern relationships between members and managers and between managers, members, and the LLC itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 29-682(B). The agreement \"may contain any provision that is not contrary to law and that relates to ... the rights, duties or powers of its members, managers, officers, employees or agents.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5075508\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/45/338/#p347\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, an LLC is not required to adopt an operating agreement. \u00a7 29-682(A) (stating that an LLC \"may\" adopt an agreement). Neither the LLC Act nor any other applicable law broadly prohibits an operating agreement from altering or limiting fiduciary duties that otherwise would be owed to the LLC by its managers or members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b612 The defendants in both certified cases concede that, regardless of their arguments relating to common law fiduciary duties, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing cannot be eliminated by an operating agreement. Based on public policy and case law, this is a well-supported concession.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rawlings v. Apodaca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1502883\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/151/149/#p163\">\n    151 Ariz. 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 163,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1502883\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/151/149/#p163\">\n    726 P.2d 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 579 (1986) (\"A covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied in every contract ....The covenant ... may be breached even though the express covenants of the contract are fully performed\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b613 Thus, we answer the third question in the affirmative. Under the LLC Act, an operating agreement may lawfully limit or eliminate common law fiduciary duties owed to the LLC by its members or managers, although it may not erase the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in every contract. We have no occasion here to address whether the provisions of any particular operating agreement are contrary to law in this respect or otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b614 For the reasons noted, the LLC Act imposes common law fiduciary duties on managers and members serving as agents of the LLC. The LLC Act permits an LLC to limit or eliminate such common law duties through an operating agreement, except for the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
