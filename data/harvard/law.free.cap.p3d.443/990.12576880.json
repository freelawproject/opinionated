We reject his claims that he was vindictively prosecuted and that the state presented insufficient evidence to support the charge of attempted armed robbery. However, the prosecutor presented an improper argument during his summation, and the state has not proven that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We therefore reverse Dansdill's convictions and sentences and remand this case for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 We view the facts in the light most favorable to upholding Dansdill's convictions and sentences.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In early 2014, Dansdill loaned $ 300 to M.L., his long-time friend and former girlfriend. By May 2014, M.L. had not repaid the debt and became aware that Dansdill was looking to collect the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In the early morning hours of May 17, M.L. was home with her boyfriend, R.G., and her cousin, M.G., who was visiting. All three were using drugs, including methamphetamine. They heard a loud knock on the door and both M.L. and R.G. asked who was there. The person at the door first responded in a joking manner that he was \"Julio.\" Then Dansdill, who had left a downtown bar shortly before, identified himself by name and said, \"[Y]ou guys owe me money.\" M.L., who recognized Dansdill's voice, corrected him, saying only she owed him the money. R.G. opened the door and quickly closed it. Dansdill warned, \"I could make this easy or it could be a problem.\" Dansdill then asked R.G. to open the door, indicated he came \"in peace,\" and said he would \"put it away.\" But then a gun was fired through the door. The bullet hit R.G. in his arm and traveled into his chest. He died at the scene from the wound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Shortly after the incident, the state charged Dansdill with second-degree murder. Almost a year later, the state obtained a second indictment charging Dansdill with two counts: (1) first-degree felony murder, \"or in the alternative,\" second-degree murder; and (2) attempted armed robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 After a jury trial, Dansdill was found guilty of felony murder and attempted armed robbery. The trial court sentenced him to life in prison for the felony murder conviction and a concurrent term of 7.5 years for the attempted armed robbery conviction. After moving unsuccessfully for a new trial, Dansdill timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1), 13-4031, and 13-4033(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Prosecutorial Vindictiveness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Dansdill first contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss for vindictive prosecution.

In particular, the prosecutor stated that defense interviews had revealed \"a theory or at least hints of a theory\" that, although Dansdill had been at the door on the night of the incident, he was not the person who pulled the trigger. The prosecutor further explained that the way the case was initially charged \"played to the strengths of that defense,\" so he made the strategic decision to obtain the felony murder indictment in order to eliminate the defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Although criminal defendants have a due process right to develop their defenses, including by confronting witnesses and conducting pretrial interviews, due process does not prevent the state from responding strategically when a defendant's pretrial efforts reveal a defense the state did not anticipate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189309\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/368/\">\n    457 U.S. at 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189309\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/368/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A prosecutor should remain free before trial to exercise the broad discretion entrusted to him to determine the extent of the societal interest in prosecution.

But the question of the prosecutor's credibility regarding his motivation was one for the trial judge, not for this court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

Furthermore, the supervening indictment relieved the state of its burden of showing that the shooter possessed the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   to commit second-degree murder, under circumstances that suggest the possibility of an unintentional shooting. For this reason, the new charges provided the state a tangible strategic advantage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 Dansdill insists the charging decision raised the presumption of vindictiveness because no new evidence or procedural developments justified the increased charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This argument fails. The reason the United States Supreme Court has declined to adopt an \"inflexible presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness in a pretrial setting\" is that, before trial, \"the prosecutor's assessment of the proper extent of prosecution may not have crystallized.\"\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189309\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/368/\">\n    457 U.S. at 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189309\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/368/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In this case, Dansdill's position has been that defense interviews \"completely changed the posture of the State's second-degree murder case.\" In that context, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to accept the state's explanation that it had responded strategically to improve its chances of obtaining a conviction, not to penalize Dansdill or deter other defendants from aggressively defending themselves.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brun\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"162837\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/190/505/#p506\">\n    190 Ariz. at 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"162837\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/190/505/#p506\">\n    950 P.2d at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (no presumption of vindictiveness because \"unrealistic\" to presume \"routine assertion of procedural rights\" prompted retaliation from the state).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b615 Dansdill points to additional facts that he contends should have compelled the trial court to find a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing of vindictiveness. These include the state's failure to immediately dismiss the original second-degree murder indictment upon the issuance of the second indictment, the state's dismissal of the original indictment without prejudice after Dansdill raised the question of vindictive prosecution, and the prosecutor's attempt to proceed immediately to trial on the new first-degree murder charge using the date set for the initial second-degree murder charge.

We agree with the state that the court's mere acknowledgement of Dansdill's frustration does not reflect the application of an incorrect legal standard. Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial judge denied the motion, finding-based on what \"[she] interpreted at the time\"-that the prosecutor's statements were\n   not a comment upon possible punishment but rather on the fact that the state was not required to prove intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b634 Dansdill raised the claim again in his motion for a new trial, which the court denied. Emphasizing the prosecutor's after-the-fact explanation about what he had meant by his comments, the court ruled that \"the State did not imply that the 'lesser form' of murder had a meaning other than the difference he described as to intent or premeditation,\" and that there had been \"no implication about penalty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b635 In reaching this conclusion, the trial court abused its discretion. Rather than focusing on the prosecutor's\n   <em>\n    post-hoc\n   </em>\n   explanation of his intention or what the judge herself interpreted his intentions to be, the court should have examined the challenged comments from the perspective of how a reasonable jury would have understood them. A juror would reasonably understand a prosecutor's remarks about the comparative \"seriousness\" of an offense as a reference to the state's perception of its comparative gravity. And although jurors are instructed not to consider punishment, they are certainly aware that any verdict they return will have important consequences to a defendant, which will depend on the seriousness of the conviction. In this context, the prosecutor's repeated characterization of felony murder as a \"lesser\" or \"less serious\" form of murder than premeditated murder would have led a reasonable jury to infer that the potential consequences for felony murder would be less than those for premeditated murder. We therefore cannot agree with the trial court that the prosecutor's comments involved \"no implication about penalty.\" We struggle to find any other way the jury could have reasonably understood them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b636 That the terms \"lesser\" and \"less serious\" would be understood to refer to punishment also finds support in our jurisprudence. As our supreme court has explained, Arizona's homicide statutes \"provide increased punishment for progressively\n   <em>\n    more serious\n   </em>\n   crimes.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Indeed, one of the very purposes of the criminal code is \"[t]o differentiate on reasonable grounds between serious and minor offenses and to prescribe proportionate penalties for each.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-101(4). Certain crimes are classified as \"lesser-grade felon[ies]\" due to a policy that those who commit them \"deserve a lesser punishment\" than those who commit their more serious counterparts.\n   <em>\n    Lua\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328449\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/301/\">\n    237 Ariz. 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328449\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/301/\">\n    350 P.3d 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b637 The prosecutor's references to punishment were also inaccurate and misleading. Felony murder is not, in any meaningful respect, a \"less serious\" or \"lesser\" offense than premeditated murder. Rather, under Arizona law, they are \"simply two forms of first-degree murder.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Tucker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"152588\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/205/157/\">\n    205 Ariz. 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 50,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"152588\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/205/157/\">\n    68 P.3d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003).

But the state has failed to explain how remarks about the comparative \"seriousness\" of premediated and felony murder were logically pertinent to making that point.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b639 In defending the propriety of his remarks to the trial court, the prosecutor maintained he gained no strategic benefit by characterizing felony murder as \"less serious\" than premeditated murder. The prosecutor's behavior during jury selection suggests otherwise: he chose to probe the venire on its willingness to convict a defendant of felony first-degree murder. In response, two potential jurors expressed confusion about the concept of felony murder. One of them concluded she could not convict a defendant of first-degree murder without a showing of intent to kill.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   By insinuating that felony murder was a less serious charge because it required no showing of intent, the prosecutor effectively addressed any juror's concern about the fairness of decoupling \"intent to kill\" from criminal culpability for homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b640 We conclude that any reasonable jury would have understood the prosecutor's repeated characterization of felony murder as \"less serious\" than premeditated murder as a reference to the potential consequences of conviction. In the context of a criminal trial, those comments could mean little else. The trial court erred when it failed to sustain the defense objection to those remarks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Reference to Dansdill's Decision Not to Testify\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b641 Dansdill chose not to testify at his trial. During summation, his counsel said the following regarding the state's evidence of calls from Dansdill's cellular telephone around the time of the incident:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Where is the information as to who these calls go to? Where are those witnesses? Where's the witness that could say, well, yeah, Dansdill called me at this time ...? Where's that information on these outgoing calls?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Where are any witnesses to say yeah, I got an outgoing call from Dansdill? Where is any of that information? Where did Dansdill say he was? Where is any of that information? There's none of that information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b642 In rebuttal, the prosecutor responded that, although \"[t]here is never a point in the trial where the defendant has to present any evidence or put on any evidence,\" it is also the case that \"[h]e can, he can present evidence.\" While saying this, the prosecutor angled his body and gestured with his right arm in the direction of the defense table. Dansdill objected and reserved his motion. After discussing other elements of the case, the state returned to the issue of the telephone calls:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [D]efense counsel says where are the witnesses who say who the defendant called? And I want to point in the direction of several different ... instructions here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   One is neither side is required to call all witnesses .... And the reason for that is because both parties are making choices about who they call and put on the stand. And each party is obligated to put the witnesses on the stand that prove their case. Or in the defendant's case, he's not\n   obligated to do anything. But if he wants to argue to you about it ... if he wants to suggest it's in evidence, then he's got to put it on the witness stand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   ... [A]nd, again, the burden is always on the State. Okay? ... It never shifts. But let me be perfectly clear. If any one of those people who-by the way, who was making the calls? Defendant. Who's making and receiving the calls? Defendant. So if any one of those people exonerated him, you could bet your bippy you would have been hearing about them from the witness stand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   And by the way, there's another instruction that says don't guess or speculate about items outside of evidence[.] ... So to stand up and say, well, think about these other people. Maybe they would help us. Well, then maybe we would have heard from them; right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b643 After the rebuttal, the court instructed the jury that \"defendant's not actually required to produce evidence of any kind, and not producing evidence is not any evidence of guilt in itself as has been explained.\" Having reserved his objection, Dansdill's counsel moved again for a mistrial immediately after the jury was dismissed. The judge denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b644 Dansdill argues on appeal that the prosecutor's comments both improperly shifted the burden of proof to Dansdill and punished him for invoking his Fifth Amendment rights. We reject his first contention that the prosecutor's argument improperly shifted the burden of proof. As the trial court correctly found: \"The prosecution was entitled ... to rebut defense counsel's closing arguments about missing evidence and witnesses and the quality of the proof.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b645 In response to Dansdill's Fifth Amendment claim, the state maintains that it made no comment on Dansdill's decision not to testify. Rather, it argues, its prosecutor exclusively addressed Dansdill's equal authority to call the witnesses in question, a proper topic of rebuttal. We agree that the majority of the prosecutor's comments addressed that proper topic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b646 However, one portion of those comments concerns us. The prosecutor repeatedly stressed that \"Defendant\" was the person who was \"making the calls\" and \"receiving the calls\" in question and would therefore know if those calls were exculpatory. The prosecutor then stated that, if any of the people on the other end of those calls could exonerate Dansdill, the jury \"would have been hearing\n   <em>\n    about them\n   </em>\n   from the witness stand\" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b647 The state contends this argument was designed only to emphasize that Dansdill stood in the best position to evaluate the evidentiary value of the potential witnesses. The prosecutor's preceding and subsequent remarks-which clearly focused on the capability of the defendant to subpoena such witnesses-do support that contention. For this reason, and in light of the trial court's superior position to personally assess the arguments and gestures in question, we conclude the trial court correctly found that these particular remarks would not alone justify granting the dramatic remedy of a mistrial.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although the prosecutor's broader argument clearly focused on observing that the defendant was equally entitled to call witnesses, a reasonable jury could have understood that Dansdill himself was among the witnesses the defense could have called to testify. The prosecutor repeated that \"Defendant\" either received or made the calls and that Dansdill therefore best knew the content of the calls. This argument suggested that Dansdill would be the best witness of all. Then, rather than carefully redirecting the jury from this improper potential inference, the prosecutor continued in a fashion that suggested he might be referring to Dansdill in his capacity as a witness: \"So if any one of those people exonerated him, you could bet your bippy you would have been hearing\n   <em>\n    about them\n   </em>\n   from the witness stand.\" (Emphasis added.) As the prosecutor had implied in the prior sentence, only one witness could testify comprehensively\n   <em>\n    about\n   </em>\n   the topic in question: Dansdill himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b650 However, we do not assess arguments in isolation. Here, defense counsel-not the prosecutor-first focused the jury's attention on a topic that might logically cause it to consider Dansdill's failure to testify. He argued in summation that the state had failed to call certain witnesses whose identities and probable testimony were obviously known best to Dansdill. Thus, to the extent the jury might have understood the prosecutor's rebuttal argument to imply that Dansdill himself was the best possible witness, the defendant's own argument had already exposed the jury to that inference. Further, to properly rebut the defendant's argument, the prosecutor had no choice but to address a topic that necessarily triggered such inferences.

The state's case relied primarily on the testimony of the two first-hand witnesses, M.L. and M.G. Both were intoxicated at the time of the incident. Both repeatedly refused to provide the state with the evidence it sought under oath.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   One of them faced mandatory prison time on unrelated drug offenses and had been offered probation if she testified. Although ample evidence placed Dansdill at the scene of the crime with a gun, the only evidence of what Dansdill said-and thus the only evidence that he intended anything more than a poor joke among friends-was the testimony of these two problematic witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b655 The state's lone evidence that Dansdill issued a threat to secure repayment of money was the recorded statement of M.L. to detectives on the night of the incident. Yet, M.L. testified at trial (as at her deposition) that she did not recall any threats. None of M.G.'s recorded statements, which were played for the jury, made any reference to a threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b656 While we have concluded that a jury could reasonably have credited M.L.'s first statement to detectives-which suggested that Dansdill threatened the victims to collect a debt-the jury could also have questioned the sincerity of that threat in the context of the other testimony. Notably, the witnesses recalled that Dansdill initially behaved in a joking manner and made remarks suggesting he \"came in peace\" and intended to put the gun away. These remarks, together with Dansdill's historically close friendship with M.L., would have allowed a jury to reasonably conclude the gun was displayed as the foolish jest of an intoxicated defendant. According to the state, Dansdill fled the scene immediately after his gun discharged through the door, rather than staying to collect any money or even determine if anyone had been hurt. Thus, the evidence could have raised a reasonable doubt about whether Dansdill truly attempted to rob the victims at gunpoint. Indeed, during summation, the prosecutor himself acknowledged that one reasonable interpretation of the evidence was that Dansdill \"startled himself because he didn't mean to fire that shot.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b657 Given the ambiguity of the evidence presented, the questionable reliability of the only first-hand witnesses, and the state's burden to prove Dansdill guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, this was a close case on each of the indicted counts. For this reason, we are not \"confident beyond a reasonable doubt\" that the prosecutor's improper statements \"had no influence on the jury's judgment\" in this case, or that the verdict of guilt was \"surely unattributable\" to his misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Leteve\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329566\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/516/\">\n    237 Ariz. 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329566\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/516/\">\n    354 P.3d 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bible\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1501172\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/175/549/#p588\">\n    175 Ariz. at 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1501172\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/175/549/#p588\">\n    858 P.2d at 1191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12227\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/275/#p279\">\n    508 U.S. at 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12227\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/275/#p279\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b658 We have sometimes concluded that prejudice from improper argument has been \"cured by the trial court's instructions.\"\n   <em>\n    Gallardo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4056328\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/225/560/\">\n    225 Ariz. 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4056328\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/225/560/\">\n    242 P.3d 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It did not sustain Dansdill's objection to the state's characterization of felony murder as somehow \"lesser\" or \"less serious\" than premeditated first-degree murder. Thus, far from striking or disapproving those remarks, the court allowed the jury to consider them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court did remind the jury of the standard instruction that it should not \"consider[ ] one way or the other what the punishment may or may not be.\" But, in light of the prosecutor's summation and the court's refusal to restrict or correct it, a reasonable jury might have been confused about whether, or how, arguments about punishment could be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b660 We may also consider the repetitive nature of the errors in evaluating the state's argument that the verdict was \"surely unattributable\" to those errors.

That repetition not only renders it more likely that the jury gave the argument weight; it also suggests the prosecutor himself believed the improper argument was important rather than trivial to his case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b661 As previously noted, we must consider the impact of a prosecutor's remarks in their context.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boyde v.

The state characterized felony murder as a \"lesser\" and \"less serious\" form of murder after conceding it could not prove that the defendant even intended to fire the gun, much less that he intended to kill R.G. Those misleading comments had the effect of mollifying any jury concerns about clear weaknesses in the state's case, including whether Dansdill had been overcharged. Given the \"alternative\" charges in count one of the indictment before it, the jury in this case faced the unique task of distinguishing whether Dansdill committed second-degree murder, first-degree felony murder, or neither. In this context, the prosecutor's claim-that felony murder was \"less serious\" or a \"lesser\" offense because it did not require a showing of intent to kill-must have been especially confusing given that \"intent to kill\" is a necessary element of second-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b662 For all these reasons, this is not a case in which we \"can say beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
