Butts in contempt of court, and ordered him incarcerated for two hours. Butts in this action appeals from the summary order of the district court. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">The transcript of what occurred immediately before the judge found Butts in contempt is reproduced in an appendix to this opinion. At about 11:80 A. M. on December 7, 1972, during the cross-examination of a prosecution witness, Butts showed the witness a color photograph. The judge asked Butts to mark the photograph as an exhibit. When Butts indicated that he did not want to do so; the judge interrupted Butts and insisted that the photograph be marked. Butts offered to comply, but did so in a manner considered argumentative by the judge. An exchange between Butts and the judge ensued. The judge retired the jury. After the jury left the courtroom, the judge and Butts again became embroiled in argument. Finally, the judge ordered the marshal to put Butts in jail, and to keep him there until 1:80 P.M. The marshal followed the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">After Butts was removed from the courtroom, the judge entered the following order, entitled \u201cOrder Committing Charles D. Butts for Contempt of Court\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-9\">\u201cOn this the 7th day of December, 1972, the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, finds that Charles D. Butts, an Officer of the Court and attorney representing the defendant herein, is in such contempt of its authority as evidenced from the record herein as to amount to misbehavior of such officer in the presence of this Court or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice; further, that said Charles D. Butts, as evidenced by the record, has shown such disobedience or resistance to the orders, rules and commands of this Court as to amount to a summary contempt of its authority committed in the presence of the Court in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(1) (3); that as punishment for such summary contempt the Court finds that the said Charles D. Butts should be committed to the custody of the United States Marshal and placed in jail until 1:30 p. m. this date, when the Marshal shall return him to this Court for a continuance of the trial herein. That the contempt hereinabove described is an aecummulation [sic] of remarks of counsel made during the absence of the jury and is confined to such acts of contempt as were committed by the said Charles D. Butts in the absence of the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">(Supp.Rec.)</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">The government argues that because Butts has served his sentence of confinement under the district court\u2019s order, his appeal is moot. It is true that in St. Pierre v. United States, 1943, 319 U.S. 41, 42, 63 S.Ct. 910, 911, 87 L.Ed. 1199, the Court stated that \u201cthe case is moot because, after petitioner\u2019s service of his sentence and its expiration, there was no longer a subject matter on which the judgment of this Court could operate.\u201d However, the Court more recently has characterized the above-quoted words as \u201cbroad dictum\u201d which \u201cfails to take account of significant qualifications recognized in <em>St. Pierre </em>and developed in later cases.\u201d Sibron v. New York, 1968, 392 U.S. 40, 51, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 1896, 20 L.Ed.2d 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">One exception to the <em>St. Pierre </em>doctrine of mootness is the situation where a petitioner could not have brought his case to an appellate court for review before the expiration of his sentence. Si-bron v. New York, <em>supra, </em>at 51-53. In the present case, after the judge ordered, \u201cTake him to jail,\u201d Butts said, \u201cI will give notice of appeal of the Court\u2019s ruling, Your Honor.\u201d The judge re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>sponded, \u201cAll right. You are going to jail now.\u201d Although Butts did not explicitly ask for a stay of execution of the sentence, he clearly expressed his desire and intent to prosecute an appeal of the court\u2019s order. The judge on his part made it clear that Butts was going directly to jail, and that he was to be held there until 1:30 P.M. There was thus no way Butts could have secured review of his case prior to the expiration of his sentence. The doctrine of mootness is therefore inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Another qualification to the <em>St. Pierre </em>doctrine of mootness lends additional support to our rejection of the government\u2019s mootness argument. In <em>Sibron, </em>the Court stated that <em>St. Pierre </em>\u201cmust be read in light of later cases to mean that a criminal case is moot only if it is shown that there is no possibility that any collateral legal consequences will be imposed on the basis of the challenged conviction.\u201d 392 U.S. at 57.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2****Butts\u2019 conviction for contempt presumably could be used for impeachment and sentencing purposes in any future criminal proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This conviction would be especially damaging if Butts were ever again accused of being in contempt of court. Conviction for contempt of court could also have serious adverse career consequences for Butts. His conviction could provide a basis for disciplinary action by a bar association. Opportunities for appointment to the bench or to other high office might be foreclosed as a result of this blot upon his record. The conviction might damage Butts\u2019 reputation in the legal community, and this in turn might affect his ability to attract clients and to represent them effectively, especially in open court. In light of these possible collateral consequences, Butts\u2019 appeal is not \u201cabstract, feigned, or hypothetical\u201d so as to justify dismissal for mootness. See <em>Sibron, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">Rule 42(a) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure allows the judge to punish certain conduct summarily:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-14\">\u201c(a) <em>Summary Disposition. </em>A criminal contempt may be punished summarily if the judge certifies that he saw or heard the conduct constituting the contempt and that it was committed in the actual presence of the court. The order of contempt shall recite the facts and shall be signed by the judge and entered of record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-15\">Appellate courts have often acknowledged the danger of abuse inherent in a proceeding which does not provide all of the safeguards which normal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>ly surround criminal prosecutions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because of this danger, the procedural requirements of Rule 42(a) must be strictly observed. Pietsch v. President of United States, 2 Cir. 1970, 434 F.2d 861, 864 (Justice Clark); Widger v. United States, 5 Cir. 1957, 244 F.2d 103, 107. One of these requirements is that the order entered by the judge \u201cshall recite the facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">The recitation of the facts in the certificate serves an important purpose. As stated in Tauber v. Gordon, 3 Cir. 1965, 350 F.2d 843, 845 (en bane), \u201cThis requirement is more than a formality. It is essential to disclosure of the basis of decision with sufficient particularity to permit informed appellate review.\u201d A relatively recent Ninth Circuit opinion has expanded upon this idea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-6\">\u201c \u2018Informed appellate review\u2019 is possible only if the facts are stated in sufficient detail for the appellate court to determine whether the conduct upon which the conviction rests was contemptuous, factually and legally; whether it was of such character, and occurred in such circumstances, as to permit summary conviction under Rule 42(a), and because Rule 42 sentences are subject to appellate review and revision, whether the conduct relied upon justified the sentence imposed.\u201d United States v. Marshall, 9 Cir. 1971, 451 F.2d 372, 375.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-7\"> The order of contempt must recite the specific facts upon which the conviction is based. Conclusory language and general citations to the record are insufficient.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The order entered by the judge in the instant case does not recite the facts with particularity, and therefore does not satisfy Rule 42(a). The order states, \u201cThat the contempt hereinabove described is an accumulation of remarks of counsel made during the absence of the jury and is confined to such acts of contempt as were committed by the said Charles D. Butts in the absence of the jury.\u201d Although there were proceedings in chambers on December 6, the remarks to which the order refers are probably those which immediately preceded the finding of contempt on December 7. However, the order does not make clear exactly which of Butts\u2019 remarks the court considered contemptuous. To uphold Butts\u2019 conviction, we would have to engage in speculation and guesswork. This we refuse to do. We therefore are compelled to reverse Butts\u2019 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">From the sentence imposed by the judge in this case, it is clear that he was primarily concerned with the preservation of order in the courtroom during the trial in which Butts was participating. Since that trial is long since concluded, we think a proper disposition of this case is to reverse the order of contempt and to dismiss the proceedings against Butts.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">Reversed and rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b933-13\">MRS. JANE ROBERTS, a witness for the Government, having first been duly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>sworn, in answer to questions propounded, testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">ON CROSS-EXAMINATION:</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Questions by Mr. Butts:</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">**\u00ab\u2022*\u00bb*</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">Q Mrs. Roberts, I will hand you Defendant\u2019s Exhibit A, and I will ask you if that is a picture of David Schrimsher and your little boy, Tiger?</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">A Yes, that is a picture of David Schrimsher and my little boy, Tiger, but I certainly don\u2019t know when this was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">Q Well, maybe I can refresh your memory\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">A Wait a minute, he doesn\u2019t have\u2014 that is not my little boy\u2019s clothes, I can tell you that right now.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">Q Is it your little boy ?</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">A It looks like my little boy, but then again, that is not a very good picture, and I have never seen anything like this before, so I don\u2019t know what you are trying to pull.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-13\">Q Trying to pull ?</p>\n<p id=\"b934-14\">A I am sorry, but\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b934-15\">Q All right. Now, you told this young man not only that your grandfather, Mr. Barrakat, I take it, was supposed to be his name ?</p>\n<p id=\"b934-16\">A My grandfather\u2019s name is Lloyd Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-17\">Q Well, did you tell him, did you tell this young man that your grandfather\u2019s name was Barrakat?</p>\n<p id=\"b934-18\">A Yes, I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-19\">Q Did you tell this young man anything about a man out of Chicago by the name of Marcus ?</p>\n<p id=\"b934-20\">A No.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-21\">Q Do you know a man out of Chicago by the name of Marcus ?</p>\n<p id=\"b934-22\">A No.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-23\">Q That is connected with your family?</p>\n<p id=\"b934-24\">A No.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-25\">Q You recognize this picture (indicating), do you not?</p>\n<p id=\"b934-26\">THE COURT: Mark it as an exhibit, please, Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-27\">MR. BUTTS: Well, I don\u2019t believe I want to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b934-28\">THE COURT: Well, you mark it as an exhibit, I said mark it, you showed it to her, and I want to know what you showed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-29\">MR. BUTTS: All right, I will do that upon instructions of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-30\">THE COURT: Well, you will follow the instructions of the Court all right.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-31\">MR. BUTTS: That is exactly what I am doing, if the Court please.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-32\">THE COURT: All right, don\u2019t argue with me.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-33\">MR. BUTTS: Let the record reflect I am not arguing with the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-34\">THE COURT: Just shut up then.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-35\">MR. BUTTS: Let the record reflect I resent the Court telling me to shut up, I am an officer of this court\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b934-36\">THE COURT: All right, the jury will be retired, retire the jury from the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-37\">(The jury then left the courtroom).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-38\">THE COURT: Now, Mr. Butts, you are going to get one thing straight\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b934-39\">MR. BUTTS: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-40\">THE COURT: If you are going to stay an officer in this court, and you are going to stay out of jail, you are going to follow my orders, and you are not going to talk back when I tell you to not talk back, you understand that ?</p>\n<p id=\"b934-41\">MR. BUTTS: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-42\">THE COURT: All right. I want it clearly understood, and I am going to carry this, as to whether I find you in contempt of the court, or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-43\">MR. BUTTS: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-44\">THE COURT: And I don\u2019t want it to happen again, when you show an exhibit to a witness, and I tell you to mark it, I mean mark it, because I am going to know what you showed her \u2014 that witness \u2014 so that the record will reflect it. Now, don\u2019t play with me. Bring the jury back.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>MR. BUTTS: May I state something for the record?</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">THE COURT: Not a word, I told you to shut up, now, I mean it. Now, you just go ahead and examine your witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">MR. BUTTS: For the record, I wanted\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">THE COURT: For the record nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">MR. BUTTS: Let the record reflect I cannot speak\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">THE COURT: That is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">MR. BUTTS: \u2014-my understanding of the Court\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">THE COURT: I am not interested in your understanding of th\u00e9 Court. I want you to take your instructions from me.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">MR. BUTTS: I do, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-13\">THE COURT: All right. Well, now, you be quiet when I tell you to be quiet in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">MR. BUTTS: If I have something that is germane to my client \u2014 ?</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">THE COURT: You may retire the jury and put it in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-16\">MR. BUTTS: Thank you, Your Hon- or.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-17\">THE COURT: But you are not to talk back to me in the presence of this jury. I am running this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-18\">MR. BUTTS: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-19\">THE COURT: And as long as you are an officer in this court, you are under my control.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-20\">MR. BUTTS: If the Court considers my talking like I did as talking back, if that is what the Court understands, I certainly apologize because I have practiced law a long time and I don\u2019t do that to courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-21\">THE COURT: You may have practiced before, but you also disclosed your gross ignorance of some things that go on in Federal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-22\">MR. BUTTS: That would be a matter of opinion, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-23\">THE COURT: Well, that is a matter of opinion. There you go again, you are insulting, you are not conducting yourself as you should, you are the first attorney that I ever had this kind of trouble with. Now, you follow my instructions hereafter, if you want to remain an officer and practice in this court. Bring the jury back.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-25\">MR. BUTTS: I take exception to the Court\u2019s comments for the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-26\">THE COURT: Marshal, put this man in jail. Where is the marshal ?</p>\n<p id=\"b935-27\">THE MARSHAL: Right here.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-28\">THE COURT: We will just have a recess. You go over and think it over for an hour, then you tell me whether you are ready to follow my orders, or ready to shut up when I tell you to shut up.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-29\">MR. BUTTS: I am ready, but I wanted to take an exception\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b935-30\">THE COURT: You got your exceptions in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-31\">MR. BUTTS: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-32\">THE COURT: You have your exceptions. You don\u2019t have to except in the Federal Court, it is in the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-33\">MR. BUTTS: Thank you.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-34\">THE COURT: You have your objection. All you have to do is make your objection. That is something else you \u25a0 don\u2019t know, apparently. I am going to sentence this man to one hour in jail in contempt of this proceeding. I am going to recess this case until 1:30. Take him to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-35\">MR. BUTTS: I will give notice of appeal of the Court\u2019s ruling, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-36\">THE COURT: All right. You are going to jail now.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-37\">MR.

The Court in <em>Sibron </em>noted that the appellant\u2019s misdemeanor conviction could be used for impeachment and sentencing purposes in future criminal proceedings. In Ginsberg v. New York, 1968, 390 U.S. 629, 633 n. 2, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195, the doctrine of mootness was not applied because it was possible that the appellant\u2019s license to operate a luncheonette might be withdrawn in consequence of his conviction. In Street v. New York, 1969, 394 U.S. 576, 579-580 n. 3, 89 S.Ct. 1354, 22 L.Ed.2d 572, the proceedings were not moot in part because the appellant\u2019s employer, the New York Transit Authority, had instituted disciplinary proceedings against him as a result of his conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b932-6\">. In Bloom v. Illinois, 1968, 391 U.S. 194, 201, 88 S.Ct. 1477, 1481, 20 L.Ed.2d 522, the Supreme Court states that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-9\">\u201cCriminal contempt is a crime in the ordinary sense; it is a violation of the law, a public wrong which is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both. In the words of Mr. Justice Holmes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-17\">\u201c \u2018These contempts are infractions of the law, visited with punishment as such. If such acts are not criminal, we are in error as to the most fundamental characteristic of crimes as that word has been understood in English speech.\u2019 Gompers v. United States, 233 U.S. 604, 610, 34 S.Ct. 693, 695, 58 L.Ed. 1115 (1914). Criminally contemptuous conduct may violate other provisions of the criminal law; but even when this is not the case convictions for criminal contempt are indistinguishable from ordinary criminal convictions, for their impact on the individual defendant is the same. Indeed, the role of criminal contempt and that of many ordinary criminal laws seem identical \u2014 protection of the institutions of our government and enforcement of their mandates.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b933-14\">.
