On the same day, Charles gave the same number of shares to each of his children and to each child of the taxpayer. Similar reciprocal transactions were effected on February 4, 1966, and February 14, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-21\">The taxpayer claimed an annual $3,000 exclusion with respect to each year for each of the nephews and nieces. This claim was disallowed upon the basis that the primary purpose of the reciprocal transactions was for each brother to effect enlarged gifts to his own children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-22\">Relying on United States v. Estate of Grace, 395 U.S. 316, 89 S.Ct. 1730, 23 L.Ed.2d 332 (1969), the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>held that \u201cactual intent\u201d was \u201cimmaterial\u201d and that the only issue was the \u201cnature and operative effect of the transfers themselves.\u201d Thereupon, he directed a verdict for the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\"> We need not reach the issue of whether this rule of <em>Grace </em>applies with equal force in the area of indirect gifts, for we hold that, on the facts of this case, a reasonable jury could have concluded only that the taxpayer intended to benefit his children, rather than those of his brother, by the gifts in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
