Mrs. Breeden attempted to prove that she had actually earned wages during quarters for which the Secretary\u2019s records showed none, but she encountered an administrative requirement that she prove her case \u201cclearly and convincingly.\u201d The district court affirmed the denial of coverage. The issues on Mrs. Breeden\u2019s appeal are: (1) whether the Social Security Act requires the claimant to prove her ease by more than a normal preponderance of the evidence; (2) whether the administrative decision is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-18\">Mrs. Breeden filed an application for disability benefits in 1969. Upon discovering that her Social Security wage records showed a deficit in covered quarters, she began trying to prove that she had earned wages between 1957 and 1963 in addition to those that appeared on her record. Several of the employers had since gone out of business;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> others had discarded records that would prove or disprove Mrs. Breeden\u2019s claims. Consequently, her supporting evidence was limited to affidavits and testimony of people who had known her during the periods in question. Most of her witnesses were relatives, some were friends, others were coworkers and acquaintances, and one was the wife of a former employer. If any substantial part of their testimony were accepted, it would establish coverage for more than the two quarters that Mrs. Breeden lacked. But the administrative law judge rejected all the testimony, including Mrs. Breeden\u2019s own account of her work history. He indicated distrust for the testimony of \u201cfriends and kinfolk.\u201d He complained repeatedly that none of the witnesses produced written records and that much of their testimony was inexact. And he insisted that Mrs. Breeden prove her case \u201cclearly and convincingly.\u201d On these grounds he concluded that she had not carried her burden of proof. The appeals counsel adopted his findings and conclusions, and Mrs. Breeden petitioned the district court for review. The district judge remanded the case for more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>evidence, indicating that the denial of benefits was not supported by substantial evidence. On remand, the appeals council accepted several pieces of documentary evidence that Mrs. Breeden\u2019s attorney offered, but reaffirmed the original decision without convening another hearing. Taking the case a second time on substantially the same record as before, the district judge held that Mrs. Breeden had the burden of proving coverage by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d On a survey of the record he concluded that her evidence did not meet that standard and that the administrative decision was therefore based on substantial evidence. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">The Social Security Act creates a scale of evidentiary weight for the Secretary\u2019s wage records. It provides that entries in the records shall serve as evidence of the amounts of wages paid and that the absence of entries shall constitute evidence that no wages were paid. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(3) (1970). The records are open to revision for a period of three years, three months, and 15 days. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 405(c)(1)(B), (c)(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After that period expires, an entry acquires conclusive weight, but the absence of an entry merely stands as \u201cpresumptive evidence\u201d that no wages were paid. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 405(c)(4)(A), (B). Records of self-employment income are also given conclusive effect at the end of the time period. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 405(c)(4)(C). Consequently, a claimant cannot dispute the accuracy of a wage entry or a self-employment income record after the time limit expires, but is allowed to prove that a blank wage record is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">The meaning of \u201cpresumptive evidence\u201d in section 405(c)(4)(B) is unclear. The agency\u2019s regulations simply repeat the words of the statute without explaining them. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.804 (1973). Judicial attempts to outline the effect of the statute have gone no further than declarations to the effect that the presumption can be rebutted by \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence. <em>E. g., </em>Thacker v. Gardner, 268 F.Supp. 663, 665 (W.D.Va.), aff\u2019d, 387 F.2d 387 (4th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 1017, 88 S.Ct. 1272, 20 L.Ed.2d 168 (1968) ; <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Williams v. Celebrezze, 243 F.Supp. 103, 107 (E.D.Ark.1965). In this case the district court reasoned that because the claimant initially bears the burden of proving coverage, the presumption must enhance the burden of persuasion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1093-11\">The Court concludes that it requires the plaintiff to prove that she was covered by the Act during the quarters in question by clear and convincing evidence, by stronger evidence than would be needed had the absence of official records been simply not relevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1093-12\">We disagree with the district court\u2019s characterization of the claimant\u2019s burden of proof. It is true that the claimant has the burden of producing evidence in support of his claim and that his claim for benefits may properly be denied if his evidence is insufficient to persuade the Secretary. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.701(b) (1973). In another context we have implied that a Social Security claimant need not prove his administrative case beyond a preponderance of the evidence, Cyrus v. Celebrezze, 341 F.2d 192 (4th Cir. 1965); Thomas v. Celebrezze, 331 F.2d 541, 545 (4th Cir. 1964),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and we think the statutory presumption involved here does not alter that rule. As a general rule, presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>tions do not operate to raise the standard of proof. Their common effect is to shift the burden of producing evidence and, some say, the burden of persuasion. <em>Compare </em>McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 345 (Cleary ed. 1972), <em>with </em>9 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 2490-93 (3d ed. 1940). <em>See </em>Garland v. Cox, 472 F.2d 875, 877-878 (4th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, Slayton v. Garland, 414 U.S. 908, 94 S.Ct. 217, 38 L.Ed.2d 146 (1973). If the presumption operates against a party who already has the burden of proof, it does not necessarily convert a preponderance standard into something stiffer. <em>See </em>McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 345, at 829.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, the policies underlying, a particular presumption govern the measure of persuasion required to escape its effect. <em>Id. </em>at 822-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\"> The progression of evidentiary value embodied in the Social Security Act \u2014 evidence, presumptive evidence, and conclusive effect \u2014 suggests that the provision concerning blank wage records reflects congressional sensitivity to the need to balance two somewhat conflicting purposes. One purpose, akin to the supposed rationale for statutes of limitation, is to guard against false claims after contradictory evidence is unavailable. But Congress did not write a statute of limitations for contradicting blank wage records, as it did for self-employment income reports. The different treatment afforded to blank wage records suggests a second purpose \u2014 that Congress intended <em>not </em>to penalize wage earners for the carelessness or dishonesty of their employers. A requirement of proof by clear and convincing evidence would all but destroy this secondary congressional intent. Applying a preponderance standard to the claimant\u2019s evidence affords the government reasonable protection against spurious claims and also makes it possible to establish valid ones. We hold that the claimant need not persuade the administrative law judge by any standard of \u201chigh probability\u201d; she need only persuade him that it is more probable than not that she received the wages she claims. This is the meaning of the rubric common in jury trials: \u201csatisfied by the greater weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>See </em>McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 339, at 794-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-10\">On review of the administrative law judge\u2019s decision, we do not assess the record to decide whether Mrs. Breeden proved her claim by a preponderance of the evidence. Our function is limited to deciding whether the administrative decision is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We must decide, therefore, what weight to accord the statutory presumption on substantial evidence review when the record contains contradictory evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-11\">Under the Thayer \u201cbursting bubble\u201d theory of presumptions, the presumption is a procedural rule that governs the outcome only when the record contains no contradictory evidence. McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 345; 9 Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 2491 (3d ed. 1940). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>Supreme Court once applied this theory to an administrative presumption in the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920 (1970),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> holding that the presumption had no evidentiary force on review of the administrative decision. Del Vec-chio v. Bowers, 296 U.S. 280, 56 S.Ct. 190, 80 L.Ed. 229 (1935).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This court chose the same approach in Garland v. Cox, 472 F.2d 875, 879 (4th Cir. 1973), giving purely procedural effect to a presumption that late appointment of counsel was prejudicial to the defendant in a criminal case. The structure of the Social Security Act, however, precludes similar treatment of the presumption involved here. Unlike the statute in <em>Del Vecchio, </em>which creates certain presumptions \u201cin the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary,\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920 (1970), the Social Security Act provides that the absence of a record entry shall be \u201cpresumptive evidence\u201d that no wages were paid- \u2014 whether or not there is other evidence. We think the Congress did not intend the presumption to evaporate when contrary evidence is introduced. Instead, we hold this presumption survives the offering of contradictory evidence and thereafter <em>may </em>itself constitute substantial evidence that no wages were paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\">But that the administrative judge may choose to accord it continuing weight does not end the inquiry. Under the standards of Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951), we must review the entire record, taking into account both the support for the administrative decision and \u201cwhatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488, 71 S.Ct. at 464. If reliance on the presumption is arbitrary or if it is not \u201cjustified by a fair estimate of the worth of the testimony of witnesses\u201d who support the claimant, <em>id. </em>at 490, 71 S.Ct. at 466, we must conclude that the administrative decision is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-11\">In this case Mrs. Breeden presented evidence relating to seven periods of employment that did not appear on her Social Security record. The Social Security records showed a small amount of wages for one of these periods, and the administrative law judge correctly denied Mrs. Breeden\u2019s attempt to prove that she had earned more than the employer had reported. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(4)(A) (1970). The administrative law judge rejected all of the evidence Mrs. Breeden offered on the six periods for which the records were blank, primarily on his assessment of the witnesses\u2019 credibility. For three of these periods we are satisfied that his conclusion is supported by substantial evidence. Mrs. Breeden\u2019s evidence was sketchy and the corroboration she offered was weak.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But for the three re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>maining periods we conclude that he dealt arbitrarily with the testimony and ignored the weight of the evidence. In those instances we hold that his findings on the witnesses\u2019 credibility and his reliance on the statutory presumption were arbitrary and that his decision is unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">\n<em>1959 and 1960:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">Mrs. Breeden testified that she had worked in an orchard owned by R. S. Graves in Syria, Virginia, in the fall of 1959 and the summer and fall of 1960. She testified that she worked in the packing shed grading apples from the first of October to the middle of November in 1959, when she quit because her baby was ill. She was paid $6 a day for five and one-half days of work per week, for a salary of $33 per week. Her six weeks of work would have entitled her to one quarter of agricultural coverage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In 1960, she testified, she picked peaches for about six weeks in the summer at a salary of $6 per day, five and one-half days a week. On about September 20, 1960, she began picking apples. Apple pickers were paid ten cents per bushel with a bonus of two cents per bushel contingent on a full season\u2019s work. She testified that she made between $50 and $75 a week until the first of November, when she began working in the packing shed for $33 a week. She finished work just before Christmas of 1960, when she received a bonus check for $339, which apparently included her husband\u2019s two-eent bonus as well as her own. According to plaintiff\u2019s calculations, her wages for 1960 amounted to over $1,000, which would entitle her to a full four quarters of coverage for the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-10\">Eight witnesses corroborated various parts of Mrs. Breeden\u2019s testimony. Her sister, Diane Shiflett, testified that she worked in the packing shed with Mrs. Breeden for three days in 1959 but that she had to quit because she was pregnant. She remembered that her husband had continued to work in the orchard, riding to work with Mrs. Breeden throughout the apple season. Her husband, Floyd Shiflett, also testified that he rode to work with Mrs. Breeden during the 1959 season and that the packing shed salary was about $5 a day. Mrs. Evelyn Shela, who was only 12 or 13 years old in 1959, testified that she had worked with Mrs. Breeden in the packing shed in either 1959 or 1960, and that the salary was $5 a day. Mrs. Anna Meadows, Mrs. Breeden\u2019s sister, testified that she worked in the Graves orchard every apple season from 1959 to 1963. She said that Mrs. Breeden had worked in 1959, and that she had \u201chauled hands\u201d to the orchard. Mrs. Meadows testified that in 1960 Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>Breeden picked peaches and apples and then worked in the packing shed. She corroborated Mrs. Breeden\u2019s testimony about the salary: $6 per day in the packing shed, and ten cents per bushel picking apples, with a two-cent bonus at season\u2019s end. She testified that her average salary picking apples was $50 to $60 per week. Mr. Sanford Geer testified that he picked peaches at the Graves orchard in either 1959 or 1960, that Mrs. Breeden was working there at the same time, and that he rode to work with her. He worked for three or four weeks at a salary of $6 per day. Mr. Jesse Meadows submitted an affidavit stating that he had worked with Mrs. Breeden in the Graves orchard in 1959, and that he rode to work with Floyd Shiflett and Mrs. Breeden. He testified that Mrs. Breeden worked about six weeks, until her baby got sick. He said that in 1960 Mrs-. Breeden worked from July through December, picking peaches, picking apples, and working in the packing shed. Mr. W. H. Conley, Jr., testified by deposition that he had worked with Mrs. Breeden in the orchard in 1959 and 1960. Following remand, Mrs. Breeden submitted the affidavit of Mr. Eddie Geer. Mr. Geer\u2019s affidavit stated that he had worked at the Graves orchard during apple season in 1959 and 1960. He said that Mrs. Breeden worked in the packing shed in 1959 and that she picked apples and worked in the packing shed in 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">The administrative law judge rejected all this testimony. In general, he complained that it was imprecise and incredible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-7\">The wisdom of the statutory presumption as to wages which pere paid after a time limitation passes is exemplified in a case such as this where an individual, without any records whatsoever and without any record by her alleged employers stating that she was gainfully employed during specific periods, appears and alleges by means of a large group of kinfolk and friends that she did, in fact, work in periods 7 to 13 years, in the past. Memories are short and the passage of time erodes our impressions. What the claimant has done is to bring together a collection of kinfolk and friends, all of whom with aplomb and with such answers as, \u201cI think\u201d, etc., corroborate the claimant\u2019s story as to events which happened a long time ago. The Hearing Examiner, after viewing these witnesses and the affidavits produced, could not find their statements and testimony contained any degree of credence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1097-11\">Administrative Transcript at 10. Because no single witness could testify to all the exact dates and the exact amounts, and because several of the witnesses were Mrs. Breeden\u2019s relatives, he rejected the testimony of each witness. His treatment of Sanford Geer\u2019s testimony is illustrative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-12\">The testimony of Mr. Geer similarly was based on such statements as, \u201cI made <em>about \u2018X\u2019 dollars, </em>I worked <em>about \u2018X\u2019 weeks\u201d. </em>He did not demonstrate a reasonable knowledge of the exact time Mrs. Breeden worked there, if at all, how much salary she received, her productive capacity while working, etc. This testimony is not substantial and probative of the claimant\u2019s work allegations in 1959 and 1960.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1097-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 13 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-14\">The Appeals Council took an even more arbitrary position on remand. Commenting on the affidavit submitted by Mr. Eddie Geer, it noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1097-15\">The Appeals Council does not doubt the claimant\u2019s reputation for truth and veracity, nor that of Mr. Geer. However, Mr. Geer\u2019s statement is based solely on his memory of events of nearly 13 years ago and is not supported by any records. Memories, even though well intentioned, are not infallible and the passage of time can dim and distort recollections not refreshed by contemporaniously [sic] made notes and records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1097-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 313. The substantial effect of such an administrative attitude is to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>write both the statute and the regulations. Neither require that the claimant have written records, nor, a fortiori, that each corroborating witness have kept a record of Mrs. Breeden\u2019s work. The regulation promulgated pursuant to the authority of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(a) (1970) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-4\">The amounts of earnings credited to an individual and the periods to which such earnings are credited may be proved by the records of the Administration and <em>by other evidence of probative value </em>subject to the limitations prescribed in Subpart I of this part.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_0e\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.702 (1973) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\"><em>We </em>recognize that the administrative law judge has the unique advantage of having heard the testimony firsthand, and ordinarily we may not disturb credibility findings that are based on a witness\u2019s demeanor. But administrative findings based on oral testimony are not sacrosanct, and if it appears that credibility determinations are based on improper or irrational criteria they cannot be sustained. Page v. Celebrezze, 311 F.2d 757 (5th Cir. 1963); Victor Products Corp. v. NLRB, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 56, 208 F.2d 834 (1953); 4 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 29.06 (1958, Supp.1970). In this case the administrative law judge refused to accept any of the testimony of \u201cfriends and kinfolk,\u201d not because it was unbelievable but because of the source. But neither the statute, the regulations, nor common sense disqualifies such persons from testifying. The administrative law judge rejected testimony out of hand because it did not establish exact dates and precise wages, but neither the statute nor the regulations require exactitude or precision. We think the fact finder unlawfully fashioned his own exclusionary rule: without some sort of records live testimony will be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">We agree that a witness\u2019s memory of details is relevant to 'his credibility, but it cannot be determinative in a situation where the witness was never in a position to know exactly when another person began work or the exact amount of another person\u2019s paycheck. Nor can a witness\u2019s testimony be rejected solely because it corroborates only one detail of the claimant\u2019s testimony. It is also unreasonable to insist that wages be proved precisely. Mrs. Bree-den\u2019s testimony, corroborated in each particular by one or more witnesses, fairly established that she worked for about six weeks in 1959 at a salary of $33 per week. Even if her salary is calculated on the lowest wage figure cited \u2014$5 per day \u2014 -the result is a salary of $27.50 per week, enough to give her credit for one quarter of agricultural wages. For 1960, her corroborated testimony establishes four more quarters of credit. She presented corroboration for three to four weeks of peach picking at $33 per week, six weeks of apple picking at $50 to $75 per week, and about six weeks of apple grading at $33 per week. Using the smallest estimates, these figures add up to almost $600, well over the $400 needed to establish four covered quarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-9\">In assessing the credibility of five of these witnesses, the administrative law judge noted that the Social Security Administration had no <em>record </em>that they had worked for the Graves orchard. From this, he apparently inferred that the testimony was collusive \u2014 an inference contrary to the congressional scheme that clearly permits oral correction of blank records. That none of them appear on the employment records is, of course, relevant to their credibility, but it is also relevant to the accuracy of the Graves orchard\u2019s Social Security reporting. Early in her testimony Mrs. Bree-den stated: \u201cI think if you will check the record R. S. Graves, a lot of these names, you can get it, you can find out why I didn\u2019t get credit up there, and I\u2019ve heard a lot of them say that they didn\u2019t get any credit either.\u201d Adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>trative Transcript at 83. Moreover, in response to administrative inquiry about wages paid to Minnie Breeden in 1958, 1959, and 1963, R. S. Graves replied: \u201cHave no Record of Minnie F. Breeden working. If worked any did not make enough to pay SS on.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243. This representation is specifically refuted by the Social Security records, which show that R. S. Graves reported $67 of wages for Minnie Breeden in 1963. Finally, the wage record of each witness is consistent with the hypothesis that he or she worked for R. S. Graves and simply received no credit; each record contains no entry for the quarter in question.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Whether or not this evidence proves a consistent pattern of nonreporting, it certainly precludes firm reliance on this employer\u2019s wage records in determining the witnesses\u2019 credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">\n<em>Spring 1963:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">Mrs. Breeden\u2019s Social Security account includes wages paid by the Green Circle Truck Stop in Zions Cross Roads, Virginia, between April 1962 and August 1963 with the exception of a single quarter, April to June 1963. Mrs. Bree-den testified that she worked continuously at that job and that the gap in the Social Security record must have been a mistake. Mrs. Birtie Powell, who had operated the truck stop jointly with her husband, testified that Mrs. Breeden worked \u201cstraight through\u201d from the time she began working until she quit, with the possible exception of two or three weeks. In an affidavit she stated that Mrs. Breeden had been paid $45 per week plus board; at the hearing she gave the salary figure as $35 per week. In rejecting Mrs. Powell\u2019s testimony altogether, the trial examiner emphasized this discrepancy and stated that there was no evidence that Mrs. Powell was \u201cinvolved in the day to day running of this business,\u201d or that she maintained any records. But Mrs. Powell did testify that she and her husband operated the truck stop, and the administrative law judge\u2019s conclusion to the contrary has no basis in fact. Nor does the salary difference discredit Mrs. Powell; Mrs. Breeden had testified earlier that her weekly wages were $35 when she first took the job and $45 at the end. We think Mrs. Powell\u2019s testimony furnished strong corroboration for Mrs. Breeden\u2019s testimony. It was the best evidence available at the time, since Mr. Powell had died and the business\u2019s records could not be traced through several changes of ownership. Though Mrs. Powell was not the sole proprietress, her testimony is equivalent to evidence furnished by an employer to the effect that the Social Security records are in error. The administrative trial judge\u2019s reliance on the presumption in this instance was unreasonable and cannot be deemed supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-9\">We conclude that the administrative decision denying coverage was not supported by substantial evidence. Ordinarily we would remand to give the Secretary an opportunity to apply the correct legal standard. This case, however, has been pending in the agency and the courts for almost five years and has been remanded once before for additional evidence. The statute governing review in Social Security cases authorizes us to reverse the Secretary\u2019s decision \u201cwith or without remanding the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>for a rehearing.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We have previously exercised this discretion. <em>E. g., </em>Cyrus v. Celebrezze, 341 F.2d 192 (4th Cir. 1965); Thomas v. Celebrezze, 331 F.2d 541 (4th Cir. 1964); Underwood v. Ribicoff, 298 F.2d 850 (4th Cir. 1962). Under this statute, we think it appropriate to reverse without remanding where the record does not contain substantial evidence to support a decision denying coverage under the correct legal standard and when reopening the record for more evidence would serve no purpose. Wayne v. Finch, 313 F.Supp. 898, 902 (M.D.N.C. 1969); <em>cf. </em>Nelms v. Gardner, 386 F.2d 971 (6th Cir. 1967); Egan v. Gardner, 277 F.Supp. 929, 932 (N.D.Cal.1968). Because both circumstances are present in this case, we will not delay the case further by remanding to the Secretary on this issue. Instead we remand to the district judge, who should enter judgment for the claimant and direct the Secretary to pay her such benefits, if any, to which she may be entitled under the law and the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"aja-dedup-0\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1092-15\">. One, the Haynes Sportswear plant at Ruckersville, Virginia, had become insolvent soon after Mrs. Breeden left her job there. The employees were forced to attach a truckload of underwear to get their wages. When Mrs. Breeden filed her Social Security claim, none of the company\u2019s records could be located.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1093-8\">. Some records may be revised after tbe period expires, but the grounds for revision are limited. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(c)(5) (1970) ; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.805, 404.806 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1093-9\">. This court\u2019s affirmance in Thacker v. Gardner did not necessarily approve the district court\u2019s apparent insistence on \u201cpositive evidence.\u201d Our per curiam opinion merely noted that there was substantial evidence to support the administrative decision. The evidence supporting the claimant\u2019s case was apparently far weaker than that in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1093-14\">. Under the substantial evidence standard of review, we have few occasions to describe the burden of proof that a claimant bears in administrative proceedings. In <em>Gyrus </em>and <em>Thomas </em>we said that disability claimants are not required to prove their cases beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">. As McCormick notes, the proposed federal rules of evidence do not provide for an increased measure of persuasion. McCormick, <em>\u25a0supra, </em>\u00a7 345, at 829 n.85. Proposed rule 301 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-8\">In all cases not otherwise provided for by Act of Congress or by these rules a presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of proving that the nonexistence of the presumed fact is more probable than its existence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9o\">This standard echoes McCormick\u2019s definition of \u201cproof by a preponderance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 339, at 794. Although this rule does not directly control the impact of presumptions in administrative proceedings, we think it persuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1094-12\">. This court has previously held that our function in reviewing district court decisions on Social Security cases is not defined by Fed.R.Civ.P. 52. Instead the issue before us, as before the district judge, is the sub-stantiality of the evidence to support the administrative findings. Thomas v. Cele-brezze, 331 F.2d 541 (4th Cir. 1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1094-13\">. For a discussion of this issue in the context of common law presumptions, <em>see </em>Maryland ex rel. Geils v. Baltimore Transit Co., 329 F.2d 738 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 842, 85 S.Ct. 80, 13 L.Ed.2d 47 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">. Subsequent cases reviewing decisions under this statute raise some doubt about the continuing validity of the unqualified language in <em>Del Vecehio. </em>In Cardillo v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 330 U.S. 469, 474, 67 S.Ct. 801, 91 L.Ed. 1028 (1947), and O\u2019Keeffe v. Smith, Hinchman &amp; Grylls Associates, Inc., 380 U.S. 359, 361, 85 S.Ct. 1012, 13 L.Ed.2d 895 (1965), the Court ascribed some significance to the presumption on review of the administrative decision. The three cases may nonetheless be consistent if <em>Gardillo </em>and <em>O\u2019Keeffe </em>represent use of the presumption as an expression of the Act\u2019s purposes rather than as evidence of the disputed facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">. The evidence relating to these periods was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-9\"><em>Spring 1957: </em>Mrs. Breeden testified that she had worked for a restaurant in Hy-attsville, Maryland, for six weeks in the spring of 1957. Although she described the exact location, she could not remember the name of the cafe or its owner. She offered a supporting affidavit from a Mr. Therwan-ger but the administrative law judge refused to accept it, declaring that it was inexact and that it did not state the source of the affiant\u2019s knowledge. We think this ruling was error because the affidavit declared that Mr. Therwanger had gotten the job for Mrs. Breeden and it gave reasonably precise information about the salary and the length of time she worked. Nonetheless, accepting the affidavit and Mrs. Breeden\u2019s testimony at face value, we cannot say that the evidence was strong enough to make reliance on the presumption arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number><em>Fall </em>1957: Mrs. Breeden testified that she picked apples in the Red Apple Orchard in Martinsburg, West Virginia, from September to December 1957. She produced two witnesses, her sister and brotlier-in-law, who testified that they had lived with her while she worked in the orchard at that time. On inquiry from the administrative law judge, the orchard responded that it had no record of Mrs. Breeden but that her ' husband had worked there in 1957. This employment appeared on Mr. Breeden\u2019s Social Security record. Although Mrs. Bree-den testified that she and her husband were paid separately and that his wage records did not account for the money she made, neither of her witnesses could testify that the orchard had paid her separately. Consequently, we cannot say that the adverse ruling on this point was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-11\"><em>Summer 1961: </em>Mrs. Breeden\u2019s Social Security record showed that she worked for Haynes Sportswear in Ruckersville, Virginia, in the quarter ending December 1961. She tried to prove that she had begun working there in July 1961 and should thus be credited with the quarter ending September 1961. Again, her testimony was quite positive, but none of her witnesses could specifically corroborate her testimony that she worked there before September 1961. Accordingly, we cannot say that the administrative law judge\u2019s reliance on the statutory presumption was unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1096-12\">. Agricultural wages are not credited strictly by dates but by amounts. A worker is entitled to one quarter of credit for $100 of agricultural wages, up to the limit of four quarters credit in a calendar year. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 413(a) (2) (iv) (1970) ; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.103(c) (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">. The only relevant limitation in Subpart I is an almost verbatim repetition of the statutory provision. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.804 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">. If believed, Mrs. Breeden\u2019s testimony about the amounts the orchard deducted from her wages would suggest other irregularities in its Social Security record-keeping. Mrs. Breeden testified that the employer deducted $10 for Social Security at the end of her work in 1959, though her wages amounted to less than $200. She testified that in 1960 the orchard deducted $10 from her wages in the peach season (about $100), $10 from her wages in the apple season (at least $480), and $12 from the bonus cheek ($339). In 1963 she testified that she earned about $600 working for R. S. Graves and that they deducted $12 from her wages, telling her that Social Security had gone up. That was the year that R. S. Graves reported paying Mrs. Breeden wages of $67.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1100-14\">. Because the statute authorizes reversal, review of Social Security cases is unusual, if not unique, in the field of administrative law. The Federal Communications Act also authorizes reversal, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(h), but the administrative decisions under review are substantially different from those made under the Social Security Act. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>16(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs judicial review in the absence of a specific statute like section 405(g), does not authorize reversal. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706. The standard legislative text in special statutory review authorizes the court to affirm, modify, or set aside an administrative decision, but not to reverse outright. <em>E. g., </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(c) (FTC) ; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77i, 78y (SEC) ; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r (EPC); <em>cf. </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(f) (NLRB; enforce, modify or set aside). Under some forms of statutory review courts cannot modify administrative orders. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 348(g)(2), 371(f)(3) (FDA; affirm or set aside) ; 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921 (Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Worker\u2019s Compensation Act; enforce, suspend, or set aside).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
