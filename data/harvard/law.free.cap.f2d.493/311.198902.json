Appellants claim that there was never a valid settlement. We agree and, therefore, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">On August 22, 1969, Andres Hall sued under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688, for injuries allegedly suffered on August 23, 1968 while he. was employed on the S. S. Hope, allegedly owned by the People to People Health Foundation and operated by the Grace Line. Hall claimed that because of appellants\u2019 negligence a fire pump on which he was working leaked and sprayed him with scalding water which caused him to twist in such a manner that his neck was injured. Appellants\u2019 answer denied liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">On a later voyage of the S. S. Hope, Hall was involved in a fracas with one of the officers on February 7, 1970. He was subsequently indicted for assault and convicted after a trial in the Southern District before Judge Levet. The conviction was affirmed on appeal. United States v. Hall, 448 F.2d 114 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 935, 92 S.Ct. 971, 30 L.Ed.2d 810 (1972). The complaint filed in 1969, of course, did not refer to t&amp;js incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">The events at issue here began with settlement negotiations between counsel for the parties that started in late 1971. On December 16, 1971, Hall\u2019s counsel informed him that he could get $10,000 if he would settle his claim and Hall agreed. Appellants sent Hall\u2019s counsel a release on January 25, 1972, which stated that all claims against appellants including those arising from both the 1968 accident and the 1970 assault were waived in return for the $10,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since he felt that he might have a claim for damages for injuries suffered in the assault, Hall balked at signing the release and his counsel informed appellants that the release was \u201cnot in the form agreed upon.\u201d A second form of release was sent on April 13, 1972, but this was objected to on the grounds that it did not clearly exclude the assault. Appellants\u2019 counsel then told Hall\u2019s counsel to type in a clause specifically excluding the assault. Although this finding is disputed, Judge Carter found that Hall never refused to sign the revised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">On May 3, 1972, appellants moved to dismiss the case and pay the $10,000 into court on the grounds that Hall had refused to sign the release even though he had authorized his attorney to settle the case for $10,000. On May 5, Hall\u2019s counsel submitted an affirmation in support of the motion in which she stated that Hall had refused to sign a release exempting the assault. Hall himself sent a letter asking for a postponement in which he indicated that he had refused to sign the earlier release, but said that he had not seen a new release that his attorney had told him about. He also expressed the belief that her affirmation of May 5 demonstrated that his attorney never \u201chad my best interest at heart.\u201d Probably as a result of this letter, Judge Frankel denied the motion on May 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">After May 16, the parties began to prepare for a trial. For example, on May 18 Hall\u2019s attorney submitted a statement to the district court that the parties had been unable to settle and also requested that appellants answer previously sent interrogatories. At least' one person, a Dr. Webb, was subsequent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>ly deposed. On October 12, 1972, appellants\u2019 counsel confirmed to Hall\u2019s attorney that the settlement was no longer viable and that the case would be litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">On November 2, 1972, Hall finally signed the revised release. Appellants, however, refused to accept any settlement at that late date.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hall then moved to enforce the settlement. Judge Carter\u2019s decision in favor of Hall is on appeal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Apparently overlooking the distinction between an executory accord and a mere offer to settle, see 6 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1270 (1962), appellants center their arguments on whether there was a valid offer and acceptance and on the basic principle that a rejection of an offer terminates the power of acceptance unless the offer otherwise provides. Appellants dispute Judge Carter\u2019s finding that Hall never rejected their offer of settlement since he never refused to sign the revised release. Appellants claim that Hall is bound by his counsel\u2019s affirmation on May 5, 1972, which stated he had refused to sign the revised release, that the evidence indicated that Hall refused to sign the release, and that Judge Frankel\u2019s order of May 16 indicated that there had been a rejection by Hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">We need not decide these issues since we think there was an executory accord on December 16, 1971, which' Hall subsequently abandoned by failing to sign the release conforming to the agreement within a reasonable time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When as here, a settlement agreement fixes no time for the performance of a particular condition, performance must be within a reasonable time. See Kotlowitz v. Vogue Service Co., Inc., 65 Misc.2d 940, 319 N.Y.S.2d 263 (N.Y. Civ.Ct.1971); Bruce Realty Co. of Florida v. Berger, 327 F.Supp. 507 (S.D.N.Y.1971). See generally 6 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 832, at 96-100 (3d ed. 1962). Viewing the facts most favorably to Hall, he had not refused to sign the release by May 16, 1972. A reasonable time to sign in this case is a few days or, at most, a few weeks after May 16. Counsel had reached a settlement to which Hall had agreed in principle. After sending the letter it was incumbent upon him to act promptly to sign the release or to abandon the settlement agreement. A delay of five months in signing is entirely unreasonable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The other parties would then naturally have assumed that he had no intention of signing and would change their positions accordingly. To the extent that this delay was caused by Hall\u2019s counsel, he is bound by her failure to act. Cf. Link v. Wabash R. R., 370 U.S. 626, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-13\">. This was in addition to the $5,187.70 which had been paid to Hall by appellants when he was unable to work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\">. One possible factor in this refusal to settle may be Dr. Webb\u2019s testimony on deposition that Hall had never complained about any accident to him and that x-rays showed an old, not a new, neck injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\">. The parties have not discussed the issue, but since the agreement was allegedly made in New York and was to be performed in New York, New York law governs. Because the issue is one of settling a federal claim brought in a federal district court, we have ancillary jurisdiction over it. See J. Moore, Federal Practice 1J0.90[3J (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AVA\">. Hall did spend part of this period in the federal facility at Danbury, Connecticut, serving his sentence on the assault charge. Nevertheless, his counsel could have sent him the release by mail, which he then could have signed and had notarized.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
