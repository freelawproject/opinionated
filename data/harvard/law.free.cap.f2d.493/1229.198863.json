The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the director. The plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-26\">The Protocol went into effect in the United States on November 1, 1968. Article 32 of the Protocol provides in part that: \u201c1. The Contracting States shall not expel a refugee lawfully in their territory save on grounds of national security or public order.\u201d The district court concluded, and we agree, that the terms \u201clawfully in [the] territory\u201d were intended to require that a refugee under the Protocol be in a country in compliance with the immigration laws of that country. Each of the appellants has had a deportation hearing at which he was found deporta-ble. No appeals were taken from the findings that each was unlawfully present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-27\">We affirm the judgment of the district court for the reasons well stated in the opinion of Judge Lawrence A. Whipple, 361 F.Supp. 177 (D.N.J.1973). <em>See also, </em>Ming v. Marks, 367 F.Supp. 673 (S.D.N.Y.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-28\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
