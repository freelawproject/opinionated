The nub of their complaint is that the proposed change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>was submitted to the Eastern Conference Joint Area Committee of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, of which they were members, without first submitting the proposal for approval to the Joint Maryland-District of Columbia Area Committee of the Freight Drivers and Helpers Local Union No. 557, an affiliate of International. The District Court held there was no breach and dismissed the complaint. The drivers appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-4\">Upon consideration of the record and the arguments of counsel, on brief and orally, we observe no error in the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the District Judge and affirm on his opinion.
