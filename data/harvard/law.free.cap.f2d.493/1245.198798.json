W. Little, Inc. The Board\u2019s Decision and Order are reported at 201 NLRB No. 71. The unfair labor practices occurred in San Diego, California, where the Company is a contractor \u2022engaged in sandblasting and painting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-18\">In brief, the Board found that the Company violated Section 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act by discharging two employees because of their grievance activity pursuant to the collective-bargaining agreement between the Company and their Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-19\">In reviewing the order and record in this matter we must have in mind the limitations on such review and that questions of credibility are for the administrative law judge who has had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses. N.L.R.B. v. Thrifty Supply Company, 364 F.2d 508, 509 (9th Cir. 1966). As stated by the Court in N.L.R.B. v. Walton, Mfg.
