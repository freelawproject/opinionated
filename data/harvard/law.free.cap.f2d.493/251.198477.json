More succinctly, Drug Fair insists that the \u201cfindings\u201d below are without the protection of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b340-15\">The central issue is whether it was reasonable for Aaron Feder, Famous Knitwear\u2019s agent, to rely upon the manifestations of apparent authority made by Drug Fair as to Bert Arthur, its buyer. The district judge concluded that, based on the appointment of Arthur to a position in which his predecessor had apparent authority to enter binding contracts and the authority, generally, of buyers in the trade to make binding commitments on behalf of their principals, Drug Fair had clothed Arthur with apparent authority to enter into the contract in question. The district judge further found that the size of the transaction was not, of itself, so unusual as to lead a reasonable man to question the scope of that apparent authority. The finding of apparent authority, including, as it must, the reasonableness of Feder\u2019s reliance on Drug Fair\u2019s manifestations in that regard, is an \u201cultimate factual inference\u201d and is to be reviewed under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Rule 52(a) unless such inference is made \u201cin disregard of the applicable principles of law\u201d or through \u201cgross overemphasis on one relevant principle to the exclusion of others.\u201d Piedmont Minerals Co. v. United States, 429 F.2d 560, 562 (4th Cir. 1970); Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. C. I. R\u201e 318 F.2d 695 (4th Cir. 1963). The district court\u2019s inference of apparent authority was not \u201cinduced by an erroneous view of the law,\u201d Bogue Elec. Mfg. Co. v. Coconut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Grove Bank, 269 F.2d 1, 4 (5th Cir. 1959), nor are the underlying findings of fact upon which that inference was made clearly erroneous within the meaning of Rule 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">We are not unaware of language contained in Hicks v. United States, 368 F. 2d 626 (4th Cir. 1966), to the effect that a judge\u2019s finding of negligence is a conclusion of law and is reviewable on appeal free of the protection of Rule 52 (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fact that negligence, a so-called \u201cmixed question of law and fact,\u201d has been treated as freely reviewable does not mean that all questions which can be so characterized are free of the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d stricture. <em>See </em>C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7\u00a7 2589-90. We believe that the creation, duration, and scope of an agency relationship and, specifically, the question of the reasonableness of a third party\u2019s reliance on a principal\u2019s manifestations of the apparent authority of his agent are essentially questions of fact. Bogue Elec. Mfg. Co. v. Coconut Grove Bank, 269 F.2d 1 (5th Cir. 1959); Steinbrugge v. Haddock, 281 F.2d 871 (10th Cir. 1960). As such, the clearly erroneous standard is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">Without explanation the district court adopted the lost profits measure of damages set out in section 2-708(2) of the Uniform Commercial Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Whether this was proper or whether the more usual<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> contract-market formula of section 2-708(1) should have been applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>depends upon whether section 2-708(2) was intended to apply to the so-called \u201clost volume\u201d seller<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and whether Famous Knitwear was, in fact, a \u201clost volume\u201d seller. We are persuaded both by the statutory history <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of section 2-708 and by Official Comment 2 that the lost profits measure of damages outlined in section 2-708(2) was meant to apply to the \u201clost volume\u201d situation. As the Comment states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\">This section permits the recovery of lost profits in <em>all appropriate </em>cases, which would include all standard priced goods. The normal measure there would be list price less cost to the dealer or list price less manufacturing cost to the manufacturer [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">It may well be that Famous Knitwear, a \u201cmiddleman\u201d between manufacturer and retailer (Drug Fair), was a lost volume seller, as was the retailer in Neri v. Retail Marine Corp., 30 N.Y.2d 393, 334 N.Y.S.2d 165, 285 N.E.2d 311 (1972). If so, the view of the Court of Appeals of New York in <em>Neri </em>that \u201cthe last sentence of subsection (2) [of section 2-708 . . . referring to \u2018due credit for payments or proceeds of resale\u2019 is inapplicable to this retail sales contract,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 334 N. Y.S.2d at 169, 285 N.E.2d at 314, is probably the proper approach in this case as well. Were this not the case, then the measure of damages would be substantially the same as the contract-market differential of 2-708(1), and 2-708(2) would have meaning only for seller-manufacturers and not for other sellers of \u201cstandard priced goods.\u201d The Official Comment negates any such purpose on the part of the drafters.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">We are still left with the question of whether Famous Knitwear is a lost volume seller and, hence, a seller for whom \u201cthe measure of damages provided in subsection (1) is inadequate.\u201d Due to the seasonal nature of the goods involved (sweaters) and the long lead-time necessary for Famous Knitwear to secure goods from its suppliers, Drug Fair alleges that, but for its placement of such a large order with Famous Knitwear, the seller would not have had the necessary goods in stock to sell to other buyers subsequent to Drug Fair\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>breach. Famous Knitwear, on the other hand, contends that it could have fulfilled its contract with Drug Fair and procured additional goods for sale to the later buyers. Because there are no findings of fact by the district judge as to the conflicting assertions, we are unable to determine if Famous Knitwear is a lost volume seller and, as such, entitled to lost profits under 2-708(2). We, therefore vacate the amount of the judgment and remand for further proceedings. On remand, the district court may make supplemental findings or, in its discretion, reopen the trial on the question of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In Famous Knitwear\u2019s cross-appeal we are asked to review the district court\u2019s finding that Drug Fair\u2019s order of two lines of sweaters was unconditionally cancelled and that Famous Knitwear was, therefore, not entitled to damages as to those lines. We think these findings were clearly erroneous, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Concerned about 'the failure of Drug Fair to supply a written confirmation, including shipment instructions, for Arthur\u2019s February 24 oral commitment, Aaron Feder, Famous Knitwear\u2019s agent, paid a visit to Drug Fair\u2019s corporate headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia, in June of 1970. Feder met with Arthur and expressed his concern. On condition that the entire fall order (except for two lines of sweaters) remain intact, and in exchange for Arthur\u2019s assurance to that effect, Feder agreed to accept cancellation of that part of the February 24 order which dealt with spring goods and for which the delivery date had already passed without shipment instructions from Drug Fair. Since Drug Fair later refused to honor Arthur\u2019s commitment, the condition failed and Famous-Knitwear correctly was awarded damages for Drug Fair\u2019s refusal to accept the spring goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-20\">At this same June meeting, Feder and Arthur also agreed to cancel two lines of sweaters which were part of the fall goods ordered on February 24. Drug Fair contends that this cancellation was unconditional, though admittedly arising from the same negotiations that led to the conditional cancellations of spring goods. In his opinion from the bench the district judge agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-21\">I do think, however, that the Defendant is entitled to the credits for 5R and 1950R because it is my recollection of Mr. Aaron Feder\u2019s testimony in court, not just his deposition, that he said that he could have cancelled those, and I don\u2019t think it was the cancellation of any fall orders that was contingent on their performing their contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-22\">The district judge correctly recollected that Aaron Feder, on cross-examination, admitted that the two sweater lines had been cancelled.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But only on redirect examination was Feder questioned as to the relationship between the agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>to cancel the spring goods and the agreement to cancel the two fall sweater lines. It is apparent from Feder\u2019s testimony on redirect that <em>both, </em>agreements were conditioned on Drug Fair\u2019s acceptance of the remainder of the February 24 order.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The district judge\u2019s opinion does not reveal that he disbelieved Fed-er\u2019s redirect testimony, but that he remembered only the content of Feder\u2019s testimony on cross-examination. Lacking any contradictory testimony on the part of Bert Arthur, who was Drug Fair\u2019s agent at the meeting in question and who testified for Drug Fair at the trial, we believe that Feder\u2019s testimony, taken as a whole, establishes a conditional cancellation as to both spring goods and the two fall sweater lines and that the district judge\u2019s contrary conclusion is clearly erroneous. As to Famous Knitwear\u2019s cross-appeal, the judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the district court to determine the proper measure of damages as discussed in Part II above.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-11\">. Though Learned Hand once wrote that \u201cit is idle to try to define\u201d what is meant by the words \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d in Rule 52(a), United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 433 (1945), the definitive test seems to be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-12\">A finding is \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-17\">United States v.

Although we presently have no occasion to review the correctness of the <em>Hicks </em>decision, we note that seven circuits have taken positions contrary to that decision and have held the clearly erroneous standard applicable to the finding or conclusion of negligence. Socash v. Addison Crane Co., 120 U.S.App.D.C. 308, 346 F.2d 420 (1965) ; Obolensky v. Saldana Schmier, 409 F.2d 52 (1st Cir. 1969) ; Nelson v. Jacksonville Shipyards, Inc., 440 F.2d 668 (5th Cir. 1971) ; J. A. Jones Const. Co. v. Englert Eng. Co., 438 F.2d 3 (6th Cir. 1971) ; Leatherman v.

Sommers, 351 F.2d 354 (10th Cir. 1965). Even the Second Circuit seems to have retreated from Mamiye Bros. v. Barber S. S. Lines, Inc., 360 F.2d 774 (2 Cir., 1966), a case which most clearly stated the minority point of view and upon which the <em>Hicks </em>case relied. In Hendry v. United States, 418 F.2d 774 (1969), Judge Waterman wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">The standard of review to be applied to a district court\u2019s finding of negligence is not the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard the Government advances, for a finding of negligence is reviewable as a matter of law. Nevertheless, the lower court finding \u201c[will] ordinarily stand unless the [lower] court manifests an incorrect conception of the applicable law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">418 F.2d at 784 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">As recently as 1972 we had occasion to note the trend of the majority. In Tucker v. Calmar S. S. Corp., 4 Cir., 457 F.2d 440, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">A district court\u2019s findings regarding unseaworthiness and negligence are generally treated as findings of fact reviewable under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of FJR.C.P.

The term is that of Professor Harris. <em>See </em>Harris, A Radical Restatement of the Law of Seller\u2019s Damages: Sales Act and Commercial Code Results Compared, 18 Stan.L. Rev. 66 (1964) [hereinafter cited as Harris]. Its meaning is illustrated by Professors White and Summers as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">[A]ssume a contract for the sale of a washing machine with a list price of $500. Buyer breaches, and seller resells that washing machine at the same list price that buyer had been willing to pay. How-over, the resale buyer is one of seller\u2019s regular customers who had intended to purchase a washing machine from him anyway. If the seller\u2019s total cost per machine was $300, he stood to gain an aggregate profit of $400, that is, $200 profit from each of two sales. Clearly the 2-708 contract-market differential formula is inadequate in this situation since it gives no damages to the seller who has lost a $200 profit because of the breach. In such a case the damage award should be the lost profit, that is, $200, for this will place the seller \u201cin as good a position as performance would have done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">J. White &amp; R.
