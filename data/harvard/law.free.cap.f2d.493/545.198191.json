The deputy commissioner\u2019s order held that claimant Lowe\u2019s attorney\u2019s telephone call to the deputy commissioner indicating that he would file an application for review of Lowe\u2019s claim was adequate to toll the running of the one year limitation period under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 because the deputy commissioner put a written memorandum of the call in his file. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-20\">In 1960 while employed as a longshoreman by appellant Luckenbach Steamship, Lowe was injured when he fell in the hold of the vessel and was paid compensation and medical expenses by appellant Fireman\u2019s Fund. After a hearing in 1965 before the deputy commissioner, Lowe was awarded further compensation which Fireman\u2019s Fund paid until May 29, 1969, at which time Fireman\u2019s Fund claimed that Lowe had received the statutory maximum for a partial disability. On May 29, 1969, Lowe served the deputy commissioner with written notice that payments had been stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-21\">On June 9, 1969, Lowe\u2019s attorney telephoned the deputy commissioner who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>wrote and filed the following memorandum regarding that call:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\">\u201cThe writer received a telephone call from C. J. Hardee, the claimant\u2019s attorney. Mr. Hardee disputes the form BEC-208, and states that the employer and carrier have taken credit in the sum of $17,280 for some $6,100 they regained on a lien against the third party and some $3,000 net to the claimant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">\u201cFurther, Mr. Hardee claims the claimant is permanently totally disabled and <em>will file for a review under </em>\u00a7 <em>22 of the Act.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">\u201cWhen such filing is received, please return the case to me for further handling.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">On December 23, 1970, the deputy commissioner wrote Lowe\u2019s attorney inquiring whether Lowe intended to apply for a modification of his compensation order. On December 30, 1970, Lowe\u2019s attorney responded stating \u201cWe do plan to file an application for review in this claim and request that you do not close the case. We will do so just as soon as possible.\u201d On April 8, 1971, a petition for modification of Lowe\u2019s compensation award was mailed to the deputy commissioner and to Fireman\u2019s Fund. On January 20, 1972, the deputy commissioner after a hearing determined that the claimant\u2019s modification application was timely filed, but that Lowe had received all compensation to which he was entitled under the 1965 award. The deputy deferred consideration of the merits of Lowe\u2019s claim of total disability. The deputy commissioner\u2019s order concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">\u201cThe memorandum recording Attorney C. J. Hardee\u2019s telephone call to Deputy Commissioner William M. O\u2019Keeffe June 9, 1969 constitutes a timely filed application for review under Section 22.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">Appellant Fireman\u2019s Fund filed suit in the district court challenging the deputy commissioner\u2019s determination that the telephone memorandum constituted an adequate application for review of an earlier award under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 922. Claimant Lowe intervened. Fireman\u2019s Fund asserted that it was only first apprised at the January 20, 1972 hearing of the deputy commissioner\u2019s memorandum of the June 9, 1969 telephone conversation with Lowe\u2019s attorney. The district court granted summary judgment for the deputy commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">Section 22 of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 922, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-14\">\u201c . . . <em>upon the application </em>of any party in interest, on the ground of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in a determination of fact by the deputy commissioner, the deputy commissioner may, <em>at any time prior to one year after the date of the last payment of compensation, . </em>review a compensation case in accordance with the procedure prescribed in respect of claims in <em>section 919 </em>of this title, . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-18\">The sole question presented is whether the memorandum recording of the phone conversation suffices as a claimant\u2019s \u201capplication\u201d for modification within the statutory proscription that such an application be filed \u201cprior to one year after the date of the last payment of compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-19\">Although decisions have not interpreted what constitutes an application under section 922, courts have determined what suffices as a claim under section 919.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since claims under section 919 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>must be filed, it has been held that they must be in writing. Employers Liability Assurance Corp. v. Donovan, 279 F.2d 76, 78 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 884, 81 S.Ct. 165, 5 L.Ed.2d 105 (1960). This Court in <em>Employers Liability, supra, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">\u201cNo particular form of claim need be used. The requirement of a claim is met if a writing, even though an informal one, of the injured employee or his attorney discloses an intention to assert a right to compensation. Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores v. Donovan, supra; . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The following \u201cinformal\u201d writings have qualified as adequate claims to toll the running of the one year statutory period of filing for a compensation award: (1) a letter from an attorney to the deputy commissioner requesting compensation, Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Donovan, 279 F.2d 75 (5th Cir. 1960) ; (2) a letter requesting compensation but misfiled by the deputy commissioner because of its reference to the wrong claim numbers, Beegan v. Brady-Hamilton Stevedore Co., 346 F.2d 857, 859-860 (9th Cir. 1965); (3) an attorney\u2019s claim letter directed to an employer\u2019s insurance carrier which in turn was transmitted to the deputy commissioner, Budson Co. v. Oikari, 270 F.Supp. 611, 614 (N.D.Ill. 1967); (4) an attorney\u2019s letter to the deputy commissioner requesting a formal application blank that was never sent, Louisiana-Texas Waterways Co. v. United States Employees\u2019 Compensation Commission, 19 F.Supp. 396 (W.D.Ky. 1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">In McKinney v. O\u2019Leary, 460 F.2d 371 (9th Cir. 1972), the claimant appeared at the deputy commissioner\u2019s office, following which a written memorandum was prepared and filed by the deputy commissioner, reciting that \u201cclaimant\u201d would return or have his attorney \u201ccontact us if he wants to file a claim.\u201d The court not only found this memorandum sufficient to constitute the necessary claim, admittedly largely because the parties in essence stipulated so on appeal, but also noted \u201cvarious types of informal writings have been liberally construed in determining whether a claim has been filed pursuant to 33 U.S.C. Sec. 913(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Similarly, this Court has recognized that the Longshoremen\u2019s Act is to be liberally construed in favor of claimants. <em>See </em>Young and Co. v. Shea, 397 F.2d 185 (5th Cir. 1968), reh. denied, 404 F.2d 1059, cert. denied, 395 U.S. 920, 89 S.Ct. 1771, 23 L.Ed.2d 237 (1969). The trend of decisions appears to be that any written notice by <em>or on behalf of </em>the claimant within one year evidencing an intention to make a claim will be treated as sufficient to toll the running of the statutory period for filing a claim. Therefore, we conclude that the memorandum recording by the deputy commissioner of the telephone message from claimant\u2019s attorney that \u201cthe claimant is permanently totally disable and will file for review under Section 22 of the Act\u201d is sufficient to constitute an application for modification under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-9\">. Section 19 of the Longshoremen\u2019s Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 919, provides for the initiation of claims under the act, whereas, Section 22, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 922, governs the modification of compensation awards on grounds of change in conditions or because of a mistake in a determination of fact by the deputy commissioner. Section 919 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">\u201cSubject to the provisions of section 913 [which bars claims filed one year after the injury] of this title a claim for compensation may be filed with the deputy commissioner in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary at any time after the first seven days of disability following any injury, or at any time after death, and the deputy commissioner shall have full power and authority to hear and determine all questions in respect of such claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
