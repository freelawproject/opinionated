The Board\u2019s order was based on the findings of the administrative law judge that the company unlawfully discharged employee Hill because of his suspected union activities, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act. We have carefully reviewed the record as a whole and conclude that substantial evidence does not exist in this record to support the Board\u2019s order; we therefore deny enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-18\">Because the Board\u2019s position depends upon our accepting as true the inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence by the administrative law judge, a somewhat more detailed statement of the facts is required. Garner Tool and Die Company (\u201cCompany\u201d) manufactures tools, dies, jigs, fixtures, molds and other items at its Lincoln, Nebraska plant. In addition to its office staff, made up of Edward Garner, president of the company, Phil Mullin, Garner\u2019s son-in-law, and Garner\u2019s wife, the company employs approximately 15 persons \u2014 11 in its tool room and 4 in its production room.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-19\">Paul Hill had been employed in the company\u2019s tool room for approximately six years. When the employees established a shop committee in 1970, Hill was elected chairman or spokesman of the group and met with President Garner at irregular intervals to discuss employee grievances and other problems. On October 13, 1971, Garner announced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>that the company would no longer order tools for employees costing less than $10.00. Hill objected to this policy change because certain tools (such as Allen wrenches) were constantly wearing out. Garner replied that he would buy a set of Allen wrenches for anyone who could not afford them. Hill was not satisfied with this response, asserting that the company should furnish these small tools without charge to the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The employees were working a ten-hour day, from 6:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., when Garner announced on October 27 that the work day was being reduced to nine hours. Garner did not specify a starting-quitting time, but did indicate his preference for a 7:00 a.m.-4:30 p.m. work day because it would not look good to customers to see the shop empty so early in the afternoon. At a coffee break on the day of the announcement, some of the employees met and decided to continue starting at 6:00 a.m. Hill did not attend this meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">On October 28 and 29, most of the tool room employees reported at 6:00 a.m. and left at 3:30 p.m. Hill and a few others reported at 7:00 and worked until 4:30. At 3:45 p.m. on Friday, October 29, Mullin approached Hill in the tool room and said that Garner was infuriated because most of the employees had left an hour early. Hill said, \u201cThey came in at 6:00. They had worked the nine hours like he requested and they left.\u201d Mullin then commented, in effect, that Garner did not want the employees coming in at 6:00 a.m., that they didn\u2019t realize how good the company was to them, and they were always bickering about little things like the company policy on buying tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Then the following occurred according to Hill\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">When he brought up this deal about the Allen wrenches I said, \u2018when you take a man that will invest $3,000.00 in tools to make another man money,\u2019 and I said, \u2018then some son-of-a-bitch wouldn\u2019t buy them an Allen wrench,\u2019 I said, \u2018well, this is pretty chicken-shit.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">That ended the conversation and Mullin returned to the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">About fifteen minutes later, Garner approached Hill and asked him what time he had come to work that day. Hill said 7:00 a.m. Garner asked what time he was coming to work on Monday, and Hill asked Garner what time he wanted him to come. Garner then asked Hill about the other employees, and Hill stated that he did not know when they were coming to work, but that it probably depended on when their group leader told them to report. Garner then returned to the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">Again, at 4:35 p.m., according to Hill\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-14\">Mr. Garner, came out.of the office and come over to the bench to my tool box, and put his arm on my back and patted me on the back and said that everything was o.k., that it is good to blow off steam, it was healthy to blow off steam, and everything was all right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">Some time that weekend, President Garner posted a notice informing the employees that effective Monday morning they were not to begin work before 7:00 a.m. Garner arrived at the shop at 6:50 a.m. on Monday, November 1, and discovered that the employees present had been working for some time. Each employee was asked if he had seen the notice, and when they replied yes, he suspended them for the remainder of the day. Hill arrived at 6:55 a.m. as the other men were leaving, and Garner summoned him to the office. Garner informed Hill that he was being laid off for one week. Hill asked why and Garner stated, \u201cYou referred to me as a son-of-a-bitch.\u201d Hill then said, \u201cEd, you told me yourself that you were a son-of-a-bitch to work for.\u201d Garner replied \u201cYes, I don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore, I don\u2019t want to see your face around here until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>next Monday. You can come back then and work.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">That evening, the tool room employees met, decided to join the union, and all signed authorization cards. A union representative communicated that fact to Garner the following day and a meeting was set up for Friday, November 5. By letter dated November 4, 1971, Garner informed union representative Dean Kocina that the Friday meeting was cancelled and that all further communications regarding the union\u2019s request for recognition should be addressed to the Midwest Employers Council, which Garner had engaged to represent the company in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">On Friday, November 5, Garner contacted Hill and the following occurred, according to Hill\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">Mr. Garner, over the phone he says, \u2018Paul,\u2019 he says, \u2018we are going to let you go.\u2019 And I says, \u2018for what reason?\u2019 And he says, \u2018any body that thinks of me in that manner,\u2019 he says, 'we don\u2019t have any place for them in the shop.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">So I said, \u2018well, am I laid off or fired, or what?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 he just left it hanging. He said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 you could tell by his voice that he was upset or something. He said I could pick up my tools that night if I wanted to and I told him that I was leaving for a trip out of town and I would not be able to pick them up until early the following Monday morning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">When Hill picked up his tools on Monday morning, some of the other employees, upon learning what had happened, walked off the job. Beginning Wednesday, October 10, Garner conducted personal interviews with each of the employees in the tool room and ordered them to return to work the following day or never return. In discussing Hill\u2019s discharge, Garner told employee Olson that Hill had been fired not only because of the events of the previous week but because Hill had stolen from the company in the past.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">Garner told employee Hester that Hill had stolen company property in the past, but that he had paid for it and made amends; that Hill had been complaining about the company policy on tools; and that Hill was outspoken and was a rabble-rouser. Garner asked employee Knop what he would do if Hill called him an S.O.B. and Knop replied \u201cWell, he has probably called me that before.\u201d Garner then asked Knop what he would do if Hill called his dad that, and Knop replied that would probably be a different story. Garner explained to Knop that Hill had called him an S.O.B. and had \u201cslammed\u201d his office personnel on October 29; that when Garner hired Hill he had contacted his previous employer and they had told him that Hill probably couldn\u2019t be handled but Garner decided to try anyway; and that Garner had been very upset about what Hill had said and hadn\u2019t slept well because of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">Employee Morack testified that Garner told him that the employees had acted before hearing both sides of the story. He told Morack that Hill had stolen from him in the past, that Hill\u2019s prior employer had informed him that Hill was a trouble maker and an agitator, which he was, but that he had decided to give Hill a chance. Garner told Morack \u201cthat he dismissed Paul [Hill] for a week and said that he told him that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>could just keep right on going if he wanted to because he didn\u2019t know if he could work for him or not any more .\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The International Association of Machinists, Lodge 31, filed charges and this complaint thereafter issued by the Board alleging that Hill\u2019s discharge was unlawful. There was no evidence in the record and no finding by the examiner or the Board of any anti-union animus by the employer. The examiner found no direct evidence that the company had actual knowledge of Hill\u2019s union activities or that Hill was in fact a leader in the union organization effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The trial examiner held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">Upon all of the facts, including particularly the fact that Garner gave Hill false explanations both for his suspension on November 1 and his discharge on November 5, I conclude that Garner\u2019s motive in both suspending and discharging Hill was one which he desired to conceal' \u2014 an unlawful motive \u2014 namely, a desire to rid himself of this outspoken\u2019 advocate of the rights of the employees whom he suspected had led the employees not only in their concerted refusal to report for work at 7 a.m. but also with respect to their seeking union representation. Accordingly, Hill\u2019s suspension on November 1 and his discharge on November 5 were illegally motivated. However, in view of the fact that the complaint did not put in issue the legality of Hill\u2019s suspension on November 1, I make no findings in this regard and conclude only that Hill\u2019s discharge on November 5 violated Section 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">We hold that the record will not support a finding of knowledge that Hill was engaged in union activities, nor will it support a finding that Hill was discharged because Garner suspected such activities. Garner\u2019s own explanations for discharging Hill, as related by all of the witnesses including Hill, were consistently based upon the S.O.B. comment and other past occasions for dissatisfaction brought to a head by the latest comment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No anti-union animus was demonstrated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Board makes too much of Garner\u2019s statement to Hill on Friday afternoon that it was good to blow off steam. It first infers that Garner knew of the S.O.B. incident at the time this statement was made and then infers upon this inference condonation of the S.O.B. remark, and from this concludes that some other reason must have motivated the discharge. While the Board is free to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence, direct and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>circumstantial, NLRB v. Melrose Processing Co., 351 F.2d 693, 699 (8th Cir. 1965), it may not build inferences upon inferences to reach a finding which is no more than educated conjecture. Assuming that Garner in fact knew that Hill had referred to him as an S.O.B., and assuming further that Garner\u2019s conciliatory statement to Hill about letting off steam in fact referred to the S.O.B. comment, we cannot follow the Board\u2019s final attenuation that this foreclosed any subsequent determination that Hill should be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">The Supreme Court defined substantial evidence in NLRB v. Columbian Enameling <em>&amp; </em>Stamping Co., 306 U.S. 292, 300, 59 S.Ct. 501, 505, 83 L.Ed. 660 (1939):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, and must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established. \u2018It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion . . . .\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Thus the Board\u2019s findings may not rest on \u201csuspicion, surmise, implications, or plainly incredible evidence.\u201d Amyx Industries, Inc. v. NLRB, 457 F.2d 904, 907 (8th Cir. 1972); <em>see also </em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 484, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). And, as we have previously stated, \u201c [c] ircumstances that merely raise a suspicion that an employer may be activated by unlawful motives are not sufficiently substantial to support a finding.\u201d NLRB v. Ace Comb Co., 342 F.2d 841, 848 (8th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\"> We have held that it is impossible for a discharge to be discriminatory without proof that the employer had knowledge of the employee\u2019s union activities, Amyx Industries, Inc. v. NLRB, <em>supra, </em>457 F.2d at 906; NLRB v. Ace Comb Co., <em>supra, </em>342 F.2d at 848, and the Board always has the burden of proving such knowledge with substantial evidence. Amyx Industries, Inc. v. NLRB, <em>supra; </em>NLRB v. Melrose Processing Co., <em>supra, </em>351 F.2d at 697. An exception to this rule is where the Board proves that the discharge was motivated by the employer\u2019s belief or \u201csuspicion\u201d that the employee was engaging in union activities, notwithstanding the absence of actual participation. NLRB v. Clinton Packing Co., Inc., 468 F.2d 953, 955 (8th Cir. 1972); NLRB v. Ritchie Manufacturing Co., 354 F.2d 90, 98 (8th Cir. 1966). However, the burden of proof is unchanged; the Board must prove by substantial evidence that the real reason for the discharge was the employee\u2019s suspected union activity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">It is not disputed that Hill could have been lawfully discharged because of his S.O.B. comment. We have consistently held that an employer may discharge an employee for good reason, bad reason or no reason at all, so long as the discharge is not motivated by unlawful considerations. NLRB v. Century Broadcasting Corp., 419 F.2d 771, 778 (8th Cir. 1969) ; NLRB v. Arkansas Grain Corp., 392 F. 2d 161, 167 (8th Cir. 1968); NLRB v. Ace Comb Co., 342 F.2d 841, 847 (8th Cir. 1965); Fort Smith Broadcasting Co. v. NLRB, 341 F.2d 874, 879 (8th Cir. 1965). We stated in NLRB v. Ace Comb Co., <em>supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">[Ojnce it is determined that disciplinary action is warranted the extent of the action taken is purely within the discretion of the employer, and the Board may not substitute its judgment for that of the employer. 342 F.2d at 847.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-13\">We must conclude from the whole record that the Board\u2019s findings were the result of speculation unsupported by evidence, direct or circumstantial, sufficient to raise such speculation to the level of a reasonable inference of illegal conduct. We give deference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the Board\u2019s ability to draw rational conclusions from the evidence, but in this case the conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence. S. W. Noggle Co. v. NLRB, 478 F.2d 1144 (8th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Application for enforcement is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-9\">. Only Hill testified with respect to his conversations with Garner. The company presented no evidence and neither Garner nor Mullin testified. The company rested on its position that General Counsel had failed to establish a prima facie case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b354-10\">. Sometime in 1968 or 1969 Hill had taken some materials and tools from the shop without paying for them. Believing Garner knew about this, he went to Garner, told him he had taken the material, and said he wanted to pay for it and make amends. Garner permitted him to pay for the material by making deductions from his cheek and Garner said it would never be mentioned again and that Hill had been forgiven. In a shop meeting two days after the occurrence, Garner explained the situation to the entire staff and told them that it should never be mentioned again, that it was completely forgotten.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\">. The company asserts that this testimony was a direct contradiction of Hill\u2019s testimony that he had been suspended on November 1 and discharged on November 5, and demonstrates that Hill was actually discharged on Monday, November 1. The examiner stated that he did not perceive the \u201cdirect contradiction\u201d in the two statements, but in any event, could not accept Morack\u2019s statement since Garner, who failed to testify, made these statements in an attempt to justify his discharge of Hill. To the extent there was a dispute, the examiner deemed Hill\u2019s sworn testimony more credible than Morack\u2019s double hearsay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b355-9\">. The company here asserts that it was denied due process because the complaint failed to allege illegality in the suspension, claiming the trial examiner\u2019s disclaimer quoted above fails to negate the fact that finding the suspension illegal was essential to the examiner\u2019s conclusion that the discharge was illegal. Since we find insufficient evidence in this record to support the Board\u2019s conclusion, we need not reach the due process question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b355-15\">. <em>Cf. </em>NLRB v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 488 F.2d 114 (8th Cir. 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b355-16\">. Garner had initially agreed to meet with the union representative on Friday, November 5. However, he changed his mind two days later in a letter characterized by the examiner as \u201cquite unfriendly\u201d, and decided to deal with the union through a management association. While these facts support an inference that Garner decided to change his tactical approach toward the union, this inference alone or in combination with the undisputed facts does not support the inference that Garner decided to discharge Hill as an anti-union tactic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\">. The fact that the company chose not to present any evidence has no effect on the Board\u2019s burden of proof, and no inferences of wrongdoing can be drawn from the company\u2019s failure to disclaim the Board\u2019s allegations. NLRB v. Century Broadcasting Co., 419 F.2d 771, 776-777 (8th Cir. 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
