The charter gave Local 1219 jurisdiction to represent millwrights in Maine, a jurisdiction which had previously been exercised by the carpenter locals. The carpenter locals objected to the new local and the threat that it posed to their jurisdiction over millwrights. They subsequently refused to obey directions by International to cease bargaining for millwrights on new contracts with intrastate employers. International\u2019s General President did not impose any sanctions on the carpenter locals for their disobedience, and he refused to provide interstate contractors working in Maine with necessary authorization that they could hire millwrights through Local 1219 rather than through the carpenter locals. Local 1219, as a consequence, has been unable to place its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>members in jobs and has lost much of its membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Local 1219 brought this action, after appealing the failure of the General President to accede to its demands to International\u2019s General Executive Board without avail, seeking injunctive relief and damages for the alleged failure of International to support Local 1219 adequately in the jurisdictional dispute with the carpenter locals, and for failing to authorize employers to hire through it rather than through them. The district court, finding no contractual undertaking by International to provide such support, denied relief. Local 1219 appeals, and International cross appeals claiming the district court lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\n<em>Jurisdictional Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Defendant attacks the district court\u2019s jurisdiction on essentially three grounds: improper service of process, failure of plaintiff to exhaust intra-un-ion remedies, and lack of subject matter jurisdiction under section 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U. S.C. \u00a7 185(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">With respect to improper service, defendant concedes personal jurisdiction in the doing business sense, but contends that since the only service was made on its agents outside the territorial jurisdiction of the court under Fed. R. Civ.P. 4(f), the Maine long arm statute. 14 Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 704, taken with McGreary v. Chandler, 58 Me. 537 (1870), would authorize such process only as a matter solely of state law if it were served on each individual member of the union personally. This argument is without merit. Section 301(b), 29 U. S. C. \u00a7 185(b), states that unions may be sued as entities, and subsection (d)\" states that the service of process on an officer or agent of the union, in his capacity as such shall constitute service upon the union. F.R.Civ.P. 4(d)(7) provides that service on unincorporated associations, <em>inter alia, </em>may be made \u201cin the manner prescribed by the law of the state in which the district court is held for the service of summons or other like process upon any such defendant in an action brought in the courts of general jurisdiction of that state.\u201d Section 704 provides as follows. \u201cService of process upon any person who is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State, as provided in this section, may be made by personally serving the summons upon the defendant outside this State .\u201d Since under the federal statute International must be considered an entity for the purposes of this suit, it, and not its individual members, is the defendant in this case. The federal statute also provides that service on defendant\u2019s agent shall constitute service on the defendant, and such service is not limited to \u201cfederal court\u201d service but includes the process of \u201cany court of the United States.\u201d Since personal service was made on defendant\u2019s agent, it would be against the clear meaning of the federal statute to hold that this personal service on the defendant\u2019s agent did not constitute \u201cpersonal service on the defendant\u201d under the Maine long arm statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">Defendant\u2019s exhaustion argument was squarely answered by the district court in its finding of unreasonable delay if an appeal to International\u2019s General Convention in 1974 were required, since plaintiff\u2019s appeal to the General Executive Board was decided in 1970, too late for the 1970 convention. In the circumstances of this case, a finding that a delay in excess of three years would be unreasonable was clearly not erroneous, and further exhaustion need not have been required.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">Defendant argues that the instant dispute, involving as it does an alleged contract between a parent international union and its local, is not a suit for violation of a contract between any labor organizations, within the subject matter of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185. Defendant concedes that the relationship between a parent union and its local is contractual in nature, but it argues that this is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the type of contract between two unions, <em>see </em>Copra v. Suro, 1 Cir., 1956, 236 F.2d 107, 113, to which the statute is intended to apply. Although Congress did indicate some reluctance to \u201ceffect extensive and detailed statutory regulation of internal union affairs,\u201d Parks v. International Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 4 Cir., 1963, 314 F.2d 886, 915, 915-916 n. 49, cert. denied 372 U.S. 976, 83 S.Ct. 1111, 10 L.Ed.2d 142, it is clear that the local and International are each suable entities under the act. When two such entities\u2019 relationship is a matter of contract, and that contract directly concerns the representation of workers in collective bargaining, there is no reason to assume that Congress did not-intend the statute to apply simply because the two parties to the contract are related. Furthermore, this suit is on a contract and is not intended to enforce internal customs and practices of the unions which have not been reduced to a contract; exercising jurisdiction here will not involve the courts in regulating internal union matters which Congress did not intend to control. In such circumstances there is no reason in this case to depart from the literal meaning of the statute. <em>See </em>National Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers v. Sombrotto, 2 Cir., 1971, 449 F.2d 915, 918; Parks v. International Bhd. of Elec. Workers, ante.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Defendant also alleges in a similar vein that Count II of the complaint is in reality a class action by individual members of the local, and as such is not a \u201csuit between unions\u201d over which section 301 jurisdiction lies. <em>See </em>Copra v. Suro, ante, 236 F.2d at 113. Section 301(b), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(b), states that \u201c[a]ny such labor organization may sue or be sued as an entity and in behalf of the employees whom it represents.\u201d In view of the fact that Count II appears to be such a suit \u201cin behalf of\u201d Local 1219\u2019s members, and is based completely on the same contractual claim alleged in Count I, there is no reason to so limit the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Furthermore, that same subsection, while prohibiting recovery <em>against </em>individual members in such a representative action, is silent as to recovery by individual members. It would appear that recovery by individual members for their damages, obtained by Local 1219 in an action for their benefit based upon a contract between it and International, and International\u2019s breach thereof, would be within the scope of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\n<em>Substantive Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">At the outset, plaintiff urges that this court need not apply the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d test of F.R.Civ.P. 52(a) since the evidence in this case was largely documentary and \u201cfacts found from the oral testimony were not in dispute.\u201d Even if we were to accept plaintiff\u2019s proposition that the findings based upon oral evidence were not contested, in this circuit \u201c[t]he clearly erroneous rule is applicable even where ... a finding is based on documentary evidence or undisputed facts.\u201d Engine Specialties, Inc. v. Bombardier Ltd., 1 Cir., 1972, 454 F.2d 527, 530; Leach v. Crucible Center Co., 1 Cir., 1968, 388 F.2d 176, 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">[The balance of this opinion, being but a discussion of the evidence, reaching the conclusion that the district court\u2019s findings against the plaintiff as to the extent of the contractual obligation were not clearly erroneous, is disseminated to the parties, but not released for publication.]</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
