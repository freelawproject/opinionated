On January 25, 1974, and on February 20, 1974, this Court denied appellant\u2019s \u201cMotion for an Extension of Briefing Time\u201d and its \u201cRenewed Motion for an Extension of Briefing Time,\u201d both asking such extension \u201cuntil forty (40) days after the district court renders a decision on the appellant\u2019s \u2018Motion to Vacate Default Judgment.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-17\">The filing of the notice of appeal had \u201cthe effect of immediately transferring jurisdiction from the district court to the court of appeals with respect to any matters involved in the appeal. It divest [ed] the district court of authority to proceed further with respect to such matters . . . .\u201d9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, 2d ed., \u00b6 203.11; see cases there cited. Thus, as was indicated by this Court in its ruling on said renewed motion, the District Court was then and is now without jurisdiction to consider the motion to vacate the default judgment, which was filed eleven days after the filing of the notice of appeal. In its opposition to the motion presently before us appellant once again relies on a ground lacking validity, namely that the motion to vacate the default judgment is still before the District Court for consideration, and it is therefore concluded that the motion to dismiss the appeal is well taken. Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-19\">It is ordered that this appeal be and it hereby is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
