Oregon, 406 U.S. 404, 92 S. Ct. 1628, 32 L.Ed.2d 184 (1972), and in support of this contention, he produced an affidavit of one of the jurors stating that she had not in fact voted to convict appellant. The record disclosed that the foreman of the jury announced in open court that the jury had reached a guilty verdict, and that although the jury was polled collectively, no juror spoke out to object to the announced verdict. Although recognizing the settled and longstanding rule that jurors may not be heard to impeach a verdict to which they have assented, <em>e. g., </em>United States v. Chereton, 309 F.2d 197 (6th Cir. 1962), Klimes v. United States, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 23, 263 F.2d 273 (1959), we remanded the case to the district court for the purpose of holding a limited evidentiary hearing to determine whether the jury verdict was in fact unanimous. After conducting an evidentiary hearing pursuant to our direction on remand, the district court found that all the jurors, including the one whose concurrence in the guilty verdict was challenged by appellant, had in fact unanimously assented to the verdict. Accordingly, the district court denied appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">On this appeal appellant contends that the testimony adduced at the hearing does not support the district court\u2019s factual determination that the jury verdict was unanimous. Upon a consideration of the transcript of the evidentiary hearing, we hold that the court\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">Appellant also contends that he was entitled to be sentenced under the provisions of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act of 1970, Pub.L. No. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1242, \u00a7 1101(b) (4) (A), which repealed the mandatory sentencing requirement of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d). The district court apparently considered itself bound to sentence appellant under the mandatory sentencing procedure, even though the imposition of a five year term for the importation of two ounces of marijuana troubled the judge to the extent that he attempted to modify the sentence by providing for discretionary parole. Under the mandatory sentencing provision the judge could not suspend the sentence or grant probation, and the provision also expressly provided that parole could not be granted pursuant to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202, the regular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>parole statute. Appellant argues that because his conviction occurred after the effective date of the new Act, May 1, at which time the mandatory sentencing provisions were repealed, he should have been sentenced under the discretionary sentencing provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">We are troubled by the harshness of this sentence, imposed under a Congressional mandate since repealed, for the offense committed. In repealing the mandatory sentencing provision, however, Congress expressly provided a \u201csavings clause\u201d in Section 1103(a) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. Section 1103(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-6\">\u201cProsecutions for any violation of law occurring prior to the effective date of [the Act] shall not be affected by the repeals or amendments made by [it] ... or abated by reason thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Here, the prosecution involved was clearly for \u201ca violation of law arising prior to the effective date of [the Act].\u201d Section 1103(a), therefore, required the court to sentence appellant under the mandatory sentencing provisions, if appellant\u2019s sentencing is considered a part of his \u201cprosecution\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. The Supreme Court, in resolving a conflict between circuits, has recently held, unequivocally, that for the purposes of interpreting Section 1103(a), the term \u201cprosecution\u201d includes the sentencing procedure. Bradley v. United States, 410 U.S. 605, 93 S.Ct. 1151, 35 L.Ed.2d 528 (1973). Accordingly, we hold that appellant was sentenced under the mandatory sentencing provisions in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">The Supreme Court in <em>Bradley </em>expressly left open the question whether parole might, nevertheless, be available under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202. Interpreting the term \u201cprosecution\u201d in the savings clause to extend through the sentencing procedure, the Court held that \u00a7 1103(a) prohibits the district judge from specifying at sentencing that the offender may be eligible for early parole under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a), which must be invoked by the court upon entering judgment of conviction. But the Supreme Court carefully noted that \u201c[t]he availability of parole under the general parole statute, 18 U. S.C. \u00a7 4202, is a rather different matter, on which we express no opinion.\u201d 410 U.S. at 611, 93 S.Ct. at 1156. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-10\">\u201cThe decision to grant parole under \u00a7 4202 lies with the Board of Parole, not with the District Judge, and must be made long after sentence has been entered and the prosecution terminated. Whether \u00a7 1103(a) or the general saving statute, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, limits that decision is a question we cannot consider in this case.\u201d 410 U.S. at 611, n. 6, 93 S.Ct. at 1156.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">The Court\u2019s suggestion that the Parole Board\u2019s decision is made \u201clong after sentence has been entered and the prosecution terminated\u201d strongly indicates that the savings clause of Section 1103(a) does not preclude the possibility of parole, after sentencing is completed and the prosecution has terminated, under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202. But we are not called upon in this case to resolve the question that the Supreme Court left open. Nevertheless, we think it appropriate to observe that our decision today in no way limits the power of the Parole Board, in its own proceedings, to consider appellant\u2019s eligibility for parole under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202, which would permit appellant\u2019s parole, if otherwise appropriate, after he has served one-third of his five year sentence. If the Board grants appellant parole and his parole is challenged \u2022 by the government, it will then be time for us to decide the question left open in <em>Bradley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"avs-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-9\">. In the judgment and commitment form, it was provided that the sentence was \u201csubject to modification by Title 18, \u00a7 4208(a)(2)\u201d. This designation was not permitted by the mandatory sentencing statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
