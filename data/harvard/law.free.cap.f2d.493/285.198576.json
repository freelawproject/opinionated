We hold that is does, and we affirm the order of the district court dismissing Count 7 of a pending twenty-four count indictment that charged defendants-appellees Finley Coal Company and Charles Finley with willful violations of interim mandatory safety standards established by the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, Pub.L.91-173, Dec. 30, 1969, 83 Stat. 742, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq., and of regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Interior thereunder, 30 C.F.R., Part 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Finley Coal Company operated several coal mines at Hyden, Kentucky, and Charles Finley was a partner active in the company. The indictment followed an explosion in appellees\u2019 underground mines, in which thirty-eight miners died. Preliminary to trial, appellees challenged the indictment, contending that the regulations implementing the safety standards were invalid because the Secretary of Interior in promulgating them failed to follow the mandatory consultation procedures of 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 811. The United States concedes that the Secretary did not engage in consultations sufficient to satisfy Section 811(c) in establishing the challenged safety standards, but argues, nevertheless, that the regulations were properly promulgated pursuant to authority found in several other provisions of the Act, namely, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 861(d) and 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 957. The district court upheld certain regulations that it determined were adopted under the specific authority of Section 861, but held invalid all other regulations. It does not appear that the district court considered whether the regulations it held invalid could be sustained under the general grant of administrative authority in Section 957.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court held that the defective rule-making, in itself, did not require dismissal of the indictment because it charged violations not only of the invalidated regulations but also of the standards established by Congress. The court concluded, however, that the government could not make a prima facie ease under Count 7 of the indictment on the basis of the statutory standards alone and, accordingly, Count 7 was dismissed. The government apparently concedes that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>could not prevail on this count without the stricken regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The United States brought this appeal, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, from dismissal of Count 7 of the indictment. The sole issue presented is whether the Secretary of Interior was required to follow the provisions of 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 811 in promulgating the regulations codified in 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.400.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Count 7 charged willful violations of 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 864(a) and the regulations codified at 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.400.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 864(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">(a) Coal dust, including float coal dust deposited on rock-dusted surfaces, loose coal, and other combustible materials, shall be cleaned up and not be permitted to accumulate in active workings, or on electric equipment therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">The pertinent regulations provided: \u00a7 <em>75MO-1 Definitions.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">(a) The term \u201ccoal dust\u201d means particles of coal that can pass a No. 20 sieve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">(b) The term \u201cfloat coal dust\u201d means the coal dust consisting of particles of coal that can pass a No. 200 sieve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-11\">(c) The term \u201cloose coal\u201d means coal fragments larger in size than coal dust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abgg\">\u00a7 <em>75MO-2 Cleanup program.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-18\">A program for regular cleanup and removal of accumulations of coal and float coal dusts, loose coal, and other cumbustibles shall be established and maintained. Such program shall be available to\u00b0 the Secretary or authorized representative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-19\">We first observe the express requirement of mandatory consultation established by 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 811. The section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-20\">(a) The Secretary <em>shall, </em>in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section, <em>develop, promulgate, </em>and <em>revise, </em>as may be appropriate, improved mandatory safety standards for the protection of life and the prevention of injuries in a coal mine, and shall, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section, promulgate the mandatory health standards transmitted to him by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-21\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-22\">(c) In the development and <em>revision </em>of mandatory safety standards, the Secretary <em>shall consult </em>with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, the Secretary of Labor, and with other interested Federal agencies, appropriate representatives of the coal mine operators and miners, other in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>terested persons and organizations, and such advisory committees as he may appoint. Such development and revision of mandatory safety standards shall be based upon research, demonstrations, experiments, and such other information as may be appropriate. In addition to the attainment of the highest degree of safety protection for miners, other considerations shall be the latest available scientific data in the field, the technical feasibility of the standards, and experience gained under this and other safety statutes. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">This language must be construed in light of a definitional provision of the Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(J), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">For the purpose of this chapter, the term\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\"><em>(l) </em>\u201cmandatory health or safety standard\u201d means the interim mandatory health or safety standards established by subchapters II and III of this chapter, and the standards promulgated pursuant to subchapter I of this chapter; . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">When Section 811(c) is read in conjunction with the definitional provision it is apparent that Section 811(c) by its terms applies not only when the Secretary develops new mandatory standards but also when the Secretary \u201crevises\u201d an interim mandatory safety standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Appellant does not now press the argument that the regulations codified in 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.400 can be sustained under the authority of 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 861(d), but that contention does not appear to have been wholly abandoned on appeal. Section 861(d) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-10\">(d) In any case where the provisions of sections 862 to 878, inclusive,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aad-dedup-0\">of this title provide that certain actions, conditions, or requirements shall be carried out as prescribed by the Secretary, or the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, as appropriate, the provisions of section 553 of Title 5 shall apply unless either Secretary otherwise provides. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">We agree with the district court that the regulations here at issue cannot be upheld under the authority of Section 861 (d) because Section 864(a) does not provide that the Secretary may prescribe how the \u201ccertain actions, conditions, or requirements\u201d set forth therein shall be carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">Appellant\u2019s primary contention on appeal is that the regulations codified at 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.400 are interpretative regulations properly promulgated under the general rule-making authority of 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 957 to carry out Section 864(a), and, as such, had the effect of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 957 provides: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-16\">The Secretary, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Panel are authorized to issue such regulations as each deems appropriate to carry out any provisions of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-17\">To be sure, the legislative history indicates that Section 957 permits \u201cadministrative regulations\u201d needed to carry out provisions of the Act. Senate Report No. 91-411, 91st Congress, 1st Session 87 (1969); H.R.Rep.No.91-563, 91st Congress, 1st Session 618 (1969), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News p. 2503. But we have found no indication that Congress intended \u00a7 957 to apply in cases involving not only administrative implementing regulations but also modifications of mandatory health and safety standards. If the Secretary was engaged in the \u201cdevelopment and revision of mandatory safety standards,\u201d within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the meaning of \u00a7 811(c), then he should have followed the specific procedure of \u00a7 811, mandated by the legislative directive to develop and revise these standards. Since specific procedures were established, the Secretary cannot rely upon the general grant of administrative rule-making authority of \u00a7 957. <em>See </em>Hellmich v. Hellman, 276 U.S. 233, 237, 48 S.Ct. 244, 72 L.Ed. 544 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Our examination of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, its legislative history, and the entire record before us, indicates that appellant did revise a mandatory safety standard within the meaning of \u00a7 811, in promulgating the regulations codified at 30 C. F.R. \u00a7 75.400. This conclusion is supported, in the first instance, by the Secretary of Interior\u2019s own characterization of his actions. The regulations published on November 20, 1970, were introduced in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u201cTITLE 30 \u2014 MINERAL RESOURCES</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Chapter I \u2014 Bureau of Mines Department of the Interior</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Subchapter O \u2014 Coal Mine Health and Safety</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">PART 75 \u2014 MANDATORY SAFETY STANDARDS, UNDERGROUND COAL MINES</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-11\">\u201cPursuant to the authority contained in paragraph (d) of section 301 of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 (Public Law 91-173), there was published in the Federal Registered (sic) for August 14, 1970 (35 F.R. 12911), a notice of proposed rulemaking setting forth proposed amendments and a new Subpart S, \u2018Approved Books and Records,\u2019 to Part 75 of Title 30, Code of Federal Regulations, regarding mandatory health and safety standards in underground coal mines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-12\">\u201cInterested persons were afforded a period of 30 days from the date of publication of the notice in which to submit written comments, suggestions, or objections to the proposed amendments and the proposed new Sub-part S. The period for submitting written comments, suggestions, or objections was subsequently extended to September 30, 1970, by a notice published in the Federal Register for September 5, 1970 (35 F.R. 14146). Approximately 21 associations, companies, and individuals submitted comments, suggestions, or objections. All were given careful consideration. A summary of the comments and an explanation of the actions taken with respect to them will be prepared by the Bureau of Mines and will be available 30 days from the date of this publication in the Office of the Deputy Director for Health and Safety, Room 4512, Bureau of Mines, Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. 20240.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-16\"><em>\u201cSome of the standards have been revised as suggested; in other instances, revisions were made in view of the comments received. </em>Some of the suggestions could not be adopted because they were contrary to the statutory provisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-17\">\u201cPart 75 of Title 30 Code of Federal Regulations, Subchapter O \u2014 Coal Mine Health and Safety \u2014 Mandatory Health and Safety Standards, Underground Coal Mines, <em>amended </em>and <em>revised </em>as set forth below is herewith promulgated and shall become effective upon publication in the Federal Register.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-18\">WALTER J. HICKEL,</p>\n<p id=\"A9i\">\n<em>Secretary of the Interior.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b377-19\">November 12, 1970.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-20\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-21\">We agree with appellees that the Secretary could not have made it any plainer that he was amending and revising the standards.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>It is equally clear that the regulations challenged in this appeal were intended to be amendments and revisions of statutory standards. 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.400-2 imposes a requirement additional to those imposed by Congress in \u00a7 864(a). The statute requires only that coal dust be cleaned up and not be permitted to accumulate. It does not require, as did the regulation, that a \u201cregular cleanup\u201d program be established, maintained and made available to the Secretary. In another part of the Act Congress did expressly command that some regular or periodic programs be established and made available to the Secretary to combat other safety hazards addressed by the interim standards. <em>See, e. g., </em>30 U. S.C. \u00a7 863(a), (f), (g) &amp; (w). We conclude that 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.400-2 changed the standard in \u00a7 864(a). Also, 30 C.F. R. \u00a7 75.400-1, although cast in definitional language,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> has the effect of changing the standards established by Congress in \u00a7 864(a) if it imposes an additional requirement. And the very fact that the district court determined that a prima facie case could not be made on the basis of \u00a7 864(a) alone, in the absence of the regulations, a determination not challenged on appeal, indicates that the regulations altered the legal relations of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">We have examined Gibson Wine Co. v. Snyder, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 135, 86 L.Ed. 249, 194 F.2d 329 (1952); Textile Mills Securities Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 314 U.S. 326, 62 S.Ct. 272 (1941); Toilet Goods Association v. Gardner, 278 F.Supp. 786 (S.D.N.Y. 1968); Toilet Goods Association v. Gardner, 360 F.2d 677 (2d Cir. 1966), aff\u2019d, 387 U.S. 158, 87 S.Ct. 1520, 18 L.Ed.2d 697 (1967), relied upon by appellant in support of the contention that the challenged regulations can be upheld under \u00a7 957 as \u201cinterpretative\u201d regulations. We agree with appellee that these cases are inapposite because none involved a criminal prosecution and none was considered in a context where Congress had established a procedure permitting the agency to revise statutory standards only after engaging in mandatory consultation procedures with interested and affected parties. It matters not whether under a different statutory scheme a general grant of rule-making authority might have supported the regulations. Here, Congress required a course of consultation as a condition precedent to any substantive revision of mandatory standards, except for modifications specifically authorized under \u00a7 861(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Also, we reject the suggestion that we should uphold the regulations as contemporaneous constructions of the Act by the person charged with its implementation and enforcement. In doing so, we are aware that under the predecessor statute to the Act here considered, another court has concluded that the interpretation of the statute by the administrator charged with its execution is entitled to great weight. St. Mary\u2019s Sewer Pipe Co. v. Director of United States Bureau of Mines, 262 F.2d 378 (3rd Cir. 1959). And we suggest no departure from this principle in the ordinary ease involving a prior administrative construction, typically in an adversary context, of a substantive provision of a remedial statute. But whatever applicability this canon may have in a case where the agency\u2019s rule-making authority is conceded and only its interpretation of a rule is involved, here the very power of the agency to promulgate the challenged regulation is assailed. Accordingly, we conclude that an administrative officer\u2019s interpretation of an Act of Congress to permit him to exercise broad power to flesh-out a statute by re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>vising interim statutory standards should be tested with less indulgence. This is particularly true when the interpretation permits promulgation of regulations and their willful violation can result in criminal prosecution. In this instance, we hold that the procedures established by Congress must be strictly observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Here, Congress granted the Secretary broad power to revise and even develop new substantive standards to promote the safety of coal miners. However, Congress intended that this authority could be exercised only after compliance with a detailed course of consultation designed to ensure participation in the decision-making process \u2022 of interested and affected parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">We hold that the Secretary was obligated to follow, but did not follow, the provisions of \u00a7 811(c) in promulgating the regulations codified at 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.400.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Administrative rule-making in disregard of procedural requirements is ultra vires and, we hold that the challenged regulations were improperly promulgated and are invalid. Texaco Inc. v. Federal Power Commission, 412 F.2d 740 (3rd Cir. 1969); Kelly v. United States Department of Interior, 339 F. Supp. 1095 (E.D.Cal.1972); American President Lines, Ltd. v. Federal Maritime Board, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 187, 317 F.2d 887 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The judgment is affirmed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-10\">. The district court\u2019s decision was rendered in a memorandum opinion, filed July 7, reported at 345 F.Supp. 62, and a supplemental memorandum opinion, filed September 12, 1972. The first opinion does not consider whether the regulations might be sustained under \u00a7 957. The second opinion more specifically states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-13\">The Secretary chose to exercise the authority of 30 U.S.C. 861 (d) alone and not to incorporate the \u2019general administrative rule making authority of 30 U.S.C. 957. The sole question is whether section 861(d) properly may he construed to bring the subject regulations within its range of authority.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b375-12\">. As set forth in appellant\u2019s brief, Count 7 charged:</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">COUNT VII THE GRAND JURY FURTHER CHARGES:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-15\">1. Each allegation contained in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Count I hereof is realleged, reaffirmed, and incorporated herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-16\">2. On or about June 19, 1970, the Finley Coal Company and Charles Finley did willfully fail to clean up and prevent the accumulation of coal dust, including float dust deposited on rock-dusted surfaces, loose coal, and other combustible materials in active workings of Number 15 underground coal mine, in violation of Sections 109(b) and 304(a) of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 819(b) and 864(a), 30 C.F.R. 75.400.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-17\">We observe a curious sequential relationship between the date of the promulgation of the regulations cited in Count 7 of the indictment, November 20, 1970, and the date of the violations charged in that count, June 19, 1970. At oral argument, counsel advised us that on June 19, 1970 regulations were in effect with language identical to that found in the November regulations that the indictment charges were violated in the indictment. (Apparently, the earlier regulations were promulgated in March 1970 when the Act first took effect.) Of course, the statutory provision underlying the subject regulations, Section 864(a), which was also relied upon in Count 7, was in effect on the date of the violations charged. -Appellant does not raise the question whether a prosecution and conviction relying upon the challenged November regulations, under these circumstances, would violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws. Since this contention was not made and the question was not briefed and argued, we intimate no views concerning it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b376-11\">. Counsel lias not contended, nor does our research indicate, that the regulations challenged in this appeal could be sustained under the authority of 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 811 (j), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-12\">All interpretations, regulations, and instructions of the Secretary or the Director of the Bureau of Mines, in effect on December 30, 1969, and not inconsistent with any provision of this chapter, shall be published in the Federal Register and shall continue in effect until modified or superseded in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b377-13\">. As noted above, the United States has conceded that the consultations engaged in cannot satisfy 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(c) if that provision is applicable.

Reliance is placed on the language contained in the promulgation notice quoted in full in the majority opinion (pp. 289-290, <em>supra.) </em>and on the nature and content of those regulations, codified at 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.400 et seq. It then concludes that all such regulations are invalid because of the failure to conform to the requirements of 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 811(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">It appears to me, however, that the purpose of the regulations issued in November, 1970 was not to amend and revise the statutory interim standards of the Act but rather that the Secretary intended to amend and revise the regulations which had been published on March 28, 1970. In March, as well as in November, 1970, the recitations of authority clearly indicate that the Secretary intended to publish for inclusion in the Code of Federal Regulations the statutory interim standards (e. g. \u00a7 75.-400) and to promulgate the standards under Sections 811(j) and 861(d) and interpretative regulations under Section 957.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I can find no manifestation of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>tention by the Secretary to amend, revise or improve the statutory Interim Mandatory Safety Standard, nor do I find that such was the effect:</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">My concurrence in the result is based on the conclusion that, in the posture of this case, the <em>particular </em>regulations at issue here (\u00a7\u00a7 75.400-1 and 75.400-2) are infirm because they substantively alter the interim standards on the subject and, perforce, their promulgation required conformance with Section 811(a)-(g).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since the Secretary admittedly did not utilize Section 811, and since, in my opinion, other rulemaking grants in the Act do .not permit such substantive alterations, Sections 75.400-1 and 75.400-2 are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">This was not to say, however, that other regulations contained in 30 C.F.R. Part 75 would necessarily be invalid, because they might be sustainable under the other rulemaking grants in the Act. This determination could only be made after consideration of individual regulations with reference to the other appropriate rulemaking grants of the Act, i. e. \u00a7\u00a7811(j), 861(d), and 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Thus, I am unable to concur in the majority opinion insofar as it may be read to hold that the Secretary\u2019s admitted failure to follow the provisions of Section 811(a)-(g) results in the invalidity of <em>all </em>regulations promulgated in November, 1970, which are codified at 30 C.F.R. Part 75.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\">. The promulgation statement of the Secretary appearing on March 28, 1970 in the Federal Register reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">\u201cPart 75 \u2014 -Mandatory Safety Standards, Underground Coal Mines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">\u201cPart 75 \u2014 Mandatory Safety Standards, Underground Coal Mines, reading as set fortli below, is added to Subchapter O of Chapter I, Title 30, Code of Federal Regulations. <em>This part includes mandatory safety standards for underground coal mines which are set forth in Title III of the Federal Goal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, other mandatory safety standards issued pursuant to that title and section 101 (j) </em>[30 <em>V.S.G. </em>\u00a7 <em>811 (m of the aet, and interpretations and supplementary regulations. </em>Because Title III of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 becomes effective on March 30, 1970, it is impracticable either to give notice of proposed rulemaking on, or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>delay the effective date of, any of the provisions of the part.

I have no difficulty determining that the \u201cclean-up program\u201d requirement appearing in Section 75.400-2 is \u201csubstantive\u201d in nature and thus beyond the permissible scope of his rule-making authority under the Act. The definitions contained in Section 75.400-1 present a much closer question. On this appeal, however, the government concedes that it could not make a prima facie case against defendants in Count VII of the indictment without both regulations. On that basis, then, given the fact that we must apply the principle of strict construction in criminal matters, I conclude that these definitions also impose an additional burden on coal mine operators and therefore the regulation cannot be sustained as being merely interpretative.
