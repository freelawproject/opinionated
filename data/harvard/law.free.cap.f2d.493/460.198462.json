In his oral findings delivered from the bench following a hearing, the District Judge based his dismissal on the predicate that all the medical history revealed severe preexisting degenerative arthritis which condition did not change after the accident, and, more specifically, that both medical reports showed there had been no aggravation of the preexisting condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">The predicate was erroneous, and the defendants do not contend otherwise. Rather they urge that a district judge is not precluded by conflicting medical evidence from ev\u00e1luating all the evidence and deciding under appropriate standards that jurisdictional amount is not present.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The short answer is that that is not what the District Judge did in this case, and the dismissal must be and is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-22\">. They also urge various reasons why certain of the conclusions set out by plaintiff\u2019s own doctor in his report should be ignored or minimized.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
