The suit, filed on the basis of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, sought monetary damages and in-junctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-32\">The appellants complain that the ap-pellee abused them mentally and physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>cally, beat them, stomped them, forced them to eat through the bars of their cells, refused them proper bedding and showers, as well as normal visiting privileges, sprayed them with mace, forced them to do push-ups, denied them drinking water and forced them to drink from the cell commode. The appellee filed a motion for summary judgment, supported by affidavits, asserting that the charges made were complete fabrications. The motion was denied upon consideration of the affidavits pro and con and the case was set down for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Prior to trial thereof, appellants sought to recuse the trial judge under Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *alleging that he was \u201can agent of Black Power groups\u201d and agent for \u201cblack power movements in the City Jail in St. Louis; that he conspires with them to delay actions brought by members of the White Race and by this plaintiff, in particular,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, in addition, that Judge Webster had \u201cgreat personal interest and bias and prejudice in seeing that this plaintiff\u2019s rights * * * are destroyed, covered up and concealed\u201d due to his having been named as defendant in a suit brought by these plaintiffs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The statutory requirements for disqualification, <em>supra, </em>were examined by us in United States v. Anderson, 433 F.2d 856 (8th Cir. 1970). It was there pointed out, among other requirements, that the affidavit must \u201callege specific facts and not mere conclusions or generalities.\u201d Measured against the statutory requirements we find the affidavits insufficient. Even considering the allegations in the suit filed against Judge Webster as part of appellants\u2019 affidavits, nothing therein contained, or in the affidavits themselves, amount to more than scurrilities and generalities falling far short of the specificities required by statute. There was no error in the denial of this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-15\">The case proceeded to jury trial. Countering appellants\u2019 charges the appellee denied, with supporting testimony, the brutalities alleged. The jury resolved the factual issues presented in appellee\u2019s favor and, although appellants urge numerous errors in the conduct of the trial, in evidentiary rulings, and in instructions to the jury, we are not, after careful consideration thereof, persuaded of prejudicial error. Paraphrasing to some extent our holding in United States v. Christian, 427 F.2d 1299 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 909, 91 S.Ct. 153, 27 L.Ed.2d 148 (1970), we note that although our courts are zealous in protecting a litigant\u2019s every right, it has never been the function of a reviewing court to reverse a jury verdict unless some error of a prejudicial nature was committed. Such is not the case here. A litigant is entitled to a fair trial but not a perfect one. Lutwak v. United States, 344 U.S. 604, 619, 73 S.Ct. 481, 97 L.Ed. 593 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">Whenever a party to any proceeding in a district court makes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the judge before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of any adverse party, such judge shall proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be assigned to hear such proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-13\">The affidavit shall state the facts and the reasons for the belief that bias or prejudice exists, and shall be filed not less than ten days before the beginning of the term at which the proceeding is to be heard, or good cause shall be shown for failure to file it within such time * * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-18\">.

In the ease referred to, No. 730 251(2), leave to proceed in forma pauperis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a) had been granted by Judge Webster. It was then assigned to Judge Regan who, prior to trial in the instant case, dismissed the action as \u201cpatently frivolous.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
