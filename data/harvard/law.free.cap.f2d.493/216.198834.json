We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-22\">The grand jury indicted appellants on eleven counts charging willful misapplication of bank funds! Upon the government\u2019s motion, Counts 3, 5, and 8 were dismissed prior to trial. The remaining counts, on which appellants were convicted, charged that appellants committed willful misapplication \u201cin that they granted and caused to be granted\u201d eight unsecured loans to parties \u201cwho [were], then and there, as the defendants well knew, not the actual beneficiar [ies] of said loan[s]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The indictment further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>charged \u201c[t]hat by means of the granting of the said loan[s], the defendants converted the proceeds thereof to the use of [appellant] Gens.\u201d The foregoing is the complete extent of the physical acts alleged in the indictment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was further alleged that appellants Porter and Carleton were officers and directors of the bank at all times material to the eight counts, and that appellant Gens was a director at all times material to the final six counts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The evidence adduced at trial was as follows. In the fall of 1969, Porter and Carleton gained control of the Massachusetts bank. They did so with financial assistance from Gens, whose principal business was the operation of several nursing homes in the New England area.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At that time Gens\u2019 nursing homes were experiencing cash shortages, mainly due to delays in Commonwealth of Massachusetts welfare payments. To add needed cash to his business, Gens borrowed $80,000 from the Massachusetts bank. That amount represented the bank\u2019s self-imposed loan limit. The record is not clear, but apparently Gens\u2019 business also borrowed funds from the bank at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-18\">Besides these loans directly to Gens and his business, during the next twelve months the bank also granted the eight loans totaling $235,000 which are in issue in this case. It was undisputed at trial that the named debtors turned over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>the proceeds of all eight loans to Gens, and that he in turn invested these sums in the nursing homes. The eight loans are best described in three categories: four loans to Hyman H. Silver; one loan to Charles Roazen; and three to J. Peter Felopoulos, Dennis Ditelberg and their law firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Hyman H. Silver was for many years Gens\u2019 partner in the nursing home business. At trial Silver acknowledged signing for the four loans from the Massachusetts bank alleged in Counts 1, 2, 4 and 6, in the total amount of $80,000. He testified that he had neither sought these loans nor received the proceeds. All he did was sign papers for them at the behest of his partner Gens. He also said he presumed Gens would employ the loan proceeds in their nursing home business, which is what Gens did. Silver further testified that these sort of cursory financial transactions on his part were not unusual. Over the years he had been in charge of the day-to-day operations in their business, while Gens was in charge of finances. Silver said he routinely signed whatever financial papers Gens placed before him, apparently even when such papers were blank notes representing his personal obligation rather than that of their business.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> *8 On cross-examination, Silver said that he recognized in signing for such loans that he could be held personally responsible for their repayment should the business fail to do so, even though he personally did not receive the proceeds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Silver also testified that at the time he signed for the four loans in issue in this case he had a net worth of between $500,000 and $700,000. It may be, however, that these figures represented the assets of the nursing home business as well as Silver\u2019s personal assets. The general impression derived from Silver\u2019s testimony is that he rarely, if ever, distinguished his personal finances from those of the nursing home business.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">Charles Roazen was a neighbor and close friend of Silver and through him became acquainted with Gens. At trial, Roazen acknowledged signing for the $80,000 loan alleged in Count 9 and further testified that upon deposit of that sum in his account he immediately made out a check to Gens for the same amount. According to Roazen, the loan came about in the following manner. Sometime around January 1970 Gens said that he, Silver, Porter and Carleton wanted to purchase stock in yet another bank, the Garden City Bank and Trust Company of Newton, Massachusetts. Gens told Roazen that they needed a fifth person \u201cto come in with them because they were going to use money borrowed from the Massachusetts Bank and Trust Company.\u201d Gens said that he and Silver had borrowed up to their limits at the Massachusetts bank <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Porter and Carleton did not want their names publicly associated with the stock purchase. Despite vigorous cross-examination suggesting otherwise, Roazen maintained that it was his understanding that although he was to sign for a loan to help out the other four, he personally would not have to repay the loan, barring some \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Roazen said he agreed to this proposal because he and Silver had been friends for a long time. In addition, Gens had pointed out to Roazen that the stock purchase would be beneficial to Roazen\u2019s automotive-parts business because the Garden City bank thereafter would be amenable toward making loans to Roazen\u2019s customers. Roazen\u2019s position was also supported by the fact that when the Garden City bank stock purchase was called off, Gens felt free to invest the $80,000 proceeds of the Roazen loan into his cash-hungry nursing home business. He did not consult Roazen on this. On the other hand, appellants\u2019 position that Roazen had agreed to purchase stock in the bank along with the four others, and that the loan was clearly a personal obligation of Roazen\u2019s, is supported by a letter which Gens gave Roazen at the time of the loan, evidencing a beneficial interest on Roazen\u2019s part in the stock to be acquired.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Also, there is no question that Roazen was a man of wealth who could afford to repay the $80,000 loan. On this record the jury could reasonably have reached either conclusion as to Roazen\u2019s agreed-upon role with respect to the loan that he signed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-16\">Finally, J. Peter Felopoulos and Dennis Ditelberg were partners in a law firm which did a substantial amount of work for Gens and Silver\u2019s nursing home business around the time of the loans in question. These two attorneys testified that in early 1970 Gens and Silver came to them and asked to borrow money for their business. They replied that they had no cash available. Gens and Silver then told the attorneys that if they could present a financial statement, \u201cthey could perhaps arrange a loan for us; and, that\u2019s how we got to know the Massachusetts Bank and Trust Company.\u201d Subsequently, the loans cited in Counts 7, 10 and 11, in the total amount of $75,000, were arranged. The two attorneys never personally went to the bank or spoke with Porter or Carle-ton about these loans. Instead, after financial statements were prepared, Gens brought them the notes and they signed them. Immediately after each loan, the proceeds were forwarded to Gens by check. In exchange, they received notes from Gens and Silver. Like Silver, Felopoulos and Ditelberg said that they \u201cfully recognized\u201d that the three loans <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>from the Massachusetts bank were personal obligations of theirs. The apparent motive was the attorneys\u2019 desire to keep the favor of a substantial client. There appears to be no question that they possessed sufficient resources at the time to repay the three loans. At the close of the government\u2019s case, appellants moved for judgment of acquittal for lack of evidence. These motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In its charge to the jury, the trial court first stated that the government\u2019s theory of willful misapplication was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">\u201c. . . that Defendant Gens dominated and controlled Defendants Porter and Carleton or at least worked in concert with them to arrange loans to the persons named in each count in the indictment, knowing that such person was not the true borrower and that Defendant Gens was to be the true beneficiary thereof, and that each of such persons was used as the borrower either with or without the knowledge and consent of the common borrower in order to disguise the concentration of the bank\u2019s funds to Defendant Gens.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The court then instructed the jury that it had to find that appellants \u201cmisapplied or caused to be misapplied money, funds, or credits of the bank by granting a loan for the amount and to the person named in the particular count so that these funds could be converted to the use of Defendant Richard H. Gens.\u201d These two excerpts from the charge were the only descriptions instructing the jury as to the acts which it could find constituted willful misapplication. On this basis, the jury found each appellant guilty on all eight counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">We think that the indictment and the charge to the jury, at best, did not give the jury adequate guidance as to precisely what acts constitute .willful misapplication of bank funds in violation of \u00a7 656. The most likely interpretation of the indictment and the court\u2019s charge was that appellants should be found guilty if it was found that they granted loans to the named debtors knowing that the proceeds would be turned over to Gens. For the reasons that follow, such a finding by itself is not sufficient to constitute willful misapplication under \u00a7 656. Therefore, the convictions cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">As employed in \u00a7 656, the term \u201cwillfully misapplied\u201d has generally been held to have no settled meaning. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Britton, 107 U.S. 655, 669, 2 S.Ct. 512, 27 L.Ed. 520 (1883); Mulloney v. United States, 79 F.2d 566, 581 (1st Cir. 1935), cert. denied, 296 U.S. 658, 56 S.Ct. 383, 80 L. Ed. 468 (1936).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead, during the past hundred years it has been left to the courts to define the acts which constitute willful misapplication of bank funds within the meaning of the statute. During this period several cases have involved situations roughly analogous to the instant case, i. e., instances of bank loans made to named individuals who, with the knowledge of bank officials, passed on the proceeds to third parties. But willful misapplication of bank funds has not been found in all such situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\"> The cases of this type in which willful misapplication has been found fall into three general categories. First, those in which bank officials knew the named debtor was either fictitious or wholly unaware that his name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>was being used. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Stokes, 471 F.2d 1318 (5th Cir. 1973) (fictitious debtor); United States v. Schmidt, 471 F.2d 385 (3d Cir. 1972) (per curiam) (named debtor never authorized use of his name for any purpose). Second, cases in which bank officials knew the named debtor was financially incapable of repaying the loan whose proceeds he passed on to the third party. <em>See </em>Mulloney v. United States, <em>supra </em>79 F.2d at 581.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Third, cases in which bank officials assured the named debtor, regardless of his financial capabilities, that they would look for repayment only to the third party who actually received the loan proceeds: in other words where the debtor allowed only his name to be used, enabling the bank officials to grant a <em>de facto </em>loan to a third party to whom the bank was unwilling to grant a formal loan. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. King, 484 F.2d 924 (10th Cir. 1973) cert. denied, 42 U.S.L.W. 3555 (U.S. April 1, 1974); United States v. Moraites, 456 F.2d 435 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 891, 93 S.Ct. 109, 34 L. Ed.2d 148 (1972).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In the three situations described above, the loans formally being made could be characterized as \u201csham\u201d or \u201cdummy\u201d loans, because there was little likelihood or expectation that the named debtor would repay. The knowing participation of bank officials in such loans could consequently be found to have a \u201cnatural tendency\u201d to injure or defraud their banks and thus constitute willful misapplication within the meaning of \u00a7 656. Mulloney v. United States, <em>supra </em>79 F.2d at 584; Galbreath v. United States, 257 F. 648, 656 (6th Cir. 1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">On the other hand, \u25a0 where the named debtor is both financially capable and fully understands that it is his responsibility to repay, a loan to him cannot \u2014 absent other circumstances \u2014 properly be characterized as sham or dummy, even if bank officials know he will turn over the proceeds to a third party. Instead, what we really have in such a situation are two loans: one from the bank to the named debtor, the other from the named debtor to the third party. The bank looks to the named debtor for repayment of its loan, while the named debtor looks to the third party for repayment of his loan. If for some reason the third party fails to make repayment to the named debtor, the latter nonetheless recognizes that this failure does not end his own obligation to repay the bank. In this situation, the bank official has simply granted a loan to a financially capable party, which is precisely what a bank official should do. There is no natural tendency to injure or defraud the bank, and the official can not be said to have willfully misapplied funds in violation of \u00a7 656.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See </em>United States v. Docherty, 468 F.2d 989 (2d Cir. 1972); <em>cf. </em>Giragosian v. United States, 349 F.2d 166 (1st Cir. 1965); Johnson v. United States, 95 F.2d 813 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>(4th Cir. 1938). For example, in <em>Doch-erty, </em>involving a factual situation quite similar to the instant case, the court held that where a named debtor knew he was putting his own credit \u201con the line\u201d and possessed the financial means to repay, there was insufficient evidence of willful misapplication of bank funds even though he turned over the loan proceeds to a third party. 468 F.2d at 995.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Throughout the trial the government has argued to the contrary. It contends that willful misapplication occurs whenever bank officials grant loans to parties with the knowledge that the proceeds will go to a third party. In support of this proposition, the government relies on two cases, United States v. Cooper, 464 F.2d 648 (10th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1107, 93 S.Ct. 902, 34 L.Ed.2d 688 (1973), and Hargreaves v. United States, 75 F.2d 68 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 295 U.S. 759, 55 S.Ct. 920, 79 L.Ed. 1701 (1935). However, both cases more readily fall within the three categories of willful misapplication outlined above. The loans in <em>Cooper </em>appear to have been to parties who were not held responsible for repayment. They never made any payments of their own on the loans. Instead, the third-party recipient made the payments. 464 F.2d at 650-651. Similarly, the loan in <em>Hargreaves </em>appears to have been to a financially irresponsible party. He testified that it was a question \u201cwhether he was worth it unsecured\u201d and that he never expected to pay it. 75 F.2d at 70; <em>see </em>United States v. Docherty, <em>supra </em>468 F. 2d at 992, 994. The government\u2019s theory of willful misapplication goes much too far and is without case or policy support.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">In addition to holding that the jury was incorrectly instructed on the standard for willful misapplication, we also hold that, with respect to seven of the eight counts, there was insufficient evidence adduced at trial to find appellants guilty under the correct standard. Silver, Felopoulos and Ditelberg were real persons who were financially capable of repaying the loans they signed for. Moreover, there ttfas no evidence presented which might rebut their assertions that they fully recognized their personal obligations to repay these loans. Thus, absent special circumstances, <em>see </em>n. 14, <em>supra, </em>there was no basis for the jury to find that the seven loans cited in Counts 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, and 11 were shams. They simply were loans to financially-capable parties who reloaned the proceeds to Gens.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We note that Silver subsequently signed a personal guarantee on the loans to him, and that Felopoulos and Ditelberg have made payments on the loans to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">On the other hand, although Roazen was a real person and a wealthy one to boot, there was evidence from which the jury could conclude that neither he nor appellants expected him to pay back the loan cited in Count 9, and that instead the bank looked only to Gens for repayment. However, in view of the indictment and jury instructions, the jury may alternatively have found only that the loan was properly made to Roazen and that he reloaned the proceeds to Gens. Therefore, we reverse the convictions of Gens, Porter and Carleton on Counts 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10 and 11, vacate their convictions on Count 9, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>remand for a new trial on said count. In view of this disposition, we do not reach the several other issues appellants have raised.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-12\">. The statute reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">\u201c\u00a7 656. <em>Theft, embezzlement, or misapplication by bank officer or employee.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-14\">Whoever, being an officer, director, agent or employee of, or connected in any capacity with any Federal Reserve Bank, member bank, national bank or insured bank, or a receiver of a national bank, embezzles, abstracts, jiurloins or willfully misapplies any of the moneys, funds or credits of such bank or any moneys, funds, assets or securities intrusted to the custody or care of such bank, or to the custody or care of any sucli agent, officer, director, employee or receiver, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both; but if the amount embezzled, abstracted, purloined or misapplied does not exceed $100, lie shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-24\">* * * \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-25\">There is no question in the instant case that the bank was federally-insured within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b305-28\">.

Because Gens did not hold a position with the bank at the time of the loans alleged in Counts 1 and 2, it is clear that he could not have been convicted as a principal under \u00a7 656. The court, in its charge to the jury, said that Gens could nevertheless be convicted as an aider and abettor. <em>But see </em>United States v. Tornabene, 222 F.2d 875 (3d Cir. 1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b306-23\">. Prior to the takeover, the bank had been experiencing difficult times and needed fresh financial investment. An arrangement was made by which Porter and Carleton would receive effective control of the bank in exchange for their purchase of $400,000 in the bank\u2019s convertible debentures. Lacking that much money on their own, Porter and Carle-ton enlisted the financial support of others in acquiring the needed debentures. Gens was among those who came in with them, purchasing $40,000 worth. His business partner, Hyman H. Silver, also purchased $40,000 worth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b307-6\">. Silver specifically testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">\u201c[Silver] : If I could explain how it went, I would come in in the morning and go out and come back in late in the afternoon. Mr. Gens usually would say to me, \u2018Are you, going to be in tomorrow morning?\u2019 I would say, \u2018No, I\u2019m going, wherever I\u2019m going.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m going to need some money. Do you want to sign these?\u2019 I would sign some blank notes. We have done that. I know it\u2019s wrong. We have done it over a period of years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Indeed, Silver could not actually recall signing for the fourth loan alleged in the indictment, presumably because he did so in the same casual manner described above. Silver did acknowledge his signature on the loan when it was shown to him, and testified on the assumption that he signed it. There was no suggestion of forgery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b307-12\">.

Of course, where bank officials knowingly grant loans to financially incapable parties, such conduct in and of itself constitutes willful misapplication, whether or not the debtor passes on the loan proceeds to a third party. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Joiner, 429 F.2d 489 (5th Cir. 1970) ; Robinson v. United States, 30 F.2d 25 (6th Cir. 1929).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b310-5\">. We also note the case of Gordon v.

We do not go so far as to say that the obligation of a financially responsible party to a bank will in all cases mean that post-loan transfer to a third party will not result in liability for willful misapplication. Por example, there may well be situations where the funneling of funds from marginally responsible borrowers to a third party engaged in a high risk venture would tend to injure the bank. But we need not explore this matter further at this time. The government made no allegation and offered no proof beyond the bare contention that funds were concentrated in Gens\u2019 hands. In the absence of a showing of special circumstances demonstrating injury or risk of injury to the bank despite the obligation of a financially responsible party to the bank, liability cannot be found.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b311-6\">. Government counsel sought to distinguish <em>Docherty </em>at oral argument by noting, accurately, that the defendant in that case was the named debtor rather than, as here, the bank officials or the actual recipient of the proceeds. However, this distinction between <em>Docherty </em>and the instant case in no way blunts the key point made by tiie Second Circuit: that there can be no harm to the bank, and thus no misapplication, where the named debtor is both financially capable and fully intends to repay the loan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b311-11\">. Indeed, since the nursing home business was as much Silver\u2019s as Gens\u2019, the proceeds of the loans to him were not truly reloaned to Gens. They simply were invested in their business at a time when cash was vitally needed. The prospective benefits of this investment would flow equally to Silver and Gens.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
