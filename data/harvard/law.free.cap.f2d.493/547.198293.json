His defense was entrapment. On this appeal from his conviction, McKinley makes two arguments for reversal: (1) the limits placed upon his cross-examination of the government\u2019s primary witness deprived him of an effective cross-examination and (2) the lower court abused its discretion in not granting a mistrial after an improper statement by the same witness incurably prejudiced him. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">McKinley admitted that he procured heroin for Sam Battles,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> an individual who, it later developed, was cooperating with the government at the time. McKinley\u2019s sole defense was that he was entrapped into making the sale. Generally, his version of what occurred was that Battles, an acquaintance of some ten years, contacted him and asked him to obtain some heroin for a \u201csick cousin\u201d from Pineville, Alabama. Battles\u2019 persistent pleas for compassion overcame McKinley\u2019s reluctance, and his humanitarian instincts caused him to agree to act as procuring agent. He then obtained the heroin from one Catherine Douglas, transferred it to Battles, and subsequently, remitted money obtained from Battles to Ms. Douglas. The Me-Kinley-Battles \u201cconnection\u201d occurred at Battles\u2019 service station near Mobile. At the trial undercover agent Claude Smith of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) testified for the government. Smith had posed as Battles\u2019 sick cousin and was present at the service station when McKinley delivered the heroin to Battles. On direct examination Agent Smith testified mainly as to how this transaction occurred. On redirect on the crucial entrapment defense issue of predisposition,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Agent Smith testified that two Mobile police officers and one Pritchard, Alabama police officer told him that McKinley was \u201cone of the sources in Mobile who was selling narcotics of various types.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> McKinley took the stand in his own behalf and admitted being convicted in 1965 of possession of marijuana, but denied ever being involved in selling drugs. After admitting he obtained the heroin for Battles\u2019 \u201csick cousin\u201d and describing the events at the service station, he stated that his only incentive had been to act as a \u201cgood Samaritan.\u201d In rebuttal Ralph Jordan, a city detective with the Mobile police department, testified that he had information from confidential informants that McKinley was \u201cone of the major dealers in narcotics in the City of Mobile.\u201d Additionally, a deputy sheriff with the Mobile County Sheriff\u2019s Department and a detective with the Pritchard Police Department testified that they had received information that McKinley was selling heroin during the period leading up to the transaction for which he was on trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">McKinley argues that the trial court denied him his sixth amendment right to effective cross-examination when it would not allow him to ask Agent Smith where he lived, what aliases he had used in other drug investigations, and how long he remained in Mobile after this incident. He relies on Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 51 S.Ct. 218, 75 L.Ed. 624 (1931); and Smith v. Illinois, 390 U.S. 129, 88 S.Ct. 748, 19 L.Ed.2d 956 (1968). The government objected to disclosing Smith\u2019s address on grounds of relevancy and materiality, stating: \u201c[i]t [Smith\u2019s address] is immaterial and irrelevant in view of the nature of the witness\u2019 occupation. His residence is totally immaterial and should not be a matter of public serunity (sic).\u201d In reference to disclosing aliases used in other eases, the government objected on grounds of relevancy, concluding with \u201cto allow [counsel] to fully discover any and everything this man has done in all drug investigations is totally irrelevant and prejudicial to the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\"> In Alford v. United States, <em>supra, </em>a mail fraud ease, a former employee of the accused gave \u201cdamaging testimony\u201d on direct examination. On cross-examination after a materiality objection by the government, the trial judge refused to let the defendant ask this witness where he lived. The Supreme Court stated in reversing, that \u201cit is the essence of a fair trial that reasonable latitude be given the cross-examiner, even though he is unable to state to the court what facts a reasonable cross-examination might develop. Prejudice ensues from a denial of the opportunity to <em>place the witness in his proper setting and put the weight of his testimony and his credibility to a test, </em>without which the jury cannot fairly appraise them.\u201d (Emphasis added) 218 U.S. at 692, 51 S.Ct. at 219, 75 L.Ed. at 628 (1931). In Smith v. Illinois, <em>supra</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the question of guilt or innocence hinged upon a credibility choice between the accused and the principal state witness, who was testifying under an assumed name. The Court there held that the trial court\u2019s failure to require divul-gence of the witness\u2019s real name and home address deprived the accused of the right to effective cross-examination included within the sixth amendment\u2019s confrontation clause. In both <em>Smith </em>and <em>Alford </em>the Court recognized that the trial judge can compromise this right in order to protect a witness from \u201cquestions which go beyond the bounds of proper cross-examination merely to harass, annoy or humiliate [the witness].\u201d The protection of the witness from physical harm is included within these categories. <em>See </em>Smith v. Illinois, <em>supra </em>(White, J., concurring); and United States v. Alston, 460 F.2d 48 (5th Cir. 1972) and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\"><em>Smith </em>and <em>Alford </em>require as a constitutional minimum that a defendant be given an opportunity to place the prosecution\u2019s witnesses in their proper setting and test the weight of their testimony and their credibility before the jury. However, once a defendant has been accorded this basic constitutional right, the outer parameters of his cross-examination are committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>See </em>C. Wright and A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">The government first argues that solicitude for Agent Smith\u2019s safety justified not allowing McKinley to elicit his address on cross-examination. This argument raises the issue of whether the vaguely worded objection to the divulgence of Smith's address would be sufficient to restrict what otherwise would be a constitutional right on this ground. <em>See, e. g., </em>Alston v. United States, <em>supra; </em>United States v. Varelli, 407 F.2d 735, 750-751 (7th Cir. 1969); and United States v. Persico, 425 F.2d 1375 (2d Cir. 1970). However, we pretermit de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>ciding this issue because of our disposition of the threshold issue of whether McKinley was denied an effective cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In <em>Alford, Smith, </em>and Alston v. United States, the testimony of the witness sought to be cross-examined was either crucial to the government\u2019s case <em>(Smith </em>and Alston); or at least extremely damaging to the accused <em>(Alford). </em>Thus, the credibility of the witnesses was, of necessity, a major issue in the trial of vital importance to each defendant. The instant case is altogether different. Under well established fifth circuit principles, by asserting the defense of entrapment, McKinley admitted the acts charged. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Newcomb, 488 F.2d 190 (5th Cir. 1974), United States v. Williamson, 482 F.2d 508 (5th Cir. 1973), and the cases cited therein. Most of Agent Smith\u2019s testimony consisted of describing the commission of the crime, <em>i. e., </em>the transaction between McKinley and Battles which Smith witnessed and which McKinley freely admitted on the stand. Although Smith\u2019s version of what transpired differed slightly from McKinley\u2019s, this difference was not of significance. The real issue in the case was whether Sam Battles induced McKinley into committing a crime he was otherwise not predisposed to commit. Agent Smith was not privy to Battles\u2019 conversations with McKinley and did not testify as to their substance. Thus, the credibility of Agent Smith was only marginally at issue in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Additionally, McKinley was allowed to place Agent Smith in his proper setting before the jury. Smith was not an informer of unknown background but was a full-time salaried employee of the Justice Department. McKinley was allowed to discover his true name, his age, occupation, length and grade level of employment, his supervisor\u2019s name, the exact location of his office, the names of other BNDD agents working on the Mobile Task Force, the date the Task Force came to Mobile, the date Smith began working on this case, and the aliases he had used while working on this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">Under these circumstances, the refusal to allow McKinley to inquire as to Smith\u2019s residence and other aliases did not thwart effective cross-examination. Given the minimal weight of Agent Smith\u2019s testimony in resolving the issue of predisposition, the fact that his credibility was only tangentially put in issue, and the extensive background information which was elicited from him about his proper setting; we hold that McKinley was not denied his sixth amendment right to an effective cross-examination and that the trial judge was within his discretion in not allowing McKinley\u2019s counsel to ask the proposed questions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em>United States v. Twomey, 460 F.2d 400 (7th Cir. 1972); United States v. Teller, 412 F.2d 374, 379-380 (7th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 402 U. S. 949, 91 S.Ct. 1603, 29 L.Ed.2d 118 (1971); United States v. Lawler, 413 F.2d 622, 627 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1046, 90 S.Ct. 698, 24 L.Ed.2d 691 (1969); and United States v. Lee, 413 F.2d 910, 915 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1022, 90 S.Ct. 595, 24 L. Ed.2d 515 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">McKinley also argues that the trial court abused its discretion in not granting his motion for a mistrial after an unresponsive interjection by Agent Smith on redirect incurably prejudiced his defense. These events developed in the following manner. On cross-examination counsel for McKinley asked Agent Smith if Battles had given McKinley any marked money. After an af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>firmative answer, counsel then asked if this marked money was \u201clater recovered from the defendant.\u201d Smith\u2019s response was that he did not <em>\u201cthink </em>any money was recovered.\u201d On redirect, the government, brought out the fact that McKinley\u2019s arrest occurred five months after the incident. Then the following question was asked. \u201cDo you <em>know </em>whether any money was recovered from the defendant at that time?\u201d Smith\u2019s response was, \u201cNo, I don't know if there was any money. <em>I know some narcotics were recovered.\u201d </em>Defense counsel then moved to strike Smith\u2019s answer. The court granted this motion and the jury was instructed to disregard the italicized portion of Smith\u2019s statement. After securing this relief, McKinley moved for a mistrial on the basis that striking the statement and instructing the jury to disregard it, as he had requested, was really not the proper remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"> When a defendant asserts the defense of entrapment hearsay reputation evidence is admissible to prove his predisposition to commit the crime. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Simon, 488 F.2d 133 (5th Cir. 1973), and United States v. Stills, 476 F.2d 592 (5th Cir. 1973). Whether this would include hearsay testimony as to subsequent specific acts (possessing narcotics at the time of arrest) is a question we need not decide. Nor, need we decide whether the prejudice created by Smith\u2019s statement was cured by the cautionary instruction granted at McKinley\u2019s request.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is unnecessary to reach these points, because we are convinced that interjection of this statement into the context of this trial was harmless error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">At the outset, we carefully scrutinized the record for any intimation that the statement was purposefully interjected by the government. Defense counsel\u2019s line of questioning appears to be aimed at raising the inference in the jury\u2019s mind that since no marked money was recovered at the time of McKinley\u2019s arrest, then McKinley might have transferred the money to Catherine Douglas, as he stated. It was perfectly proper for the government to point out on redirect that the arrest occurred five months after McKinley was given the money and that, in any event, Smith <em>did not know </em>whether any money was recovered. Smith\u2019s supplemental statement was entirely unresponsive. In these circumstances, given the propriety of the line of questioning, we can perceive no question of prosecutorial bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The objectionable statement was merely cumulative of other evidence that was eventually properly placed before the jury. After the jury had heard a Mobile city detective testify that McKinley was \u201cone of the major dealers in narcotics in the City of Mobile,\u201d and had listened to a Mobile deputy sheriff and a Pritchard detective state that McKinley had been engaged in selling heroin, the single statement that narcotics were recovered from McKinley when he was arrested paled into insignificance. This probable lack of prejudice was reinforced by the court\u2019s prompt action in instructing the jury to disregard the unresponsive comment. The strong proof of widespread narcotics activity, which went into the record without objection, rendered the possibility that Smith\u2019s comment prejudiced the question of predisposition gossamer indeed. Additionally, Agent Smith testified on redirect as to what he had heard about McKinley\u2019s reputation for dealing in drugs, and the jury was made aware of McKinley\u2019s prior marijuana conviction. In view of all of the testimony in the record, we hold that the interjection of this isolated statement into this case did not have a \u201csubstantial influence\u201d on the jury. <em>See </em>Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946), and United States v. Stein-koenig, 487 F.2d 225 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-12\">.

Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973), reaffirming the majority opinion in Sorrells v.
