The plaintiff-appellant was a longshoreman, employed by a stevedore company when he was injured on the pier in the course of unloading the defendant\u2019s ship. Due either to a malfunction of a shore-based crane or to its improper operation by a fellow stevedore, a piece of cargo fell from the crane and struck the plaintiff as the crane swung from the ship to the deposit area on the pier.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-23\">The plaintiff sued in admiralty, alleging that the defendant was negligent and its ship unseaworthy. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant and the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-24\">Federal admiralty jurisdiction [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333; 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 740] does not extend to injuries to stevedores on the pier caused by faulty or improperly operated pier-based equipment. <em>Compare </em>Victory Carriers, Inc. v. Law, 404 U.S. 202, 92 S.Ct. 418, 30 L.Ed.2d 383 (1971); Chagois v. Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., 457 F.2d 343 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>and </em>Snydor v. Villain &amp; Fassio, etc., 459 F.2d 365 (4th Cir. 1972) <em>with </em>Gutierrez v. Waterman Steamship Corp., 373 U.S. 206, 83 S.Ct. 1185, 10 L.Ed.2d 297 (1963). We conclude, therefore, that plaintiff\u2019s complaint did not state a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>claim of which the district court had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The judgment of the district court is vacated, and the cause remanded with instructions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
