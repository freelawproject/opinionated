She contends on appeal: (1) that the trial court erred in denying her motion for a judgment of acquittal because the evidence did not establish that she knew the cheeks were stolen, and (2) that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of other crimes. We find no merit to ei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ther contention and affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The evidence was more than sufficient to establish not only that the checks were stolen and were in the possession of the defendant, but that she knew the checks were stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The evidence of other crimes objected to by the defendant, showed that the defendant forged the endorsements upon and uttered each of the two checks involved in the unlawful possession charge. This evidence was clearly admissible because the acts were integral parts of the offense for which the defendant was charged. <em>See, </em>United States v. Cochran, 475 F.2d 1080, 1082-1083 (8th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
