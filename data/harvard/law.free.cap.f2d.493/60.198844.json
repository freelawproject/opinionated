The Judicial Officer of the Department of Agriculture, acting for the Secretary of Agriculture,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sustained the Administrator\u2019s classification. The District Court, in an unpublished opinion, held that \u201ca plain reading of the regulations supports the Administrator\u2019s determination,\u201d and granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Marigold appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-17\">Order No. 61 became effective on April 1, 1969. The order classifies milk as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-18\">(a) <em>Class I milk. </em>Class I milk shall be all skim milk and butterfat:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-19\">(1) Disposed of as a fluid milk product except as provided in subpara-graphs (2), (3), and (4) of paragraph (b);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-20\">(2) An inventory of fluid milk products in packaged form on hand at the end of the month; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-21\">(3) Not accounted for as Class II milk;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-22\">(b) <em>Class II milk. </em>Class II milk shall be all skim milk and butterfat:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-23\">(1) Used to produce butter, butter-oil, anhydrous milkfat, plain or sweetened condensed milk or skim milk, and condensed buttermilk; nonfat dry milk, dry whole milk, dried buttermilk, dried whey, and blends of dried milk products including dry ice cream mix; cheese and cheese foods; ice cream, ice milk and frozen desserts including mixes for freezing; sterile products in hermetically sealed metal or glass containers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-24\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-25\">(3) Disposed of in bulk in the form of a fluid milk product to any commercial food processing establishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>where food products are prepared only for consumption off the premises;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\">(4) Dumped or disposed of for animal feed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">(5) In inventory of bulk fluid milk products on hand at the end of the month;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1061.41 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">It defines the term \u201cfluid milk product\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">\u201cFluid milk product\u201d means milk, cream, skim milk, buttermilk, unsterilized concentrated milk or skim milk, eggnog and eggnog flavored milk, and mixtures combining milk, skim milk, and/or cream, including the aforesaid products sweet, sour, cultured, or acidified and such products reconsituted from or fortified with milk products. The term includes the aforesaid products to which the flavors, sweeteners, stabilizers, emulsifiers, vitamins, minerals, and similar ingredients have been added. The term does not include products which are sterilized and disposed of in hermetically sealed metal or glass containers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1061.7 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">The Administrator determined that the Grade A skim milk used in \u201cParty Dip\u201d should be classified as Class I milk for two reasons: First, \u00a7 1061.41(a)(1) and (2) provides that skim milk disposed of or retained in inventory as a fluid milk product, shall be classified as Class I milk. \u201cParty Dip\u201d was a fluid milk product within the meaning of \u00a7 1061.7 as it contained eighty to eighty-two percent of Grade A skim milk to which flavors, sweeteners, stabilizers, emulsifiers, vitamins, minerals and similar ingredients had been added. Second, \u00a7 1061.41(a)(3) provides that skim milk not accounted for as Class II milk should be classified as Class I milk. Because it was not used to produce butter, ice cream or one of the other products listed in the Class II category [\u00a7 1061.-41(b)(1)], it had to be accounted for as Class I milk.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">Marigold vigorously contests the Administrator\u2019s interpretation.' It argues, in substance, that the Secretary did not intend to include filled milk products such as \u201cParty Dip\u201d in Class I; that the skim milk lost its character as a fluid milk product when eighteen percent vegetable fat was added to it; and that it was inequitable to continue to classify the skim milk used in \u201cParty Dip\u201d as Class I after a new order, the \u201cMemphis Order,\u201d classified skim milk used to produce filled milk as Class II milk in most other marketing areas in the United States.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-15\">At the outset, we note that the Administrator\u2019s decision is entitled to great weight. He is an expert making a decision on a matter where expertise is important. Our review will, therefore, be limited to a determination of whether the ruling is warranted by the record and has a rational basis at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-16\">There is no clear indication of an intent by the Secretary to exclude \u201cParty Dip\u201d from a Class I classification in Order No. 61. He simply stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-17\">Producers proposed that filled milk also be a fluid milk product. This issue is reserved for a later decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-18\">Official notice is taken of the fact that a hearing held at Memphis, Tenn., in February, April, and May 1968 (33 F.R. 2785) dealt with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>disposition or potential disposition in all Federal order markets of filled milk and certain other products containing milk or milk derivatives which are disposed of in fluid form. Evidence was received as to the need for a coordinated program of regulation of such products in all Federal order markets. No decision based on the Memphis hearing has been issued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">The treatment of filled milk under the Southeastern Minnesota-Northern Iowa order should be coordinated with the results of the Memphis hearing. Since the outcome of that hearing has not yet been determined, no action is taken herein on the filled milk issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aj-dedup-0\">34 Fed.Reg. 3816 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The notice of hearing described the term \u201cfilled milk\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">* * * any milk, cream, or skimmed milk, whether or not condensed, evaporated, concentrated, powdered, dried, or desiccated, to which has been added, or which has been blended or compounded with, any fat or oil other than milk fat, so that the resulting product is in imitation or semblance of milk, cream, or skimmed milk * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">33 Fed.Reg. 2786 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">The most we can read into the above is that the Secretary was aware of the problems, that he did not want to anticipate the results of the Memphis hearing which was then pending and decided to avoid the issue by classifying all milk not specifically included in Class II as Class I milk. While he could have followed the reverse procedure, he was not required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">There is nothing in the record to support Marigold\u2019s argument that the addition of vegetable fat causes the skim milk to lose its character as a fluid milk product. Order No. 61 and the United States Public Health Service\u2019s recommended Grade A Pasteurized Milk Ordinance, from which Marigold asserts the definition in Order No. 61 was obtained, simply state that the term \u201cfluid milk product\u201d includes skim milk to which flavors, sweeteners, etc., have been added. Neither specifically excluded filled milk products from the definition. We further note that the drafters of the order and ordinances stated specifically that the term \u201cmilk product\u201d is not intended to include a number of other products, thus making it clear that both knew how to write exclusionary language if they were of a mind to.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">The Administrator\u2019s interpretation may have put Marigold to a competitive disadvantage on the product \u201cParty Dip\u201d between the date the Memphis order was issued and the date Order No. 61 was amended to in effect classify the skim milk used in \u201cParty Dip\u201d as Class II milk. But this fact alone is insufficient to upset the Administrator\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">We repeat, the order<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> clearly states that all skim milk not accounted for as Class II milk shall be classified as Class I milk and this milk could not be accounted for as Class II milk. It was not used to produce butter, condensed milk, ice cream, frozen desserts, or any of the other products set forth in \u00a7 1061.-41(b)(1). It, therefore, had to be included in Class I.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-14\">.
