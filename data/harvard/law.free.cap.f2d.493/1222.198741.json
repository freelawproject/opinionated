Optical Recognition Systems, Inc., the manufacturer of the accused device, appeals the declaration of validity. We affirm on the excellent opinion of the district judge. Lundy Electronics &amp; Systems, Inc. v. Optical Recognition Systems, Inc., 362 F.Supp. 130 (E.D.Va.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-8\">The claims in question disclose a method and apparatus for automatically reeogniring magnetic ink characters that are printed on documents. The most important example mentioned in the patent is the recognition of characters shaped in the type E-13 B font that are imprinted on the lower left-hand edge of bank checks and deposit slips.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-9\">The record depicts a crowded technical field in which advances over the prior art are very narrow. Dykaar and Stein\u2019s departure from existing systems, though slight, is sufficient to justify the district court\u2019s holding that their invention was neither anticipated nor rendered obvious by the prior art, and it properly held other attacks on the validity of the patent to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-11\">Although the accused device performs the same ultimate function as that described in the patent, the district court found that it employs significantly different timing circuitry and means for establishing reference voltage levels. These findings are not clearly erroneous. Though the advance they achieve is slight, they are sufficient to negate the charge of infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
