The contract provided that it be construed in accordance with New Jersey law, to which the parties even now do not object; for liquidated damages consisting of accelerated rental payments until the end of the term upon default; for a credit to the lessee upon sale after default by the lessor for such part of the resale price as might be attributed to the period between the date of the sale and the end of the term; and for such additional damages upon default as may have resulted from the breach.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-20\">The district court awarded judgment to the plaintiff as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-21\">Remainder of rental due $43,763.20</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-22\">Interest on rental due 8,370.67</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-23\">Value of missing parts 6,791.22</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-24\">Cost of repairs 2,000.00</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-25\">Attorneys\u2019 fees (10%) 6,092.50</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-26\">$67,017.59</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-27\">The defendant appeals from that part of the judgment awarding accelerated rentals as liquidated damages, claiming it a penalty; from the award of attorneys\u2019 fees; and from the action of the district court allowing it no credit under the contract on account of the sale by the lessor after repossession. Of course, if the accelerated rentals should fall, interest thereupon should likewise be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-28\">The district court held that the accelerated rentals as liquidated damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>were not an unreasonable approximation of the lessor\u2019s actual damages and loss of bargain, and that collection of these should not be denied as against a claim of penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-4\">In affirming an award of payment of agreed upon accelerated monthly charges, greater than the minimum service charges, upon breach of a contract to supply bottled gas for a period of three years, the New Jersey court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A67\">\u201cParties to a contract may not fix a penalty for its breach. The settled rule in this state is that such contract is unlawful. Liquidated damages however are enforceable, and the intention of the parties will be carried out. The distinction between penalty and liquidated damages is to be tested by the reasonableness of the amount stipulated by the parties in the contract. If unconscionable, exorbitant or excessive under all the conditions and circumstances they are a penalty and not recoverable because the law limits recovery to indemnity from loss.\u201d Suburban Gas Company v. Mollica, 131 N.J.L. 61, 34 A.2d 892 (1943).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">Since the rentals here agreed upon as liquidated damages were not unreasonable, exorbitant, or excessive, we are of opinion their payment satisfies the rule expressed in <em>Suburban Gas, </em>supra. The general rule in New Jersey in such cases is that \u201c. . . the agreement of the parties will be effectuated.\u201d Wallis Iron Works v. Monmouth Park Association, 55 N.J.L. 132, 26 A. 140 (1893). \u201cTheir agreement will, however, be ascertained by considering, not only particular words in their contract, but the whole scope of their bargain, including the subject to which it relates.\u201d 26 A. 140, 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">The district court, in its written opinion, undertook just the analysis required by <em>Wallis Iron Works </em>and concluded that the \u201csum fixed is a reasonable approximation of CPC\u2019s actual damages for the loss of its bargain.\u201d With this conclusion, we are unable to disagree. We note parenthetically that the market for re-rental of the used computer was nonexistent, or at the very least very tenuous, thus bringing the case within the rule expressed in some New Jersey cases that liquidated damages agreed upon by contract may not be enforced unless actual damages are \u201cuncertain in amount and not readily susceptible of proof.\u201d <em>Suburban Gas Company, </em>supra, 34 A.2d p. 893. See also Westmount Country Club v. Kameny, 82 N.J.Super. 200, 197 A.2d 379 (1964), esp. p. 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-9\">In its determination that no part of the resale price of the computer should be credited to the lessee as \u201cattributable to the period\u201d between the date of sale and end of the term, the district court largely based its opinion on the fact that the resale price was less than the end of term book value, and that the projected end of term market value based on current sale price would be less than end of term book value. While the use of book value as evidence of value in ascertainment of damages may frequently not be a proper standard, its use here we do not believe to be reversible error, especially in the absence of any showing of end of term market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">A clause of the lease provided that upon default the lessor could \u201c[d]eclare due and payable such additional damages CPC may have suffered as a result of lessee\u2019s breach.\u201d The district court construed this clause as allowing attorneys\u2019 fees to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-11\">We do not agree. We are of opinion that the courts of New Jersey, if called upon, would not allow attorneys\u2019 fees under the recited clause, the key words of which are \u201csuch additional damages.\u201d Textileather Corp. v. American Mutual Liability Insurance Corp., 110 N.J.L. 483, 166 A. 214 (1933), is persuasive. In that case, an insurance policy required indemnity to the insured in different clauses for \u201cliability imposed on him by law for damages on account of such injuries and for \u201call costs taxed against this employer in any legal proceeding.\u201d These clauses were construed not to include attorneys\u2019 fees. In <em>Textileather, </em>the New Jersey rule is stated that attorneys\u2019 fees are not allowable against a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>party . . except ... as bound by his contract or as the statutes of the state provide.\u201d 166 A. 214, 216. In Alexander\u2019s Department Stores v. Arnold Constable Corp., 105 N.J.Super. 14, 250 A.2d 792 (1969), the court denied attorneys\u2019 fees in a suit involving a lease which did not specifically provide for them. The court there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-5\">\u201cIt is settled law that attorneys\u2019 fees are not cognizable as an item of damage in the same case in which they are incurred.\u201d 250 A.2d 792, 802.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">To the same effect is Liebeskind v. Metal Framed Aquarium Company, 58 N.J. Super. 504, 156 A.2d 701 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">We are not persuaded, then, that the phrase \u201csuch additional damages,\u201d in the absence in the lease of any reference to attorneys\u2019 fees, entitled plaintiff to recover them. In New Jersey, as above recited, attorneys\u2019 fees are not so cognizable as an item of damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">The case will be remanded for entry of judgment for the plaintiff in an amount not to include attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-9\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1042-13\">.
