It further found that the employees struck in response to this action by the Company and that they were accordingly unfair labor practice strikers. After such repudiation of its contract with the Association, a majority of the employees, as found by the Board, selected the Steelworkers\u2019 Union as their collective bargaining representative. Consequently, the Board concluded that the Company violated Sec. 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act by repudiating its contract with the Association and by repudiating its entire statutory bargaining obligation. As the Board found that the strike was in protest of the Company\u2019s unfair labor practices, it further determined that the Company violated Sec. 8(a)(3) and (1) by discharging and refusing to reinstate the striking employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-4\">The Board\u2019s order requires the Company to cease and desist from these unfair labor practices or in any other manner interfering with, restraining or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights under Sec. 7 of the Act. The order further affirmatively requires the Company to bargain upon request with Local 8070, United Steelworkers, as the duly designated exclusive bargaining representative in the appropriate unit, and to offer reinstatement with back pay to the employees discriminated against. The order also directs the posting of the usual notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-5\">Upon consideration of the entire record, the Court finds that the Board\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, that its legal conclusions are in conformity with applicable and controlling principles of law, and further, that its remedial order is adequate and proper to meet the violations found to have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-6\">It is therefore ordered that the petition for review filed on behalf of the Company is hereby denied. The Board\u2019s application is granted and its order of September 24, 1973, will be accordingly enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
