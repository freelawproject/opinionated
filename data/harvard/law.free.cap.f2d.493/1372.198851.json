We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-13\">\n<em>The Board Opinions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-14\">The majority of the board, after reciting five of appellee\u2019s registrations of the mark TORO, reviewing its extensive advertising and sales of lawn-care equipment and parts therefor under the mark, and comparing TORO with TORUS, concluded there would be likelihood of confusion or mistake. The dissenting board member said TORO and TORUS do not look or sound sufficiently alike to make confusion, mistake, or deception likely and said the marks have no similarity in meaning. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-15\">The briefs of the parties are in agreement that the sole issue in this case is likelihood of confusion within the meaning of section 2(d) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d). However, that basic issue brings with it certain subsidiary issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-16\">\n<em>Opposer\u2019s Mark and Goods</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-17\">Opposer, Toro Manufacturing Corporation (Toro), makes and sells, under the trademark TORO, a well-known, nationally-distributed line of lawn-care equipment or \u201cturf products\u201d ranging in size and cost from a small edge trimmer to tractor-drawn gang mow\u00e9rs which will cut a 26-foot swath. Toro\u2019s expenditures for advertising have climbed from over half a million dollars in 1962-63 to over a million and a half in 1970-71. There can be no question but that TORO is a very well-known mark in its field. The TORO line includes motorized reel, rotary, riding, and tractor-drawn lawnmowers of many kinds and sizes and other equipment such as snow throwers, tillers, brushes, and leaf blowers. Toro services all of this equipment, as is customary in such a business, by supplying replacement parts through a far-flung dealer and distributor organization. Since Toro has been in business for many years, this parts or \u201cafter market\u201d business is very large. It is said to include from fourteen to fifteen thousand different parts, apparently including in that number many of the nuts and bolts. Toro\u2019s evidence shows that the parts are, like the original equipment, sold under the trademark TORO by applying it to the packing slips, cartons, and labels or gummed tape used to close the shipping containers. When each piece of original equipment is sold, the customer receives with it an owner\u2019s manual and a reference drawing and parts list, from which replacement parts can be ordered by part nulnber.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>\n<em>Applicant Falk\u2019s Mark and. Goods</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">Appellant, The Falk Corporation (Falk), seeks to register TORUS as a wordmark for \u201crubber element shaft couplings.\u201d The description of goods in the application as filed was \u201crubber element couplings.\u201d The examiner rejected the application on a registration of TO-RUSEAL (with a circle design combined with the initial \u201cT\u201d) for \u201cgaskets or seals of metal tubing for bolted flanges and flanged joints in housings, pipe lines, and combustion chambers,\u201d Reg.

The other items were not introduced into evidence by anyone during the trial period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-17\">After the submission of this material and the amendment of the description of goods, together with argument, the application was passed to publication by the examiner and this opposition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-18\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-19\">\n<em>What Is In Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-20\">A preliminary legal question arises in connection with the determination of what is encompassed by Falk\u2019s description of goods. The question is whether we can look at all of the materials which the examiner looked at. It arises because Falk\u2019s brief asked us to look at the specimen filed with the application, which includes an exploded view of a Falk rubber element shaft coupling. Toro countered with the contention that it is \u201cnot properly of record\u201d and \u201ctherefore cannot be considered,\u201d quoting from the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board in M &amp; T <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>Chemicals, Inc. v. Stepan Chemical Company, 150 USPQ 570 (1966), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ8\">It is well established, however, that specimens or documentary material submitted with an application cannot be used as evidence in behalf of the party filing them unless identified and introduced in evidence as other exhibits during that party\u2019s trial period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-4\">Appellee\u2019s quotation ends there but the board opinion continues, saying, \u201cSee: Rule 2.126.\u201d Toro further cites the decisions of this court in In re Fielder, 471 F.2d 640 (1973), and Rexall Drug Co. v. Manhattan Drug Co., 284 F.2d 391, 48 CCPA 756 (1960). In neither <em>Fielder </em>nor <em>Rexall </em>did we pass on the question whether papers in a trademark application file are of record in an opposition. <em>Fielder </em>was a patent case and we merely refused to consider patents relied on by an applicant which were not of record. In <em>Rexall </em>we merely refused to look at third party trademark registrations which were not of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-5\">We think the question of our right to look at the specimen and the literature submitted to the examiner and contained in the application file of the opposed application is settled in the affirmative by Trademark Rule 2.122, which reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-6\">2.122 <em>Matters in evidence, </em>(a) <em>The files </em>of the applications or registrations specified in the declaration of interference or in the notice in case of concurrent registration proceedings, <em>of the application against which an opposition is filed, </em>and of the registration against which a petition for cancellation or an affirmative defense requesting cancellation is filed,' <em>form part of the record of the proceeding without any action by the parties, </em>and \u2022may be referred to for any relevant and competent purpose. . [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-8\">Our purpose is to refer to the specimen and the literature submitted to and considered by the examiner to determine, as accurately as we can, what the description of goods means, which is certainly relevant to this proceeding, whatever a \u201ccompetent purpose\u201d may be. Now what of the <em>M &amp; T </em>case and Rule 2.126 which it relied on ?</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-9\">Trademark Rule 2.126 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-10\">2.126. <em>Allegations in application not evidence on behalf of applicant. </em>The allegation of <em>dates of use </em>in the application for registration of the applicant or registrant cannot be used as evidence in behalf of the party making the same nor are exhibits attached to pleadings, or <em>specimens </em>in application and registration files, considered as <em>evidence of use </em>on behalf of the party who filed them, unless identified and introduced in evidence as other exhibits. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-11\">On the face of it, there appears to be some inconsistency between Rules 2.122 and 2.126.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the purposes of this case, however, it seems sufficient to note that we are looking neither to the specimen nor to the publications as evidence of <em>dates </em>of use by applicant or as evidence <em>of use </em>but as shedding light on what \u201crubber element shaft couplings\u201d means. We therefore think that Rule 2.-122 is controlling and that 2.126 is not. We further note that in forwarding the certified transcript of the Patent Office record to this court the Certifying Officer, pursuing the normal procedure, notified us, on behalf of the Commissioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-12\">Attachments to Amendment, filed December 10, 1970 in Trademark Serial Number 344,845; and Third Party Registrations (55), filed with Notice of Reliance, December 13, 1971; will follow later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-13\">These are deemed to be part of the record as certified, they did follow later, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>and we consider them to be part of the \u201cfile\u201d of the application referred to in Rule 2.122.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-4\">The <em>M &amp; T </em>case, which relied on Rule 2.126, cited by appellee, appears to us to be at least partially inconsistent with Rule 2.122. To that extent its ruling is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-5\">\n<em>What Goods Are Described by Falk</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-6\">Looking at the literature submitted to the examiner, as well as the specimen which shows one coupling, considerable light is shed on the nature of the goods described in Falk\u2019s application because Falk makes, advertises, and describes a number of different shaft couplings and the literature discusses the shaft coupling problem. From consideration of this material, it appears to us that the goods described are mechanical couplings which couple a driving with a driven shaft, in end-to-end relation, to transmit rotary motion and must contain a rubber element for the purpose of compensating for various types of shaft misalignment, by virtue of the flexibility of the rubber. Thus, a \u201cshaft coupling\u201d couples two rotatable shafts and, of course, rotates with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-7\">\n<em>Appellee\u2019s Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-8\">About a year ago we decided a case heavily relied on by Falk, Toro Manufacturing Corp. v. The Gleason Works, 474 F.2d 1401 (1973), in which we affirmed the dismissal of an opposition by Toro to the registration of the trademark TOROID for gears, among other things. There, as here, the board decision, by the same panel, was two to one, but the other way around, the majority saying the words \u201cdo not look or sound very much alike.\u201d (167 USPQ 315.) Toro argued before us that because its TORO mowers etc. contain gears the goods \u201cbecome identical.\u201d We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a-d-dedup-0\">There is no indication of record that the TORO mark is used <em>on gears </em>and, although appellant contends otherwise, we are not persuaded that there is likelihood of confusion merely because appellant\u2019s lawn mowers and other goods sold under the TORO mark <em>contain </em>gears. [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1464-11\">Falk here cites the <em>Gleason </em>case in support of its argument that TORO and TORUS are no more alike than were TORO and TOROID, and no more likely to cause confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-12\">Toro, apparently endeavoring to remedy evidentiary deficiencies it saw in <em>Gleason, </em>has here tried to show by evidence that it uses its mark TORO on \u201cthe same identical goods\u201d described in appellant\u2019s application. It distinguishes this case from <em>Gleason </em>on the ground it has made such a showing. To do so Toro produced as a witness its Director of Distribution Control. Among other duties, he was in charge of replacement parts. He was examined by counsel about the owner\u2019s manual parts lists supplied with four mowers and was asked to select therefrom anything which was a \u201cflexible coupling.\u201d He was not asked, we note, to find any \u201crubber element shaft couplings,\u201d which is Falk\u2019s actual goods description.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-13\">During the taking of the testimony of Toro\u2019s witness on the sale of replacement parts, Falk was not represented and there was, therefore, no cross-examination. While it is not our duty to represent. a party who chose not to represent itself, it is our duty to examine the record to determine whether and to what extent the evidence supports the allegations of counsel and the decision of the board which is on appeal. We have to form a judgment on the claim \u2014 which is challenged by Falk \u2014 that Toro has been selling goods <em>identical </em>with those designated .in the Falk application, and, if so, the volume of such sales, which the board-, uncritically we think, found to amount to over $93,000 in a year. We will now consider what the evidence shows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-14\">The first parts list Toro\u2019s witness testified about was for the Toro 21\" Power Greensmower. In it he identified three parts he said constituted a \u201cflexible coupling.\u201d Examination of the parts list <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>and reference drawing shows they are a power takeoff (shaft), a coupling yoke, and a flexible coupling disc through which the shaft is coupled to a pulley. The pulley, in turn, is mounted on the engine drive shaft. We here note, for reasons which will appear, that a <em>shaft </em>is not a part of the shaft <em>coupling.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1465-4\">The second parts list was for the Toro 76\" Professional mower from which five parts were selected, namely, two \u201cball studs,\u201d a rubber \u201cball socket,\u201d a socket right half, and a socket left half. This connection has the structure of a ball- and-socket joint with a rubber \u201csocket\u201d or covering on the metal ball, being a kind of \u201cflexible coupling\u201d between a ball and something else, but <em>not </em>connecting two shafts. The ball studs are fixed into mower frame members. The socket apparently connects to a link, not to a rotating shaft.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-5\">The third parts list was again for an earlier model of the same machine as the second and involves similar parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-6\">The fourth parts list was for the Toro \u201cSuper Pro\u201d mower, a 12 H.P. 3-reel unit which cuts an 81\" swath. Selected from its parts as \u201cflexible coupling\u201d components were a shaft assembly, a complete torque limiter, an adjusting stud, a spring, a ball, and a key. It is noted that 4 each of the stud, spring, and ball are required in each unit. They are all parts of the torque limiter assembly which appears to be friction-drive clutch for connecting a shaft to a chain-driven sprocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-7\">We cannot conclude, as counsel for Toro would have us do, that all of the above-described parts are the \u201csame identical goods\u201d described as \u201crubber element shaft couplings,\u201d when that description is read in the light of appellant\u2019s disclosures to the Patent Office. The closest approach appears to be the yoke, disc, and pulley combination found in the 21\" mower first described, which at least couples two shafts, albeit through the engine pulley. While it may be that the other parts found in the second, third, and fourth parts lists about which the witness testified are \u201cflexible couplings,\u201d which is what the witness was asked to look for, we consider that they are not \u201crubber element shaft couplings,\u201d according to Falk\u2019s goods description. To that extent we have to disagree with the contention of Toro\u2019s counsel that sales of such parts are sales by Toro of \u201cidentical goods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-11\">We reach this conclusion on the basis of the parts lists themselves, which Toro put in evidence, and which contain the \u201creference drawings\u201d and the names of the parts, showing with reasonable clarity what they are, where they are used, and how they function.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-12\">What is clear to us from these exhibits and the testimony is that Toro\u2019s witness selected as parts coming within Falk\u2019s goods description anything that connected a rod or a shaft, whether rotatable or not, and whether containing a rubber element or not, to another member. Many of the parts connect a rod to a metal ball fixed on the end of a stud fastened into a frame member, some of them involving a rubber covering on the ball which gives a degree of flexibility justifying classification as a \u201cflexible coupling.\u201d Some of them apparently do not involve any rubber element. The net result is a great exaggeration of the number of \u201crubber element shaft couplings\u201d sold by Toro. This same exaggeration underlies the asserted dollar amount of Toro\u2019s business in this field.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-13\">Toro alleges sales of over $93,000 worth of so-called \u201cflexible couplings.\u201d This amount was the total taken from a hand-written tabulation by the witness (Exs. 15-A, 15-B) which he said was \u201ca partial list of parts sold by Toro Manufacturing that we consider to be flexible couplings.\u201d It shows dollar sales of each of the. listed parts for 1970-71. The witness said it was \u201ca random list of parts selected for this exhibit.\u201d It lists many parts other than those selected from the four parts lists put in evidence and described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-14\">The first thing that detracts from the credibility of the alleged sales of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>$93,426.67 of \u201cflexible couplings,\u201d however, is the inclusion among such \u201ccouplings\u201d of $8,221.52 worth of itemized <em>shafts and rods. </em>Assuming that a few of the parts listed are for rubber element shaft couplings, surely sales of the shafts and rods themselves are not sales of couplings. The next thing is that the last 5 items on the list, including the largest dollar item listed, are itemized as \u201cU-Joint\u201d for \u201cLawn Trac.\u201d and \u201cRiders.\u201d We are directed to no evidence which explains what these items are, whether or not they connect shafts, or whether they contain rubber elements. They account for $28,931.39 of the total. The list contains a large number of \u201cBall Joints\u201d for various mowers. We cannot check them all but we note total sales of two ball joint items we can check, part 3-8863 with sales of $7,-223.52 and part 5-3928 with sales of $3,081.00, which are not within Falk\u2019s goods description but are ball joints attached to opposite ends of part 5-3927 which is cataloged as a \u201cRod, Push,\u201d (Ex. 5, p. 6). We do not consider such parts to be \u201crubber element shaft couplings,\u201d even should they contain rubber in the ball joints, which seems doubtful since none is indicated in the parts list. Without the aid of cross-examination or the chance of a complete check, the evidence thus shows us over $47,000 worth of items we consider not to be within Falk\u2019s goods description. These eviden-tiary self-contradictions taint the whole computation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\">In view of these matters, we cannot accept at face value, as the board seems to have done, the asserted amount of sales by Toro of parts falling within appellant\u2019s description of goods. It is apparent to us that the amount is grossly exaggerated by reason of the witness\u2019s mistaken assumption as to what Falk\u2019s goods description encompasses. Toro\u2019s counsel asserted at oral argument that Toro\u2019s annual sales of parts is of the order of $6 .million. Feeling, as we do, that the asserted amount of Toro\u2019s sales of parts falling within Falk\u2019s description of goods must be drastically reduced, such sales were a miniscule part of its total parts sales and were not large sales of \u201cidentical\u201d parts, as Toro alleges. So much for getting the evidence in proper perspective as a preliminary to deciding the basic question of whether appellant\u2019s use of TORUS as a trademark on its goods would be likely to cause confusion, or mistake, or to deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-6\">\n<em>Likelihood of Confusion, Etc.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-7\">Toro made of record, by attachment to its Notice of Opposition, eight registrations. We find it unnecessary to discuss them in detail because none of them makes any reference, in the goods named, either to <em>parts </em>of the equipment listed or to <em>couplings </em>of any kind. Five of the registrations are of the wordmark TORO, two are for a design representing, in conventionalized form, mounted steer\u2019s horns, referred to by Toro as \u201cBULLS HEAD DESIGN.\u201d The other registration combines the word TORO and said design. The design mark registrations are irrelevant. Because appellant\u2019s goods are not within any of the registrations, Toro cannot prevail merely on the ground that \u201crubber element shaft couplings\u201d may be contained in some of its machines. Toro v. Gleason, supra. We come, then, to the question whether it has here succeeded in establishing such <em>use </em>of the mark TORO, under section 2(d), on goods so related to appellant\u2019s goods as to give rise to a likelihood of confusion, etc., taking into account the <em>circumstances of such use.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1466-8\">Assuming Toro made sales, prior to appellant\u2019s earliest date, of some unknown quantity of couplings within Falk\u2019s goods description, we think the controlling factor here, on the issue of likelihood of confusion, is the manner of their sale by Toro. The evidence makes it clear that sales or offers of sale by Toro have been and are only as spare or replacement parts. The purchasers are either users of, repairers of, or dealers in Toro\u2019s lawn-care equipment who have a need for a particular part for a particular machine. To determine what shall be purchased, reference must be had to a parts list containing a reference drawing of the machine and identifying parts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>numbers keyed thereto. Order for the goods is placed <em>by part number. </em>Normally, this order will be for a TORO part and placed through TORO\u2019s distribution system with no possibility of confusion as to the source. Toro produced evidence, however, showing the existence of an independent parts distributor, Lawnmower Parts Manufacturing Co., Inc., which sells some parts for TORO lawnmowers. Its catalog shows the method of sale, which is the same as Toro\u2019s. Reference drawings of TORO mowers by model name have annexed parts lists keyed to the drawings and listing two numbers, first the seller\u2019s number and next Toro\u2019s number, headed \u201cOur Part- <em>#\u201d </em>and \u201cReplaces Part #,\u201d respectively. It is clear that nobody ordering from this list could be in doubt as to the source of the goods. It is evident that in this category of spare parts merchandising the sales take place without any reference to or reliance on trademarks. Parts are ordered from catalogs by part number from whatever available source the buyer selects \u2014 either the original-equipment supplier or one of its distributors, or from an independent competitor of known identity and known <em>not </em>to be the maker of the machine for which the part is being ordered. It is simply not a buying-by-brand operation, but buying by a part number which is tied to a source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-4\">As to the marks themselves, we see no point in discussing their similarities, differences, meanings, or lack of meaning to prospective purchasers of the parties\u2019 goods. The only important point to note is that the marks are different, so it cannot be said that registration to Falk will in any way interfere with Toro\u2019s use of its mark TORO on any goods.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1467-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-7\">Taking into consideration the differences in the marks and the nature of op-poser Toro\u2019s business in its closest approach to the goods described in Falk\u2019s application, namely, the selling of certain replacement parts in the manner above described, we see no likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception and the decision of the board is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-9\">MILLER, Judge, with whom MAR-KEY, Chief Judge, joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-10\">The majority\u2019s decision appears to rest on two erroneous premises, namely: that, to support a holding that appellant\u2019s mark so resembles appellee\u2019s mark as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake, the goods of the parties must be identical or interchangeable; and that confusion must be likely with respect to the goods of the <em>opposer </em>(appellee).</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-11\">Thus, it is pointed out that the description of appellant\u2019s goods is \u201crubber element shaft couplings\u201d; whereas, ap-pellee\u2019s witness identified parts under the description \u201cflexible coupling.\u201d Great emphasis is placed on the fact that appellee\u2019s brief argues that the goods are \u201cidentical,\u201d but the brief also argues prior use of the mark TORO on <em>\u201cother flexible couplings </em>and <em>other forms of coupling devices.\u201d </em>Moreover, nowhere in appellee\u2019s notice of opposition is there any allegation that the goods are identical. Rather, appellee alleged that \u201cMany of Opposer\u2019s TORO brand products utilize couplings, which are in turn ultimately sold as individual repair parts under the TORO and BULL\u2019S HEAD DESIGN marks\u201d; and that \u201cpotential purchasers or users of Applicant\u2019s shaft couplings, being well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>acquainted with Opposer\u2019s marks and products, are likely to- assume that Applicant\u2019s products originate with, or are related to, Opposer.\u201d Merely because the evidence of record does not support a finding that the goods of the parties are identical or interchangeable does not mean that the evidence fails to sustain these other allegations. Notwithstanding that the goods of the parties are not identical and even when there are differences between the marks, this court has not hesitated to find a likelihood of confusion or mistake. In re Knapp-Monarch Company, 296 F.2d 230, 49 CCPA 779 (1961); Schenley Industries, Inc. v. Fournier, Inc., 357 F.2d 395, 53 CCPA 1046 (1966); Ford Motor Co. v. Sherman Ford, Jr., d.b.a. Ford Records, 462 F.2d 1405, 59 CCPA 1124 (1972),</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-4\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s statement that the question is whether appellee \u201chas here succeeded in establishing such <em>use </em>of the mark TORO, under section 2(d), on goods so related to appellant\u2019s goods as to give rise to a likelihood of confusion, etc., taking into account the <em>circumstances of such use,\u201d </em>section 2(d) refers to refusal of registration of a mark which, \u201cwhen applied to the goods of the applicant,\u201d is likely to cause confusion or mistake. In the absence of some limitation in appellant\u2019s application or in appellee\u2019s registration, the evidence here clearly shows that the goods of the parties . (couplings) are similar. This raises the presumption that the goods move in the same channels of trade. Esso Standard Oil Company v. Bigelow Clark, Inc., 266 F.2d 804, 46 CCPA 883 (1959). Appellant failed to come forward with any evidence to rebut this presumption, and the specimen and literature considered by the examiner certainly do not rebut this presumption. Although TORO parts are sold as spares or replacements under parts numbers, so that TORUS couplings would probably not be purchased for these because of confusion or mistake, the movement of these goods in the same channels of trade (primarily independent hardware stores) lays a foundation for confusion or mistake on the part of <em>those who buy TORUS couplings </em>in attributing the' source thereof to TORO, and this is a necessary question to be decided by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-6\">I agree with the majority of the board that the record establishes TORO as a strong mark for tractors, mowers, related machinery and parts thereof; and that the marks TORO and TORUS are sufficiently similar in sound and appearance to establish that there would be a likelihood of confusion or mistake when used contemporaneously on the similar goods of the parties. See Paula Payne Products Company v. Johnson Publishing Company, Inc., 473 F.2d 901 (CCPA 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-7\">The decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1462-8\">. The examiner said in his action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-9\">If applicant has any advertisements or promotional material dealing with the instant goods, it is requested that a copy be furnished for the record. See Trademark Rule 2.61(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-10\">The cited rule says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-11\">(b) The Examiner may require the applicant to furnish such information and exhibits as may be reasonably necessary to the proper examination of the application.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1462-12\">. Among other things, this advertisement states: '</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-21\">What\u2019s the Torus?

There also appears to be inconsistency between rule 2.126 and rule 2.122(b) with respect to \u201cexhibits attached to pleadings,\u201d which might be an opposer\u2019s registrations attached to a Notice of Opposition which Rule 2.122(b) says will be \u201creceived in evidence and made part of the record if two copies showing status and title of the printed registration or an order for such copies accompany the opposition * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">. In Hardigg Industries, Inc. v. Toro Manufacturing Corp., 173 USPQ 813 (1972), the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board sustained Toro\u2019s opposition to the registration of Toro-Pad for plastic pads for absorbing and dissipating shocks, which' obviously differs from opposer\u2019s mark Toro only in the addition thereto of the descriptive word Pad. We affirmed without a published opinion, 180 USPQ 403 (COPA 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-12\">Rule 5.12(g) of this court, effective January 1, 1974, provides that unpublished <em>opinions </em>\u201cshall not be cited as precedent.\u201d In referring to our <em>decision </em>of affirmance, reported at 180 USPQ 403, we are not citing an <em>opinion. </em>In these matters it is essential to distinguish between decisions (affirmed, reversed, etc.) and the opinion giving the supporting rationale.
