Wilson, 5 Cir., 1969, 415 F.2d 467 and urged all parties to cooperate in devising a plan to ensure constitutionally valid jury rolls in the future. Pursuant to these instructions and a subsequent letter directive of the Court vacating and remanding the District Judge\u2019s order, all parties have worked diligently, in cooperation with the District Court, to achieve a constitutionally acceptable jury roll. On December 18, 1973 the District Court entered an order, approved by all parties, dismissing the complaint recognizing that the jury box in the Bessemer Division of the Tenth Judicial Circuit now complies with the constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-40\">The expiration date for appeal of the District Court\u2019s order has passed and therefore we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
