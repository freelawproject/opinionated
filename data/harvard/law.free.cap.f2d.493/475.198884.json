The trial court\u2019s opinion is reported at 361 F.Supp. 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-19\">Plaintiff-appellant, Kirkham, Michael &amp; Associates, Inc. (KMA), a South Dakota engineering and architectural firm, instituted this declaratory judgment action in order to determine the scope of coverage of a Travelers Indemnity Company comprehensive general liability policy issued to KMA for the year 1966. Travelers had previously denied coverage under the policy and had refused to defend KMA in a suit' filed in state court by the City of Rapid City, South Dakota, alleging, inter alia, negligence on the part of KMA in the design, preparation of plans and specifications, and supervision and inspection of the materials and work in connection with the construction of the City\u2019s sewage treatment plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-20\">Conjoined with KMA as plaintiffs were the Continental Casualty Company, KMA\u2019s professional liability insurer, and the Maryland Casualty Company, an issuer of a comprehensive general liability policy to KMA in 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-21\">Prior to trial, the district court ordered the realignment of the Maryland Casualty Company as a party defendant and the introduction of the City of Rapid City, South Dakota, as an involuntary plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-22\">The policy issued by Travelers to KMA in 1966 agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-23\">To pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of injury to or destruction of property, including the loss of use thereof, caused by accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>With respect to such insurance as is afforded by this policy, the company shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">(a) defend any suit against the insured alleging such injury, sickness, disease or destruction and seeking damages on account thereof, even if such suit is groundless, false or fraudulent; but the company may make such investigation, negotiation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">With respect to the period of coverage, the policy provided: \u201cThis policy applies only to accidents which occur during the policy period * * While excluding professional liability arising from defects in maps, plans, designs or specifications, the policy did not exclude professional liability arising from supervisory or inspection services.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Travelers conceded that an \u201caccident,\u201d within the meaning of the insurance policy, had occurred. The question presented by the case was whether the accident occurred when KMA allegedly negligently supervised and inspected the construction of the plant, within the coverage period of the 1966 policy, or when the sewage treatment plant was tendered to the City, beyond the coverage period of the 1966 policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AKj\">The trial judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP60\">It is the damage incurred by \u201caccident\u201d that triggers the policies\u2019 coverage, not the preceding wrongful acts. A thorough reading of the complaint discloses that the City sustained actual damages or injury by accident when the alleged defective facility was turned over for possession and operation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Kirkham, Michael &amp; Associates v. Travelers Indemnity Co., 361 F.Supp. 189, 193 (D.S.D.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">In his memorandum decision, the trial judge conscientiously explored the facts of the case, the contentions of the parties, and the applicable law. We find ourselves in agreement with the trial judge, and on the basis of his opinion, affirm the judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-11\">. The 1967 Travelers policy in effect at the time the plant was turned over to the City contained a broader exclusion of professional liability than that contained within the 1966 policy. KMA concedes in its brief on appeal that this exclusion forecloses coverage under the 1967 policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
