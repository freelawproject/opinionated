Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1002-10\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">The district court\u2019s refusal to impose sentence under the provisions of the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 4251-4255 is the sole error asserted by Neria on appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">Neria pled guilty to conspiring to possess heroin with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 846. He was sentenced to 15 years with a special parole term of 15 years. His subsequent 2255 motion attacking the sentence was denied by the district court which found Neria ineligible for commitment under NARA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-14\"> The statute under which Neria claims entitlement to relief poses two obstacles which he cannot overcome. First, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4251(f)(2), not mentioned by Neria, excludes \u201can offender who is convicted of unlawfully importing or selling or conspiring to import or sell a narcotic drug, unless the court determines that such sale was for the primary purpose of enabling the offender to obtain a narcotic drug which he requires for his personal use because of his addiction to such drug.\u201d Such a determination was not made by the court. Second, \u00a7 4251(f)(4) excludes \u201can offender who has been convicted of a felony on two or more prior occasions.\u201d It is undisputed that Neria had two prior felony convictions. Relying on Watson v. United States, 1970, 141 U.S.App.D.C. 335, 439 F.2d 442, Neria argues, however, that this portion of the statute is unconstitutional. This contention has now been answered in Marshall v. United States, 1974, 414 U.S. 417, 94 S.Ct. 700, 38 L.Ed.2d 618 in which the Supreme Court held that the exclusion provisions of the Act do not violate due process or equal protection concepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-15\">Finally, in United States v. Hart, 5 Cir. 1974, 488 F.2d 970 we had this to say concerning the district court\u2019s discretion under NARA :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-16\">If a defendant is to get NARA rehabilitative sentencing the court must determine that he is an eligible offender and believe that he is an addict; then the court may, <em>in its discretion, </em>place him in the Attorney General\u2019s custody for an examination preliminary to treatment. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
