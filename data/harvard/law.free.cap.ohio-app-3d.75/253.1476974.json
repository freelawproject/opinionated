Defendant insured plaintiff\u2019s office building under a policy that provided coverage for property damage, with provision for business interruption and an endorsement for loss of rental value. When the office building was destroyed by fire on July 25, 1987, plaintiff claimed losses under the property damage and rental value provisions of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-15\">The property damage provisions of the policy specified that, subject to the policy limit, the amount of plaintiff\u2019s loss was to be determined by the replacement cost of the building if plaintiff chose to rebuild, or by the actual cash value of the building if plaintiff chose not to rebuild. Plaintiff notified defendant on August 11, 1987 that it would not rebuild, and claimed a loss measured by the actual cash value of the building. In mid-September 1987, defendant retained an expert to determine the replacement value of the building. Defendant did not retain an expert to determine the building\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>actual cash value until November 16, 1987; approximately two weeks later, this expert determined that the building\u2019s value exceeded the property damage policy limit. On December 16, 1987, defendant paid to plaintiff the property damage policy limit of $1,030,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">As to rental value, plaintiff claimed a $198,433 loss. By mid-November 1987, defendant made three payments to plaintiff totalling $92,000 under the policy\u2019s rental value insurance (\u201cRVI\u201d) coverage, but the parties were unable to agree on the total amount plaintiff was entitled to recover. In particular, the parties disagreed both as to the rental income anticipated from the portions of the building which were vacant, at the time of the fire, as well as the nature and amount of noncontinuing expenses that were to be subtracted from the rental value in determining plaintiff\u2019s actual loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">In December 1987, defendant retained an accountant to assist in determining the amount of plaintiff\u2019s RVI claim. The accountant submitted an incomplete report in April 1988, and ultimately was unable to complete the report. Defendant therefore retained a second accountant in August 1988, who submitted a complete report in October 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The second accountant raised for the first time the issue of whether depreciation was to be considered in determining plaintiff\u2019s RVI loss. With the assent of defendant\u2019s agent, Michael Gagnon, the second accountant\u2019s report treated depreciation as a noncontinuing expense, thereby significantly reducing the amount of plaintiff\u2019s RVI loss. Thus, fourteen months after the fire, defendant valued plaintiff\u2019s rental value loss at $47,751, approximately one fourth of the amount plaintiff claimed and $44,249 less than the amount defendant had previously advanced to plaintiff on the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Despite defendant\u2019s determination that it had already paid plaintiff more than the amount of its RVI loss, defendant offered plaintiff an additional $18,000 to settle the claim. Plaintiff rejected the settlement offer, and brought suit against defendant alleging breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith, and intentional tort. Defendant brought counterclaims alleging fraud and misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The case was tried to a referee, who found that defendant\u2019s delay in paying plaintiff on the property damage claim breached the insurance contract. The referee further found that defendant\u2019s delay in settling the RVI claim and its treatment of depreciation as a noncontinuing expense under the RVI provision breached both the insurance contract and defendant\u2019s duty of good faith, and that defendant\u2019s lack of good faith was sufficient to warrant punitive as well as compensatory damages. The trial court adopted the referee\u2019s report, granting judgment in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Defendant appeals therefrom, assigning the following errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>\u201cI. The trial court erred by concluding, as a matter of law, that defendant-appellant breached its contract by omitting to timely perform a contractual obligation, to wit: the payment of policy limits for the loss of the building within a reasonable period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u201cII. The trial court erred by finding that the actual loss sustained by plaintiff-appellee, for purposes of the rental value insurance endorsement, was $158,016.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>The trial court\u2019s finding that depreciation was not properly included in the calculation of the actual loss sustained by plaintiff-appellee was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u201cB. The trial court\u2019s finding that depreciation was not in the category of \u2018charges and expenses which do not necessarily continue during the period of untenantability\u2019 was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u201cIII. The trial court erred by failing to conclude, as a matter of law, that depreciation was properly included in the calculation of the actual loss sustained by plaintiff-appellee, and that depreciation was an expense that did not necessarily continue after destruction of plaintiff-appellee\u2019s building.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\u201cIV. The trial court erred by concluding, as a matter of law, that defendant-appellant breached the terms of the rental value insurance endorsement and thereby breached its insurance contract with plaintiff-appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">\u201cV. The trial court erred by finding (a) that the insurance company breached its duty of good faith, justifying compensatory damages, and (b) that such conduct was sufficiently outrageous as to justify an award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">\u201cA. The trial court\u2019s finding that defendant-appellant breached its duty of good faith was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">\u201cB. The trial court erred in concluding that plaintiff-appellee sustained compensatory damages in the amount of $25,000 as a result of the alleged bad faith conduct of defendant-appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">\u201cC. The trial court erred in concluding that the actions of defendant-appellant through its employees was outrageous beyond any notion of mere bad faith and justifies punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">\u201cVI. The trial court committed numerous errors in the conduct of the trial which prejudiced defendant-appellant and deprived it of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">\u201cA. The trial court erred in permitting the testimony of James Wiles for the reason, that Mr. Wiles was plaintiff-appellee\u2019s counsel and further he was not timely disclosed as a witness which prejudiced defendant-appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\u201cB. The trial court erred in precluding defendant-appellant from cross-examining Ed Overmeyer regarding Cincinnati Insurance Company\u2019s claim regarding the adjustment of the claim and further erred in permitting plaintiff-appellee Charles J. Ruma to testify as to these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u201cC. The trial court erred in admitting the opinion testimony of Donald S. Malecki.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u201cVII. The trial court erred by imposing the burden of proof upon defendant-appellant regarding the actual loss sustained by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u201cVIII. The trial court erred in failing to grant judgment in favor of defendant-appellant on its counter-claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Plaintiff cross-appeals, assigning the following errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">\u201cI. The trial court erred in adopting that portion of the referee\u2019s report which concluded as a matter of law that the amount of compensatory damages ($25,000) was adequate for the finding of bad faith against Cincinnati Insurance Company; such amount being prima facie inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">\u201cII. The trial court erred in adopting that portion of the referee\u2019s report which concluded as a matter of law that the amount of punitive damages ($100,000) was adequate for the actual malice, fraud, and insult committed by Cincinnati Insurance Company; such amount being prima facie inadequate to punish and deter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Defendant\u2019s first assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred in determining, as a matter of law, that defendant\u2019s delay in paying plaintiff\u2019s property damage claim breached an implied contract term that payment be made within a reasonable time. Defendant first argues that the trial court improperly implied a contractual term fixing a reasonable time for payment, when the contract contained no express provision regarding time of payment. The law implies that performance take place within a reasonable time when a contract is silent as to the time for performance. <em>Stewart v. Herron </em>(1907), 77 Ohio St. 130, 147, 82 N.E. 956, 959; see, also, <em>Clarke v. Hartley </em>(1982), 7 Ohio App.3d 147, 150, 7 OBR 190, 193-194, 454 N.E.2d 1322, 1326-1327. Thus, the trial court did not err in implying a reasonable time in the absence of a specific time for defendant\u2019s payment under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">Defendant further argues that even if a contractual term fixing a reasonable time for payment properly may be implied, defendant\u2019s delay in paying plaintiff\u2019s property damage, as a matter of law, was not unreasonable; and, therefore, defendant did not breach its insurance contract with plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">The trial court referee found that \u201cit became clear to everyone right away that plaintiff\u2019s office building, prior to the loss, had had a value far in excess of the $1,030,000 insurance policy limits,\u201d citing in support thereof defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>dant\u2019s field adjuster\u2019s July 29, 1987 report that the replacement value of the building would be $2,000,000, and that the actual cash value was $2,000,000. Ultimately, defendant hired an expert who on December 2, 1987 reported an appraisal of $1,700,000 for plaintiff\u2019s property, with $1,100,000 allocated to the value of the destroyed building. While the appraisal results alone suggest that defendant\u2019s need to value the property as of the date of loss may have been justified, defendant\u2019s request for the appraisal itself appears unreasonable in light of its own adjuster\u2019s immediate valuation of the property to be well in excess of the policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">However, even if defendant\u2019s need to ascertain the value of plaintiff\u2019s loss through appraisal is reasonable, we cannot say, as a matter of law, that defendant\u2019s efforts to ascertain the amount of the loss were reasonable. The trial court found that plaintiff notified defendant on August 11, 1987 that plaintiff would not rebuild, thereby fixing the actual cash value of the building as the method for valuing the loss. Nonetheless, defendant did not retain an expert to determine the actual cash value until three months later; and the trial court found no explanation for defendant\u2019s delay in ascertaining the amount of plaintiff\u2019s loss. Thus, we are unable to conclude that the trial court erred, as a matter of law, in finding that defendant\u2019s delay in paying plaintiff\u2019s claim was unreasonable and a breach of the insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">We therefore overrule defendant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">We next consider defendant\u2019s second, third, fourth, and eighth assignments of error together, inasmuch as all of them challenge the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the RVI provision. Defendant asserts that the trial court erred (1) in concluding that depreciation was not a noncontinuing expense to be deducted in calculating plaintiff\u2019s RVI loss, (2) in failing to grant judgment on defendant\u2019s counterclaim that defendant overpaid plaintiff on the RVI claim, as depreciation should have been deducted in calculating plaintiff\u2019s loss, and (3) in finding that defendant breached the RVI provision of the contract as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Preliminarily, we note that defendant\u2019s second assignment of error challenges, as against the manifest weight of the evidence, the trial court\u2019s finding that depreciation was not properly included as a noncontinuing expense in calculating plaintiff\u2019s actual loss under the RVI endorsement, defendant arguing that its expert witness testimony overwhelmingly proved the contrary. We disagree with the premise to that argument. Specifically, to the extent the policy is unambiguous, the meaning of \u201cactual loss\u201d under the RVI endorsement, including whether depreciation is a noncontinuing expense to be excluded in calculating actual loss is a question of law to be determined from the language in the policy. <em>Olmstead v. Lumbermens Mut. Ins. Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>(1970), 22 Ohio St.2d 212, 215-217, 51 O.O.2d 285, 287-289, 259 N.E.2d 123, 126-127; <em>Aultman Hosp. Assn. v. Community Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 51, 53, 544 N.E.2d 920, 923. To the extent the policy language is ambiguous, the policy is construed against the insurance company. <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, syllabus. While the expert testimony rendered herein may have been pertinent to determining whether defendant breached its duty of good faith in resolving plaintiffs claim, and, in particular, in classifying depreciation as a noncontinuing expense under the policy, the expert testimony is not probative of the question of whether depreciation is a noncontinuing expense under the RVI endorsement at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Addressing, then, the question of law raised in defendant\u2019s second, third, fourth, and eighth assignments of error, we note that the policy at issue contains separate provisions for business interruption and RVI coverage. As to business interruption, the policy provides that defendant shall be liable for \u201cthe actual loss sustained by the insured resulting directly from necessary interruption of business, but not exceeding the <em>reduction in earnings </em>less charges and expenses which do not necessarily continue during the interruption of business * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">As to RVI, the policy provides that defendant shall be liable for \u201c * * * the ACTUAL LOSS SUSTAINED by the Insured resulting directly from necessary untenantability, * * * but not exceeding the <em>reduction in Rental Value </em>less charges and expenses which do not necessarily continue during the period of untenantability * * *[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Under the policy, \u201crental value\u201d is the sum of:</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u201cA. The total anticipated gross rental income from tenant occupancy * * *, and</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">\u201cB. The amount of all charges which are the legal obligations of the tenant(s) and which would otherwise be obligations of the Insured, and</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">\u201cC. The fair rental value of any portion of said property which is occupied by the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Defendant, pointing to the similarity of the language of the foregoing provisions, contends that the business interruption and RVI provisions provide virtually identical coverage. Plaintiff responds that (1) the separate RVI endorsement serves no purpose if it merely duplicates the coverage provided by the business interruption provision, and (2) to the extent that the two provisions provide the same coverage, the differences in policy language create an ambiguity which must be construed strictly against the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The two provisions differ primarily in the language used to define the insurable interest from which any noncontinuing charges or expenses are to be subtracted. Specifically, the business interruption provision defines \u201closs\u201d in terms of reduction in earnings, whereas the RVI endorsement defines \u201closs\u201d in terms of gross rental income plus the fair rental value of portions of the building occupied by the insured. If reasonable and logical meaning be afforded to these differences, <em>Farmers Natl. Bank v. Delaware Ins. Co. </em>(1911), 83 Ohio St. 309, 337, 94 N.E. 834, 839; <em>Gibbons-Grable Co. v. Gilbane Building Co. </em>(1986), 34 Ohio App.3d 170, 175, 517 N.E.2d 559, 564, then, despite the obvious language similarity in the \u201ccharges and expenses\u201d language of the two provisions, the RVI endorsement provides coverage distinct from the business interruption insurance. Indeed, to conclude otherwise would suggest that defendant included the additional RVI endorsement but provided plaintiff with no greater protection than the business interruption provisions of the policy. Not only is such a conclusion illogical, but it defies common rules of contract interpretation. <em>Ford Motor Co. v. John L. Frazier &amp; Sons Co. </em>(1964), 8 Ohio App.2d 158, 161, 196 N.E.2d 335, 337 (each provision of a contract is generally deemed to be included for some purpose).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Specifically, to examine first the language differences, the business interruption coverage, by protecting earnings, protects plaintiffs profit on its leases. See, <em>e.g., Fidelity-Phenix Fire Ins. Co. of New York v. Benedict Coal Corp. </em>(C.A.4, 1933), 64 F.2d 347, 353, certiorari denied (1933), 289 U.S. 762, 53 S.Ct. 795, 77 L.Ed. 1505. By contrast, the RVI endorsement is not so limited, as it even includes coverage for the cost plaintiff avoided by occupying space within its own building rather than renting space elsewhere; and plaintiffs occupancy of its building generates no profit on plaintiffs leases. Hence, the difference in coverage is apparent. Moreover, the RVI endorsement includes, as the most significant aspect of RVI coverage herein, plaintiffs gross income from its leases; it thereby protects not profits, as in business interruption coverage, but cash flow, which is defined generally as cash receipts less out-of-pocket charges and expenses. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.1979) 196 (\u201ccash flow\u201d), 416 (\u201cdisbursement\u201d). Given the foregoing, we find the two endorsements provide different coverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In calculating plaintiff\u2019s actual loss, both the business interruption insurance and the RVI endorsement require that noncontinuing charges and expenses be subtracted from the insurable interest. Despite the difference in coverages under the two endorsements, defendant contends that the noncontinuing charges and expenses in both endorsements are identical as both are stated in identical language, and that because depreciation is a noncontinuing charge or expense for the purpose of determining business interruption loss, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>General Ins. Co. of America v. Pathfinder Petroleum Co. </em>(C.A.9, 1944), 145 F.2d 368, 369, certiorari denied (1945), 324 U.S. 844, 65 S.Ct. 679, 89 L.Ed. 1406; <em>Fidelity-Phenix, supra, </em>depreciation also must be a noncontinuing charge or expense for the purpose of determining RVI loss. However, since the foregoing endorsements protect distinct insurable interests, the \u201ccharges and expenses\u201d appropriately considered under each will differ. Depreciation is not necessarily a proper consideration in calculating RVI loss merely because depreciation is a factor in calculating business interruption loss. Rather, RVI and the \u201ccharges and expenses\u201d pertinent to it must be considered independently in determining whether depreciation is a noncontinuing charge or expense in an RVI loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In the final analysis, depreciation is not an out-of-pocket charge or expense; rather, it is an accounting device that permits a taxpayer to recover his or her investment in property over the property\u2019s useful life. <em>Hibernia Natl. Bank in New Orleans v. United States </em>(C.A.5, 1984), 740 F.2d 382, 386; see, also, Section 167, Title 26, U.S. Code. Since depreciation is an accounting device not pertinent to determining cash flow, which RVI coverage protects, depreciation is not properly deducted as a noncontinuing expense in calculating actual loss under plaintiff\u2019s RVI endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Accordingly, we overrule defendants second, third, and eighth assignments of error. We also overrule defendant\u2019s fourth assignment of error, because defendant\u2019s improper inclusion of depreciation as a noncontinuing expense in calculating the RVI loss breached its contract with plaintiff as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Defendant\u2019s fifth assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred in finding that defendant breached its duty of good faith so as to justify an award of both compensatory and punitive damages. Defendant timely objected to the referee\u2019s findings of fact as to its breach of duty and requested preparation of a transcript for the trial court\u2019s review in ruling on these objections. However, the trial court overruled defendant\u2019s objections before preparation of the transcript was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Pursuant to Civ.R. 53(E)(6), defendant bears the burden of providing the trial court with a transcript in support of its objections to the referee\u2019s findings of fact. <em>Eash v. Eash </em>(1984), 14 Ohio App.3d 298, 14 OBR 355, 471 N.E.2d 174. Defendant arguably met this burden by timely requesting preparation of the transcript. However, even if defendant failed to meet this burden, we may consider whether the trial court abused its discretion in adopting the referee\u2019s findings, given that defendant timely objected to these findings and timely requested a transcript. <em>Proctor v. Proctor </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 55, 63, 548 N.E.2d 287, 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Defendant\u2019s objection to the referee\u2019s findings was based upon the manifest weight of the evidence. Since resolution of a manifest weight question requires that the trial court review the transcript of proceedings, <em>Eash, supra, </em>14 Ohio App.3d at 299, 14 OBR at 356, 471 N.E.2d at 176; <em>Reynolds v. CSX Transp., Inc. </em>(1989), 55 Ohio App.3d 19, 26, 561 N.E.2d 1047, 1054, the trial court abused its discretion by failing to consider the requested transcript before ruling on objections based upon the manifest weight of the evidence. See <em>Shull v. Shull </em>(Aug. 9, 1990), Greene App. No. 89-CA-89, unreported, 1990 WL 115983; <em>Eash, supra. </em>We sustain defendant\u2019s fifth assignment of error, and remand the cause to the trial court for determination of whether defendant breached its duty of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Defendant\u2019s sixth assignment of error raises several challenges to the referee\u2019s admission and exclusion of evidence. One of the matters assigned as error and raised in objections to the referee\u2019s report in the trial court was the admission of the testimony of James Wiles, attorney for plaintiff. When an attorney seeks to testify on behalf of a client without withdrawing from representation of the client at trial, the Supreme Court has directed the trial court to determine first whether the attorney\u2019s testimony is admissible, without regard to the Code of Professional Responsibility (\u201cCode\u201d). <em>Mentor Lagoons, Inc. v. Rubin </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 256, 260, 31 OBR 459, 462-463, 510 N.E.2d 379, 382. If the trial court finds that the testimony is admissible, the court then must determine whether any of the exceptions to DR 5-102 of the Code apply in order to prevent potential Code violations. <em>Id. </em>These exceptions to DR 5-102(B) permit an attorney to testify on behalf of a client only in the circumstances enumerated in DR 5-101(B). Specifically, DR 5-101(B)(4) permits an attorney to give substantive testimony as to disputed facts only if the attorney\u2019s withdrawal from conduct of the trial would work a substantial hardship on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Defendant does not dispute that Wiles\u2019 testimony satisfied the first prong of <em>Mentor Lagoons, supra; </em>rather, defendant asserts that the referee, and hence the trial court, abused their discretion by finding that Wiles\u2019 testimony satisfied DR 5-101(B)(4). Resolution of an abuse of discretion question, like resolution of a manifest weight question, requires that the trial court review the transcript. The trial court abused its discretion in ruling on defendant\u2019s objection to the referee\u2019s report relative to the admission of Wiles\u2019 testimony without considering the transcript. Hence, we sustain defendant\u2019s sixth assignment of error as to the admission of Wiles\u2019 testimony, and remand the cause to allow the trial court to properly rule on defendant\u2019s objection and determine whether the referee abused his discretion in determining that Wiles\u2019 testimony satisfied DR 5-101(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>As to the remaining matters assigned as error in defendant\u2019s sixth assignment of error, to the extent defendant objects to the admission of the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s expert, any error is nonprejudicial as it relates to the issue of depreciation as a noncontinuing expense. Moreover, to the extent the testimony is pertinent to a determination of bad faith, we are unable to assess whether prejudicial error occurred, given our remand of the bad faith issue to the trial court. Similarly, to the extent the remaining evidentiary issues raised in defendant\u2019s sixth assignment of error are related to the trial court\u2019s determination of bad faith, we again are unable to determine that the matters at issue constitute prejudicial error. To that extent, then, defendant\u2019s sixth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Defendant\u2019s seventh assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred by imposing upon defendant the burden of proving plaintiff\u2019s actual loss, and that the trial court improperly disallowed defendant\u2019s inclusion of certain management and professional fees as noncontinuing expenses, thereby permitting plaintiff to recover these fees under the RVI provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The insured bears the burden of establishing the amount of its loss. <em>Strip v. Buckeye Union Ins. Co. </em>(June 26, 1973), Franklin App. No. 73AP-56, unreported. However, the trial court\u2019s failure to include the challenged fees as noncontinuing expenses did not improperly shift the burden of proof to defendant but, rather, indicates that the trial court was not persuaded by defendant\u2019s attempt to refute plaintiff\u2019s claim with respect to these fees. Defendant\u2019s seventh assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s first and second cross-assignments of error both challenge the adequacy of the trial court\u2019s award of damages for defendant\u2019s bad faith. Having determined that the trial court abused its discretion by prematurely adopting the referee\u2019s findings of fact regarding defendant\u2019s breach of the duty of good faith, any error in the adequacy of the trial court\u2019s award of damages for bad faith is not prejudicial, as the trial court necessarily will redetermine the amount of damages based on the nature of the breach of duty of good faith, if any, the trial court may find. <em>Gray v. General Motors Corp. </em>(1977), 52 Ohio App.2d 348, 359, 6 O.O.3d 396, 402-403, 370 N.E.2d 747, 754-755. Consequently, we overrule both of plaintiff\u2019s cross-assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Having sustained defendant\u2019s fifth assignment of error and that portion of defendant\u2019s sixth assignment of error relating to the admission of Wiles\u2019 testimony, and having overruled defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error and plaintiff\u2019s cross-assignments of error, we reverse the judgment of the trial court as to plaintiff\u2019s claim for breach of the duty of good faith under the RVI provision, affirm the judgment of the trial court except as noted herein as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>to the foregoing claim, and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b293-6\">Strausbaugh and John C.
