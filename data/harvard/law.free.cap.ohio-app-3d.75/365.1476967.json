(\u201cProfessional\u201d) against its insurer, appellee Shelby Insurance Company (\u201cShelby\u201d). In this action, Professional sought a declaration that Shelby was obliged to defend and indemnify it with respect to certain United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) claims. On December 26, 1990, the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas entered judgment in favor of Shelby, concluding that Professional\u2019s claims for coverage were premature because Shelby has no duty to defend until the commencement of a \u201csuit\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>lawsuit). Based upon the record in the instant case, the following facts are pertinent to this court\u2019s inquiry:</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Professional is an Ohio corporation duly authorized to conduct business in Ohio with its principal place of business located in Chardon, Ohio. Shelby has insured Professional during all periods relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">In January 1980, Professional sold Alvin Laskin, d.b.a. Poplar Oil Company, approximately seventy-five gallons of its waste motor oil for $6. Thereafter, the excess motor oil was transported to the Laskin Poplar Oil Site in Jefferson, Ohio (\u201cLaskin Site\u201d). This single transaction represents Professional\u2019s only contribution of waste oil to the Laskin Site.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Between 1980 and 1984, waste from numerous sources was stored at the Laskin Site. Federal and state environmental agencies investigating the Laskin Site detected releases and threatened releases of hazardous waste into the environment. In April 1984, the United States of America filed a civil action against Laskin and eight other defendants in the United States District Court, Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division. <em>United States of America v. Laskin, </em>case No. C84-2035Y. Initially, Professional was not a named party to the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">In July 1986, Professional was brought into the <em>Laskin </em>lawsuit as a third-party defendant. By correspondence dated July 27, 1987, Professional put Shelby on notice of the pending litigation and made a claim for coverage including defense and indemnification. Shelby denied any obligation to provide Professional with a defense or indemnification under the insurance policy. However, Professional was subsequently dismissed without prejudice from the <em>Laskin </em>case on the basis of a settlement with the third-party defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">In August 1987, the EPA notified Professional by letter that it was a potentially responsible party (\u201cPRP\u201d) under the Comprehensive Environmen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>tal Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), with regard to the Laskin Site. This \u201cPRP notification\u201d requested that Professional voluntarily remedy the situation at the Laskin Site, otherwise the EPA would undertake the remedial action itself and seek reimbursement or other enforcement action as authorized by law. The EPA further requested that Professional enter into settlement negotiations with other PRPs and submit a \u201cgood faith\u201d proposal for implementing remedial action at the Laskin Site within sixty days. In closing, the EPA requested information for the purpose of enforcing CERCLA and assisting itself in determining the need for response action.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In April 1989, Professional received another PRP notification from the EPA. The initial language employed by the agency was couched in the same noncompulsory terms as the April 1987 correspondence, <em>i.e., </em>the EPA \u201cencouraged\u201d Professional to make restitution for costs already incurred and to \u201cvoluntarily\u201d finance future cleanup costs. However, the letter continued: \u201c * * * In Accordance with Section 107(a) of CERCLA, <em>demand </em>is hereby made for payment of the amount specified * * * plus any and all interest authorized to be recovered under Section 107(A) or under any other provisions of law. <em>Demand </em>is also hereby made under these authorities for payment of interest on all future costs that U.S. EPA may accrue in regard to the Site.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\"><em>(( </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u201cAs a potentially responsible party, you should notify U.S. EPA in writing within 15 calendar days of receipt of this letter of your willingness to participate in negotiating to perform or finance the activities described above. If U.S. EPA does not receive a timely response, U.S. EPA will assume that your organization does not wish to negotiate a resolution of its potential responsibility in connection with the Site and that your organization has declined any involvement in performing the response activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\"><em>it </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">\u201c * * * Upon your receipt of this Special Notice, <em>you will have a maximum of 60 days to coordinate with any PRPs and to present to U.S. EPA a \u2018good faith\u2019 proposal for implementing and conducting the remedial action proposed in the Proposed Plan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\"><em>(( </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">\u201cIf a \u2018good faith\u2019 offer is not received within the 60 day period, <em>no extension </em>to the 60 days will be granted by U.S. EPA <em>except in the event that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number><em>extraordinary circumstances are demonstrated </em>by the PRPs in a written request. <em>If a \u2018good faith\u2019 proposal is not received within 60 calendar days, the U.S. EPA, pursuant to section 122(e)(4), may proceed to undertake such further action as is authorized by law, including implementation of the remedial action utilizing public funds available to the Agency.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">After receiving this EPA correspondence, Professional notified Shelby of the potential liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">On July 7, 1989, Professional once again received a PRP notification from the EPA. The EPA estimated Professional to be jointly and severally liable for the sum of $3,652,516.05, plus interest for previously incurred costs and demanded payment, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\"><em>\u201cSuch payment must be made </em>to the U.S. EPA Hazardous Substances Superfund established pursuant to Section 221 of CERCLA, as amended, which is administered by U.S. EPA. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\"><em>\u201cWe hereby request that you make restitution by payment of the amount in this letter plus interest, together with any sums hereafter expended by the Agency in connection with the Site </em>pursuant to authority of CERCLA, as amended. Pursuant to Section 107(a) of CERCLA, as amended, <em>interest shall begin accruing as of the date of this demand, if payment is not received within thirty (30) days of the date of this letter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\"><em>a </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\"><em>\u201cIf we do not receive a response from you within this time frame, </em>the U.S. EPA will assume that you have declined to reimburse the Fund for the Site expenditures, and pursuant to CERCLA, as amended, <em>U.S. EPA may pursue civil litigation against you.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">Professional again notified Shelby of the EPA demands. However, Shelby refused to provide Professional with a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">Accordingly, Professional filed the instant declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that Shelby was obligated to defend and indemnify with respect to the EPA PRP notifications. The parties submitted stipulations, various exhibits, and briefs in lieu of trial. Among these items was a copy of Professional\u2019s policy with Shelby, which provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">\u201cPART IV \u2014 LIABILITY INSURANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">\u201cA. WE WILL PAY</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">\u201c1. We will pay all sums the insured legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies caused by an accident and resulting from garage operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\u201c2. We have the right and the duty to defend any suit asking for these damages. However, we have no duty to defend suits for bodily injury or property damage not covered by this policy. We may investigate and settle any claim or suit as we consider appropriate. Our payment of the LIABILITY INSURANCE limit ends our duty to defend or settle.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">On December 26, 1990, the trial court granted judgment in favor of Shelby based upon its conclusion that since there was no actual \u201csuit\u201d pending against Professional, Shelby\u2019s contractual. \u201cduty to defend\u201d had not yet arisen. In its judgment entry, the court noted:</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u201c * * * There is no \u2018suit\u2019 pending against [Professional] within the meaning of the insurance policies at issue in this case. Accordingly, the duty to defend, if any, has not been triggered. Any other or further determination by this Court would be dicta. <em>[Shelby] has no duty to defend until an actual suit (lawsuit) has been filed against [Professional] Although all the issues have been exhaustively briefed and argued by </em>counsel, <em>the lack of a lawsuit is dispositive of the case. </em>There is no evidence of any failure by [Shelby] to abide by the terms of any applicable policy and [Professional] cannot prevail on its claim in declaratory judgment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Professional timely filed its notice of appeal, and now raises the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">\u201c1. The trial court erred in dismissing Professional Rental\u2019s declaratory judgment action because the administrative actions taken by the EPA against Professional Rental constitute a \u2018suit\u2019 triggering Shelby\u2019s duty to defend under the insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">\u201c2. The trial court erred by dismissing Professional Rental\u2019s action for declaratory relief without declaring Professional Rental\u2019s rights under the insurance policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">In the first assignment of error, Professional maintains that the trial court erred in concluding that the EPA notices identifying Professional as a \u201cPRP\u201d and subsequently demanding payment did not constitute a \u201csuit.\u201d Under the policy, Shelby had a duty to defend any \u201csuit\u201d seeking property damages \u201ccaused by an accident and resulting from garage operations.\u201d Professional contends that the PRP notifications were substantially equivalent to the commencement of a \u201csuit\u201d seeking damages covered by the policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">Since the trial court determined that Shelby\u2019s duty to defend did not arise until the commencement of a formal lawsuit, the court made no determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>as to the scope of Shelby\u2019s duty to indemnify. Based upon the limited extent of the trial court\u2019s decision and the argumentation presented on appeal, we will confine our analysis to the narrow issue of whether the PRP notifications amount to a suit giving rise to a duty to defend. Significantly, this issue appears to be one of first impression in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">When construing insurance contracts, words in the policy must be given their plain and ordinary meaning. <em>State Farm Auto. Ins. Co. v. Rose </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 528, 531, 575 N.E.2d 459, 461. However, where provisions of a contract of insurance are ambiguous and thus susceptible to more than one meaning, they will be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 531-532, 575 N.E.2d at 461-462; <em>King v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 208, 519 N.E.2d 1380, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 2286, gives \u201csuit\u201d a meaning Shelby seeks: \u201can action or process <em>in a court </em>for the recovery of a right or claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>However, the same dictionary also gives the word a second, broader meaning: \u201cthe attempt to gain an end by a legal process.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Federal and state courts stand divided on the issue of whether receiving an EPA \u201cPRP\u201d notification equates to the filing of a traditional \u201csuit\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>lawsuit).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Similarly, the courts are equally divided on the issue whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>letter from a state environmental agency is congenerous to a suit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Upon reviewing authority on both sides of the issue, it is apparent that the term \u201csuit\u201d is susceptible to more than one meaning, and thus should be liberally construed in favor of the insured. See <em>Rose, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 532, 575 N.E.2d at 461. We do not adopt the bright-line rule set forth in the trial court\u2019s judgment entry, linking the obligation to defend to some pending <em>judicial </em>proceedings. This court feels compelled to focus more upon the substance rather than form in determining whether the insured was subjected to a \u201csuit\u201d or its functional equivalent within the meaning of the policy. Accordingly, the term \u201csuit,\u201d in our judgment, should include substantial efforts which <em>force </em>the insured to take action or suffer serious consequences if the insured fails to cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Our rejection of the bright-line definition of the term \u201csuit\u201d is especially appropriate when dealing with the subject matter involved in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The junction where environmental law meets insurance law is an inappropriate place to erect an inflexible rule requiring the initiation of a traditional lawsuit as a condition precedent to the insurer\u2019s obligation to defend. See <em>Ryan v. Royal Ins. Co. of Am. </em>(C.A.1, 1990), 916 F.2d 731, 740. Accordingly, it is both appropriate and necessary for this court to examine the manner in which the EPA initiates CERCLA enforcement actions in order to determine when a \u201csuit,\u201d or its functional equivalent, has arisen.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\n<em>CERCLA Enforcement Actions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">The CERCLA statutory scheme gives the EPA several legal methods for compelling PRP\u2019s to assume responsibility for hazardous waste cleanup. Initially, CERCLA empowers the EPA to \u201crespond\u201d to the actual or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. See Section 9604, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Title 42, U.S.Code. The Act then shifts liability for \u201cresponse costs\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to responsible parties, namely, owners and operators of hazardous waste facilities, waste generators, disposers, and transporters. See Section 9607, Title 42, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The enforcement process includes two primary methods of shifting cleanup responsibility to PRPs: (1) The CERCLA statutory scheme provides for injunctive relief by permitting the EPA to issue an administrative order compelling cleanup or to obtain a court order compelling the same; and (2) CERCLA also allows for restitutional relief by authorizing the EPA to expend funds from the federal Superfund to clean up toxic waste sites and subsequently institute cost recovery actions against responsible parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><em>1. Compelled Cleanup Actions: </em>Initially, the EPA encourages voluntary participation in the cleanup efforts through the issuance of a \u201cPRP notification,\u201d discussed <em>infra. </em>If the PRP does not respond to this invitation, CERCLA Section 106(a) authorizes the EPA to issue an <em>administrative order </em>to compel a responsible party to clean up a site. The EPA usually first attempts to negotiate the administrative order with the PRP. If the EPA chooses to negotiate and is successful, the agreement is bound in a <em>consent order. </em>However, if negotiations fail, the EPA may <em>unilaterally </em>develop the administrative order. The issuance of this order tends to accelerate participation, as a failure to comply could subject the PRP to a fine of $25,000 \u201cfor each day in which such violation occurs or such failure to comply continues.\u201d Section 9606(b)(1), Title 42, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Section 106(a) also authorizes the EPA to seek an <em>injunctive order. </em>The EPA, through the Department of Justice, may file in federal district court to compel PRP cleanup under CERCLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Whether the remedy sought by the EPA is administrative or judicial, the purpose of enforcement actions taken pursuant to CERCLA Section 106(a) is to get the PRPs to take the lead in site cleanup operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\"><em>2. Cost Recovery Actions: </em>The EPA may decide to clean up first and ask questions later. In other words, if the PRP chooses not to participate in the cleanup operations (or simply fails to respond to the PRP notifications), CERCLA empowers the federal government to use Superfund money to clean up a site and seek reimbursement later from <em>any </em>responsible party it can locate. See Sections 9604(a)(1) and 9607(a), Title 42 U.S.Code. If, during the process of cleanup, the EPA issued an <em>\u201cinformation-gathering\u201d administrative order </em>under CERCLA Section 104(e), the failure of a PRP to abide could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>subject the party to treble damages. See Section 9607(c)(3), Title 42, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">In either case, whether the EPA attempts to compel cleanup or seeks reimbursement, once the agency notifies a party of its potential liability, the PRP is faced with three alternatives: (1) engage in a voluntary settlement; (2) force the government to order cleanup; or (3) have the government unilaterally implement cleanup and litigate for reimbursement later.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\n<em>The Effect of PRP Notifications</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Generally, the EPA\u2019s first move is to issue administrative notices to one or more PRPs to initiate the settlement process. Section 9622(e), Title 42, U.S.Code.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These \u201cPRP notifications\u201d serve to inform parties about their potential liability for response costs under CERCLA Section 107, define the scope of potential liability, explain why they have been identified as PRPs, and begin the exchange of information and negotiation. The EPA\u2019s policy is to send PRP notifications as early as possible in the cleanup process so that PRPs may gather information about their potential liability and have sufficient time to conduct or finance a response action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The CERCLA notification process is clearly not analogous to the traditional means of bargaining and settlement. \u201cSettling\u201d with the EPA primarily involves formulating an acceptable proposal for cleaning up the pollution under the assumption of PRP liability.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although the EPA designates recipients as \u201cpotentially responsible parties,\u201d it is not the equivalent of a conventional demand letter or a simple accusation of fault. First, PRP notifications are sent after the EPA has established that \u201cthere is sufficient evidence to make a preliminary determination of potential liability under section 107 of CERCLA.\u201d Superfund Program, <em>supra, </em>53 F.R. at 5301. Second, parties who are simply \u201cidentified\u201d as responsible under Section 107(a) are strictly liable, regardless of fault. The only defense (other than an act of God or war) is the limited defense of \u201cdue care\u201d provided in CERCLA Section 107(c)(3), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>which allows a defendant to escape liability only in instances where the release or threatened release of hazardous substance was caused by:</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u201c(3) an act or omission of a third party other than an employee or agent of the defendant, or than one whose act or omission occurs in connection with a contractual relationship, existing directly or indirectly, with the defendant * * *, if the defendant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that (a) he exercised due care with respect to the hazardous substance concerned, * * * and (b) he took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions of any such third party * *</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The EPA\u2019s initial PRP correspondence typically requests information from the PRP for the purpose of assisting the EPA in determining the need for response action. The EPA further requests that the PRP inform the government of its willingness to \u201cvoluntarily\u201d participate in cleanup plans by submitting (within sixty days) a \u201cgood faith\u201d proposal for implementing and conducting remedial action. See Section 9622, Title 42, U.S. Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">If the PRP chooses not to respond to the initial PRP letter, the EPA will take one of several steps: (1) seek an injunction in district court forcing the PRP to act; (2) issue a Section 104(e) or 106(a) administrative order either demanding information or forcing PRP cleanup<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>; or (3) send additional notice letters, known colloquially as \u201cdrop dead\u201d letters, informing the PRP\u2019s that they must follow the EPA\u2019s suggested cleanup \u201cvoluntarily\u201d \u2014 otherwise, the government will expurgate the pollution itself, and thereafter demand reimbursement through a CERCLA Section 107 cost recovery action.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">The EPA\u2019s strategy is confrontational, and seemingly coercive, as identified PRPs must either abide by what the EPA desires or the agency may clean up the pollution itself, typically at a higher cost.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> By sending a PRP notification, \u201cthe agency in effect has issued an ultimatum of \u2018settle on the government\u2019s terms or litigate and lose.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">Nevertheless, receiving a PRP notification, <em>by itself, </em>does not impose liability. Moreover, failing to respond to a PRP notification does not, <em>by itself, </em>authorize the EPA to assess fines or provide a basis for punitive damages. Rather, it is necessary for the EPA to do \u201csomething more\u201d in order to <em>force or compel </em>the insured to take action or suffer serious conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>quences. The \u201csomething more\u201d is present when the EPA issues an <em>administrative order, </em>pursuant to CERCLA Sections 106(a) or 104(e), making the PRP susceptible to stiff fines or punitive damages for failure to abide by the terms of the order. Moreover, the same degree of compulsion is present when the EPA seeks an injunctive order in federal district court under CERCLA Section 106(a), or institutes a cost recovery action under CERCLA Section 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">While the EPA has clearly identified Professional as a PRP, and has taken a confrontational and seemingly coercive posture, in our opinion Professional is not faced with the functional equivalent of a \u201csuit.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The PRP notifications received by Professional were in essence \u201cclaims\u201d of liability and demands for restitution \u2014 coupled with threats of unilateral action should Professional fail to participate in remedial action. Specifically, the EPA: (1) notified Professional of its joint and several liability with respect to $3,652,-516.05 expended on the Laskin Site; (2) demanded Professional pay these amounts; (3) threatened unilateral action with respect to future cleanup efforts; and (4) warned that the failure to respond within the time allotted would lead the EPA to pursue civil litigation. These threats, demands, and warnings of unilateral remedial action do not <em>force </em>Professional to settle or suffer severe financial repercussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">We recognize that, because environmental liability is strict, receipt of a PRP notification is a seemingly apocryphal event. However, the nature of the <em>claim </em>does not change the \u201cPRP notification\u201d into a \u201csuit.\u201d Even though CERCLA liability may be strict, it is only when the EPA actually begins to <em>enforce </em>that liability against an alleged polluter that the latter will bear the consequences of strict liability. Accordingly, we hold that a \u201csuit\u201d is commenced, for purposes of triggering the insurer\u2019s duty to defend, at the moment the EPA issues an administrative order which the PRP is legally obligated to obey, or otherwise attempts to enforce liability through an injunctive action or cost recovery action filed in a court of law. Under such circumstances, the EPA makes it sufficiently clear that the <em>force </em>of its powers under CERCLA is being brought to bear in a way that threatens the insured with probable and imminent financial consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Unlike the issuance of an administrative order or the filing of an action, the EPA\u2019s PRP notifications in the instant case did not place the insureds under a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>compulsion to begin cleanup on the site. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In the second assignment of error, Professional asserts that the trial court erred by \u201cdismissing\u201d the declaratory judgment action without declaring Professional\u2019s rights under the insurance policies. This argument is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The trial court did not \u201cdismiss\u201d Professional\u2019s action for declaratory judgment, but rather entered judgment in favor of Shelby based upon the court\u2019s conclusion that Shelby\u2019s duty to defend was not triggered in the absence of an actual lawsuit. This declaration set forth a construction of the document which was dispositive of the parties\u2019 \u201crights, status and other legal relations\u201d under the stipulated facts.
