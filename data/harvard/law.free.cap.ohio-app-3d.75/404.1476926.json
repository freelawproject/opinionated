On July 5, 1986, Phyllis Mullet was murdered in her home in Belle Center, Ohio. Mullet was stabbed multiple times in the chest area and her throat was slit. When found, Mullet\u2019s body was clad in a sweatshirt only.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">The body of Griffin was found in the upstairs hall of Mullet\u2019s home. Griffin died from gunshot wounds which he apparently sustained at the hand of Mullet\u2019s murderer during the marshal\u2019s attempt to rescue Mullet.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">In response to the defendant\u2019s request for notice of intention to use evidence at trial, the state filed a notice of intention to use \u201cthe testimony of * * * officers from the Behavioral Science Unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who will testify concerning crime scene characteristics for the purposes of assisting in the identification of the Defendant as the perpetrator.\u201d The defendant responded to the state\u2019s notice of intention with a pretrial motion to suppress any testimony by any state\u2019s witness regarding \u201cestablishment of a psychological or personality profile of the perpetrator of the crimes charged, based upon crime scene analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">At the hearing convened upon defendant\u2019s motion, the state introduced the testimony of Agent John Douglas. Douglas is a twenty-year employee of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) who currently works within the National Center for Analysis of Violent Crime at the FBI Academy.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The goal of the testimony elicited from Douglas by the state was to establish Douglas\u2019s expertise in the field of criminal-investigative analysis and psycholinguistic analysis<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and to determine his opinion regarding the perpetrator\u2019s motivation for the murder of Mullet, as well as the motivation for a certain writing authored by defendant. The state contended that Douglas\u2019s opinion testimony on these issues should be admitted into evidence at defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">On direct examination, Douglas testified that criminal-investigative analysis is a process through which the crime scene is examined to determine the perpetrator's motivation for the crime. Douglas further testified that he has utilized crime-scene analysis as an investigative tool on over five thousand occasions. With respect to psycholinguistic analysis, Douglas testified that this analysis is used to discern both the underlying motivation for a particular writing and the potential for violence by the author of the writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">As pertains to the case before us, Douglas examined the crime-scene photographs, autopsy protocols, and police reports. In addition, the agent examined a document authored by defendant which consisted of a list of women, the names of their husbands and the names of their children. The murder victim, Mullet, was included on the list of females. Although the document contained sexual language concerning at least one female on the list, there was no overt sexual language regarding Mullet.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Douglas testified that, based upon his review of the crime scene materials, he was of the opinion that the motivation for the death of Mullet was sexual. Douglas stated that his opinion in this regard was premised on the fact that Mullet\u2019s hands and feet were bound with ligatures that had been brought to the scene by the perpetrator of the crime. Douglas was of the opinion that the presence of the ligatures indicated preplanning on the part of the perpetrator. Douglas further testified that preplanning is one of several characteristics of a sexually motivated homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">As concerns the document that was authored by the defendant, Douglas testified that the writing was sexually motivated and represented defendant\u2019s plan or mission for power.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">Upon cross-examination by defense counsel, Douglas acknowledged that his educational background consists of a bachelor\u2019s degree in physical education. Douglas also holds a master\u2019s degree in educational psychology, with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>emphasis in counseling, and a doctorate in education. Douglas further acknowledged that, when concluding that an offender\u2019s motivation is sexual, he must make psychological inferences to draw those conclusions and therefore is engaging in a form of psychology. There was considerable dispute over whether Douglas was really attempting to draw a psychological profile of defendant as opposed to merely expressing investigative conclusions resulting from his analysis of crime-scene evidence. In any event, Douglas conceded that none of his testimony, whether related to the motivation for the murder of Mullet or the motivation for defendant\u2019s writing, could be stated to a reasonable scientific certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Additionally, defendant elicited the testimony of Dr. Solomon Fulero, who is a licensed psychologist and a professor of psychology, to rebut Douglas\u2019s testimony elicited on direct examination. Fulero corroborated the conclusion of Douglas that opinions based on criminal-investigative analysis do not rise to the level of reasonable scientific certainty that is a prerequisite to consideration as expert opinion testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. Upon certification of its inability to proceed to trial without the suppressed evidence, the state appealed the judgment assigning one error as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting the motion of the defense to exclude the testimony of Special Agent John Douglas regarding crime scene analysis and threat analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The syllabus in <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 53, 4 OBR 144, 446 N.E.2d 444, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">\u201cThe Ohio Rules of Evidence establish adequate preconditions for admissibility of expert testimony, such as spectrographic voice analysis. It is within the sound discretion of the state\u2019s judiciary, on case by case basis, to decide whether such testimony is relevant and will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Evid.R. 401 defines relevant evidence as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Evid.R. 402 provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible * * *. Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">As regards the relevancy of expert testimony, the court in <em>Williams, supra, </em>at 59, 4 OBR at 149, 446 N.E.2d at 448 established that there must be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>\u201csufficient demonstration of \u2018reliability\u2019 * * * to qualify the evidence as \u2018relevant\u2019 within the meaning of Evid.R. 402.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">In the case before us, the trial court suppressed the testimony of Douglas upon finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cMr. Douglas\u2019 opinion is an investigative tool like a polygraph; it might be used to investigate, but it does not have the reliability to be evidence.\u201d Having given careful consideration to the testimony elicited in this matter, we conclude that there is evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the opinion testimony of Douglas is not reliable evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">As a whole, the record reflects that Douglas\u2019s opinion for the most part is based on the behavioral science of clinical psychology, an area in which he has no formal education, training or license. In short, the purported scientific analytical processes to which Douglas testified are based on intuitiveness honed by his considerable experience in the field of homicide investigation. While we in no way trivialize the importance of Douglas\u2019s work in the field of crime detection and criminal apprehension, we do not find that there was sufficient evidence of reliability adduced to demonstrate the relevancy of the testimony or to qualify Douglas as an expert witness. Accordingly, the error as assigned by the state is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Defendant cross-appeals from the judgment of the trial court and raises the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in ruling that its exclusion of the testimony of State\u2019s expert witness John Douglas is applicable only as the case is currently charged as a capital offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">In the final sentence of the judgment entered suppressing the testimony of Douglas, the trial court stated that \u201c[t]his ruling is applicable only to this case as it is currently charged as a capital offense.\u201d Upon consideration, we hold that the matter asserted by defendant on his cross-appeal is premature in that the trial court has made only a preliminary ruling concerning the future use of the disputed evidence. Simply put, the ruling lacks finality and thus is not a proper subject for appeal. Defendant\u2019s assignment of error as raised on cross-appeal is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">Finding no error as assigned or argued, the judgment of the trial court is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b436-12\">Thomas F.
