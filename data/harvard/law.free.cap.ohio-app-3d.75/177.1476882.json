The trial court erred by granting the Appellees\u2019 Motion for Directed Verdict based upon a finding that the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">\u201c2. O.R.C. Section 4123.54, as applied by the trial court in this case, is unconstitutional because it deprives Appellant due process of law and equal protection of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">This case arises from an injury received by a nonresident while driving through Ohio in the course of, and arising out of, employment entered into outside Ohio. Appellant filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits with the Industrial Commission of Ohio which was denied administratively and, on March 23, 1989, filed a complaint in the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, pursuant to R.C. 4123.519, appealing the administrative denial of his claim. The following findings of fact, which are sufficient for a determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>of the issues raised by this appeal, were made by the trial court and are agreed by the parties to be undisputed:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\u201c1. On October 14,1985, Plaintiff was involved in an accident while driving a truck in the course of and arising out of his employment with Defendant, Anchor Motor Freight Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u201c2. The accident occurred in Toledo, Lucas County, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">\u201c3. Plaintiff was, at all times relevant hereto, a resident of Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">\u201c4. Defendant Anchor was, at all times relevant hereto, a Michigan resident corporation engaged in the business of interstate trucking.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">\u201c5. Plaintiff, in the course of his employment with Defendant Anchor, drove his truck on Ohio highways, averaging approximately 400 miles per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">\u201c6. Plaintiff made regular deliveries to destinations outside of Ohio, as well as to locations in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">\u201c7. The Plaintiff was regularly dispatched out of Defendant Anchor\u2019s terminal in Pontiac, Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">\u201c8. At the time of the accident, Plaintiff was in the process of driving his empty truck from his home in Kentucky to his dispatch terminal point in Pontiac, Michigan, having last made a delivery in Indiana, when the accident occurred in Lucas County, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">\u201cThe Court takes Judicial Notice of the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">\u201c9. Plaintiff <em>[sic, </em>defendant] had filed and been assigned a \u2018Risk No. 206589\u2019, by the Ohio Bureau of Worker\u2019s Compensation, thereby establishing by implication Defendant Anchor\u2019s participation in Ohio\u2019s Workers\u2019] Compensation coverage through the Ohio Insurance Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-15\">\u201c10. The Industrial Commission\u2019s Order disallowing the Plaintiff\u2019s Claim was premised upon a finding that, \u2018claimant was hired, supervised and controlled in the State of Michigan * * * [that he] is a resident of a state other than Ohio * * * [that he] is insured under the Workers\u2019] Compensation Law of a state other than Ohio * * * [and that he] was temporarily in the State of Ohio at the time of the injury of 10-14-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-16\">\u201c11. The Court, in interpreting Michigan statutory law, to wit: M.C.L. 418.845; M.S.A. 17.237(845), and Michigan case law, to wit: <em>Wolfe v. Ethyle [Wolf v. </em>Ethyl] <em>Corp. </em>(1983) [124 Mich.App. 368], 335 N.W.2d 42 (Mich.App.), determines Plaintiff is not entitled to participate in, nor is he covered under Michigan\u2019s Workers\u2019] Compensation law, since he is an out-of-state resident, and the accident occurred outside the State of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u201c12. The Court determines, under Kentucky statutory law, to wit: K.R.S. Sec. 342.670, Plaintiff is denied the right to participate in, and he is not covered under Kentucky\u2019s Worker[s\u2019] Compensation law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">On January 16,1990, the case proceeded to a trial to the court. At the close of appellant\u2019s evidence, appellees moved for a directed verdict. On February 13, 1990, the trial court filed its judgment entry which, pursuant to R.C. 4123.54, found that appellant was only \u201ctemporarily\u201d within the state of Ohio at the time of his accident and granted appellees\u2019 motion for directed verdict. It is from this judgment that appellant brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In his first assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in its interpretation of R.C. 4123.54. In support, appellant argues that R.C. 4123.54 does not preclude a nonresident employee who is \u201ctemporarily within this state\u201d from receiving compensation or benefits unless that employee is \u201cinsured under the workers\u2019 compensation law or similar laws of a state other than this state\u201d and that in this context the term \u201cinsured\u201d means \u201ccovered.\u201d Alternatively, appellant argues that he was not \u201ctemporarily\u201d in Ohio. In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that the application of R.C. 4123.54, as interpreted by the trial court, to the facts of this case deprives him of due process and equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Appellees respond that R.C. 4123.54 precludes the receipt of compensation when, at the time of the accident, an employee is a resident of a state other than Ohio, is only temporarily within Ohio and is insured under the workers\u2019 compensation laws of states other than Ohio. Appellees submit that \u201cinsured,\u201d in this context, does not mean \u201cavailability of a remedy,\u201d but rather only that the employer has taken out a policy of insurance in a state other than Ohio on behalf of his employees. Appellees further respond that appellant waived his constitutional arguments by failing to raise them in the trial court and that no class of persons is created by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Th\u00e9 issue of whether appellant has insufficient contacts with Ohio to entitle him to compensation, or whether his employer is engaged entirely in interstate commerce, has not been raised by the parties and is not, therefore, before this court. Nor is it contended or argued that appellant is not an \u201cemployee\u201d as defined in R.C. 4123.01(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">The issue presented by appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is whether <em>R.C. 4123.54 </em>precludes appellant from receiving workers\u2019 compensation and benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">R.C. 4123.54 provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">\u201cEvery employee, who is injured * * * is entitled to receive * * * the compensation * * * [and other benefits] as are provided by this chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number><em>(( * * </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u201cIf an employee is a resident of a state other than this state and is insured under the workers' compensation law or similar laws of a state other than this state, the employee and his dependents are not entitled to receive compensation or benefits under this chapter, on account of injury, disease, or death arising out of or in the course of employment while temporarily within this state and the rights of the employee and his dependents under the laws of the other state shall be the exclusive remedy against the employer on account of the injury, disease, or death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Pursuant to R.C. 4123.54, an employee is not entitled to receive compensation or benefits for an injury when that employee (1) is a resident of a state other than Ohio, (2) is insured in a state other than Ohio, and (3) is only temporarily in Ohio. All three conditions must exist to preclude compensation; the absence of one condition will result in the general entitlement, pursuant to R.C. 4123.54, of every employee to compensation or benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Since neither party disputes that appellant is a resident of Kentucky, the preliminary issue for this court is whether appellant was, at the time of his injury, <em>\u201cinsured </em>under the workers\u2019 compensation law\u201d (emphasis added) of another state. This issue, in turn, involves the threshold question of whether preclusion from participation under the workers\u2019 compensation law of another state on a jurisdictional or quasi-jurisdictional basis <em>{e.g., </em>situs of injury, length of stay, place of hire and/or state of residence) results in the employee not being \u201cinsured\u201d in another state as that term is used in R.C. 4123.54.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">In <em>Wingate v. Hordge </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 55, 58, 14 O.O.3d 212, 214, 396 N.E.2d 770, 772, the Supreme Court of Ohio stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">\u201cIt is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that where the terms of a statute are clear and unambiguous, the statute should be applied without interpretation. <em>Provident Bank v. Wood </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St.2d 101 [65 O.O.2d 296], 304 N.E.2d 378. Where the court is confronted with a statutory ambiguity, the rules of statutory interpretation may be invoked for the purpose of ascertaining the true intent of the General Assembly. See <em>Humphrys v. Winous Co. </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 45 [59 O.O. 65], 133 N.E.2d 780.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">The General Assembly has established certain basic guidelines for statutory interpretation. R.C. 1.49 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">\u201cIf a statute is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention of the legislature, may consider among other matters:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">\u201c(A) The object sought to be attained;</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">\u201c(B) The circumstances under which the statute was enacted;</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">\u201c(C) The legislative history;</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>\u201c(D) The common law or former statutory provisions, including laws upon the same or similar subjects;</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u201c(E) The consequences of a particular construction;</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u201c(F) The administrative construction of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">In addition, R.C. 4123.95 provides that \u201cSections 4123.01 to 4123.94, inclusive, of the Revised Code shall be liberally construed in favor of employees</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">* * * <em>)&gt;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Preliminarily, this court notes that it is clear that the term \u201cinsured,\u201d as employed in R.C. 4123.54, does not mean that benefits were actually \u201cawarded\u201d or \u201crecovered\u201d; this is apparent when considered in light of the preceding paragraph of R.C. 4123.54 which credits the bureau with any benefits \u201cawarded or recovered\u201d under the laws of another state. If the legislature meant to preclude compensation or benefits to out-of-state residents only in cases in which benefits were actually awarded or recovered in another state, then it would have employed the same language that it used in the preceding paragraph. The term \u201cinsured\u201d is ambiguous, however, because, as used in R.C. 4123.54, it is unclear whether it is meant to preclude an employee from receiving benefits in Ohio: (a) merely because a policy of workers\u2019 compensation insurance has been secured in another state by the injured workers\u2019 employer; or (b) only when the application of the law of the other state would permit actual recovery under the facts of the case; or (c) only when the claimant\u2019s employer is required to maintain coverage on his behalf in another state, <em>i.e., </em>amenability; or (d) only when the laws of the other state do not deny its agencies and courts the power to entertain a claim for benefits on the merits, <em>i.e., </em>bestows subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">The purpose behind the Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Law is stated in Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution:</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">\u201cFor the purpose of providing compensation to workmen and their dependents, for death, injuries or occupational disease, occasioned in the course of such workmen\u2019s employment, laws may be passed establishing a state fund to be created by compulsory contribution thereto by employers, and administered by the state, determining the terms and conditions upon which payment shall be made therefrom. Such compensation shall be in lieu of all other rights to compensation, or damages, for such death, injuries or occupational disease, and any employer who pays the premium or compensation provided by law, passed in accordance herewith, shall not be liable to respond in damages at common law or by statute for such death, injuries, or occupational disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">The Supreme Court of Ohio stated, early on, in <em>Indus. Comm. v. Drake </em>(1921), 103 Ohio St. 628, 636, 134 N.E. 465, 467:</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>\u201cWhile the premium is paid by employers, in the last analysis it amounts to a deduction from the wages due the workmen to create a fund to be administered for their benefit * * * in the strictest sense a mutual insurance * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The general purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, therefore, is reciprocal, on the one hand to provide compensation to injured workers and their dependents and, on the other hand, to shield employers from actions for damages for accidental injuries. The objective sought to be attained by R.C. 4123.54 is, by its very language, the providing of compensation to \u201c[ejvery employee\u201d who is injured in the course of, and arising out of his employment. The General Assembly could have, but did not, pursuant to the nonresidency provision contained in R.C. 4123.54, preclude entitlement to benefits to a nonresident solely on the basis that he is temporarily in Ohio. Instead, it imposed the additional condition that, to be precluded, the nonresident employee who is temporarily in Ohio must be \u201cinsured\u201d under the workers\u2019 compensation laws of another state. We believe that this evidences legislative concern that a remedy be available somewhere to the nonresident employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Upon consideration of the law as set forth above, including the directive of R.C. 4123.95 to interpret R.C. 4123.54 liberally in favor of employees, and in light of its clear legislative intent, and applying that law to the undisputed facts as found by the trial court, this court finds: (1) pursuant to the nonresidency provision of R.C. 4123.54, when a nonresident employee is not \u201cinsured under the workers\u2019 compensation law\u201d of another state, he is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits in Ohio for an injury occurring in Ohio; (2) such an employee is not \u201cinsured\u201d in another state when, although his employer has secured a policy of insurance in that other state, he is precluded by that other state from entitlement to compensation on a jurisdictional or quasi-jurisdictional basis; (3) appellant herein was foreclosed on a jurisdictional or quasi-jurisdictional basis, from receiving workers\u2019 compensation in all other states; (4) appellant was not insured in a state other than Ohio; and (5) appellant is not precluded, by virtue of the nonresidency provision of R.C. 4123.54, from entitlement to compensation or benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is found well taken. Having held that R.C. 4123.54 does not apply in this case to defeat compensation, appellant\u2019s constitutional arguments, based as they are on a deprivation of his right to a forum in which to have his claim considered, are moot. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">On consideration whereof, this court finds that substantial justice has not been done the party complaining and the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is reversed. This case is remanded to said court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. Costs assessed against appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b212-6\">Glasser and Sherck, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-14\">. On April 10, 1991, appellees Patrick Mihm, Administrator, Bureau of Workers' Compensation and the Industrial Commission of Ohio filed a motion with this court to join in appellee Anchor Motor Freight Company's brief. Upon consideration, this court finds appellees\u2019 motion well taken and grants same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b211-8\">. This court is not unmindful of the possible extraterritorial application of this finding to a case in which a nonresident employee is injured outside of Ohio. Whether such a case requires application of the nonresidency provision of R.C. 4123.54, application of the test for sufficient contacts, <em>Prendergast v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1940), 136 Ohio St. 535, 17 O.O. 190, 27 N.E.2d 235, or some other test, <em>Holly v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1943), 142 Ohio St. 79, 26 O.O. 261, 50 N.E.2d 152, or a combination of tests, is not within the purview of this opinion. The present opinion is limited to the facts of this case in which a nonresident employee is injured in Ohio. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>We otherwise do not decide today whether or not the term \"insured,\u201d as used in R.C. 4123.54, encompasses a situation in which the nonresident employee has been or would be denied compensation and benefits in another state as a result of the application of that state\u2019s substantive or procedural law to the facts of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
