After service was obtained, the president of CEE Contracting, Inc. (\u201cCEE\u201d) sent a letter to the clerk of courts which indicated:</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">\u201cIn response to complaint filed against CEE Contracting, Inc. by Columbus Showcase [sic] Co. Case #91CVH09-7373 in the Court of Common Pleas, Franklin County, Ohio we wish to answer as follows: * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Columbus Show Case Company then filed a motion for a default judgment, since the letter did not constitute a responsive pleading on behalf of a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">As a result, CEE obtained counsel, who filed a memorandum contra the motion for default judgment and a motion requesting an extension of the time to move or plead.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">The trial judge signed a judgment entry overruling the motion for default judgment and granting CEE leave to move or plead. CEE then filed a motion to dismiss the case based upon a purported lack of personal jurisdiction. In support of the motion to dismiss, CEE filed an affidavit from the president of CEE which included:</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">\u201c2. CEE Contracting, Inc., is a corporation chartered under the law of the State of New York with its principal and sole place of business located at 23 Sexton Drive, West Islip, New York 11795; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">\u201c3. CEE Contracting, Inc., maintains no physical presence of any kind in the State of Ohio and specifically does not maintain any office or other physical setting in the State of Ohio, nor does it retain any employees, independent sales agents, or other personnel in the State of Ohio; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">\u201c4. With respect to the contract subject of this action, all communication leading up to the contract was done by telephone or mail between defendant\u2019s office in the State of New York and the plaintiff\u2019s office in Columbus, Ohio; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">\u201c5. At no time did Affiant or any employee or agent of CEE Contracting, Inc., physically enter the State of Ohio with respect to this contract; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b589-14\">\u201c6. To the extent that there were personal meetings between Affiant or other employees of CEE Contracting, Inc., and representative <em>[sic </em>] or employees or agents of Columbus Show Case Company, said personal meetings took place either in the State of New York or in the State of New Jersey, the situs of delivery of the goods subject of this contract; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>\u201c7. The subject matter of this contract were [sic] certain show cases, counters and store fixtures to be installed in certain Macy\u2019s-Lancome Stores located in Rockway [sic] and Tom\u2019s River, New Jersey; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">\u201c8. The documents attached hereto as Exhibit \u2018Al\u2019 and \u2018A2\u2019 are true and accurate copies of the quotation or bid telefaxed to defendant by plaintiff as offers to supply the subject materials; and</p>\n<p id=\"AtT\">\u201c9. Those documents attached hereto as Exhibits] \u2018Bl\u2019 and \u2018B2\u2019 are true and accurate copies of the letters issued by defendant authorizing performance by plaintiff of the work proposed in Exhibits \u2018Al\u2019 and \u2018A2\u2019; and,</p>\n<p id=\"Aey\">\u201c10. Defendant CEE Contracting, Inc., has never and does not currently do business in the State of Ohio; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">\u201c11. Defendant\u2019s only contact with the State of Ohio was the above-described communication with Columbus Show Case Company. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AlvF\">Exhibits \u201cAl\u201d and \u201cA2\u201d attached to the affidavit are, as indicated in the body of the affidavit, quotations for the installation of showcases in Macy\u2019s Department Stores in Rockaway, New Jersey and Tom\u2019s River, New Jersey, respectively. Exhibits \u201cBl\u201d and \u201cB2\u201d are authorizations to perform the work at the two stores. The authorizations were sent from New York to Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Columbus Show Case Company filed a memorandum contra the motion to dismiss. Attached to the memorandum was an affidavit signed by an employee of Columbus Show Case Company which indicated that CEE solicited the quotations from Columbus Show Case Company in a telephone call to a different employee of Columbus Show Case Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The trial court sustained the motion to dismiss via an entry which reiterated the court\u2019s earlier ruling on the motion for default judgment filed on behalf of Columbus Show Case Company. Columbus Show Case Company (hereinafter \u201cappellant\u201d) has now appealed, assigning two errors for our consideration:</p>\n<p id=\"ALU\">\u201cI. The trial court committed an error prejudicial to appellant by overruling appellant\u2019s motion for default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">\u201cII. The trial court committed an error prejudicial to appellant by sustaining appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">The first assignment of error alleges that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant the motion for default judgment. Apparently, the president of CEE was unaware that he could not represent \u201chis\u201d corporation in an Ohio court of law and that his letter/answer did not constitute a pleading such as to put the issues in a posture of being contested. Upon learning of the problem, he then obtained counsel who properly opposed the motion for default judgment. Under the circumstances, the trial court appropriately overruled the motion for default judgment. Obviously, significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>issues are present in this action, not the least of them being the existence or lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The second assignment of error presents the difficult issue of personal jurisdiction. What quality and/or quantity of contacts with Ohio are necessary to permit a lawsuit against a \u201cforeign\u201d person or entity to go forward in Ohio\u2019s courts?</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">For guidance, this court turns to the recent Ohio Supreme Court ruling in <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall Co. v. Mitchell\u2019s Formal Wear, Inc. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 73, 559 N.E.2d 477. According to <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall, </em>a two-part test should be utilized to determine if personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant is available. First, it must be determined if the defendant\u2019s conduct falls within Ohio\u2019s \u201clong-arm statute\u201d or applicable civil rule, giving rise to personal jurisdiction, and then the court must determine whether a grant of jurisdiction to Ohio courts comports with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 75, 559 N.E.2d at 479-480.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The syllabus in <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall </em>states:</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">\u201cA commercial nonresident lessee, for purposes of personal jurisdiction, is \u2018transacting any business\u2019 within the plain and common meaning of the phrase, where the lessee negotiates, and through the course of dealing becomes obligated, to make payments to its lessor in Ohio. (R.C. 2307.-382[A][1] and Civ.R. 4.3[A][1], construed and applied.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">R.C. 2307.382(A)(1) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">\u201cA court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action arising from the person\u2019s:</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">\u201cTransacting any business in this state[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">Civ.R. 4.3(A)(1) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">\u201cService of process may be made outside of this state, as provided in this rule, in any action in this state, upon a person who, at the time of service of process, is a nonresident of this state or is a resident of this state who is absent from this state. \u2018Person\u2019 includes an individual, his executor, administrator, or other personal representative, or a corporation, partnership, association, or any other legal or commercial entity, who, acting directly or by an agent, has caused an event to occur out of which the claim that is the subject of the complaint arose, from the person\u2019s:</p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">\u201cTransacting any business in this state[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Although the syllabus provides the law of the case in the <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall </em>case, we are not at liberty to ignore the body of the opinion, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">\u201cIt is clear that R.C. 2307.382(A)(1) and Civ.R. 4.3(A)(1) are very broadly worded and permit jurisdiction over nonresident defendants who are <em>transacting any </em>business in Ohio. \u2018Transact,\u2019 as defined by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.1979) 1341, \u2018 * * * means to <em>prosecute negotiations; </em>to carry on business; <em>to have dealings </em>* * *. The word embraces in <em>its meaning the carrying on or prosecution of business negotiations </em>but it is a <em>broader term than the word \u201ccontract\u201d and may involve business negotiations </em>which have been either wholly or partly brought to a conclusion * * (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 75, 559 N.E.2d at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">In light of the <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall </em>case, the Supreme Court of Ohio\u2019s current interpretation of R.C. 2307.382 and Civ.R. 4.3 seems to be that the statute and rule are intended to reach to the full outer limits of litigation which is permissible consistent with federal due process of law limitations. Thus, <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall </em>implicitly overrules our earlier opinion in <em>Ohio State Tie &amp; Timber v. Paris Lumber </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 236, 8 OBR 309, 456 N.E.2d 1309.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The most recent insight as to federal due process standards has been provided in <em>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz </em>(1985), 471 U.S. 462, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528. In <em>Burger King, </em>at 464, 105 S.Ct. at 2177-2178, 85 L.Ed.2d at 535-536, Justice Brennan concluded, citing <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington </em>(1945), 326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">\u201c * * * [T]he constitutional touchstone remains whether the defendant <em>purposefully </em>established \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 in the forum State.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\"><em>Burger King goes </em>on to note:</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">\u201cOnce it has been decided that a defendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the forum State, these contacts may be considered in light of other factors to determine whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with <em>\u2018fair play and substantial justice. </em>\u2019 * * * Thus courts in \u2018appropriate case[s]\u2019 may evaluate \u2018the burden on the defendant,\u2019 \u2018the forum State\u2019s interest in adjudicating the dispute,\u2019 \u2018the plaintiff\u2019s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,\u2019 \u2018the interstate judicial system\u2019s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies,\u2019 and the \u2018shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.\u2019 <em>* * * These considerations sometimes serve to establish the reasonableness of jurisdiction upon a lesser showing of minimum contacts </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number><em>than would otherwise be required. </em>* * * On the other hand, where a defendant who purposely has directed his activities at forum residents seeks to defeat jurisdiction, he must present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable. * * * \u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>471 U.S. at 476-477, 105 S.Ct. at 2184-2185, 85 L.Ed.2d at 543-544.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">CEE\u2019s president, in his affidavit, asserts that no agent or employee from his company did \u201cphysically enter the State of Ohio with respect to this contract,\u201d nor does \u201cCEE maintain a physical presence of any kind in Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Physical presence in a state is not the determinative factor as to whether an entity may be haled into court in that state. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Burger King </em>at 476, 105 S.Ct. at 2184, 85 L.Ed.2d at 543:</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">\u201cJurisdiction * * * may not be avoided merely because the defendant did not <em>physically </em>enter the forum State. Although territorial presence frequently will enhance a potential defendant\u2019s affiliation with a State and reinforce the reasonable foreseeability of suit there, it is an inescapable fact of modern commercial life that a substantial amount of business is transacted solely by mail and wire communications across state lines, thus obviating the need for physical presence within a State in which business is conducted. So long as a commercial actor\u2019s efforts are \u2018purposely directed\u2019 toward residents of another State, we have consistently rejected the notion that an absence of physical contacts can defeat personal jurisdiction there. * * * \u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">CEE\u2019s president stipulates that communications leading up to the contract with appellant were accomplished by telephone or mail between its office in the state of New York and appellant\u2019s office in Columbus, Ohio. The mere fact that no employee or agent of CEE was \u201cphysically\u201d present in Ohio during negotiations between parties to the case at bar, or that CEE has not maintained a \u201cphysical presence\u201d at any time in Ohio, is not supportive of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of that action for lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">In the situation presented by the litigation between appellant and CEE, we note that three state court systems could be utilized. The actual showcases were installed in New Jersey and the New Jersey sales tax assessed is at least part of the damages alleged; so, New Jersey is one possible legal forum. CEE is located in New York, and apparently did the contracting from New York; so, New York is a potential forum. Finally, Ohio, whose involvement for purposes of this litigation is set forth in the affidavits before the trial court, presents the third forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Under the circumstances, litigation in Ohio is the most appropriate. CEE\u2019s home state of New York is the least appropriate since appellant has not been demonstrated to have any ongoing presence there and since none of the actual work contemplated in the contract for installation of the showcases has been shown to have occurred there. New Jersey would be a more appropriate forum than New York, since the actual installation of the showcases occurred there and since CEE apparently had ongoing business responsibilities there. However, neither of the parties is a resident there. Apparently some or all of the work incident to the manufacturing of the showcases was done in Ohio, and apparently the installation of the showcases was coordinated through Ohio. Finally, the fact that CEE initially approached appellant, as opposed to appellant approaching CEE, is significant in determining the most appropriate forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Therefore, we find that permitting this litigation to proceed in Ohio is consistent both with the most recent opinions of the Ohio Supreme Court in construing R.C. 2307.382 and Civ.R. 4.3, and with federal due process standards. As a result, the second assignment of error is sustained. The judgment of the trial court in ordering dismissal of the action is reversed and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b594-7\">Bowman and Peggy Bryant, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
