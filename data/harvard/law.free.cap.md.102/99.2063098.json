Held, that Owen and his four children are each entitled to one-fifth of the proceeds of the sale, and that the use of the word <em>between </em>does not indicate that the grantor intended that the fund should be divided into two equal parts, one of which should go to Owen and the other be equally divided between his children.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b125-7\">A trustee authorized by a deed of trust to sell property is entitled to a commission for making the sale.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-8\">Appeal from the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Fowler, C. J. and Burke, J.)</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b125-9\">The cause was argued before McSherry, C. J., Briscoe, Page, Boyd, Pearce, Schmucker and Jones, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b125-10\"><em>John P. Poe </em>and <em>Edwin Higgins, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-11\">The question is a narrow one. Looking to the precise language of the deed of trust we insist that this is a case in which the children are to be treated as a class and that the word \u201cequally\u201d means \u201cequally\u201d <em>between </em>himself and his children as a class, each child to receive one-fourth of the half given to them collectively as a class.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-12\">The grantor did not intend that the proceeds of sale should be divided <em>amongst </em>her son and his children, no matter how many these- might be, share and share alike, so that if he had ten children, these proceeds were to be divided into eleven shares, one to him and one to each of the ten children, but she intended that the proceeds should be divided into <em>two </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>equal </em>shares of which two shares, her son, the appellant, should take one and the other equal share should be divided, share and share alike, <em>amongst </em>the children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-5\">It does not seem reasonable to suppose that the grantor, the mother of the appellant, intended to put him upon the same plane and level with his children, her grandchildren.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-6\">The children are mentioned in the deed three times as a class; the names of the children are not given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-7\">The precise words are \u201cequally <em>between </em>himself and each of his children share and share alike.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-8\">The grantor 'does not use the word <em>amongst, </em>but the word <em>between, </em>and this word <em>between </em>makes our contention quite clear.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-9\"><em>\u201cBetiveen\" </em>refers to <em>two </em>and not more, and the only way by which the language of this deed can be gratified is to divide the fund into two equal parts, which two equal -parts are to be divided <em>betiveen </em>the appellant and his children, he taking one-half and the children as a class taking the other half, which other half is to be divided amongst the children, each child to take an equal part.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-10\">The word \u201cbetween\u201d and its well-recognized meaning will be entirely ignored by dividing the fund into five parts. 2 <em>Am. &amp; Eng.

Jones, and she is directed in case of sale by her, \u2018 \u2018to divide the proceeds of sale equally between herself and each of her children by the said Owen D. Jones, share and share alike.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-8\">In this event the daughter-in-law, Annie E. Jones, received the same share which' the son would have received, had he made the sale, that is, an equal share with each of the children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-9\">Finally, upon the death of both parents the land, if unsold, \u201cshall pass to their children to be equally divided between them, share and share alike.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-10\">Whether the sale was made by the son Owen or by his wife Annie, in either event the beneficiaries were all put in one class. Throughout it was to be share and share alike, and the portion of the parent was to be not equal to the share of the children, but to the share of each of his children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-11\">Even had the language of the grantor been less clear and explicit, and if the direction had been to divide the proceeds of sale equally between the said Owen D. Jones and' his children, share and share alike, eliminating the word \u201ceach,\u201d the intention was manifest to divide the proceeds of s\u00e1le between the son and his four children, share and share alike, giving to each one-fifth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-12\">The intention of the grantor is to be ascertained by the rule laid down in <em>Larmour </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>71 Md. 369, that \u201cobviously the most simple and natural way to ascertain what a testator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>or grantor\u2019s intention was, is to read what he has written, because what he has written was designed by him to express that intention.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-5\">Where the language is so plain and explicit as that contained in this deed, no authority would seem to be required; but authority is not wanting to sustain the appellees\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-6\">In <em>Maddox v. State, use ef Swann, </em>4 H. &amp; J. 539, the will of John Swann directed that the money arising from the sale of certain negroes \u201cbe equally divided between my brother Justinian and my brother George\u2019s children.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-7\">George left six children and the Court held that Justinian, the brother, took as tenant in common an equal part and no more with each of the children of George, and that if George left six children, the estate would be divided into seven equal parts; if only five, into six equal parts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-8\">In <em>Brittain </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>46 Md. 189, the Court recognize the authority of <em>Maddox </em>v. <em>Swann, </em>and said it has been followed and adopted by subsequent decisions in this State. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Ramsay, </em>7 Gill, 347; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Young, </em>25 Md. 461; <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>4 Md.

Jones, certain property, in trust for the 'grantor\u2019s own use during her life, with power reserved to herself to sell and dispose of thfe same, or any part thereof as she might see proper; and apply the proceeds thereof to her own use and benefit; and from and after her death, the said property or so much thereof as had not been disposed of by her, should go to her son Owen for life, with power to him to sell the same or any part thereof and to divide the .proceeds of the same \u201cequally between himself and each of his children share and share alike.\u201d Should he, however, not sell as authorized by the deed, upon his death the power of sale was vested in his wife, Annie Jones, with direction to divide the proceeds of sale \u201cequally between herself and each of her children, by the said Owen D. Jones, share and share alike.\u201d And should neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Owen D. Jones, nor Annie E. Jones, sell the property or only a part of it, then it and the remaining part, upon their deaths shall pass to their children, to be \u201cequally divided between them share and share alike, &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Annie, the wife of Owen, died four years ago, leaving four children, all of whom are still living. Sarah Ann Jones, the mother of Owen, died many years ago. Owen Jones in December, 1904, made sale of the property for the sum of <em>$4,000, </em>and the same is now in Court for distribution among those entitled thereto. Two of the children, it appears have assigned their respective interests in the-fund to the appellant. The lower Court decreed that by a proper construction of the deed, Owen Jones and his four children each take one-fifth of the; proceeds of sale, and that the trustee was entitled to a commission of two and a-half per cent as compensation. From this decree this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The terms of the deed indicate a purpose on the part of the grantor To devote the property, first, to the use and enjoyment of her son during his life, and afterwards to that of his wife, if she should survive. But such use was limited only to the property itself or that part of it that remained unsold. So soon as the property was sold, either by the son Owen, or by his wife under and by virtue of the powers conferred by the deed, then a rule of distribution of a different character was imposed. In that event, the person invested with the power of sale was not to be entitled to the entire proceeds, but to only a share; he or she (as the case might be) was to share \u201cequally\u201d with \u201ceach of the children share and share alike.\u201d This seems to be the clear meaning of the words of the deed; and if that be correct, the decree of the lower Court must be affirmed. <em>Larmour </em>v. Rich, 71 Md. 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">There was some stress laid at the argument upon the use of the word \u201cbetween.\u201d The deed provides that the proceeds of sale shall be divided, \u201cequally <em>between </em>himself (the appellant) and each of his children,\u201d and it was contended that by the employment of this word there was indicated the purpose to require the fund to be divided into two parts, one of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>to go to the appellant, the other to be equally divided among his children. But we cannot accept this view. It has been held that the word \u201cbetween\u201d ordinarily refers to two only and not more, though, as was said in <em>Leary's </em>Appeal, 162 Pa. St. 372, \u201cit is not unfrequently used, especially by the uneducated and colloquially, in the sense of among as referring to more than two objects.\u201d To construe it here as indicating that the grantor in the deed intended to be understood as meaning there were to be only two parties to the distribution, one of \u2022 them being the appellant and the other his children, does violence to the proper import of all the words, when taken together. It absolutely ignores the word <em>\"each,\" </em>as used by the grantor more than once. Her direction is explicit and so clear as to leave no room for doubt, that the division is to be made <em>\u201cequally\" </em>between <em>himself </em>and each of his children \u201cshare and share alike.\u201d Thus the division is to be \u201cequal,\u201d and each child and the appellant should take \u201cshare and share alike.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b130-9\">(Decided November 16th, 1905.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">' Where the language is so clear as in this case, grammatical construction of a particular word and even the authorities applicable to cases not exactly similar to the- one under consideration are not important.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The counsel for the appellee has referred to several cases in -Maryland, but we do not deem it necessary to discuss them. <em>Brittain </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>46 Md. 189; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>7 Gill, 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">There was no error in the allowance of commissions as compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
