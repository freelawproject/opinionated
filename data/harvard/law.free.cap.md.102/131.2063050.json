In what respect does the testamentary disposition under consideration differ from the devise mentioned in the illustration? There is no real difference.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-13\"><em>(a) </em>Instead of giving his wife a legal estate for life, as was given A in the illustration, Mr. S'hriver left his property to h'is wife for life, <em>in trust, for the use and benefit of herself and their </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number><em>children. </em>That is to say, the widow and testator\u2019s children by her, took equally and as tenants in common, equitable estates during the life of the widow.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-5\">(b) In the illustration, A, the life tenant has no power to dispose of the <em>corpus, </em>while in the case at bar Mrs. Shriver had the power conferred on her to dispose of the principal and to apply the proceeds thereof to the support of herself and their children, or for the education or advancement of the latter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-6\">(c) B, in the illustration, acquires an estate in possession mpon A\u2019s death, and no provision is made as to what shall become of the estate in the event of B\u2019s death; while in the \u2022will under discussion the. testator devises and bequeaths \u201call my estate, real .and personal, remaining at the death of my said wife to my children by my said wife, share and share alike, absolutely and in fee-simple, the child or children of a deceased child to stand in its or their parent\u2019s place and stead, and to receive and have the-share and interest its and their .parent would have been entitled to if living.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-7\">We will now discuss these points of supposed difference and see if any or all of them are of such a character, taking of course the language of the whole will into consideration as to make the remainders contingent and not vested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-8\">(a) It is apparent from the will that the testator desired to \u25a0make provision for the support of his wife and their children during her life, and in order to make this more effective, he \u25a0makes her trustee. The fact that the remaindermen\u2019s estate follows a life estate split up into .legal and equitable estates, cannot and does not make the remainder a contingent one, for that fact does not of itself produce or create a contingency.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-9\">In <em>Buck v. Lantz, </em>49 Md. 445, and in <em>Tayloe </em>v. <em>Mosher, </em>29 Md. 451 \u2014 452, it was held that it makes no difference <em>as to the vesting </em>of the estate whether the legal estate be devised or conveyed to trustees who are required to convey, according \u25a0to the direction of the will or instrument creating the estates, or whether the interest is provided to take effect without'the intervention of trustees. Now, if this is so, it would neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>sarily follow that the vesting of the legal estate of the life tenant in a trustee cannot effect the vesting of the remaindermen\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-5\">Neither does the fact that the remaindermen, or certain of them (they being also life tenants), have the right to be educated or advanced in addition to being supported, have that effect. The right to support, education or advancement, though in addition to their rights as remaindermen-, cannot change the character of their estate as such.. It certainly cannot be said that the mere fact that the remaindermen, or certain of them, also have an interest in the life estate evidences an intention on the testator's part that the estates in remainder, shall not vest on his death. It is clear that if the persons entitled to support, education and advancement were not the remaindermen, no one could argue that because the testator directed that certain persons should be supported, educated or advanced during the life estate, that that direction would affect the character of the estates in remainder. It is clear to us that the same would be true-although the persons entitled to support, education and advancement are the same persons as the remaindermen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-6\">([b) The next point to be discussed is, whether the power lodged in the widow as trustee to lease or to sell and convey in fee-simple the testator\u2019s real estate, the proceeds thereof if-sold, to be invested under the trusts of the will, and to use so much of the principal of the estate as may be required for -the support of herself and their children, all in the discretion of the trustee, affects the character of the estate in remainder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-7\">It is to be noted that the testator gave his wife two distinct and separate powers: one to sell and convey, in fee-simple, the real estate, or any part thereof, the proceeds of such sale or sales to be invested under the trusts of the will, and also to lease the real estate; and the other to use the principal for certain definite purposes. It is clear both from the terms of the will and from the authorities, that the powers conferred on Mrs. Shriver did not give her full and complete powers of distribution over the'property. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Werntz, 88 </em>Md. 210; I<em>n re Bauernschmidt' s </em>Estate, 97 Md. 35.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>The powers above enumerated are not inconsistent with the contention that the remainders are vested. The existence of the power in \u00e1 life tenant to convert the realty into cash and to reinvest the same, or to. use the principal so that. the <em>corpus </em>of the estate is diminished, does not either make what would otherwise be a vested remainder a contingent one, or show an intent on the part of the testator that the estates should not vest in the remaindermen until the death of the life tenant. <em>A fortiori </em>when the power to do these things is not in\u2018the life tenant, but in a trustee. <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>24 Md. 430.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-5\">Applying the reasoning of the case cited to the case at bar, it necessarily follows that the remaindermen here take a vested estate notwithstanding the fact that in the proper exercise of the powers conferred on her, the testator\u2019s widow as trustee might have found it necessary to convert the realty into personalty, or use nearly the whole of the principal of the estate for the purposes mentioned in the will. Such a disposition would undoubtedly affect the <em>quantity </em>of the estate <em>but not the quality-thereof. Am. &amp; Eng. Ency., </em>vol. 24, p. 389; <em>Ducker </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>146 Ill. 10, 20; <em>Railsback </em>v. <em>Lovejoy, </em>116 Ill. 442; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>54 Hun. 500; <em>Heilman </em>v. <em>Heilman, </em>129 Ind. 59, 65; <em>Woodman </em>v. Woodman, 89 Me. 128, 136, 137; <em>Burleigh </em>v. <em>Clough, </em>52 N. H. 267.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-6\">When we read the numerous cases here and elsewhere, defining remainders to be vested, notwithstanding the fact that they are to be divested <em>pro tanto </em>to let in children that may be born after the death of the testator and during the lifetime of the tenant, which, of course, diminishes the amount each remainderman would have otherwise received, it is apparent that the quantity of a remainderman\u2019s estate may be diminished under the terms of the Instrument creating it without changing or affecting the quality of his estate. <em>Dulany </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>72 Md. 67, 75; <em>Tayloe v. Mosher, </em>29 Md. 443, 455; <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Ency., </em>vol. 24, p. 383. It is to be observed that in <em>Dulany </em>v. <em>Middleton, supra, </em>the trustees named in the will of Lambert Gittings, which was the subject of construction in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>\u25a0 that case, had the power to sell any part of the real or personal estate to pay debts or legacies, or to effect division among the devisees and legatees according to the directions of the will, or to make or change investments, whether real or personal property, in their discretion, and yet the Court decided that the <em>cestui que trust </em>took vested interests in the estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-5\">So, too, in <em>Tayloe </em>v. <em>Mosher, supra, </em>at pp. 443, 450, in which the remainders were held to be vested, the trustees had the power to make any sale, disposition, or deed of the estate and property that might be requisite and proper for the final distribution, and otherwise carrying into full effect the provisions of the will. As was'said in the case last cited (p. 455): \u201c <em>The fact .that an estate is liable to be divested in tvhole </em>&gt; <em>or in part upon a contingency, does not make it a contingent estate.\u201d </em>The proposion contained in this quotation settles the contentions of the-appellee oh this point. It is contended on their behalf that because Mrs. Shriver, the widow,-as trustee, had the powers to sell or lease the real estate and to use the principal for the support and advancement of their children, the testator\u2019s children or grandchildren took contingent remainders, for it might happen that the life tenant would, in the exercise of her powers, use up the principal for the purposes mentioned, and there would be nothing'left for the remainders to act upon, and, therefore, the remainders were contingent upon Mrs. Shriver\u2019s not exercising her powers. We submit, however,' \u25a0 that these estates vested in the remaindermen, but were liable to be reduced in quantity upon a contingency,-to wit, the \u25a0proper exercise by the widow as trustee of the powers conferred upon her by the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-7\">The learned Court below was of the opinion that the testator intended that the remainders should be contingent and not vested, and that this intention is apparent from two considerations: First, because the property devised and bequeathed to \u25a0 the remaindermen is what remained of the testator\u2019s property at the death of the life tenant; and,-second, because the testator directed that his children should \u201cshare and share alike, absolutely and in fee-simple, the child or children of a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>ceased child to stand in its or their parent\u2019s place and stead, and to receive and have the share and interest its and their parent would have been entitled to if living,\u2019-\u2019 and that the equality of distribution thus indicated would, or-could, be disturbed by the exercise of the powers by the trustee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-5\">The first consideration above mentioned is practically included in. the point already discussed, and that is, that the fact that the testator contemplated that his estate might be changed :or diminished during the life estate, is not significant or in any way decisive in determining the character of the remainder. The other consideration, we submit, should not be given the importance attached to it by the learned Judge who decided this case below. It is true that the testator desired that his \u25a0 estate should be shared equally by his children ; but it is also \u25a0apparent that he was apprehensive lest the income should be .insufficient to support the widow and support and educate their .children, and to advance the latter in life, and, therefore, conferred on His widow as trustee certain powers relating to the . disposition of the estate for certain purposes. The equality of . distribution was subject to and liable to be disturbed by the \u2022exercise of the powers by tHe.trustee. And this is so no matter whether the remainders are regarded as contingent or .vested. Accordingly, even if the remainders are considered as contingent, the actual equality of distribution cannot be \u2022 preserved so long as the powers relating to the disposition of the principal may be exercised, for these powers, if exercised, are inconsistent with equality of distribution. But it may be urged that if the remainders are held to be contingent, that then the equality of distribution is preserved for the reason that the remaindermen would be equally entitled to share in the property remaining at the time of the death of the life tenant, and that thereafter the powers of the trustee would be terminated. In other words, this contention is based upon the assumed intention of the testator that what he desired was equality of distribution in the estate after the powers vested in the trustee had ceased to exist by reason of her death. We contend that what the testator intended was equality of distri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>bution in the estate from the death of the testator, subject to the disposition by the trustee of the <em>corpus </em>of the estate in the pursuance of the powers conferred on her. The practical result is the same under either contention, as the share each remainderman would actually get would be the same, and what possible object would the testator have in desiring equality of distribution after the death of the life tenant rather than equality of distribution from the date of his death, subject to be disturbed by the exercise of the powers by the trustee? It must be borne in mind that the law favors the vesting of estates, and that, accordingly, estates will not be held to be contingent unless the testator has clearly indicated an intention to postpone the time of the vesting of the remainders. Certainly in this case the fact that the testator by declaring for equality of distribution, which could not be actually given effect to if the trustee saw fit to exercise the powers vested in her, did not clearly indicate an intention on his part to postpone the vesting of the remainders until the death of his widow. The only effect, so far as equality of distribution is concerned, is that if the est\u00e1tes are held to be contingent the remaindermen get equal shares in their respective estates in remainder, which cannot be disturbed by the trustee for the reason that her powers to dispose of any part of the estate died with her; but the equality of their respective estates would be the same under either construction ; therefore, to declare the estates contingent on account of this declaration of the testator for equality of distribution, would, we submit, be giving it undue importance in the .construction of the will under consideration, and would put the testator in the position of appearing to have taken into consideration theoretical results rather than actual results.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-5\">(&lt;r) The last point of difference between the illustration and the case at bar is that in the former B acquires an estate upon A\u2019s death, and no provision is made as to what becomes of the estate in the event of B\u2019s death; while in the will under consideration, Mr. Shriver devised and bequeathed \u201cAll my estate, real and personal, remaining at the death of my said wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>to my children by my said wife, share and share alike, absol utely and in f\u00e9e-simple, the child or children of a deceased child to stand in its or their parent\u2019s place and stead, and to receive and have the share and interest its and their parent would have been entitled to if living.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-5\">We contend that by providing for the substitution of his grandchildren in place of their parents, if the latter should die before his widow, the testator did not intend to make the remainders contingent on the devisees and legatees surviving her. That this is so, is well settled by the decisions of this Court; <em>Ridgely </em>v. Ridgely, 100 Md. 230; <em>In re Rogers Trust Estate, </em>97 Md. 674; <em>Hoover </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>96 Md. 393; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Handy, </em>78 Md. 108; <em>Engel </em>v. <em>State, use of Geiger, </em>65 Md. 539, 545; <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Eisler, Trustee, </em>29 Md. 28.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-6\">It was argued in the Court below that <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Handy </em>could be distinguished from the case at bar on the ground that in the will in that case the testator designated his children by name, whereas, Mr. Shriver, the testator, did not. This distinction, however, is not sound, when we consider that Mr. Handy did not designate his grandchildren by name, and yet the Court decided that the grandchildren took vested remainders upon their parents\u2019 deaths.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-7\">The learned Judge below in his opinion, cites in support of his conclusion <em>Demill </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>71 Md. 175; <em>Larmour </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>71 Md. 369; <em>Small </em>v. <em>Small, </em>90 Md. 550.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-8\">We think that the provisions of the wills in these cases make it clear that they are so absolutely and essentially different from the language and provision of the will under consideration, that no decisions construing them can be used as authority in this case for holding the remainders herein are contingent and not vested. In neither case was the event upon the happening of which the remaindermen were to come into the enjoyment of their estates, an event sure to happen, naniely, the death of the life tenant; but there were age qualifications and other contingencies which might never be gratified or happen. In the case at bar, on the other hand, the only thing standing between the remaindermen and the enjoyment of their respective estates was the life of testator\u2019s widow.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>If the remainders are vested, then upon the death of Carrie Reese, her children, Augustus Shriver Reese and William \u2022Reigart Reese, took their mother\u2019s share of the estate as substituted legatees and devisees under the will of their grandfather, Augustus Shriver. They took by purchase and not by descent. <em>Hoover </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>96 Md. 397, 398; <em>Cox </em>v. Handy, 78 Md. 108, 127; <em>Demill </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>71 Md. 175, 193.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-5\">Augustus Shriver Reese died on July 31st, 1877, intestate, and thereupon his share (which was one-half of his mother\u2019s share) in his grandfather\u2019s estate, went as to the realty to his heirs-at-law, and as to the personalty, to his personal representatives. His heir-at-law, he dying unmarried and having no descendants, was his brother. Therefore, upon the death of Augustus Shriver Reese there became vested in his brother, \u25a0William Reigart Reese, the entire interest in the real estate, included in the remainder which first vested in his mother. When William Reigart Reese departed this life on August 5th, ,.i 877, this interest in the realty passed to his heir-at-law, who was his father, Edward Reese. With this interest in the .realty vested in him, Edward Reese died having first made a will whereby he left everything to his widow, Margaret, now Margaret A. Landon, one of the appellants. Margaret A.\" Lan.don is by virtue of this will and by force of these circumstances entitled to the real estate which in part composed the share of the Reese children in their grandfather\u2019s estate. As :to the personalty belonging to their share in the estate, that passed to Clymer Whyte, the administrator, who has taken out letters of administration on their estates, and is one of the' appellants here. When the personalty is received by him, it would be distributed to the persons entitled thereto, namely, Mrs. Landon, as executrix of the late Edward Reese, father of Augustus Shriver Reese and William Reigart Reese.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-6\">We, therefore, submit that the learned Court below erred in overruling the exceptions of Margaret Landon and Clymer Whyte, administrator, to the accounts which did not allow to the former one-eleventh of the proceeds, of the realty; and to the latter one-eleventh of the proceeds of the personalty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>It is wholly immaterial that this one-eleventh of Mr. Shriver\u2019s estate passes from his family. He had power to provide against the contingency which has happened. He did-not see fit to direct what should become of the share of his daughter should she die without children living at the death-of his widow. A new stock \u2022 was thus created. His two grandchildren became entitled to-his daughter\u2019s share, and the. fact that they did not survive their grandmother, makes no difference. It is precisely what happened in <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Handy. </em>As above said, Jesse T. Handy, one of the sons, survived the testator, and died without leaving children before\u2019 the life tenant. By his last will he gave all his property to his wife for life, with power to dispose of it at her death. She also died before the life tenant, having disposed of the property in controversy by will. The contingency of Jesse dying without issue, was not provided for in the will, and it was decided that-his share went according to the powers created under his wife\u2019s will, this Court saying at p. 126: \u201cWe understand that no question is made about the devolution of the property under these wills.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-6\">So in <em>Hoover </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>96 Md. 393 \u2014 398, where the will construed contained provisions similar to those found in Mr, Shriver\u2019s will, it was held that the remainder was vested, and that the father of one of the sustituted legatees \u2014 a deceased granddaughter of the testator \u2014 took as her representative, although she died after the testator, but before the tenant for life. According to these authorities, the shares of the infant children of Mrs. Reese ultimately devolved upon Edwin Reese, their father, who was their heir-at-law and next of kin.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b167-8\"><em>Charles E.

Landon and Clymer White, administrator, which involves the construction of the will of Augustus Shriver. The property of the testator having been converted into cash, the questions arising were presented by exceptions to audits. We will first consider the. appeal last mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>i. Augustus Shriver was married twice, and died on the 28th of July, 1872, leaving surviving him a widow, two children by his first wife and eleven by his second. After bequeathing one hundred dollars to each of the two children by his first wife and providing for payment of his debts and funeral expenses, he devised and bequeathed all the rest and residue of his estate to his wife \u201cfor and during the term of her natural life; <em>m trust&gt; </em>for the use and benefit of herself and our children\u201d \u2014 expressing his confidence that she would manage it as would be most advantageous to herself and children. He then authorized his wife to sell any part of the real estate which she thought proper \u2014 \u201cthe proceeds of such sale or sales to be invested upon the trusts of this will\u201d \u2014 and also to lease' the real estate. He further gave her authority to use so much of the principal as may be required, \u201cif it shall be necessary for the support of herself and' our children, dr for their education or advancement in life (all of which I confide to her discretion),\u201d but recommended that she should not sell the farm on which he resided unless absolutely necessary. Then follows this clause, \u201cI devise and bequeath all my estate, real and personal, remaining at the death of my said wife, to my children by my said wife, share and share alike, absolutely in fee-simple, the child or children of a deceased child shall stand in its. or their parents place and stead, and receive and have the share and interest its and their parent would have been entitled to if living.\u201d' He appointed his wife guardian of their children until they were twenty-one years of age, and sole executrix of his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Mrs. Shriver, the widow, died May 1st, 1902, having disposed of a part of the <em>corpus </em>of the estate, in pursuance of the power conferred upon her. Two of the eleven children died after their father and before their mother \u2014 Alice E., who' married George R. Gehr and left four children, and Carrie,, who married Edwin Reese, leaving her husband and twin boys surviving her. Those twins died a few days after their mother. Edwin Reese, the husband of Carrie, married Margaret A. Adams after the death of his two children, and died November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>22nd, 1887, leaving al) his property of every character and description to his wife, Margaret. She afterwards married Thomas D. Landon. Letters of administration were granted to Clymer Whyte on the estates of the two Reese children. The statement of these facts will suggest the- claim of Mrs. Landon, that is to say; that the two Reese children took their mother\u2019s interest in the estate of Augustus Shriver, and having died intestate their interest went to Edwin Reese, their fatheir as heir-at-law and next of kin, who by his last will and testament left them to his widow, who is now Mrs. Landon, one of the appellants \u2014 the children of the testator according to Mrs. Landon\u2019s contention, having taken vested remainders in his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">It will be observed that the testator left his entire estate (after payment of debts, funeral expenses and legacies) to his wife \u201cfor and during the term of her natural life in trust for the us\u00e9 and benefit of herself and our children.\u201d The legal title was therefore vested in her and she and their children were the <em>cestuis que trustent. </em>The \u2018widow and eleven children held the 'equitable estate and were the beneficial owners during the widow\u2019s life. If the testator had simply left his estate to his widow and their eleven children, during the life of the former, and at her death to the eleven children, there could be no doubt that the children would have taken <em>vested, not contingent, </em>remainders in the estate. It is thoroughly settled in this State that \u201cit makes no difference, as to the vesting, whether the legal estate be devised to trustees who are required to convey according to the directions of the will, or whether the interest is provided to take effect without the intervention of trustees, nor that the trust provides for the accumulation of income until the period of payment or distribution arrives.\u201d <em>Tayloe </em>v. <em>Mosher, </em>29 Md. 451; <em>Ellicott </em>v. <em>Ellicott, </em>90 Md. 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The power given Mrs. Shriver to sell the real estate and invest the proceeds upon the trusts of the will was certainly not sufficient to -show an intention to create a contingent instead of a vested remainder, nor was the power to lease it. Nor can it be said that the power to use so much of the prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>cipal as was necessary for the support of herself and children or for their education or advancement in life necessarily made these contingent remainders. Although that power was expressly confided to her discretion, he did not give the estate to her to do what she chose with it, for her own benefit, but she could only use it for the purposes named, that is to say, for the support of herself and the remaindermen, or for the education or advancement in life of the latter. In <em>Benesch </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>49 Md. 497, it was said that where an estate is given to a person generally or indefinitely with the power of disposition, such gift carries the entire estate, and the devisee or legatee takes the property absolutely, but when the property is given to one expressly <em>for life, </em>and there be annexed to such gift a power of disposition of the remainder, the rule is different and the first taker takes only an estate for life, with the power annexed. That has been approved in <em>Foos </em>v. <em>Scatf, </em>55 Md. 310; <em>Russell </em>v. Werntz, 88 Md. 214, and other cases. It is clear from those decisions, and authorities cited in them, that there may be a valid devise to one <em>for life </em>with a power of disposition which will not affect the remainder over, unless the power is exercised as authorized, and as to any part of the estate upon which the power is not exercised the remainder is unaffected.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">It is equally clear that the clause in the will last quoted does not of itself make these remainders contingent. . The testator, having given his widow a power of disposition, naturally and properly spoke of his estate \u201cremaining at the death of my said wife,\u201d but that would not convert what would otherwise have been a <em>vested </em>into a <em>contingent </em>remainder. The remainder may vest subject to the power, and the uncertainty as to whether the power will be exercised as to all or part of the estate does not make it a contingent remainder. As was well said in <em>Ducker </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>146 Ill. 10: \u201cIf the remainder is contingent because it may consist of what remains after the exercise of the power of sale and use conferred upon the life tenant, then, in case the life tenant should fail to sell any of the estate or to exhaust for her own use any of the principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>thereof, the remainder would still be \"contingent because it would consist of what remains after paying off the charges created upon the property by the directions to pay the debts and the bequests. To hold that a remainder is contingent, because it cannot be known how much will be left until the debts and funeral expenses and other charges are paid, would make every remainder given by will a contingent one. But it is well settled that a devise to a person after the payment of debts and legacies is not contingent until such debts and .legacies are paid, but confers an immediately vested estate. <em>(Scofield </em>v. <em>Olcott, supra.) </em>In such cases the remainder vests subject to the payment of debts and legacies and subject to the exercise of the power to use and sell, but liable to be divested as to so much of the estate as may be disposed of for the payment of debts and legacies, and by the execution of the power. The remainder is not made contingent by uncertainty as to the amount of the estate remaining undisposed of at the expiration of the life estate, but by uncertainty as to the persons who are to take.\u201d See also <em>Heilman </em>v. <em>Heilman, </em>129 Ind. 59; <em>Woodman </em>v. <em>Woodman, </em>89 Me. 128; <em>Burleigh </em>v. <em>Clough, </em>52 N. H. 267, and other cases cited in 24 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, </em>389.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">It is not necessary to go beyond our own decisions to find authorities on the subject, but the above quotation from <em>Ducker </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>seems to be very apt. In <em>Tayloe </em>v. <em>Mosher, supra, </em>the testator, after making certain devises, bequests, and dispositions in favor of his wife and servants, devised his estate not otherwise specifically disposed of to trustees. He directed them to pay certain annuities, and then to invest \u201cthe clear income of my estate, if anything remain after the application annually or otherwise of the several sums of money hereinbefore charged thereon,\u201d and provided: \"Upon the death of my son William, I will and desire that a <em>distribution </em>of rtay-estate be made among <em>all my grandchildren, </em>to-Wit: - The children of my late son James Mosher, and the children of my aforesaid son William, <em>provided </em>any child he shall' leave. All my said grandchildren to take <em>per capita.\u201d </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Court said: \u201cIt is doing no violence to this language or to any rule of law to hold that the children of James, who were <em>in esse </em>at the date of the will and of the testator\u2019s death, took vested interests, liable to be divested <em>pro tanto </em>for the purpose of letting in for a share any child that William, who then had none, might, by possibility, have, and leave surviving him. <em>The fact that an estate is liable to be divested in whole or in part upon a </em>continge?icy, <em>does not make it a contingent estate. </em>\u201d See also <em>Dulany </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>72 Md. 67, for a similar decision. It would seem, then, to be clear that the reference to the estate \u201cremaining at the death of my said wife\u201d did not make the remainder contingent.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">But it is argued, and was so held by the learned Judge below, that the rest of this clause shows that, the interests left to the children were contingent \u2014 that their right to participate in the distribution of his estate was contingent upon their surviving the testator\u2019s wife. But we cannot see how that clause indicates an intention on the part of the testator to create contingent remainders. The wife might in her lifetime have given one child more than she gave another, and that child might have survived her mother, while the other who received very little might have died, without issue, before her mother. It would seem to be more in accordance with the intention of the testator, and more natural for him, to vest the. remainder in his children at his death. We have seen what confidence he had in his wife\u2019s judgment and sense of justice, and he was willing for her to decide what was necessary to be expended for the support of herself and children, and for their education or advancement in life, He did not -direct that any charge should be made against- them for sums thus advanced in excess of what was given others, and, even if the remainder be treated as contingent, those thus favored might survive their mother and receive a share of the remaining property. The equality of distribution does not in any way depend upon whether the remainders were contingent or vested. It is a familiar but important rule that the law favors the early vesting of estates, and .it.is likewise a well-recognized rule of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>struction that in doubtful cases the interest should be deemed to be vested in the first instance, rather than contingent, unless the instrument under consideration does not admit of such construction. It cannot be doubted that Mr. Shriver did not intend to die intestate as to any part of his estate \u2014 he prefaced his will with the statement \u201csubject to the payment of my debts and funeral expenses <em>I dispose of all my estate </em>in manner and form following.\u201d Yet it was quite possible, although not probable, that all of the childeren by his second wife might have died without leaving issue before his wife died, and in that event there would have been an intestacy as to the remainder, if it must be regarded as contingent. The children provided for during the lifetime of his wife \u2014 \u201cour children,\u201d that is those of his second wife and himself \u2014 were the same who were referred to in the clause under consideration \u2014 \u201cmy children by my said wife.\u201d Mrs. Reese was one of those children and left two children who would admittedly have been entitled to their mother\u2019s share if they had survived their grandmother. The testator did not leave the remainder to such of his children as survived his wife, or to such children and grandchildren (children of a deceased child) as survived her. He did make provision in that clause for the share and interest of a deceased child who had died leaving a child or children, but made none as to the share of a deceased child who died without leaving issue. The provision that \u201cthe child or children of a deceased child shall stand in its or their parent\u2019s place and stead and <em>receive and have </em>the share and interest its and their parent would have been. entitled to if living\u201d is not of controlling effect on this question by reason of the use \u2022 of the words \u201creceive and have.\u201d That was speaking of the period of <em>distribution, </em>and whether vested or contingent, the remaindermen were not entitled to \u201creceive and have\u201d their shares until that time arrived. The trustee was to receive, have and hold the estate until then, excepting such part as she previously disposed of under the other provisions of the will. Without further discussion of this clause it is sufficient to say that we do not find anything in it which necessarily in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>dicates an intention on the part of the testator to create contingent remainders, and it will be well to now see what this Court has said about the effect of similar or analogous provisions in other wills.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Eisler, </em>29 Md. 28, the testator after making certain bequests and legacies, gave all the rest of his estate to his wife and another <em>in trust, </em>to hold the same with the surplus or unappropriated revenue or income arising from the same, etc. He then authorized them to receive all rents, issues, interest and profits arising or growing out of the property, and from the amounts so received to pay insurance, taxes, and repairs, and out of the residue to pay his wife for her use and benefit one-third part, and directed the balance of the income to be invested in Baltimore City stock to be held <em>in trust </em>with the other property, until the end of twenty years after his death, or until his youngest child should arrive at the age of twenty years, and then the whole, including principal and interest, to be divided and paid over as follows: To his wife one-third part \u201cand the other two-third parts to all my children, share and share alike * * *; and in the event of the death of either of my said children, leaving lawful issue, such issue to have and receive the share or proportion that the deceased would have been entitled to if living.\u201d He then provided for a similar distribution of the third left to his wife in case she \u201cshall be dead at the time of such division.\u201d Elizabeth, one of the children, after the testator\u2019s death, married John Rose, and subsequently died before the time had arrived for a division of the estate, intestate and without issue. The widow also died before that time. This Court held that the children took a vested interest in the property devised to them, and that John Rose, as husband of Elizabeth, was entitled under the statute then in force to a life estate in her share of the realty, and absolutely to her share of the personalty. That case is strikingly similar to the one under consideration, and has been fully approved in <em>Tayloe </em>v. <em>Mosher, supra; Small </em>v. <em>Small, </em>90 Md. 568, and. <em>Daughters </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>93 Md. 305, and other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>In <em>Cox v. Handy, </em>78 Md. 108, the testator left certain real and personal property to his wife for life, and his will contained this clause: \u201cIt is my will that after the death of my wife, Mary Ann Handy, all the property devised to her for life * * * shall be sold if necessary for equal partition, or if the same can be accomplished without a sale, shall be divided amongst my children, share and share alike, the child or children of any deceased child to take the portion to which the parent, if living, would have been entitled.\u201d This Court held, \u201cthat a share of the property vested in each of the children of Wm. W. Handy, who survived him, but if any such child should leave children at his death, -his share was divested in favor of his children; and that it was not divested by the death of the child in the lifetime of the tenant for life without leaving .children,\u201d and in the opinion delivered after a motion for reargument it was said \u201cA share of the property vested in each of the children who were living at the time of his death, and if any child died before the. period of distribution, leaving children, they were substituted in his place; his share however was not divested if he left no children, but it went to his representatives.\u201d That case has been recently approved in <em>Hoover </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>96 Md. 393, and <em>In re Rogers' Trust Estate, </em>97 Md. 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The cases we have cited would seem to conclusively show that these remainders were vested and not contingent. This, opinion has already reached such length as to make it undesirable to attempt to discuss in detail the authorities relied on by the appellees \u2014 such as <em>Demill </em>v. Reid, 71 Md. 175; <em>Larmour </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>Ib. 369; Small v. <em>Small, </em>90 Md. 550. In the latter Judge Fowler referred to <em>Larmour v. Rich, </em>and said: \u201cThe distinction is clearly drawn between that class of cases where the estate or interest vests at the death of a testator, because of an absence of any expressed intention that it vest later, and those where the testator by his will fixes a more distant period for the vesting.\u201d It is sufficient to say that in our opini\u00f3n the testator did not by his will express or indicate an intention that the remainder of his estate should not vest until after his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>wife\u2019s death. In the very recent case of <em>Ridgely </em>v. <em>Ridgely, </em>ioo Md. 230, many of the cases affecting this question are cited. <em>Engel </em>v. <em>Geiger, </em>65 Md. 539; <em>Small </em>v. <em>Small, </em>and <em>Larrnour </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>are there included in the class of cases where gifts were made for life and then over to survivors \u2014 in which cases the period of survivorship is generally referred to the period of distribution and not the death of the testator. There is no reference to survivorship in this will. In <em>Daughters </em>v. <em>Lynch, supra, </em>we repeated what had been said in <em>Tayloe </em>v. <em>Mosher, </em>that, \u201cestates will be held to be vested wherever it can fairly be done without doing violence to the language of the will, and to make them contingent there must be plain expressions to that effect, or such intent must be so plainly inferrible from the terms used as to <em>leave no room for </em>construction.\u201d We are therefore of the opinion that the Court erred in rejecting the claims of Margaret A. Landon and Clymer Whyte, administrator, for the shares claimed by them respectively \u2014 the one being for this interest in the real property, and the other for that in the personalty distributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">2. This brings us to the consideration of the appeal of Margaret L. Roberts. Having held that the children of Mr. and Mrs. Shriver took vested estates, it will not be necessary to determine whether a deed of trust such as that made by Mr. and Mrs. Roberts to Messrs. Reindollar and Roberts, trustees, would include a <em>contingent </em>remainder. The appellant contends that the deed of trust did not pass the interest of Mrs. Roberts for several reasons which we will briefly refer to.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">(\u00ab) It is claimed for her that it does not contain a description of the real estate sufficient to identify it with reasonable certainty, as provided in sec. 9 of Art. 21 of the Code. The description in the deed of trust is \u201call and singular the real and personal estate, wheresoever situate, * * * and all</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">other property of every nature, kind and description and wheresoever situate (except so much thereof as is exempt from execution) of us the said\u201d William and Margaret. It is difficult to understand how it would be possible to identify property intended to be conveyed more thoroughly than is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>done by that description. The intention manifested on the face of the deed was to convey and assign <em>all of their property of every nature,'kind and description. </em>If they had undertaken to specify it, some might have been omitted and to show on the face of the deed that they intended to make an assignment of all property,, it would have been necessary to have added some such clause as the one that was inserted. This Court decided in <em>Maughlin </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>47 Md. 545, and other cases, that a deed of trust for the benefit of creditors, creating preferences and exacting releases, is void unless it appears <em>on its face </em>to convey all the property of the debtor. It is true this deed does not create preferences or exact releases, but if the position of the appellant be correct as to the effect of this statute, it would be difficult to ever comply with the requirements of the law as announced in <em>Maughlin </em>v. <em>Tyler. </em>If a grantor intends to convey part of his property, of course he must describe it specifically, but if he intends to convey all of it and uses such language as is in this deed, who could be misled or in doubt as to what he conveyed? ' The object of sec. 9 is to require sufficient notice to the public and certainty as to what is conveyed. As well might it be required of a testator to specify his property in detail in a residuary clause in his will as to require a debtor making an assignment for the benefit of his creditors to do so. This statute has never been construed to require a schedule or list of the grantor\u2019s property to be set out in such a deed, and so far as we are aware it is the universal custom throughout the State to use terms similar to those in this deed, when it is intended to make a general assignment of all the debtor\u2019s property. In <em>Carey's Forms ef Precedents, </em>p. 371, a very similar description of property is given for such a deed of trust and ther.e have been many cases in this Court where such descriptions were given, and never questioned. The case of <em>Farquharson v. Eichelberger, </em>15 Md. 63, is conclusive of the question. It is said by the appellant that as it was decided prior to the Act of 1856, ch.- 154, sec.'24, which is now the section of the Code above mentioned, the effect of the statute was to change that deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>sion. But that was \u201cAn Act to simplify and abridge the rules and forms of conveyances,\u201d and if such a description was valid before the rules and forms were simplified, surely it is now. In our opinion the statute does not in any wise invalidate this instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><em>(\\b) </em>It is further contended on behalf of Mrs. Roberts that the deed of trust only conveyed the joint estates of her husband and herself \u2014 that she united in the deed simply to convey her potential right of dower. We find nothing in the deed that sustains that contention. It recites that they are \u201cindebted unto sundry persons and corporations in several sums of money, and being unable to pay the same in full have proposed and agreed to <em>assign all our property </em>* * * in trust for the benefit of <em>our </em>creditors, as hereinafter mentioned.\u201d It then assigns the property as we. have stated, and after giving the trustees authority to convert it into money and providing for costs, etc., directs them to apply the residue of said moneys in payment of the several debts due to the creditors aforesaid <em>of us, </em>the said William Jesse Roberts and Margaret L. Roberts, his wife, <em>pari passu, </em>and without any preference or priority of payment\u201d and after the payment of debts, costs, expenses and commissions, \u201cthen in trust to apply the surplus (if any), unto the said William Jesse Roberts and Margaret L. Roberts,\u201d etc. It seems clear to us, therefore, that Mr. and Mrs. Roberts not only conveyed and assigned any property owned by them jointly, but all they owned individually. Whether or not she owed any individual debts which are entitled to be paid we have no means of knowing, and we do not intend to determine how the money realized from her father\u2019s estate is to be distributed by the trustees. That can be disposed of in the proceeding in which they make distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\"><em>(c) </em>After having determined that the interests of the children of Mr. Shriver under his will were vested remainders, we do not deem it necessary to discuss at length the question as to whether Mrs. Roberts\u2019 interest passed by the deed of trust as we think it did. A vested remainder can be devised, mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>gaged or conveyed. It also is liable to execution by a judgment creditor. <em>Armiger </em>v. <em>Reitz, </em>91 Md. 334. We are of the opinion, therefore, that Mrs. Roberts\u2019 interest should be distributed to the trustees named in the deed of trust, and it can then be determined what creditors are entitled to it. As-the Court below so decided, although on a different ground, as to Mrs. Roberts\u2019 interest, that part of the decretal order will be affirmed, but as we do not agree with the Court as to the interest that would have gone to Carrie Reese, and is now-claimed by Margaret A. Landon and Clymer Whyte, administrator of Augustus Shriver Reese, and of William Reigart Reese, the portion of the order appealed from by them will be reversed. Of course we do not mean to disturb the portions of the decretal order not appealed from.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b182-6\">(Decided November 16th, 1905.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Decretal order affirmed in part and reversed in part \u2014 the costs in- No. 18 (office docket) to be paid by- the appellant in-that case, including one-half of the cost of transmitting and printing the record, and the costs in No. 19 (office docket) to be paid out of the estate of Augustus Shriver, including the other half of cost of transmitting and printing the record (one-half by the trustees and the other by the receiver) \u2014 and cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
