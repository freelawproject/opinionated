Defendant\u2019s evidence was to the effect that the plaintiff began to alight after the car had started. <em>Held, </em>that if plaintiff\u2019s evidence be found to be true defendant was guilty of negligence, and the trial Court properly refused defendant\u2019s prayers, one of which asked the Court to rule that there was no evidence legally sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover, and the other to rule that the verdict must be for the defendant because the undisputed evidence showed that the plaintiff\u2019s negligence contributed to the injury.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b312-9\"><em>Held, </em>further, thai the jury should not be instructed that if they found that the plaintiff attempted to alight from the car while it was in motion and before it came to a full stop, the verdict must be for the defendant.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b312-10\">It is not always, as a matter of law, negligence for a person to attempt to get off a car while it is in motion, but whether such attempt be negligence or not depends upon the circumstances of the particular case.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-11\">Appeal from the Court of Common Pleas (Sharp, J.), where there was a judgment for the plaintiff 'for $2,500.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b312-12\">The cause was argued before McSherry, C.

They announced the correct principles for the guidance of the jury in fixing the defendant\u2019s responsibility for the injury complained \u25a0 of, and also the correct rule for estimating the damages in case the jury should find for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">The defendant\u2019s first and second prayers were properly refused. The first prayer asked the Court to direct a verdict for the defendant, because there was no evidence in the case legally sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover, and the second prayer asked the Court to say that the undisputed evidence in the case showed that the negligence of the plaintiff contributed to the injury of which she complained, and, therefore, the verdict must be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>In view of the evidence offered by the plaintiff it is clear that the Court could not grant either of these prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">It is settled that-while the carriers of passengers are not insurers of absolute safety, yet they are bound to exercise reasonable care according to the nature of their contract; and as their employment involves the safety of the lives and limbs of passengers the law requires the highest degree of care which is consistent with the nature of their undertaking. <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. </em>v. <em>State, use of Hauer, </em>60 Md. 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">A railroad company, undertaking the carriage of passengers for hire, which stops its cars for the purpose of allowing a passenger to alight therefrom, is under an obligation to stop a sufficient length of time to enable him to alight in safety, and if a passenger is injured by reason of the failure of the company to observe this obligation it is liable for the injury. <em>Cumberland Valley R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Maugans, </em>61 Md. 53; <em>United Railways Co. </em>v. <em>Hertel, </em>97 Md. 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Assuming the testimony of the plaintiff as to the happening of the accident to be true, and the Court in passing upon these prayers was bound to assume its truth, there appears to have been, under the principles stated, a clear act of culpable negligence on the part of the defendant company.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">The action of the Court in rejecting the defendant\u2019s third prayer constitutes the main ground upon which it relies for the reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">This prayer asked the Court to instruct the jury that if they found that the plaintiff \u201cattempted to alight from the car while it was in motion, and before it came to a full stop\u201d their verdict should be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Under the authority of repeated decisions of this Court it would have been manifest error for the trial Court, under the facts as testified to by the defendant\u2019s witnesses, to have declared the plaintiff guilty, as matter of law, of negligence and want of ordinary care under the facts stated in the prayer. The question of negligence is ordinarily one of fact and not of law. This is the general rule, but cases frequently occur in which the Court will say that the plaintiff is guilty of contrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>utory negligence when some prominent and decisive act of negligence is found to have been committed by him in regard to the character and affect of which no room is left for ordinary minds to differ.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Whether it be negligence <em>per se </em>for one to attempt to alight from a moving car must depend alwaj^s upon the ctrcumstances of the particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">In the case of the <em>Cumberland Valley Railroad Company v. Maugans, supra, </em>where a passenger on the appellant\u2019s cars was injured in alighting therefrom while the car was in motion,, this Court said that the weight of authority is against the proposition, that it is <em>always, </em>as matter of law, negligence and want of ordinary care for a person to attempt to get off from a car while it is in motion; that in every case where the facts and circumstances are such that reasonable men may honestly entertain different views as to the nature and character of the act of the plaintiff, it is error in the Court to pronounce the act negligence in law, but that the question should be left to the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">To the same effect are the cases of <em>Kane </em>v. <em>B. &amp; O. R. R., </em>69 Md. 27; <em>New York, Phila. &amp; Norfolk R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Coulbourn, </em>69 Md. 360; <em>Western Md. R..R. Co. </em>v. 74 Md. 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">It will be noticed that the prayer excludes from the consideration of the jury the question of the physical condition and activity of the plaintiff, and also all the facts and circumstances of the case as testified to by the defendant\u2019s witnesses as to the speed of the car, except the two facts that she attempted to alight from the car while it was in motion and before it came to a full stop; and if the jury should find these two segregated facts then the Court was asked to say, <em>as matter of law, </em>there was such negligence on the part of the plaintiff as would preclude her right to recover, without regard to the other facts of the case. We are of opinion that the question of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff was - properly lef to the jury to determine under the instructions granted by the Court upon all of the facts and circumstances of the case, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>that under the authority of the cases cited the prayer was properly refused.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b317-7\">(Decided December 6th, 1905.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Finding no error in the ruling of the Court, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, the appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
