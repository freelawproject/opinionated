Kenneth Gonsalves, a salesperson for the BMW dealership, was a passenger in the vehicle. Gonsalves sued, alleging that Li<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> drove recklessly during the test drive, causing the accident, and that Gonsalves suffered significant back injuries as a result. A jury found that Li was negligent and Gonsalves was not comparatively negligent, and awarded Gonsalves more than $1.2 million in damages. Li argues the trial court committed numerous evidentiary errors and failed to adequately investigate juror misconduct. He further argues that Gonsalves\u2019s trial counsel committed multiple acts of misconduct. We conclude the trial court erred in admission of certain evidence and find that Gonsalves\u2019s counsel committed misconduct in at least two instances. We conclude that the cumulative prejudice from these errors requires the verdict be set aside and the matter be remanded for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">\n<em>Undisputed Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-7\">On December 28, 2008, Gonsalves assisted potential customers Xiaoming and Li at a BMW dealership in Concord. Gonsalves accompanied them on test drives of a BMW 335 and of a more powerful car, a BMW M3. Xiaoming drove the first half of the M3 test drive and Li drove the second half. During the M3 test drive, Li exited the highway to return to the dealership, but then pressed an \u201cM button\u201d in the car and returned to the highway. He lost control of the vehicle in the curve of the on-ramp. The car\u2019s rear wheels lost traction and the car hit the guardrail, turning to face oncoming traffic. None of the airbags deployed and there were no skid marks. Accident reconstruction experts for both parties agreed that the M3 was traveling about 25 miles an hour when it entered the curve of the on-ramp, and then accelerated. California Highway Patrol officers interviewed the parties shortly after the accident. Gonsalves reported that the driver had accelerated in a turn, spun the vehicle out, and hit the guardrail. Li reported that, after he exited the highway, Gonsalves told him about the functions of the M button; Li pushed the M button and returned to the highway; and the accident occurred as he accelerated in the curve of the on-ramp.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1409\">*1409</page-number>\n<em>Gonsalves\u2019s Version</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">Gonsalves testified that when Li and Xiaoming arrived at the dealership they expressed interest in test driving both the 335 and M3, but Gonsalves persuaded them to test drive the less powerful 335. Only Xiaoming drove the 335. When Xiaoming asked if he could test drive the M3, Gonsalves told him the dealership typically only allows \u201cconfirmation test drives\u201d of the M3\u2014 i.e., test drives after an agreement on price and confirmation of a customer\u2019s ability to pay \u2014 because purchasers want to buy those cars with no mileage on them. Xiaoming told Gonsalves he lived in Orinda, was wealthy enough to pay cash for the car, and was very interested in buying the car. Because Gonsalves was concerned that he had insulted Xiaoming, he let Xiaoming test drive the M3 without the usual confirmatory paperwork.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">Xiaoming initially drove the M3 and then asked Gonsalves if his son could drive the car. Gonsalves initially said no, but relented after Xiaoming told him Li was a very safe driver who had never received any tickets. When Li got on the highway, he accelerated to 120 miles per hour and began to weave dangerously between cars. Gonsalves repeatedly told Li to slow down. As Li was returning to the dealership, he asked Gonsalves about various buttons on the dashboard, including the M button. Gonsalves told him not to press the M button. Li accelerated to 60 to 80 miles per hour and headed toward the highway on-ramp \u2014 both Xiaoming and Gonsalves told him to slow down\u2014 and sometime before he got on the highway on-ramp, he pressed the M button. He told Gonsalves, \u201cI\u2019m just going to get on the freeway and I\u2019ll get right back off.\u201d As he accelerated into the curve of the on-ramp, he lost control of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-7\">According to medical reports, Gonsalves told doctors that he was injured when a test driver accelerated to 120 miles per hour and ran into a wall. In response to an interrogatory, Gonsalves wrote that the car was going about 80 miles an hour on the on-ramp. In a deposition, Gonsalves said the car was going 50 to 60 miles an hour at the time of the crash. At trial, Gonsalves said he could not estimate the car\u2019s speed in the curve of the on-ramp, but he was sure it was traveling faster than 25 miles an hour. He admitted it was not traveling 80 to 85 miles per hour on the on-ramp. Gonsalves testified that he tried to tell the CHP officers about Li\u2019s dangerous driving on the highway, but the police directed him to describe only what happened during the accident itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-8\">Gonsalves\u2019s expert testified that the accident occurred because of driver error: the driver accelerated and turned the steering wheel in a manner that caused the car to exceed the maximum friction in the roadway. \u201cThis is clearly not a turn where 25 miles an hour is maintained constant through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1410\">*1410</page-number>turn. [f]... [][] It\u2019s 20 or 25 miles an hour starting into the turn and then gunning it and turning the steering wheel hard. That\u2019s what caused the accident.\u201d The expert acknowledged that the M button might have been programmable to disengage the car\u2019s dynamic stability control system, which was designed to automatically direct braking power to wheels that start to slip. He acknowledged that the car might have handled differently with the stability control disengaged and, because it was unknown how the M button was programmed, it would have been imprudent of Gonsalves to suggest that Li press the M button if he did so \u2014 such an act might have contributed to the accident. \u201cIf the driver thinks he\u2019s got more capability than he does, then he may exceed those capabilities.\u201d Gonsalves\u2019s expert nevertheless opined that the accident was caused by driver error regardless of whether the M button had disengaged the stability control system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">\n<em>Li\u2019s and Xiaoming\u2019s Version</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">Xiaoming testified that he went to the BMW dealership because he was interested in purchasing a new car that he would share with Li, who had just finished college and was working in San Francisco. Gonsalves suggested they test drive a 335. He collected driver\u2019s licenses from Xiaoming and Li and, per their agreement, Xiaoming drove the first half of the 335 test drive and Li drove the second half. After the 335 test drive, Gonsalves asked if there was anything they did not like about the car and they said they preferred a stick shift. He suggested they test drive a manual transmission M3. Again, per their agreement, Xiaoming drove the first half of the test drive and Li drove the second half. Xiaoming could tell immediately that the M3 was very different from the 335. When Li took over, he drove about 85 miles per hour and passed some cars but he was not \u201cweaving.\u201d Xiaoming told him to be careful; Gonsalves said nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">Li exited the highway and was about to return to the dealership when Gonsalves said, \u201cOh, do you want to see the full potential of the car? There\u2019s a button. If you press the button, it\u2019s going to change the behavior of the car.\u201d Gonsalves pointed out the M button and said it would cause the car to stiffen and release a lot of power. Because travel had to be at a sufficient speed to feel the difference, Gonsalves advised them to get back on the highway to try it out. Li rapidly accelerated in the curve of the on-ramp, and the car started moving sideways as well as forward. Xiaoming told Li to be careful, but Li \u201cmust have pressed on the brake so hard, [because] then the car was totally out of control. It spun a little bit and hit [the] guardrail.\u201d It happened very quickly. \u201c[T]he car had indeed stiffened substantially . . . once the car was in motion with sufficient speed . . . .\u201d Li similarly testified that pressing the M button somehow changed the car\u2019s performance \u201cso when I made that turn, a turn that I would typically think was a safe speed, the car lost control.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1411\">*1411</page-number>had had no trouble driving the M3 before the button was pushed. Following the accident, Gonsalves calmly and cordially told Xiaoming that the accident occurred because Li was not used to driving a rear-wheel-drive vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">The defense expert opined that pressing the M button affected the way the accident happened. \u201c[T]he Dynamic Stability Control on the vehicle was clearly off when this accident occurred; otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t see the rear of the vehicle spinning out or coming out to the left as it did in this accident.\u201d When the wheels are spinning, the speed of the vehicle does not increase. Thus, the accident was not caused by excessive speed. Instead, \u201cpressing the accelerator caused the rear wheels to spin, which is what caused the vehicle to lose control. That was all caused by the Dynamic Stability Control being turned off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">\n<em>Gonsalves\u2019s Injuries</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">Gonsalves testified that he was thrown around from side to side and back and forth as the car spun. For years after the accident, he suffered from neck and back pain, had a limited range of motion in his neck, and developed numbness and tingling in his upper extremities. When pain medication, physical therapy and epidurals failed to alleviate his symptoms, Gonsalves underwent artificial disk replacement surgery in May 2013, which provided substantial relief. He anticipated having further surgery on another disk in the future. It was disputed at trial whether Gonsalves\u2019s medical problems after the accident were caused by the accident or were normal degenerative problems typical of persons his age.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-8\">In closing argument, plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the jury to award $118,643.86 in past medical expenses, $80,518.80 in future medical expenses, and between $744,993 and $1,495,986 in pain and suffering damages. Defense counsel argued Li had not been negligent and that Gonsalves\u2019s past medical expenses were overstated, future medical expenses were unproven, and noneconomic damages were in the range of $35,000 to $40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-9\">\n<em>Verdict and Motion for New Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-10\">The jury found only Li negligent and awarded Gonsalves $118,642.86 for past medical expenses, $90,000 in future medical expenses, and $1 million in noneconomic damages. The trial court denied Li\u2019s motion for a new trial, and entered judgment against Li for $1,208,642.86.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1412\">*1412</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">A. <em>Evidentiary Errors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">Li argues the trial court made several errors in admitting evidence and allowing examination on certain subjects. With the exception of one issue of statutory interpretation, we review these issues for abuse of discretion. <em>(People v. Foss </em>(2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 113, 124-125 [65 Cal.Rptr.3d 790].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-7\">1. <em>Requests for Admission</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-8\">Li argues the court erred in permitting plaintiff\u2019s counsel to examine Li about his negative responses to Gonsalves\u2019s requests for admission (RFA\u2019s) and admitting those responses in evidence. We agree that this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-9\">a. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-10\">Gonsalves called Li as an adverse witness during his case-in-chief. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel had Li confirm that he prepared responses to Gonsalves\u2019s RFA\u2019s and swore under penalty of perjury that his responses were true. The court instructed the jury: \u201cBefore trial, each party has the right to ask another party to admit in writing that certain matters are true. If the other party admits those matters, you must accept them as true. No further evidence is required to prove them. However, these matters must be considered true only as they apply to the party who admitted they were true. [\u00b6] So prior to the trial during this discovery process, the plaintiff sent the defendant these Requests for Admissions. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel is now asking the witness about those requests. [][] The other side can do the same.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then told the jury that Li was asked to admit that \u201cat the time as you began your turn from Concord Avenue onto Highway 242 northbound on-ramp you were driving too fast for the conditions,\u201d and that Li replied, \u201cResponding party has a lack of information and knowledge to admit this Request for Admission. A reasonable inquiry concerning this matter has been made, and the information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable responding party to admit this matter.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel extensively examined Li on this and similar responses to RFA\u2019s over multiple defense objections.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When Li testified in the defense case-in-chief, plaintiff\u2019s counsel again asked questions in cross-examination about Li\u2019s responses to the RFA\u2019s and elicited Li\u2019s statement, \u201cI stand by my admissions that I signed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1413\">*1413</page-number>Defense counsel made at least nine objections that questions about Li\u2019s denials of the RFA\u2019s were argumentative, that \u201cthese are not exhibits in the case,\u201d and that the questions called for legal opinions or were contention questions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All of the objections were overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">At the conclusion of Li\u2019s testimony, the court admitted in evidence the full sets of the RFA\u2019s and special interrogatories that asked Li to explain any denials to the RFA\u2019s, as well as Li\u2019s responses to both.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defense counsel moved to strike and exclude all testimony regarding Li\u2019s responses to the RFA\u2019s and to admonish the jury to disregard the evidence. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">In closing argument, plaintiff\u2019s counsel urged the jury to consider Li\u2019s failure, in response to the RFA\u2019s, to admit that his pressure on the accelerator was a substantial factor in causing the accident as evidence of his failure to take responsibility for Gonsalves\u2019s injuries. Counsel told the jury, \u201cI encourage you to look at . . . the Requests for Admissions that we sent to Ran Li asking him to admit some very basic facts about this crash. His responses are there as well. Let\u2019s just look at a few of them:\u2022 \u2022 \u2022[][]\u25a0\u25a0\u2022 HD This is a simple question, ladies and gentlemen. \u2018How much did you push on the accelerator.\u2019 [His response] is a bunch of double speak[,] ... a bunch of \u2018I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not taking responsibility and not only am I doing it, I\u2019m doing it in a way that makes no sense.\u2019 [][]\u2022\u2022\u2022 FID \u25a0 [I]t\u2019s been more than four and a half years since this crash, and he will not in any way take any responsibility for it. . . . And that\u2019s why we need to impanel a jury like you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-7\">Posttrial, Li renewed his argument that the examinations were improper in his motion for a new trial; \u201cSuch questions add no facts to the case, deny the defendant representation, and improperly inflame the jury.\u201d The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1414\">*1414</page-number>b. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">Li argues that the discovery statutes do not authorize admission at trial of denials to RFA\u2019s and that the trial court erred in allowing plaintiff\u2019s counsel to examine him about his qualified denials and in admitting the written responses. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\">As a preliminary matter, Gonsalves argues defense counsel implicitly waived any objection to admission of Li\u2019s responses when he stipulated to admission of the written responses at trial. As set forth <em>ante, </em>however, the defense made this stipulation only after the court had overruled its objections to use of the responses during the examinations of Li and after the court appeared unpersuaded by defense counsel\u2019s arguments that the written responses were not admissible evidence. In context, therefore, the stipulation cannot be deemed truly voluntary or an intentional waiver of the objection. (See <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>CertainTeed Corp. </em>(2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 645, 650 [40 Cal.Rptr.3d 501] [\u201c[n]o waiver may be implied where, as here, a party alleging error has made its objection and then acted defensively to lessen the impact of the error\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-7\">Interpretation of the discovery statutes is subject to our de nova review. <em>(People ex rel. Lockyer v. Shamrock Foods Co. </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 415, 432 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 200, 11 P.3d 956].) Li notes that the discovery statutes expressly allow <em>any part of </em>a deposition or interrogatory to be introduced at trial (with certain restrictions not relevant here), whereas the statutes provide only that <em>admissions </em>in response to RFA\u2019s are binding on the party at trial. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 2025.620 [\u201cany <em>part </em>or all of a deposition\u201d (italics added)], 2030.410 <em>[\u201cany </em>answer or part of an answer to an interrogatory\u201d (italics added)], 2033.410, subd. (a) [\u201c[a]ny matter <em>admitted </em>in response to [RFA\u2019s]\u201d (italics added)]; see Wegner et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Trials and Evidence (The Rutter Group 2013) f 8:828, p. 8C-104.3 (rev. # 1, 2011) <em>[\u201c[a\\dmissions </em>made in response to [RFA\u2019s] . . . may be received into evidence at trial\u201d (italics added)].) Li further notes that the statutory scheme provides for monetary sanctions (i.e., reasonable expenses including attorney fees) when a party unreasonably fails to admit a matter in response to RFA\u2019s, but does not expressly permit a denial, objection or failure to respond to RFA\u2019s to be used against the party at trial. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2033.420, subd. (a).) He argues that the statutory scheme therefore implies that the only authorized sanction for an unreasonable failure to admit is a monetary award and a denial cannot be used to impeach a witness at trial. In this case, the court actually <em>denied </em>sanctions for Li\u2019s failure to admit the RFA\u2019s, yet the court allowed Li to be impeached with that same conduct. Gonsalves argues that the statutes are essentially silent on the subject of whether denials or qualified denials are admissible at trial, leaving the admissibility subject to the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1415\">*1415</page-number>Neither Li nor Gonsalves cites authority that we find to be directly on point. Our own research reveals a somewhat surprising paucity of relevant authority. In <em>Morris v. Frudenfeld </em>(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 23 [185 Cal.Rptr. 76] <em>(Morris), </em>the appellant asserted it was error not to permit impeachment of the respondent by showing that certain denials to RFA\u2019s were inconsistent with respondent\u2019s admissions on the witness stand. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 35.) Citing Evidence Code section 352, the trial court declined to permit reading of the denials to the jury on the basis of excessive time consumption. Noting that the record was unclear as to precisely what pretrial denials appellant was attempting to introduce, the reviewing court held that such a ruling was within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>(Morris, </em>at pp. 35-36.) While perhaps implicitly suggesting that admission at trial of denials to RFA\u2019s is committed to the trial court\u2019s discretion and not precluded by statute, the case does not so hold. The issue presented in <em>Morris </em>was whether the court could properly exclude an allegedly inconsistent prior statement. Gonsalves does not allege any inconsistency between the discovery responses and trial testimony. In fact, he argued to the jury that they should draw adverse inferences from the fact that Li <em>continued </em>to deny the request, consistent with his earlier responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">Li analogizes the examinations by plaintiff\u2019s counsel to asking a witness to explain the basis of his legal contentions, conduct condemned in <em>Rifkind v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1255 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 822] <em>(Rifkind). </em>In <em>Rifkind, </em>the witness was asked at deposition to state with respect to each of his affirmative defenses: \u201call facts that support the affirmative defense\u201d; \u201cthe identity of each witness who has knowledge of any facts supporting the affirmative defense\u201d; and the identity of \u201cany documents that pertain to the facts or witnesses.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1257-1258.) The Court of Appeal condemned the practice, which it referred to as asking \u201clegal contention questions,\u201d but held the same questions could properly be asked in interrogatories. (I<em>d. </em>at pp. 1256, 1260.) The distinction between these discovery devices is that \u201c \u2018the client presumably knows the facts (although not always), but he can hardly be expected to know their legal consequences. This is what lawyers are for. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1260.) \u201c[L]egal contention questions require the party interrogated to make a \u2018law-to-fact application that is beyond the competence of most lay persons.\u2019 [Citation.] Even if such questions may be characterized as not calling for a legal opinion [citation], or as presenting a mixed question of law and fact [citation], their basic vice when used at a deposition is that they are unfair. They call upon the deponent to sort out the factual material in the case according to specific legal contentions, and to do this by memory and on the spot.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1262.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">While not directly on point, we agree that the underlying concerns discussed in <em>Rifkind </em>apply to the use of qualified denials to RFA\u2019s in the examinations here. Li was asked to explain \u201cby memory and on the spot\u201d and without the ability to consult with his attorney why he took the legal position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1416\">*1416</page-number>that he could not admit or deny certain RFA\u2019s without further inquiry. And he was asked to do this not in a deposition, as in <em>Rifkind, </em>but in front of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">The weight of authority in other jurisdictions also favors Li\u2019s position. Massachusetts\u2019s highest court interpreted a statutory scheme similar to California\u2019s<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and concluded that denials to RFA\u2019s are not admissible evidence at trial: \u201cThe purpose of [RFA\u2019s] is to narrow the issues for trial by \u2018identifying those issues and facts as to which proof will be necessary.\u2019 [Citation.] A denial ... is not a statement of fact; it simply indicates that the responding party is not willing to concede the issue and, as a result, the requesting party must prove the fact at trial.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] [Citations]. The sanction for improperly responding to [RFA\u2019s] is the shifting of the award of incurred expenses[ \u2014 see rule 36(a) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure], [][] Further, [Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 36(b)], which governs [RFA\u2019s], does not specifically provide for the admission of denials in evidence. Although the rule states that admissions are conclusively binding on the responding party, it makes no parallel provision for the use of a denial. By contrast, [Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 33(b)], governing interrogatories, states that the answers to interrogatories \u2018may be used [at trial] to the extent permitted by the rules of evidence.\u2019 The omission of a similar provision in rule 36(b) indicates that, although admissions have binding effect, denials do not have such an effect and cannot be introduced in evidence.\u201d <em>(Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority </em>(2002) 437 Mass. 396 [772 N.E.2d 552, 567], final brackets in original.) Therefore, the trial court \u201cincorrectly concluded that a denial of a request for admission is admissible as a prior inconsistent statement\u201d to impeach a witness at trial. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">Intermediate appellate courts in at least three states have similarly held that denials of RFA\u2019s are inadmissible at trial. (See <em>Winn Dixie Stores, Inc. v. Gerringer </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1990) 563 So.2d 814, 817 [citing <em>Morris, supra, </em>135 Cal.App.3d 23 for the proposition that \u201cdenials cannot be used for impeachment purposes\u201d]; <em>Mahan v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co. </em>(Mo.Ct.App. 1988) 760 S.W.2d 510, 515 [\u201cthe propriety of defendant\u2019s denials is for the court to decide, not the jury\u201d]; <em>American Communications </em>v. <em>Commerce North Bank </em>(Tex.App. 1985) 691 S.W.2d 44, 48 [\u201c[w]hen an answering party denies or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1417\">*1417</page-number>refuses to make an admission of fact, such refusal is nothing more than a refusal to admit a fact\u201d].) In most cases the use of denials of RFA\u2019s to impeach a witness at trial \u201cis nothing more than an attack on the \u2018character\u2019 of the defendant and that issue [i]s not before the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Mahan v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co., </em>at p. 515.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">Perhaps recognizing the lack of any inconsistency between Li\u2019s responses to the RFA\u2019s and his trial testimony, Gonsalves suggests that the responses were admissible to impeach Li\u2019s credibility by showing \u201c[h]is attitude toward the action in which he testifies.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 780, subd. (j).) Gonsalves cites no cases that support his interpretation of this section of the Evidence Code. Section 780 has been held applicable to a witness\u2019s reluctance to testify or fear of retaliation for testifying <em>(People v. Merriman </em>(2014) 60 Cal.4th 1, 84 [177 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 332 P.3d 1187]; <em>People v. Mendoza </em>(2011) 52 Cal.4th 1056, 1084 [132 Cal.Rptr.3d 808, 263 P.3d 1]) or a witness\u2019s desire for revenge against the defendant <em>(People v. Stewart </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 967, 976-977 [193 Cal.Rptr. 799]). As Li points out, courts have held in other contexts that litigation conduct is not relevant evidence at trial in the ordinary case. <em>(Palmer v. Ted Stevens Honda, Inc., supra, </em>193 Cal.App.3d at p. 539 [\u201c[o]ne significant defect in such evidence is that it holds the client responsible for the attorney\u2019s litigation strategy\u201d].) <em>White, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d 870, which allows such evidence in a bad faith case, has been criticized as unfairly compromising a defendant\u2019s right to defend himself. (See <em>California Physicians\u2019 Service v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1321, 1327-1329 &amp; fn. 5 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 95].) We find no support for Gonsalves\u2019s attempt to make a party\u2019s litigation conduct a legitimate subject for inquiry under Evidence Code section 780, subdivision (j), absent truly exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">We are persuaded, therefore, that denials of RFA\u2019s are not admissible evidence in an ordinary case, i.e., a case where a party\u2019s litigation conduct is not directly in issue. Thus, the trial court permitted examination of Li that was unfair and prejudicial to him, and erred in admitting those responses in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1418\">*1418</page-number>2.-5.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">B.-D.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1208-6\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-7\">The judgment is vacated and the matter is remanded to the trial court for a new trial. Gonsalves shall bear Li\u2019s costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-8\">Jones, P. J., and Needham, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-9\">Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 25, 2015, S224545.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1198-8\"> The original complaint named both Gonsalves and his wife as plaintiffs and both Li and his father, Xiaoming Li (hereafter Xiaoming; no disrespect intended), as defendants. Gonsalves\u2019s wife was dismissed as a plaintiff at her request. Xiaoming apparently also was dismissed as a defendant midtrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1202-12\"> In this case, however, counsel examined Li not about his admissions, but about his failure to make admissions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1202-13\"> Excerpts of the examination are set forth in an appendix to this opinion (see appen., <em>post, </em>at pp. 1419-1420).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1203-8\"> Defense counsel further insisted that \u201c[A]ll of these questions violated defendants\u2019 motion in limine number 3. That motion prohibited any questioning concerning whether or not the defendant takes responsibility for the accident or took responsibility during litigation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1203-9\"> Defense counsel initially objected to admitting the written responses to the RFA\u2019s in evidence. He contended that if responses were admitted, Li\u2019s explanations for those responses should also be admitted. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel suggested admitting all of the RFA\u2019s, responses and the corresponding special interrogatories and responses. Defense counsel asked the court to admit a single form interrogatory propounded by Li and Gonsalves\u2019s response, and plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked that it be presented in context with all of the other form interrogatories and responses. Defense counsel then said, \u201cI could compromise, Your Honor. It looks like they are putting in all the admissions. If they put in all the admissions . . . and our explanation^], I don\u2019t mind if they all come in. That\u2019s not really my biggest problem with the admissions. It was questioning [Li] on it.\u201d The court admitted the full set of RFA\u2019s, the redacted responses, the special interrogatories, and responses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1206-7\"> Compare Code Civil Procedure sections 2030.410 (use of interrogatories), 2033.410 (effect of admissions), 2033.420 (sanctions) with Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure, rules 33(b), 36(b), 37(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1206-8\"> The California Supreme Court has expressed a similar view of the purpose of RFA\u2019s: \u201cMost of the other discovery procedures are aimed primarily at assisting counsel to prepare for trial. [RFA\u2019s], on the other hand, are primarily aimed at setting at rest a triable issue so that it will not have to be tried.\u201d <em>(Cembrook </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 423, 429 [15 Cal.Rptr. 127, 364 P.2d 303]; see <em>St. Mary </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 775 [167 Cal.Rptr.3d 517].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1207-7\"> At least one court has held that such refusal may be relevant evidence of bad faith at trial in bad faith insurance cases. <em>(Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Owens </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1990) 573 So.2d 343, 344; see <em>White </em>v. <em>Western Title Ins.

Hixson </em>(2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 256, 297 [147 Cal.Rptr.3d 88].) However, the court expressly distinguished non-bad-faith cases, where the party\u2019s litigation conduct is not directly relevant to an issue before the jury. <em>(Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>at p. 344 [distinguishing <em>Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. v. Gerringer, supra, </em>563 So.2d 814].) This distinction is consonant with California law. (See <em>Palmer v.
