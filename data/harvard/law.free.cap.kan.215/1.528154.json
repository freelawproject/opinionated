S. A. 21-419 as being a lesser included offense of murder in the first degree. In assigning this as a ground for reversal this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>was in error; the jury was instructed as to fourth degree manslaughter as defined by K. S. A. 21-419. Consequently, the opinion is modified by deleting all reference to failure to instruct on fourth degree manslaughter under K. S. A. 21-419, and Syllabus 7 is corrected to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">7. The evidence is examined in an action wherein the defendant was convicted of murder in the second degree and for reasons appearing in the opinion it is <em>held </em>the trial court erred (1) in failing to instruct on the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree as defined in K. S. A. 21-411 and (2) in improperly instructing the jury as to the purposes for which a prior crime could be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">In other respects the opinion is confirmed and the motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
