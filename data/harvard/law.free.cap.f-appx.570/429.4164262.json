In his lawsuit, Calloway alleges that he was subject to unlawful discrimination based on his race and age, leading to his eventual termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-24\">On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the district court dismissed Calloway\u2019s claims for age discrimination and hostile work environment, as well as his claims against the individual defendants. The district court held that Calloway\u2019s complaint failed to allege that his age motivated an adverse employment decision, and failed to allege that he was treated less favorably than a similarly situated younger employee. It also held that Calloway failed to allege a hostile work environment claim separate and apart from his retaliation claim. Finally, the district court held that the suit could not be maintained against the individual employees of the Texas Health <em>&amp; </em>Human Services Commission (\u201cHHSC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-25\">On HHSC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the district court dismissed Callo-way\u2019s remaining claims. As to the remaining race discrimination claim, the district court concluded that because Calloway presented no direct evidence of discrimination, he had to proceed through the circumstantial evidence <em>McDonnell-Doug</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>las<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> framework.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It held that Calloway failed to establish all four elements of the <em>prima facie </em>case; specifically, the district court concluded that Calloway failed to show that he was treated differently than similarly situated employees outside of his protected class. Moreover, the district court held that even if Calloway established the <em>prima facie </em>case, he failed to demonstrate that HHSC\u2019s non-discriminatory reason for terminating him was pre-textual.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u25a0 Likewise, as to Calloway\u2019s retaliation claim, the district court held that he failed to establish any causal connection between his protected activity, here an internal EEOC complaint, and the adverse employment action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court dismissed these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">On appeal, Calloway argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claims. On <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal and grant of summary judgment to defendants, we AFFIRM for essentially the same reasons given by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
