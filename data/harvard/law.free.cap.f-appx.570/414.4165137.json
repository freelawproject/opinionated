Hudson, </em>422 Fed.Appx. 343 (5th Cir.2011) (direct appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-21\">On this record, Hudson cannot carry his heavy burden of showing that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors in failing to object to the simultaneous application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.2 and 4Bl.l(b), the district court would have imposed a more lenient sentence. <em>See Lafler v. Cooper, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 132 S.Ct. 1376, 1384, 182 L.Ed.2d 398 (2012); <em>United States v. Wines, </em>691 F.3d 599, 604 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-24\">Hudson\u2019s conclusional argument, related to counsel\u2019s failure to object to the attribution to Hudson of relevant conduct in the determination of the drug quantity at sentencing, fails to demonstrate any error by the district court. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>United States v. Rhine, </em>583 F.3d 878, 885-89 (5th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-25\">Because our review is limited to issues for which a certificate of appealability has been granted, other uncertified issues raised by Hudson have not been consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>ered. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances\u2019set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
