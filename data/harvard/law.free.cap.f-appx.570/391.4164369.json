He appeals from the denial of his \u201cMotion to Determine the Applicability of the Fair Sentencing Act,\u201d in which he sought clarification as to the district court\u2019s determination of drug quantity for purposes of application of the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) to his case. In the motion, Fulton indicated that he intended to file an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on the FSA in the future; however, he expressly stated his filing was not a motion for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The district court determined that Fulton\u2019s motion was seeking legal advice or strategy, and it denied the motion on the grounds that it did not present a justicia-ble controversy. We \u201cmay affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any basis supported by the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Chacon, </em>742 F.3d 219, 220 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In his pro se appellate brief, Fulton argues that issues related to the possibility of a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) were not moot because the district court had the authority to sua sponte grant such relief. He asserts that there is a justicia-ble controversy as to the \u201claw-of-the-case\u201d regarding the drug quantity that will be used to determine his eligibility for relief. He also contends that a justiciable controversy exists because the FSA is retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Section 3582(e)(2) does not require the district court to consider a sentence reduction on its own motion, nor is the district court required to determine the applicable drug quantity under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) prior to the filing of a motion for a reduction of sentence. In view of the foregoing, Fulton \u201cfiled an unauthorized motion which the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain. Thus, he has appealed from the denial of a meaningless, unauthorized motion.\u201d <em>United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b413-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
