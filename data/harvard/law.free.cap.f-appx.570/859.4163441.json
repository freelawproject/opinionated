Membrides appeals his conviction for one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and he appeals his 84-month sentence. Mem-brides argues that the district court erred by (1) granting a two-level downward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3 E 1.1(a) while allowing the government to withhold a motion for an additional one-point reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b); (2) assigning him an enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1; and (3) denying his motion to suppress. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">We review the denial of an acceptanee-of-responsibility reduction for clear error. <em>United States v. Knight, </em>562 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s finding is entitled to great deference on review, and should not be disturbed unless it lacks foundation. <em>Id. </em>A factual finding is clearly erroneous when, after reviewing the entire evidence, the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1195 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">A defendant is entitled to a one-level reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(b), if, among other conditions, the government files a motion \u201cstating that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the government and the court to allocate their resources efficiently.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). Section 3El.l(b) was recently amended to require a government motion. Amendment 775 to \u00a7 3El.l(b) provides that \u201c[t]he government should not withhold [a \u00a7 3El.l(b) motion] based on interests not identified in \u00a7 3E1.1, such as whether the defendant agrees to waive his or her right to appeal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E 1.1(b) cmt. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">Here, the district court did not clearly err when it did not award Mem-brides a third reduction point under \u00a7 3El.l(b). Membrides was sentenced on December 10, 2013, and therefore the 2013 Guidelines, with Amendment 775, apply. <em>United States v. Jerchower, </em>631 F.3d 1181, 1184 (11th Cir.2011). Although the Amendment arguably may allow for judicial review of the government\u2019s refusal to make a \u00a7 3El.l(b) motion, we have not yet decided under what circumstances, if any, the district court may review the government\u2019s decision not to file such a motion. Regardless, however, Membrides\u2019s argument fails. While Membrides indicated his intention to plead guilty early on, he stated that he would do so only <em>if </em>he lost his suppression motion. Thus, late in the game, the government had to fully prepare for a two-day suppression hearing. That preparation included preparing law enforcement witnesses to testify about facts similar to those they would testify about at a trial and defeated the purpose of \u00a7 3El.l(b)\u2019s incentive to plead early. By conditioning his guilty plea on the outcome of the suppression hearing, Membrides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>forced the government and the district court to allocate resources they would not have been required to allocate if Mem-brides had pleaded guilty outright. This is one of the considerations identified in \u00a7 3E1.1, thus even if the Amendment created judicial review, the district court did not clearly err. In similar circumstances before \u00a7 3E1.1 was amended, we upheld withholding the one-point reduction when a guilty plea was made on the eve of trial following denial of a motion to suppress, after the government began trial preparation. <em>See United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371, 1373-74 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008). That holding remains appropriate despite the Amendment and Membrides therefore cannot benefit from the fact that he pleaded as soon as was practicable give his trial strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s application of an obstruction-of-justice enhancement, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its applications of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Doe, </em>661 F.3d 550, 565 (11th Cir.2011). Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, a defendant\u2019s offense level will be increased by two levels if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_X_\">(1) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (2) the obstructive conduct related to (A) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (B) a closely related offense....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. An example of conduct deemed \u201cobstructive\u201d under \u00a7 3C1.1 is directly or indirectly attempting to threaten or intimidate a codefendant or witness. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. 4(A). The defendant need not be successful in his attempt to impede or obstruct the administration of justice in order for the enhancement to apply. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>88 F.3d 938, 943-44 (11th Cir.1996). A district court applying the obstruction-of-justice enhancement must identify what the defendant did, why that conduct warranted the enhancement, and how that conduct hindered either the investigation or prosecution of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 944. However, even where a district court fails to make such individualized findings, a remand is unnecessary if the record clearly reflects and supports the basis for the enhancement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">The district court did not clearly err in applying a \u00a7 3 C 1.1 enhancement to Membrides. During pretrial detention Membrides attempted to orchestrate a social media barrage to threaten or intimidate a witness in this case. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. 4(A). He made numerous calls to his mother and other associates instructing them to \u201cexpose\u201d the witness as a snitch. During one phone call, for example, Mem-brides told an associate that the witness \u201cwill be testifying in court, so I can\u2019t even take my case to trial.\u201d And later, that the witness \u201cwas talking about things he shouldn\u2019t be talking about.\u201d In another jailhouse phone call, Membrides instructed his mother to post all the discovery information online: \u201cPut that s \u2014 on my Face-book,\u201d and \u201cPut that s \u2014 as a picture.\u201d Membrides also called an unidentified male and told him, \u201cIf they don\u2019t drop my charge for the illegal search and seizure, guess what, I\u2019m pleading guilty.\u201d The male informed Membrides, \u201cI put the word out about this f \u2014 n\u2014dawg that\u2019s running his lip,\u201d and \u201cEverybody\u2019s going to find out about this.\u201d Membrides replied, \u201cOh, I\u2019m glad. Expose him.\u201d The male said, \u201cI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>wanna get some of those papers you were talking about.\u201d Membrides told him, \u201cI need to get it from the counselor,\u201d and then, \u201cI\u2019ll get it for you. Instagram that s \u2014 .\u201d The male replied, \u201cFacebook. Everything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">The court further stated that it could not ignore \u201cthat [Membrides] is documented as a gang member and that social media would be a way of getting the message out.\u201d Based on the court\u2019s statements and the fact that the record reflects that Mem-brides referred to the witness as a \u201csnitch,\u201d encouraged his friends and mother to post as much on social media to \u201cexpose\u201d the witness, and wanted his friends to post on social media copies of documents he obtained during discovery that show the witness was cooperating with the government, the enhancement for obstruction of justice was not applied in error. <em>See Taylor, </em>88 F.3d at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">We review de novo whether a defendant\u2019s guilty plea caused him to waive his right to appeal the denial of a motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Patti, </em>337 F.3d 1317, 1320 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003). Generally, a defendant\u2019s unconditional plea of guilty, made knowingly, voluntarily, and with the benefit of competent counsel, waives all non jurisdictional defects in that defendant\u2019s court proceedings. <em>United States v. Pierre, </em>120 F.3d 1153, 1155 (11th Cir.1997). A district court\u2019s refusal to suppress evidence is non jurisdictional and is waived by a guilty plea. <em>United States v. McCoy, </em>477 F.2d 550, 551 (5th Cir.1973) (per curiam).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A defendant can preserve appellate review of a non jurisdictional defect while at the same time pleading guilty by entering a \u201cconditional plea\u201d pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(a)(2), \u201creserving in writing the right to have an appellate court review an adverse determination of a specified pretrial motion.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2); <em>see also Pierre, </em>120 F.3d at 1155.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Membrides waived appellate review of the denial of his motion to suppress because his unconditional plea of guilty was made knowingly, voluntarily, and with the benefit of competent counsel. Additionally, the district court\u2019s refusal to suppress evidence is non jurisdictional. <em>See McCoy, </em>477 F.2d at 551. Membrides argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Menna v. New York, </em>423 U.S. 61, 96 S.Ct. 241, 46 L.Ed.2d 195 (1975) (per curiam), a double jeopardy challenge, allows an exception to the general rule that a non-conditional guilty plea waives all non jurisdictional grounds for appeal. We have not applied Menna\u2019s exception to a defendant\u2019s appeal of a denial of a motion to suppress after pleading guilty, nor have we suggested that <em>Menna </em>should be applied as broadly as Membrides argues. Rather, this court has explained that <em>Menna </em>provides for such an exception \u201cwhen a charge against a defendant, judged on the basis of the record that existed at the time the guilty plea was entered, is one the State may not constitutionally prosecute.\u201d <em>United States v. Kaiser, </em>893 F.2d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir.1990). Membrides\u2019s motion to suppress does not fall within this category.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-11\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of die former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
