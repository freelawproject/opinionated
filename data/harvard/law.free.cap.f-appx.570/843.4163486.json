The presentence report (\u201cPSI\u201d) prepared by the District Court\u2019s Probation Office determined the offense level for the crime under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1 and 2D1.2. Because the offense involved the sale of 87.72 ounces of crack cocaine, the PSI <em>fixed </em>the base offense level at 32, under U.S.S.G. 2D.1, added 2 levels, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2(a), because the offense occurred near a protected area, for total offense level of 34, then adjusted that level downward, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b) to 31, for acceptance of responsibility. PSI at \u00b6 28. Coupled with a criminal history category VI, level 31 yielded a Guidelines sentence range of 188 to 235 months imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">On March 23, 2004, the District Court adjudicated Moreland guilty of the offense, adopted the PSI\u2019s Guidelines range, found that Moreland was a career offender under U.S.S.G. 4B1.1,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, noting that his career offender status did not affect the Guidelines range calculation under \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1 and 2D1.2, Doc. 71, at 55, sentenced Moreland to a prison term of 188 months, at the low end of the Guidelines range. <em>Id., </em>at 58-59, 61. Moreland did not appeal his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">On October 17, 2008, Moreland, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>moved the District Court to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) based on Amendment 706 of the Sentencing Guidelines, a retroactive amendment that reduced the drug-quantity thresholds and base offense levels for certain crack offenses. Moreland acknowledged that he was a career offender, but argued that he had been sentenced not as a career offender but pursuant to a Guidelines range fixed by U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 21D1.1 and 2D1.2 for his drug offense and that the court should adjust the Guidelines range based on those two sections and reduce his sentence under Amendment 706. The District Court, stating, \u201c[h]ad the Defendant been sentenced after the effective date of the amendment to the crack cocaine guideline, the amendment would have had no effect on his sentence,\u201d Doc. 64, at 3, concluded that Amendment 706 did not affect Moreland\u2019s sentence because he was a career offender and denied his \u00a7 3582(c) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-14\">Moreland, having obtained counsel, appealed the District Court\u2019s decision. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>355 Fed.Appx. 376, 2009 WL 4598278 (C.A.ll (Fla.)). He presented the same arguments he presented to the District Court. <em>Id. </em>at 1-2. In response, we stated that the District Court\u2019s first task, under the two-step process followed in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c) motion, was to \u201cdetermine Moreland\u2019s new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>base offense level under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)\u201d[the Drug Quantity Table], and then compare it to his career offender base offense level under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) to determine which was higher. <em>Id. </em>at 2. We then said this, concluding that Amendment 706 provided Moreland no relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-5\">Amendment 706 reduced Moreland\u2019s drug quantity base offense level from 34 to 32. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706. Nevertheless, because 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 860(a) carry a statutory maximum sentence of 80 years\u2019 imprisonment, Moreland\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) remained at 34. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), 860(a); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Therefore, Amendment 706 did not have the effect of reducing Moreland\u2019s sentencing range. This approach is consistent with the policy statement in \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l), which directs the court to \u201cdetermine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) ... had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). As a result, the district court did not err in denying Moreland\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 2-3. In short, we held that More-land\u2019s criminal offender status under \u00a7 4B1.1 controlled the District Court\u2019s disposition of his \u00a7 3582(c) motion for sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">On June 6, 2013, Morehead again moved the District Court <em>pro se </em>to reduce his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c), this time based on Amendment 750, a second retroactive amendment to U.S.S.G. 2Dl.l(c) that reduced the drug-quantity thresholds and base offense levels for certain crack offenses. And once again the District Court denied his motion, concluding that his career offender status precluded Amendment 750, like Amendment 706, from lowering the Guidelines range in his case. Now, having obtained counsel, he appeals that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">In his first \u00a7 3582(c) proceeding, More-land litigated the question of whether he was sentenced as a career offender and thus precluded from \u00a7 3582(c) relief. He did not prevail, so now the question is whether the doctrine of issue preclusion has settled the career offender issue once and for all for Moreland.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-11\">Issue preclusion \u201cbars \u2018successive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment,\u2019 even if the issue recurs in the context of a different claim.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Sturgell, </em>553 U.S. 880, 892, 128 S.Ct. 2161, 2171, 171 L.Ed.2d 155 (2008) (quoting <em>New Hampshire v. Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 748-49, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001)). This serves \u201cthe dual purpose of protecting litigants from the burden of relitigating an identical issue with the same party or his privy and of promoting judicial economy by preventing needless litigation.\u201d <em>CSX Transp., Inc. v. Bhd. of Maint. of Way Emps., </em>327 F.3d 1309, 1317 (11th Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 326, 99 S.Ct. 645, 649, 58 L.Ed.2d 552 (1979)). We apply issue preclusion when (1) the issue at stake is identical to the one involved in the prior litigation; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior suit; (3) the determination of the issue in the prior litigation was a critical and necessary part of the judgment in that action; and (4) the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the earlier proceeding. <em>See CSX Transp., </em>327 F.3d at 1317.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-12\"><em>Miller\u2019s Ale House, Inc. v. Boynton Carolina Ale House, LLC, </em>702 F.3d 1312, 1318 (11th Cir.2012). It seems clear to us that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>all four factors are present here. As such, the question is settled: Moreland was sentenced as a career offender and thus is not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Moreland nonetheless argues that, even if he remains a career offender, <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), abrogated our holding in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), that a career offender is not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. We disagree. In <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir. 2012), we held that <em>Freeman </em>did not overrule or abrogate our holding in <em>Moore. </em>As <em>Lawson </em>remains good law, we are bound to follow it. <em>See United States v. Kaley, </em>579 F.3d 1246, 1255 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that we are bound by the holding of a prior opinion unless that holding is overruled by the Court sitting <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-10\">.
