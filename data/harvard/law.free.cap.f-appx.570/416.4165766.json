In his complaint, Minnick alleged that Britney Lane and Evette Alexander of the Hays County District Clerk\u2019s Office violated his First Amendment right of access to the courts and his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection by delaying for a week service of process in a civil case which he had filed in that district. Minnick also raised state law claims. The district court dismissed the federal claims with prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and dismissed the state law claims without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Minnick challenges the district court\u2019s certification, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 24(a), that any appeal would not be taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.Sd 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Contrary to Minnick\u2019s assertion, the district court properly considered his claims under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). <em>See Newsome v. E.E.O.C., </em>301 F.3d 227, 231-33 (5th Cir. 2002). While an individual\u2019s right of access to the courts is protected under the Constitution from unlawful interference by the state, Minnick must still show prejudice to his position as a litigant from the alleged denial of access. <em>See Eason v. Thaler, </em>73 F.3d 1322, 1328 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Ryland v. Shapiro, </em>708 F.2d 967, 972 (5th Cir.1983). Because he has failed to allege such prejudice, he has failed to show that his \u201cappeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Minnick does not challenge the district court\u2019s analysis or rejection of his equal protection claim, or its dismissal without prejudice of his state law claims, and has, therefore, abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s certification as to these issues. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Because Minnick has not shown that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal, his motion to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(a); <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cm. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
