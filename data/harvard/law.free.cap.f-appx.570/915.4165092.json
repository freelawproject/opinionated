Herrera-Lopez challenges the district court\u2019s application of a 16-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) for his illegal re-entry into the United States after being removed following a sexual-battery conviction under Florida state law. Herrera-Lopez argues that, because his offense under \u00a7 794.011(4)(e), Florida Statutes, did not require physical force, it should not be classified as a \u201cforcible sex offense[ ]\u201d under '\u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s commentary, and, thus, it does not automatically qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d He adds that interpreting \u201cforcible sex offenses\u201d to include all non-consensual illicit conduct renders the commentary\u2019s enumerated \u201cstatutory rape\u201d category superfluous. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm Herrera-Lopez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-16\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a 16-level increase in the offense level if a defendant previously was removed from the United States following a conviction for a felony that is a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). \u201cCrime of violence\u201d is explicitly defined in \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>Application Note l(B)(iii) to include several enumerated offenses, including federal, state, or local \u201cforcible sex offenses.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. l(B)(iii)). A parenthetical reference in the commentary immediately following that term describes it as \u201c(including where consent to the conduct is not given or is not legally valid, such as where consent to the conduct is ... incompetent ...).\u201d <em>Id. </em>In 2008, Amendment 722 to the Sentencing Guidelines clarified this language was inserted to expressly include within the enumerated \u201cforcible sex offenses\u201d category, contrary to some circuits\u2019 holdings, sex offenses involving legally invalid consent. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amendment 722, Reason for Amendment. The Sentencing Commission further stated that \u201c[t]he amendment makes clear that forcible sex offenses, like all offenses enumerated in Application Note l(B)(iii), are always classified as \u2018crimes of violence,\u2019 regardless of whether the prior offense expressly has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The \u00a7 2L1.2 commentary is \u201cauthoritative,\u201d and we are bound by it unless it violates federal law or is otherwise inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, the corresponding guideline provision. <em>United States v. Contreras, </em>739 F.3d 592, 594 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">We have held a felony conviction qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2 if the defendant was convicted under any offense enumerated in its commentary. <em>Id. </em>at 595. The label a state attaches to an offense is not conclusive as to whether it qualifies as an enumerated offense under \u00a7 2L1.2, and we must determine if the conviction offense is equivalent to the generic definition of the crime enumerated in the commentary. <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2010). In doing so, we ordinarily employ a categorical approach, and, to that end, evaluate only the judgment of conviction and the conviction offense\u2019s statutory definition. <em>Id. </em>at 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">The Florida statutory offense listed- in Herrera-Lopez\u2019s judgment prohibits a person from \u201ccommitting] sexual battery upon a person 12 years of age or older without that person\u2019s consent\u201d under a variety of aggravating circumstances. \u00a7 794.011(4), Fla. Stat. The subsection listed in his judgment prohibits the conduct, \u201cwhen the victim is mentally defective and the offender has reason to believe this or has actual knowledge of this fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 794.011(4)(e). \u201cMentally defective\u201d is defined as \u201ca mental disease or defect which renders a person temporarily or permanently incapable of appraising the nature of his or her conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 794.01l(l)(b). \u201cSexual battery\u201d is defined to include \u201cunion\u201d with the sexual organ of another. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 794.011(l)(h). The Florida standard jury instructions for sexual battery explicitly state that \u201cunion\u201d means contact. <em>See </em>Fla. Std. Jury Instr. (Crim.) 11.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">In <em>Contreras, </em>we interpreted \u00a7 794.011(5), which applies only to sexual battery that \u201cdoes not use physical force and violence likely to cause serious personal injury.\u201d \u00a7 794.011(5), Fla. Stat.; <em>Contreras, </em>739 F.3d at 595. We concluded the offense qualified as a forcible sex offense under Application Note l(B)(iii), and, thus, as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>Contreras, </em>739 F.3d at 598. In so doing, we reasoned that any non-consensual sexual contact, including unlawful \u201cunion,\u201d was expressly included within Application Note l(B)(iii)\u2019s \u201cforcible sex offense[ ]\u201d category by virtue of its parenthetical language describing forcible sex offenses to include conduct \u201cwhere consent ... is not given.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594-98. The Florida Legislature has expressly indicated that \u00a7 794.011(5) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>\u201cthe least serious sexual battery offense\u201d in the Florida sexual-battery statute and is \u201cnecessarily included\u201d in all offenses listed in \u00a7 794.011(4), including \u00a7 794.011(4)(e). \u00a7 794.005, Fla. Stat.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">The district court did not err in applying a 16-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Section 2L1.2\u2019s commentary explicitly describes enumerated \u201cforcible sex offenses\u201d to include those like Herrera-Lopez\u2019s, where consent to the conduct was legally invalid. Because his conviction meets this express criterion, it automatically qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-10\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a prior conviction qualifies as a \"crime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v.
