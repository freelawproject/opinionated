He argues that the sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">We review Lira Flores\u2019s challenge to his sentence under an abuse of discretion standard, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009). Because the sentence was within the advisory guidelines imprisonment range, we afford the sentence a presumption of substantive reasonableness. <em>United States v. Tuma, </em>738 F.3d 681, 695 (5th Cir.2013). Lira Flores asserts that the sentence imposed was greater than necessary because the illegal-reentry guideline lacks an empirical basis, his criminal history was effectively double-counted, his crime of conviction was a type of international trespass, and the guidelines range failed to reflect his personal history and circumstances. He has not made the showing necessary to overcome the presumption of reasonableness afforded his sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). The record reflects that the district court considered Lira Flores\u2019s mitigation arguments and ultimately concluded that a sentence at the top of the applicable guidelines range was appropriate based on the circumstances of the case and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The fact that we might reasonably conclude \u201cthat a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
