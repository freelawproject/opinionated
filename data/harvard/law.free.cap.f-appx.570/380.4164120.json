Hernandez argues that he is entitled to withholding of removal because substantial evidence supports his claim that he would likely be persecuted if he returned to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-21\">We generally have authority to review only the decision of the BIA. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 (5th Cir.2007). However, where, as here, the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the factual findings and legal\" conclusions of the IJ. <em>Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 186 (5th Cir.2004). Hernandez asserts merely that he claims persecution based on his status as a member of a particular social group. However, he does not address the IJ\u2019s determination that profitable farmers and their families did not meet the standards of a particular social group because the proposed group did not possess the requisite social visibility or particularity. Nor does he address the IJ\u2019s conclusion that even if profitable farmers and their families constituted a particular social group and he was a member, he still could not demonstrate a particularized connection between the feared persecution and the identifying characteristics of the group because any harm suffered by his family was motivated by criminal activity rather than individual membership in the group.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-22\">Hernandez\u2019s counseled brief is not entitled to liberal construction. <em>See Beasley v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number><em>McCotter, </em>798 F.2d 116, 118 (5th Cir.1986). Furthermore, Hernandez\u2019s failure to challenge the IJ\u2019s specific bases for denying his application for withholding of removal constitutes an abandonment of those issues. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we need not address Hernandez\u2019s contentions because he has waived his appeal. <em>See id.; Chambers v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 445, 448 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008). Hernandez\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
