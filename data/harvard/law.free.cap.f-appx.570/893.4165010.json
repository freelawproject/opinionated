Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003), sodomy was no longer a crime; (2) the use of the sodomy conviction to obtain the instant conviction denied him substantive due process; and (3) the use of that conviction to obtain the instant conviction denied him procedural due process. The District Court issued the writ on claim (1), but failed to rule on claims (2) and (3). The State appeals, arguing in part that the court erred in failing to rule on those two claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-22\">We have previously directed district courts to resolve all claims for relief raised in a \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus, \u201cregardless of whether habeas relief is granted or denied.\u201d <em>Clisby v.
