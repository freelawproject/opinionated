Deleon-Ajiataz argues on appeal that he was improperly convicted and sentenced under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2)\u2019s enhanced statutory maximum sentence, asserting that he does not have a prior conviction for an aggravated felony as the statute requires. Our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 368 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-21\">The statutes of conviction and adjudicative records that we may consider, <em>see Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 17-26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), do not support a determination that Deleon-Ajiataz had a prior aggravated felony conviction as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Regardless of any plain error, however, Deleon-Ajiataz is not entitled to remand for resentencing because, as he concedes, he cannot show that any error affected his sentence. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 369. Nonetheless, because Deleon-Ajiataz\u2019s illegal reentry offense was a \u00a7 1326(b)(1) violation rather than a \u00a7 1326(b)(2) violation, we REMAND for the sole purpose of reforming the judgment to reflect the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>statute of conviction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106. In all other respects, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
