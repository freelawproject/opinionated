The district court stated at sentencing that, as a special condition of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>SR, Alanis-Soto must \u201cnot use any name other than [his] true name or true date of birth nor possess any false or fraudulent identification documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Alanis-Soto contends that, under the facts, the \u201ctrue name\u201d condition is not reasonably related to the purposes of SR and is a greater deprivation of liberty than reasonably necessary because it violates his First Amendment right to free speech. Specifically, he asserts that the condition is a content-based restriction not sufficiently narrowly tailored to accommodate his First Amendment rights. Because his position requires an extension of <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,- -, 132 S.Ct. 2587, 2544-47, 183 L.Ed.2d 574 (2012), rather than a straightforward application of that case, any error on the part of the district court was not clear or obvious. <em>See United States v. Vargas-Soto, </em>700 F.3d 180, 182 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">The written judgment did not include the \u201ctrue name\u201d condition included in the oral sentence. We therefore REFORM the judgment to include the special condition of SR that Alanis-Soto not use any name other than his true name or true date of birth, nor possess any false or fraudulent identification document. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106; <em>United States v. Bigelow, </em>462 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2006). We AFFIRM the judgment as modified. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 369 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
