In his sole argument on appeal, Solis contends that the district court erred in imposing a 10-level sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(E). The district court accepted the findings of the probation officer that Solis should be held responsible for a total of 229 firearms obtained from various straw purchasers. Solis maintains that the information linking him to more than the 11 weapons present at the time of his arrest came from a codefendant who the Government conceded was not credible. In addition, Solis asserts that because the Government was unable to provide specific information about his role within the firearms trafficking organization (FTO), he should not have been linked to all the weapons purportedly obtained by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-27\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretations of the Sentencing Guidelines de <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>novo and review findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Longstreet, </em>603 F.3d 273, 275-76 (5th Cir.2010). The number of firearms included within a defendant\u2019s relevant conduct is a factual finding we review for clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 278-79. Under the rules governing relevant conduct, the district court could consider not only the acts committed, aided, or abetted by Solis personally but also all acts or omissions of others in furtherance of the conspiracy that were reasonably foreseeable by Solis. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(l)(A)-(B); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>553 F.3d 380, 395 (5th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">A review of the information available.to the court at the time of sentencing reveals that the court could reasonably conclude that the information about Solis provided by codefendant Juan Nunez was credible based on corroboration, even though Nunez had previously provided false statements about his own role in the offense. Additionally, even if the court felt that it lacked sufficient information about Solis\u2019s leadership role within the FTO, it still could have concluded that all of the firearms obtained were reasonably foreseeable to him. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.3(a)(l)(B), 3B1.1 &amp; comment, (n. 4). The court\u2019s imposition of the 10-level enhancement was plausible in light of the record as a whole and therefore was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Longstreet, </em>603 F.3d at 276. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
