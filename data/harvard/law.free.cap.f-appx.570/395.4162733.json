Hearn contends that his sentence is unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and because the sentence was not adequately supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>We review objections to the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). When the district court has imposed a sentence that varies from the guidelines range, reasonableness review requires that we evaluate whether the sentence \u201cunreasonably fails to reflect the statutory sentencing factors\u201d set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The record indicates that the district court properly considered the arguments of counsel in mitigation of sentence, the advisory guidelines range, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The 90-month sentence reflected Hearn\u2019s history and characteristics, the need to promote respect for the law, the need to protect the public and deter future crimes, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing discrepancies. The sentence imposed was reasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008). Hearn\u2019s disagreement with the sentence and the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to show that the court abused its discretion. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir. 2008). Although the sentence was 49 months above the top of the advisory guidelines sentencing range, we have upheld variances considerably greater than the increase to Hearn\u2019s sentence. <em>E.g., Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 349-50; <em>United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 531-32 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
