He appeals his sentence of 41 months of imprisonment, contending that the district court erred in concluding that his prior Florida burglary conviction warranted a 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. We vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Bibian Garcia-Montejo pleaded guilty to violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b) for being unlawfully present in the United States after his deportation following an aggravated felony conviction. The Presen-tence Investigation Report (PSR) calculated a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of II. The total offense level included a 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines based on his 2009 Florida burglary conviction. This resulted in an advisory Guidelines range of 41 to 51 months of imprisonment. Garcia-Montejo filed no objections to the recommendations in or conclusions of the PSR. The district court sentenced Garcia-Montejo to 41 months imprisonment and one year of supervised release. Garcia-Montejo now appeals his sentence contending that the district court erred by applying the 16-level crime of violence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b431-15\">\u201cWe review de novo whether a prior conviction constitutes a crime of violence within the meaning of the Guidelines.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Guidelines define a crime of violence as (1) any offense in a list of enumerated offenses that includes \u201cburglary of a dwelling,\u201d or (2) any other offense that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Government\u2019s only contention is that Garcia-Mon-tejo\u2019s Florida burglary conviction qualifies as a crime of violence because it constitutes the enumerated offense of \u201cburglary of a dwelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-16\">Garcia-Montejo did not object to the crime of violence enhancement at the district court. Because he failed to object, we review his challenge for plain error. Plain error exists if \u201c(1) there is an error, (2) the error is plain, ... (3) the error affect[s] substantial rights,\u201d and (4) \u201cthe error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plainness of an error is judged from the time of appeal, not the time of trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">We employ a categorical approach in determining whether an enumerated offense qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201c[W]e examine the elements of the offense, rather than the facts underlying the conviction or the defendant\u2019s actual conduct, to determine whether an offense meets the definition of a [crime of violence].\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, if the statute of conviction encompasses multiple, distinct offenses, at least one of which would not qualify as a crime of violence, we apply a modified categorical approach.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under the modified categorical approach, we may examine certain additional documents in the convicting court\u2019s record to determine whether a guilty plea conviction fell under a particular subsection of a divisible statute. The state court documents that we may consider include the charging documents, written plea agreement, transcript of the plea colloquy, and any explicit factual findings or conclusions of law to which the defendant assented.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Once we have pared down the statute based on the information in the approved documents, we presume that the conviction \u201crested upon nothing more than the least of the acts criminalized, and then determine whether even those acts are encompassed by the generic federal offense.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To determine whether an offense qualifies as an enumerated offense we use a \u201ccommon sense approach\u201d that looks to the \u201cordinary, contemporary, [and] common meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If \u201cthe state definition for an offense is broader than the generic definition, a conviction under that state\u2019s law cannot serve as a predicate for the crime of violence enhancement.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">Applying the plain error standard we must first determine whether there was an error. Garcia-Montejo was convicted of burglary in Florida. The criminal information to which he pleaded guilty charged that he \u201cdid knowingly enter or remain in a dwelling, the property of [the victim], with intent to commit an offense therein, and in the course of committing the burglary made an assault or battery upon [the victim], contrary to Florida Statute 810.02(1) and 2(a).\u201d The relevant portions of the Florida burglary statute in force when he committed this offense defined burglary as follows,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-14\">1. Entering a dwelling, a structure, or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the defendant is licensed or invited to enter; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-15\">2. Notwithstanding a licensed or invited entry, remaining in a dwelling, structure, or conveyance:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-16\">a. Surreptitiously, with the intent to commit an offense therein!.]<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>This is not the first time this court has been asked to determine whether an offense under this statute categorically qualifies as a crime of violence. In <em>United States v. </em>Gomez-Guerra,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we held that a conviction under \u00a7 810.02 did not qualify as the enumerated offense of burglary of a dwelling because the statute criminalized a broader range of conduct than the generic, common sense definition of burglary of a dwelling.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Namely, Florida law defines \u201cdwelling\u201d to include not just the actual building but also the curtilage surrounding the building:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">(2) \u201cDwelling\u201d means a building or conveyance of any kind, ... whether such building or conveyance is temporary or permanent, ... which has a roof over it and is designed to be occupied by people lodging therein at night, <em>together with the curtilage thereof.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Because dwelling is defined to include the curtilage, and the \u201cordinary, contemporary, common meaning of burglary of a dwelling does not extend to the grounds around the dwelling,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we held in <em>Gomez-Guerra </em>that the least culpable act that satisfied the statutory count of conviction was categorically not a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The Government in this case argues that <em>Gomez-Guerra </em>is not controlling because the facts show that the Garcia-Montejo did not enter curtilage, but actually entered a residence. The Government asserts that under <em>United States v. </em>Castillo-Morales,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> if the documents we may evaluate under the modified categorical approach demonstrate that the defendant entered the residence rather than the curtilage, then the conviction does constitute a crime of violence under the enumerated offense clause. In <em>Castillo-Morales, </em>we again evaluated whether a conviction under the Florida burglary statute constituted a crime of violence as a \u201cburglary of a dwelling.\u201d We held in <em>Castillo-Morales </em>that it did, because the defendant\u2019s plea agreement stipulated to facts laid out in the charging affidavit, which specified that the defendant had in fact burglarized the inside of a residence rather than the curtilage.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cWe hold that when a defendant stipulates that \u2018a factual basis\u2019 for his plea is present in \u2018court documents,\u2019 courts may use any un-contradicted facts in those documents to establish an element of a prior conviction.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">Here, however, we do not have any \u201ccourt documents containing the factual basis for the conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Under the modified categorical approach, when there is a guilty plea conviction, our review is \u201climited to examining the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Of this limited class of documents, we have only the charging instrument and the statutory definition entered into the record before us. Neither of these documents shed light on the precise elements of Garcia-Montejo\u2019s conviction. The charging document is silent on whether Garcia-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Montejo entered the building or merely the curtilage. It simply uses the term \u201cdwelling,\u201d which as discussed above, includes both.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We do not have the Florida sentencing transcript. We do not have any findings of fact by the Florida judge. We do not have a copy of the plea agreement. We do not have a copy of the charging affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The Government responds that the factual predicate for the conviction is discussed in the PSR. It is true that the PSR states that, \u201c[ajccording to the charging affidavit ... the defendant removed the screen and two (2) panes of glass from a window of the victim\u2019s residence. He entered the habitation through the window and committed ... battery upon [the victim].\u201d But an uncorroborated summary of a charging affidavit that contains facts to which the defendant may or may not have stipulated or pleaded guilty is not one of the approved documents that we may evaluate under the modified categorical approach. As we have made clear before, we cannot rely on a recitation of facts in the PSR to determine whether a prior conviction constitutes a crime of violence.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Even if we were satisfied that the PSR accurately portrayed the underlying facts, there is no indication that Garcia-Montejo pleaded guilty to these facts or stipulated to them, which was crucial to the incorporation of the charging affidavit in <em>Castillo-Morales. </em><footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">The Government counters that we have previously held that in certain situations reliance on the PSR for a crime of violence determination does not rise to the level of plain error if the defendant has admitted those facts.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Government argues that Garcia-Montejo admitted the facts in the PSR by failing to file an objection to the PSR in the district court. But failure to object to the PSR is insufficient.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Even in <em>United States v. Martinez-Vega,</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the principal case on which the Government relies, the defendant had at least admitted in open court that \u201ceverything in the [PSR][was] correct.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We have no analogous statement here. Further, in <em>Martinez-Vega </em>the lesser included charge in the indictment was categorically a crime of violence.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> That is not the case here. Rather, the least culpable conduct that would satisfy the criminal information here has been held, by this court, to categorically <em>not </em>be a crime of violence under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>enumerated offense clause.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Because the Government has failed to introduce into the record any trial documents that further define the term dwelling as it was used in the criminal information, we must presume that Garcia-Montejo violated the statute in the least culpable manner.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> This court has already held that a violation of the statute in that manner is categorically not a crime of violence under the enumerated offense clause.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> It does not fit the generic, contemporary definition of \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d because it encompasses burglary of the curtilage rather than only the burglary of an actual dwelling. Therefore, the district court clearly erred when it applied the 16-level crime of violence enhancement. This clear error satisfies the first two prongs of the plain error standard of review.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We also conclude that the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. \u201cWhen the rights acquired by the defendant relate to sentencing, the \u2018outcome\u2019 he must show to have been affected is his sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> A sentencing error affects a defendant\u2019s substantial rights if he can show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for the district court\u2019s misapplication of the Guidelines, [he] would have received a lesser sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The erroneous application of the Guidelines resulted in a 16-level enhancement for Garcia-Montejo. With the enhancement his Guidelines range was 41-51 months of imprisonment. Without the enhancement, he faced a Guidelines range of 0-6 months of imprisonment. This is a significant disparity. The two ranges do not overlap. This is sufficient to establish that Garcia-Monte-jo\u2019s substantial rights were violated.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-15\">The fourth prong of the plain error test is whether the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This is a discretionary test. In previous decisions we have determined that if the district' court\u2019s error clearly and substantially affects a defendant\u2019s sentence, then that error substantially affects the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of the judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> In the present case, the sentence imposed was significantly outside of the applicable Guidelines range had the 16-level enhancement not been applied. Under these circumstances, we exercise our discretion and we determine that the error was substantial enough to seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-16\">We vacate the sentence of the district court and remand the case for resentenc-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>ing. We express no opinion on whether the district court should permit the Government to supplement the record on remand with documents that would conclusively establish that\" Garcia-Montejo\u2019s count of conviction was for burglary of a residence rather than of the curtilage.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
