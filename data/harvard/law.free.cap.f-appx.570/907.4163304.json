Mr. Ceasar argues that the district court erred in concluding that his underlying conviction for possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii), was a Class A felony for purposes of calculating his advisory revocation Guidelines range. Specifically, he argues that \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) should be characterized as a Class B felony because the statute does not explicitly authorize a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-25\">We review de novo the legality of a sentence imposed pursuant to the revocation of a term of supervised release. <em>United States v. Pla, </em>345 F.3d 1312, 1313 (11th Cir.2003). Following a review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-26\">A defendant\u2019s advisory guideline range following a revocation of supervised release is generally determined based on the grade of the release violation and the defendant\u2019s underlying criminal history cate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>gory. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). Where a defendant commits a Grade A release violation, as Mr. Ceasar did, he receives a higher guideline range if his underlying conviction was for a Class A felony. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">\u201cAn offense that is not specifically classified by a letter grade in the section defining it, is classified [according to] the maximum term of imprisonment authorized.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a). The crime is considered a Class A felony where the maximum penalty is death or life imprisonment, and a Class B felony where the maximum term of imprisonment is 25 years or more. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3559(a)(1) &amp; (2). Although Congress did not specify a maximum sentence that may be imposed for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii), providing instead that the defendant shall \u201cbe sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years,\u201d we have held that the statutory maximum sentence for all subsections of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) is life imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Pounds, </em>230 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cEvery other Court of Appeals to address this issue has reached the same conclusion.\u201d <em>United States v. McCollum, </em>548 Fed.Appx. 65, 66-67 (3d Cir.2013) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Accordingly, because the \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment authorized\u201d under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) is life imprisonment, it is properly classified as a \u201cClass A felony\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(1). <em>See also United States v. Cudjoe, </em>634 F.3d 1163, 1166 (10th Cir.2011) (holding that an offense under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00a9 is \u201cproperly classified as a Class A felony\u201d because \u201cthe sentencing range for a violation of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00a9 extends to life imprisonment\u201d); <em>United States v. Miles, </em>947 F.2d 1234, 1235-36 (5th Cir.1991) (holding that crimes subject to a minimum sentence of 15 years under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) are properly characterized as Class A felonies under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">Because the district court properly classified Mr. Ceasar\u2019s underlying offense under \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) as a Class A felony, it committed no error in calculating his advisory guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
