Hatcher brought suit in federal court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. As relevant on appeal, Fusco moved to dismiss the individual-capacity claims against her on the ground that she was entitled to qualified immunity. The district court denied Fusco\u2019s motion in part. Fusco appealed. We have jurisdiction under the \u201ccollateral order doctrine.\u201d <em>See Keating v. City of Miami, </em>598 F.3d 753, 759-60 (11th Cir.2010). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-14\">At this stage, we assume that all well-pled factual allegations in Hatcher\u2019s complaint are true.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1948, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). The following is a relevant subset of those allegations. We, of course, offer no opinion about whether they are actually true.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-15\">When Hatcher was a freshman at DeSo-to County High School in Arcadia, Florida, she and other students sought to participate in a national event called \u201cDay of Silence\u201d on Friday, April 20, 2012. \u201cDay of Silence\u201d occurs at thousands of middle schools, high schools, and universities nationwide. On the day in question, participating students vow to take a form of silence in order to draw attention to the silencing effect of bullying and harassment directed toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (\u201cLGBT\u201d) students.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-16\">Approximately four weeks before the event, Hatcher described it to Principal Fusco and asked for permission to participate. Fusco contacted her boss, the superintendent of the school district. He informed Fusco that it was district practice not to approve student protests and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>that Hatcher\u2019s event was disapproved. Fusco relayed this information to Hatcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Hatcher contacted the superintendent directly by email, claiming a right to participate under both district policy and also the United States Constitution. She quoted from a publicly-available legal analysis, which also stated that there are \u201climits on free speech rights at school,\u201d including that \u201c[i]f a teacher tells a student to answer a question during class, the student generally doesn\u2019t have a constitutional right to refuse to answer.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hatcher asked for the administration\u2019s cooperation and for permission to put up posters. She indicated that many students would participate whether the event was approved or not. The superintendent forwarded at least one of these emails to Fusco.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Meanwhile, Hatcher approached Fusco twice more, arguing that the event should be allowed. On each such instance, Fusco told Hatcher \u201cno\u201d and \u201cwhat the ramifications would be if the protest occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">The day before the event, on Thursday, April 19, 2012, Fusco called Hatcher out of class and into her office, where she warned that if Hatcher came to school the following day and \u201cwas quiet, there would be disciplinary consequences.\u201d Fusco also telephoned Hatcher\u2019s parents on several consecutive days prior to the event, asking them to convince Hatcher not to participate. Fusco told Hatcher\u2019s parents that there would be \u201cconsequences\u201d if she did participate. She suggested that they keep Hatcher home from school in order to \u201cavoid problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">On the morning of the event, Friday, April 20, 2012, Fusco sent an email to all teachers at DeSoto County High School containing the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-10\">If you have students who are wearing placards in protest of an issue or disrupting the hallways or classrooms, please notify the dean or administration and we will handle it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-11\">If a student refuses to participate in class by taking part in a silent protest, that is considered a disruption. Again, please notify the administration, and we will handle it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">That day, Hatcher wore a red t-shirt to school bearing the words \u201cDOS April 20, 2012: Shhhhh.\u201d She also attempted to keep silent. She communicated with the aid of a dry-erase board, handed out information about her reason for keeping silent, and asked friends to explain on her behalf. She did not, however, refuse to respond to any teacher or instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">Hatcher\u2019s first- and second-period classes proceeded without incident. Early in the third period, however, she was summoned to the office of the dean of students. The dean gave her a choice between in-school and out-of-school suspension. When Hatcher asked why she was being punished, the dean responded, \u201cMrs. Fusco told you not to do this.\u201d Hatcher was placed in in-school suspension, isolated from her peers and classroom activities for the rest of the day. One other student was similarly punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">The following Monday, April 23, 2012, Principal Fusco sent an email to the superintendent\u2019s executive assistant, reporting that \u201conly two students received any consequences from protesting for LGBT day of silence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-16\">As relevant on appeal, Hatcher sued Fusco in her individual capacity. Hatcher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>claims that Fusco violated her First Amendment rights to free expression and against retaliation. Hatcher also claims that Fusco is liable under the Fourteenth Amendment for the actions of Fusco\u2019s subordinates. The district court denied Fus-co\u2019s motion to dismiss these counts pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Fusco appeals that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">Our review is <em>de novo. Keating v. City of Miami, </em>598 F.8d 753, 759-60 (11th Cir. 2010). In order to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must state well-plead factual allegations that, taken as true, \u201callow[] the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1948, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Under the doctrine of qualified immunity, a government official in a \u00a7 1983 suit is not liable in damages for alleged misconduct within the scope of her discretionary authority <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> unless she violated \u201cclearly established\u201d federal statutory or constitutional right(s) about which a reasonable person would have known. <em>Keating, </em>598 F.3d at 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Fusco does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that Hatcher alleged a \u201cclearly established\u201d constitutional violation. <em>Cf. Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., </em>393 U.S. 503, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969); <em>Holloman ex rel. Holloman v. Harland, </em>370 F.3d 1252 (11th Cir.2004). Rather, Fusco argues that her alleged role is insufficient to support a reasonable inference that she was among the violators. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">\u201c[Sjupervisors are hable under \u00a7 1983 \u2018either when the supervisor personally participates in the alleged constitutional violation or when there is a causal connection between actions of the supervising official and the alleged constitutional violation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Keating, </em>598 F.3d at 762 (quoting <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>325 F.3d 1228, 1234 (11th Cir.2003)). \u201cA causal connection can be established by, <em>inter alia, </em>\u2018facts which support an inference that the supervisor directed the subordinates to act unlawfully or knew that the subordinates would act unlawfully and failed to stop them from doing so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gonzalez, </em>325 F.3d at 1235).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">In this case, the well-pled factual allegations support a reasonable inference that Fusco personally attempted to dissuade Hatcher from participating in \u201cDay of Silence.\u201d According to the complaint, Fusco repeatedly threatened Hatcher and her parents with \u201cconsequences\u201d for Hatcher\u2019s participation. We reject Fusco\u2019s argument that the only reasonable inference is that she was following the superintendent\u2019s orders.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The allegations also support a reasonable inference that Fusco either directed that Hatcher be disciplined or actually knew that she would be and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>failed to intervene. The complaint indicates that Fusco directed teachers to report on students who were participating in \u201cDay of Silence.\u201d Hatcher was one such student. Hatcher was summoned to the dean\u2019s office and informed that she was being punished because Fusco had \u201ctold [her] not to do this.\u201d The next business day, Fusco reported on Hatcher\u2019s discipline to the superintendent. It is reasonable to infer that Fusco may have caused or knowingly failed to prevent Hatcher\u2019s in-school suspension.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-11\">. Conclusory allegations are not assumed to be true. <em>Randall v. Scott, </em>610 F.3d 701, 709-10 (llth Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b898-8\">. Copies of Hatcher\u2019s emails were attached to the complaint. For the purpose of this analysis, we treat the attachments as part of the complaint. <em>See Reese v.

It is undisputed that Fusco was acting within the scope of her discretionary authority. In the qualified immunity context, a government official acts within the scope of her discretionary authority when she pursues a job-related goal through means that are within her power to utilize. <em>Holloman ex rel. Holloman v. Harland, </em>370 F.3d 1252, 1265-66 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b899-8\">. Even if that were the only reasonable factual inference, moreover, we question whether it would support the legal argument that Fus-co is entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See O\u2019Rourke v. Hayes, </em>378 F.3d 1201, 1210 n. 5 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Brent v.
