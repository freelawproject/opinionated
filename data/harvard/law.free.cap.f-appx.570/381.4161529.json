The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a notice to appear, alleging that Yang was subject to removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), because he was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT) committed within five years after admission for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed. The DHS also alleged that Yang was removable under \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (A) (iii) because his conspiracy conviction constituted an aggravated felony as he violated a law relating to an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense described under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">\n<em>Effect of Former Counsel\u2019s Concessions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-16\">Yang argues that the BIA erred in holding that he was bound by his former counsel\u2019s concessions because they were incorrect and the result of unreasonable professional judgment and constituted ineffective assistance. He maintains that the BIA abused its discretion in not addressing his claim that his former counsel was ineffective. He contends that he suffered prejudice because the concessions made him ineligible for certain relief, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>no tactical advantage, and caused him to be subject to mandatory detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\u201cAbsent egregious circumstances, a distinct and formal admission made before, during, or even after a proceeding by an attorney acting in his professional capacity binds his client as a judicial admission.\u201d <em>Matter of Velasquez, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986). Certain \u201cegregious circumstances\u201d may justify relieving an alien from being bound by his counsel\u2019s admissions, such as admissions and the concession of deportability that were the result of unreasonable professional judgment or were so unfair that they have produced an unjust result. <em>Id. </em>at 382-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Although an alien has no Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel during removal proceedings, <em>Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 385 n. 2 (5th Cir.2001), this court has assumed without deciding that an alien\u2019s ineffective assistance claim may implicate Fifth Amendment due process concerns. <em>Mai v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir.2006). To show ineffective assistance, an alien must establish that his attorney performed deficiently and that he was substantially prejudiced as a result of the ineffective representation in that he was prevented from pursuing his rights. <em>Mai, </em>473 F.3d at 165. To show prejudice, an alien must make a prima facie showing that, but for counsel\u2019s error, he would have been entitled to the relief he sought. <em>Miranda-Lores v. INS, </em>17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The BIA held that the concessions of Yang\u2019s counsel were not incorrect or the result of unreasonable professional judgment and, therefore, that he was bound by his counsel\u2019s concessions. Although the BIA did not expressly state that Yang\u2019s counsel was not ineffective, the BIA\u2019s determination that his counsel\u2019s concessions were not the result of unreasonable professional judgment indicates that the BIA implicitly determined that counsel\u2019s concessions did not constitute deficient performance. Thus, the record indicates that the BIA considered and implicitly denied Yang\u2019s claim that his counsel\u2019s concessions constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 139-40 (5th Cir.2004). As discussed below, the concessions of Yang\u2019s counsel were correct and were not the result of unreasonable professional judgment. Therefore, the BIA did not err in determining that Yang was bound by his counsel\u2019s concessions. <em>See Velasquez, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 382-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">\n<em>Removal Based on Aggravated Felony Conviction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">Yang argues that his conspiracy conviction was not an aggravated felony because the DHS did not present evidence to establish that the convictions resulted in an actual loss of over $10,000. He asserts that the immigration judge (IJ) and BIA erred in relying on the restitution order to establish the loss amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">Under \u00a7 1101 (a)(43)(M)(i), a crime that \u201cinvolves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000\u201d is an aggravated felony. A conspiracy to commit such an offense also constitutes an aggravated felony. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(U). Yang\u2019s conspiracy conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(b)(2) falls within the definition of an aggravated felony in \u00a7 1101 (a)(43)(M)(i) because the conspiracy was an agreement to commit crimes in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(1), (3), or (4), all of which require intent to defraud, and the conspiracy resulted in a loss that exceeded $10,000. The IJ did not err in considering the restitution order to determine the loss amount. <em>See Nijhawan v. Holder, </em>557 U.S. 29, 43,129 S.Ct. 2294, 174 L.Ed.2d 22 (2009); <em>James v. Gonzales, </em>464 F.3d 505, 510-11 &amp; n. 31 (5th Cir.2006). Yang has not shown that his counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>concession was incorrect or the result of unreasonable professional judgment. <em>See Velasquez, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 382-83. Yang has also failed to show that his counsel\u2019s concession was deficient performance or that, but for his counsel\u2019s alleged error, the IJ would have determined that his conspiracy conviction was not an aggravated felony. <em>See Miranda-Lares, </em>17 F.3d at 84-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\n<em>Removal Based on Conviction for CIMT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Yang contends that his aggravated identity theft conviction was not a CIMT because the statute under which he was convicted did not require a guilty mind or intent to deceive. He asserts that, therefore, his counsel\u2019s concession that he was removable based on a CIMT was incorrect, was the result of unreasonable professional judgment, and constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The statute under which Yang was convicted, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), provides that a defendant commits aggravated identity theft if he \u201cknowingly transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person.\u201d The plain language of the statute requires that the defendant act with a guilty mind or intent to deceive as it expressly requires that the defendant act \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cwithout lawful authority.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 646, 657, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009) (holding that a conviction under \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) requires that a defendant have knowledge that the means of identification at issue belonged to another person); <em>see also Hyder v. Keisler, </em>506 F.3d 388, 392 (5th Cir.2007) (holding that a crime involving \u201cdishonesty as an essential element\u201d falls within the court\u2019s understanding of the definition of CIMT). Yang has not shown that counsel\u2019s concession was deficient performance or that, but for counsel\u2019s alleged error, the IJ and BIA would have held that his aggravated identity theft conviction was not a CIMT. <em>See Mai, </em>473 F.3d at 165; <em>Mirandas-Lores, </em>17 F.3d at 84-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Yang\u2019s conspiracy conviction was also a CIMT. Section \u00a7 1029(b)(2) provides that a person may be convicted if he is a party to a conspiracy of two or more persons to commit an offense under subsection (a) of this statute, all of which involve intent to defraud. Fraud is a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See Jordan v. DeGeorge, </em>341 U.S. 223, 223-24, 232, 71 S.Ct. 703, 95 L.Ed. 886 (1951); <em>Planes v. Holder, </em>652 F.3d 991, 997-98 (9th Cir.2011) (holding that an offense under \u00a7 1029(a)(3) was properly determined to be a CIMT). Further, for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), Yang was admitted to the United States in 2009, within five years of the date of his convictions in 2012, and he was also sentenced to over one year of imprisonment. Therefore, all of the requirements for removal based on a conviction for a CIMT under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) were met. Yang has not shown that counsel\u2019s concession constituted deficient performance or that, but for counsel\u2019s alleged error, the IJ and BIA would have held that his conspiracy conviction was not a CIMT. <em>See Mai, </em>473 F.3d at 165; <em>Miranda-Lores, </em>17 F.3d at 84-85.</p>\n<p id=\"ABN\">\n<em>Particularly Serious Crimes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Yang contends that his counsel\u2019s concession that his convictions were particularly serious crimes was incorrect and constituted ineffective assistance because his convictions were not crimes against persons, were nonviolent, and did not cause a serious danger to the community. He contends that the IJ and the BIA erred in not analyzing this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">A crime need not involve violence or cause harm or physical danger to other persons in order to be considered a particularly serious crime. <em>See, e.g., Hakim v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>Holder, </em>628 F.3d 151, 152 (5th Cir.2010) (holding that alien\u2019s prior convictions for drug trafficking, tax fraud, and money laundering were particularly serious crimes making him ineligible for withholding of removal under \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii)). The IJ concurred with counsel\u2019s concession that Yang\u2019s prior convictions were particularly serious \u201cgiven the nature and extent of the damage caused by [Yang\u2019s] conspiracy to commit access device fraud and aggravated identity fraud.\u201d The record supports the IJ\u2019s determination as Yang was involved in a large scale scheme that resulted in losses to 23 different individuals and banking organizations, the theft of 419 identities, and a loss of $54,329.44. Given the large extent of the scheme, Yang has not shown that his counsel\u2019s concession that his convictions were particularly serious crimes was deficient performance or that, but for his counsel\u2019s alleged error, the IJ and BIA would have found that his convictions were not particularly serious crimes. <em>See Mai, </em>473 F.3d at 165; <em>Miranda-Lores, </em>17 F.3d at 84-85. <em>Eligibility for Waiver of Inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">Yang contends that the BIA erred in holding that he was statutorily ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(h) because the BIA ignored the possibility that he may reapply for adjustment of status in conjunction with a \u00a7 1182(h) waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">The IJ and BIA did not err in holding that Yang was not eligible for waiver of inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(h). Yang argued that he may file an adjustment of status application, but he did not state or present any evidence showing that he had actually filed such an application or that he was eligible for an adjustment of status. Yang relies on decisions of other circuits that he was only required to make a prima facie showing that he was eligible for adjustment of status. However, these cases are not binding authority in this circuit and are inconsistent with this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Sausedo, </em>596 F.3d 279, 282 (5th Cir.2010) (holding that other circuits\u2019 decisions are persuasive only); <em>Cabral v. Holder, </em>632 F.3d 886, 891-92 (5th Cir.2011) (holding that an alien, who had not filed concurrent application for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255, was ineligible to apply for a \u00a7 1182(h) waiver). The IJ and BIA did not err in finding that he was not eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility because he had not filed a concurrent adjustment of status application. <em>See Cabral, </em>632 F.3d at 891-92; <em>Matter of Rivas, </em>26 I. &amp; N. Dec. 130, 131-32 (BIA 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-17\">. Yang abandoned any challenge to the BIA\u2019s holding that he was not entitled to deferral of removal under the CAT by failing to brief the issue. <em>See Soadjede v.
