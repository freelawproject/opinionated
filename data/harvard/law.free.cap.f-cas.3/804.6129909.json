Benedict, for claimant</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b807-6\">The brig was a Portuguese vessel of about 100 tons burden, found by the steam tug Huntress, on the 15th of January last 15 or 20 miles below Sandy Hook light, on the coast, with a signal up for a pilot. The tug took her in tow and brought her into this harbor, without injury or exposure to the tug or her crew, within a period of 3 to 5 hours. The service was all performed in the day time, and in moderate weather. The libellant proves on his part that the master of the brig agreed to pay $2,000 for the service. The action is brought to recover that sum, and the libel charges that the vessel was disabled and in distress, and that the service was a salvage service. For the claimant it is proved that the brig only required a pilot; that neither her master or any of the crew could speak English; and that, by signs and figures passed between the master and the man from the tug, it was understood on the brig that 200 Portuguese milreas, and not $2,000, was the price agreed to be paid. That sum was offered to the libellant, and refused, before suit brought.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b807-7\">THE COURT</author>\n<p id=\"Akh\">held that the service was \u25a0one of towage, merely, and that the sum demanded was unreasonable and exorbitant; that, if the master had made such agreement under apprehension of the loss of his vessel, the court would not enforce it against him; but that in this case the brig was in no peril, and the tug was entitled to no more than a fair compensation, which, on the facts, was adjudged to be 200 milreas, or $224, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
