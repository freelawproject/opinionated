The defendant who resided in the territory northwest of the Ohio, when in Philadelphia in the year 1796, was served with a subpoena from the equity side of this court, to appear and answer the plaintiff\u2019s bill. He entered his appearance by Rawle; but put in no answer, and stood in contempt. In this situation the complainant took out an attachment to compel an answer; and was proceeding with the other process used in Westminster; namely, an attachment with proclamations, commission of rebellion and sequestration. But in April sessions, 1799, the practice in this case being mentioned, Iredell [Circuit Justice] and Peters [District Judge] were of opinion, that it was not necessary nor practicable to pursue the English practice; but that the bill might be taken pro confesso, on the return of the first attachment, non est inventus. But in April sessions, 1800, Chase [Circuit Justice] and Peters [District Judge] present, it was held that such mode of proceeding was inadmissible; that until some legislative provision or rule of practice was established, the method which obtained before must be pursued. Accordingly the decree pro con-fesso, was set aside; and the plaintiff proceeded to issue an attachment with proclamations, which being also returned non est inventus, Ingersoll, after stating these proceedings, said that the next process was a commission of rebellion, which, regularly, must have fifteen days between the test and the return, as all other process of contempt should have:*but as it was desirable to have an order for sequestration in this term, so as that the bill might be set down for hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>ing and taken pro confesso, which could not he until the commission of rebellion returned non est, and a sequestration ordered. Harr. Ch. Pr. (New Ed.) 203; 3 Bl. Comm. 443, 444. He therefore moved for an order that a commission of rebellion do issue against the defendant, returnable immediate, directed to the marshal, &amp;c. He said that it was in the discretion of the court, under circumstances, to expedite this process for contempt; that in this case, they were merely formal, the defendant was out of the state, and would not answer. That great delay had already been incurred; and it was due to justice that the plaintiff should have the benefit of a decree by default. He cited Hinde, Pr. 122, to show that the court might \u25a0order the return immediate.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b999-3\">GRIFFITH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Agt\">This is a special motion, and requires notice.

And upon his further motion, it was ordered that the plaintiff\u2019s bill be taken pro confesso, and that a decree be entered accordingly; with leave, nevertheless, to the defendant to move, at the next sessions of the court, to set it aside upon filing an answer: and that proof of the service of this order, made before any magistrate of the North Western Territory, should be held sufficient</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
