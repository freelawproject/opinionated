After the expiration of that term, without any new agreement or arrangement with the defendant in error, the plaintiff in' error held over, continuing in the possession of the premises, and paying rent therefor at the rate, and in the manner provided in the written instrument, until the 1st day of September, 1892, at which time it abandoned the premises without the consent of the defendant in error, and , refused to pay rent thereafter. The defendant in error, claiming that he was entitled to the rent for the whole of the year ending March 29, 1893, notwithstanding the abandonment of the premises, brought his suit therefor, after the expiration of the year; and, upon the foregoing state of facts, recovered a judgment for the amount of the rent from September 1, 1892, to March 29, 1893, at the rate fixed by the written agreement, with interest. That judgment was affirmed by the circuit court, and the plaintiff in error seeks a reversal in this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-5\"><em>J. H.

It is not averred that the contract was parol and that it was taken out of the statute by virtue of some part performance; but the pleading is simply a contract for the subsequent lease upon a rental which is designated. But even if we had a proper pleading here there is no case made for recovery under the Ohio statute of frauds and the decisions of the Supreme Court thereon. <em>Armstrong </em>v.

And when, after the expiration of the term., he holds over into another year without any new agreement or arrangement with the landlord, the latter may treat him as a tenant for that year at the same rent and upon the terms and conditions of his prior occupancy, or, as a trespasser at his election; but if the landlord accept the rent, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>acquiesce in such, holding over-for a considerable time, his election will be regarded as made in favor of the tenancy, and then it cannot be terminated before the end of the year by either party without the consent of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In Wood on Landlord and Tenant, section 13, it is laid down as the established rule, that: \u201cWhen a tenant under a demise for a term holds over after the termination of the time for which the premises were let to him, without a new demise, the landlord may elect to treat him as a trespasser, or as a tenant holding' under the terms of the original lease, unless it appears that by agreement or notice, the terms of the original agreement or lease were changed.\u201d And, \u201cwhen a tenant holds over, whether he is a tenant for a term of years, or from year to year, he impliedly holds according to all the conditions of the original lease which are applicable to his new situation, and the law will imply - those terms which are found in the contract which has expired.\u201d In Taylor on Landlord and Tenant, section 22, the rule is stated as follows: \u201cA tenant for years who holds over after the expiration of his term without paying rent, or otherwise acknowledging a continuance of the tenancy, becomes either a trespasser or a-tenant* at the option of the landlord. Very slight acts on the part of the landlord, as a short lapse of time, are sufficient to conclude his election and make the occupant his tenant. But the tenant has no such election; his mere continuance in possession fixes him as a tenant for another year, if the landlord thinks proper to insist upon it. And the right of the landlord will not be affected by'the fact that the tenant refused to renew the lease, and gave notice that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>hired other premises.\u201d And, that author further says, in section 525, that: \u201cWhen the landlord suffers the tenant to remain in possession after the expiration of the original tenancy, the law presumes the holding to be upon the terms of the original demise, subject to the same rent, and to all the covenants of the original lease, so far, at least, as they are applicable to the new condition of things.\u201d In Wood on .Frauds, section 22, it is said, that: \u201cAn entry under a lease for a term at an-annual rent, void for any cause, and payment of rent under it, creates a tenancy from year to year, upon the terms of the lease except as to its duration.\u201d To the same effect is Wood on Frauds, section 19, and Wood on Landlord and Tenant, section 25. The law as above stated, is maintained also by other authors and text-writers wiio treat of the subject. 2 Woodfall on Landlord and Tenant, 219, 220, 222; Reed on Statute of Frauds, section 807; 12 Am. &amp; Eng. Encyclopedia of Law, pp. 738\u00a3&gt;, 738$', and <em>738r. </em>The decisions are largely collected in the text-books referred to, and need not be cited here.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">In this case, though the written agreement was ineffectual as a lease for the term of five years \u2019 on account of the omission of the parties to acknowledge its execution and have it recorded, the plaintiff in error, by taking possession and paying the rent under the agreement, became a tenant from year to year at the annual rent fixed by it, and payable according to its terms; and, by holding, over after the expiration of the term into the next year and paying the rent at the same rate for a part of that year, the plaintiff in error became a tenant for that year upon the terms of the former occupancy, and was not relieved from its obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>tion to pay the rent for the balance of the year by the abandonment of the premises. Nor, is the obligation to pay the rent for the balance of that year within the statute of frauds. The tenant, by holding over, is regarded as consenting or proposing to enter upon a new term for another year at the same rent and upon the conditions of the prior occupancy, and the landlord\u2019s acceptance of the proposed tenancy is presumed from his receiving the rent, or other acquiescence. The agreement arises by implication of law from the conduct of the parties after the expiration of the former tenancy; and, in this respect, is essentially different from those agreements made by parties while in possession under an existing lease, for a new lease to commence in the future; as was the case of <em>Armstrong </em>v. Kattenhorn, 11 Ohio, 265, and <em>Crawford &amp; Murray </em>v. <em>Wick, </em>18 Ohio St., 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Here the new agreement grows out of, and is founded upon, the possession evidenced by the holding over, and is therefore referable to it, rather than to the possession under the prior agreement which had expired. The holding over is equivalent to a new entry; or, as said in Reed on the Statute of Frauds, section 806, concerning the application of the statute in such eases, the \u201ceffect of entry under a void lease, and of holding over after the expiration of a valid one, is identical.\u201d And it is the settled law of this state, that a parol lease for a year, accompanied by possession, is not within the statute of frauds. <em>Wilber </em>v. Paine, 1 Ohio, 252; <em>Moore </em>v. Beasley, 3 Ohio, 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
