And where such by laws provide that a change of beneficiary can be made only by surrender and issue of a new certificate, such change cannot be made (the wife being in life) by will. <em>Arthur </em>v. <em>Odd Fellows' Ass\u2019n., </em>29 Ohio St., 557, approved and followed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b579-8\">And the rule is not different where a like certificate is issued by an association organized in another state doing buisness in this state under section 3630^, Revised Statutes, where the statute which authorizes the organization permits the association to make by-laws regulating the payment of benefits, and by-laws made accordingly, require a surrender of the old and the issue of a new certificate in order to effect a change in the person of the beneficiary.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b579-9\">2. A provision in the last will of a husband which directs the payment to his wife of a sum of money which is in fact but the return to her of money which he had borrowed from her and used for his own purposes, and was so understood by both parties at the time the will was executed, will not furnish a consideration to support a promise on her part to surrender to the estate property belonging to her in her own right, even though it should be found that the will purports to dispose of such property.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b579-11\">3. The intent of the testator, the guide in the construction of a will, is to be gathered from a consideration of the entire instrument, and where any part of a will is ambiguous, oral proof may be heard of the circumstances of the testator at the time of the making of the will, of his estate, and of the objects of his bounty. But where a clause of a will, taken in connection with the whole, is not of doubtful import, and the words of the will are applicable to any subject, they are to be applied accordingly, and the intent of the testator must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>derived from the language he has used. In such case, parol evidence cannot be admitted to contradict, add to, or explain the contents of the will.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b580-5\">4, If it be charged that the provision involves a false description, and that there is nothing for the provision, giving to the language its ordinary meaning, to operate upon, the burden of establishing that fact is upon the party alleging it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b580-7\">5. The general rule is that when a will assumes to dispose of property not owned by the testator, but belonging to another person for whom provision is likewise made in the will, the latter is bound to elect whether he will claim the property so disposed of, or take the provision made for him in the will. But the language expressive of the intent to dispose of the property of another must be unequivocal. If the provision, taken in connection with the entire instrument, will reasonably admit a construction not involving such disposition that construction must prevail, and no necessity for an election in such case will arise. <em>A fortiori </em>will no election be required where the language of the will clearly excludes the purpose to dispose of the property of another.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b580-9\">(Decided January 26, 1898.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-10\">Error to the Circuit Court of Montgomery county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-11\">The controversy had its origin in the court of common pleas, by the filing of a petition by John P. Charch as executor of John S. Charch, deceased, against Emma B. Charch, Kate Brendel, Nettie Bonner, Minnie Charch and John P. Charch, in which it was averred in substance, that John S. Charch died testate in the summer of 1891, and his will and codicil thereto were thereafter probated, and plaintiff appointed executor; that he left Emma B. Charch, widow, and the other defendants, his children, all of full age; that during his life John S. Charch united with an order called the Legion of Honor, which order created a fund for the protection and benefit of families or mem-, bers thereof, the family or such, or any of them as the member directs, to receive, upon his decease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>not to exceed $3,000; that when said Charch became a member he directed that in the certificate issued to him, his wife Emma B., should receive the amount payable at his decease, and that after his decease, in the fall of 1891, Emma B. received that amount from the order, no other direction having been given the said order. Then follow like averments respecting membership, etc., in Lodge No. 48, of an association known as the Ancient Order of United Workmen ; the issue of a certificate also payable to Emma B., which was never changed, and the receipt by her, about January 1, 1892, of $2,000 from the association thereon. The petition further stated that the defendants other than Emma B. and John P., claim that the testator, at the time of making the codicil referred to, made an agreement with Emma B., whereby she was to receive a further sum by will, and she in turn was to pay over the amounts she would derive from the aforesaid insurance; that in the codicil the testator bequeathed to her an additional sum of one thousand dollars; that the will and codicil are still in force; that she has accepted under the same, but refuses to pay over the insurance money; that if Emma B. is liable for the return of the money, the amount due is $5,000, with interest, etc., for which judgment is prayed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-6\">Emma B. Charch answered, asserting her rightful claim to the insurance money, and denying the making of the contract alleged; also setting up the provisions of the will in her favor in these words: \u201c That the said will provides for the payment to her, during her life, of the sum of $100 per month, so long- as her two daughters, Anna M. Charch and Minnie Charch, remain unmarried, and after their marriage the sum of $70 per month and also secures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>to her the use of the residence, No. 348 South Main Street, Dayton, Ohio, during her natural life, free of taxes, assessments, and expenses of repairs ; and the furniture contained in said house, and a horse, harness and carriage was devised to her absolutely.\u201d She also averred that the estate was of the value of at least $80,000, and that the provisions under the will which she accepted were much less than she would have been entitled to under the law. She further averred that during her married life she inherited from her father one thousand dollars ; that her husband took charge of it and purchased a piece of land which conveyed to a son-in-law, and that at the time of the making of the codicil she requested him to provide for the payment to her of that sum, which he did by the bequest of one thousand dollars, and that sum was bequeathed for that purpose and no other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-5\">Kate D. Brendel and Nettie Bonner answered, denying, for lack of information, the averments of the petition as to the certificates providing that Emma B. should receive the amounts named therein; also denied that the widow received the money from the companies, and averred that it was collected by the executor and improperly paid over by him to her. And, by cross-petition, set up that the dues and assessments in both orders were paid by John S. Charch personally; that the widow had no vested right therein; that the sum to be paid by each order upon the death of John S. Charch were subject to his disposition, either by assignment or by will; that by his last will said testator directed that his said executor should collect the insurance upon his life (intending to include and dispose of the insurance in the petition mentioned), and that he should distribute the proceeds of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>same in accordance with, the terms of the will and codicil; that this intent was made known to Emma B. at the time of the execution of the codicil, 'and that she then expressed her approval of and satisfaction with the same, and subsequently, after the probate of the will and codicil, elected to take under the same, and has since received the benefit thereby given; that they (these defendants) are legatees and devisees under the will, and that as such there is due to each of them a balance of $2,000, and interest; that the same should properly be paid out of the proceeds of the insurance on the life of decedent, including that improperly paid to said Emma B., and they therefore join in the prayer of the petition for judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-4\">To this pleading Emma B. replied, denying the new matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-5\">The common pleas, upon trial, found the issues for Emma B. Charch, and rendered judgment for her. This judgment was reversed by the circuit court. Its finding is: \u201c1st. It was manifest from the will and codicil of said John S. Charch, testator, that he intended to, and did, dispose of all the insurance on his life, amounting to the sum of sixteen thousand, five hundred dollars ($16,500), without regard to the beneficiary stated in the policy. 2nd. That the said widow, Emma B. 'Charch, elected to take under will of her husband, and continues to assert her right under the said will, and that if she demanded the insurance money aforesaid, which is bequeathed to other party than herself, she acts in contravention of said will. 3rd. That having elected to take under the said will, and continuing to assert her right to all the benefits thereby conferred, she is estopped to make any claim to the insurance money covered by the</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>bequest in the will and codicil, and that she must, therefore, return the said sum of five thousand dollars so received by her, with interest.\u201d Then follows a final judgment against Mrs. Charch for five thousand dollars, interest and costs. She asks a reversal of this judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b584-5\">Gotschall, <em>Brown &amp; </em>Crawford, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-6\">The fundamental principle is that the naming of the beneficiary in the certificate is an act testamentary in its character and the beneficiary has a vested right in the policy and its proceeds, and the certificate could not be changed without the consent of the beneficiary and in pursuance of the bylaws and regulations of the Association.

Charch made bis last will in which he made provision for Emma B. Charch, in lieu of dower and all statutory provisions and allowances,\u201d as stated in her answer, giving also to his four daughters, Kate D. Brendel, Nettie Bonner, Anna M. Charch and Minnie Charch, each five thousand dollars, to his son, John P. Charch, a business property in Dayton, in fee, and certain rents and income from other property, and providing farther, that at the death of the wife, or before with her consent, the executor should sell all the residue, real and personal, and divide the proceeds equally among his four daughters. The son was made executor without bond. May 21, 1801, he executed a codicil thereto the provisions of which are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\"><em>\u201cFirst </em>\u2014 I hereby revoke and declare to be null and void, so much of item 1, of my last will and testament, as relates to my daughters, Anna Charch and Minnie Charch.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\"><em>\u201cSecond </em>\u2014 I hereby, give, devise and bequeath to mydaughters, Anna Charch and Minnie Charch, the land recently purchased by me and situated on the north side of the Eaton pike, west of the city of Dayton, and containing 12.98 acres in fee simple, and free of all incumbrance to each the undivided one-half.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\"><em>\u201c Third </em>\u2014 I direct that my executor collect and realize on my life insurance policies, which I hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>upon my life, and distribute the proceeds in accordance with the terms of my will and codicil, and I further direct said executor to pay off any and all incumbrance which may be a lien on the real estate on the Eaton pike, west of Dayton, out of the proceeds so by him realized.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\"><em>\u201cFourth </em>\u2014 I further give and bequeath, to my widow, Emma B. Chareh, one thousand dollars, which shall be in addition to the other provisions contained in my will, and to be paid by my executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\"><em>u Fifth </em>\u2014 Y give, devise and bequeath to my daughter, Nettie Bonner, the lots on the corner of Jay and Wyoming- streets, in the city of Dayton, to her heirs and assigns forever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">June 1, 1891, John S. Chareh, deceased. June 8, following, the, will and codicil were probated, and, on the same day, the widow appeared in the pro-, bate court and elected \u201c to take and accept of the provisions made for me in said last will and testament and codicil, in lieu of my dower interest and distributive share of the personal estate.\u201d The allegations of the answer that the estate was of the value of at least $80,000, and the provisions for the widow under the will and codicil were less than that to which she would have been entitled under the law, are not denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Evidence was introduced by parties opposed to Mrs. Chareh of the tenor following: At the time the codicil was executed the testator was dangerously ill with heart disease, and the wife and all the members of the family regarded his condition as critical. There were present at the time, Mrs. Chareh, John P. Chareh, the son, and one Carl Baumann, the latter of whom drew the codicil. The matter was talked over by father and son be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>fore Baumann was called in, and at the request of the father, the son produced from a desk in the room a box containing the will and- other papers. At the request of the father, the son read to him the will. The father explained that he wanted to change the first item as to Anna and Minnie, and give them land instead. The mortgage on the land, about $4,000, he wanted paid, so that they would receive it clear. Among the papers were certain insurance policies and certificates on the life of the father. At his request the son figured them up and told his father they amounted to $16,500. He asked his father,then, \u201cwherethis money was to come from, and he said it was to come off these insurance policies.\u201d It was mentioned that the executor was'to collect the insurance money, and the iand was to be given to the girls, free of all incumbrance. The father asked the son to draw a codicil, but he declined, wanting his father to wait until morning and call in Judge Elliott; or some other lawyer, but the father, expressing a fea,r that he might not live until morning, refused to delay, and said Baumann could draw it. Mrs. Charch kept quiet and said nothing until it was arranged that Baumann (who was in another room) should be called in to write the codicil, and then she said she wanted one thousand dollars in lieu of the land her husband had bought with her money, which he consented to give her.' After Baumann came in she said something about his giving the girls more than he had, or \u201cyou haven\u2019t got money enough to pay all this, \u201d to which he replied that he thought he had, and explained that he intended Anna and Minnie to have the land instead of the five thousand dollars each. In one part of his testimony the son puts it this way: He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>stated how he wanted this insurance money distributed, and she asked him: \u201cPapa, what do I get?\u201d or something to that effect. \u201cWhy, \u201d he said, \u201cI provided for you.\u201d She said: \u201cI would like to have a thousand dollars that you had to buy this land,\u201d and he says: \u201cIs there enough left?\u201d I says, \u201cYes, there will be enough left.\u201d The outline of what was wanted was given to Baumann, and he wrote the codicil, which was then read aloud and duly executed. It is difficult to determine exactly what Mrs. Charch did say, as the two witnesses are somewhat at variance, and the principal one, who undertakes to give it several times, fails to state it twice alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The foregoing- is a brief epitome of the testimony as to what took place at the time of the drawing of the codicil. Necessarily many statements and incidents are omitted here, but the above, it is believed, contains all that makes against Mrs. Charch. She did not participate in the making of the codicil, by either act or word, save in the making of the bequest as to the thousand dollars, and the suggestion of doubt of there being money enough to pay, whatever that may have been. It was clearly shown by the testimony of the son, that the thousand dollars referred to was money which Mrs. Charch had received from her father\u2019s estate and had loaned to her husband who used it in the purchase of land which he had conveyed to a son-in-law. It does not appear that Mrs. Charch saw any of the insurance papers, or was apprised of their contents. Nothing at all was said about any of the insurance certificates or policies being those which had been made to her, nor was she asked to give up any interest of that kind, nor did she, by word or act, directly attempt to do so, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the claim that she then understood that the policies to be used by the executor in paying legacies, etc., provided by the will and codicil included any which were payable to her, rests entirely on inference. She was present. She may have heard all that was said, and she may not. She did nothing, and said nothing by way of assent or dissent with respect to the use of the insurance money. She may have understood that her certificates were to be included, and she may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Of course if a contract is to be found it must rest upon what occurred at the time the codicil was drawn. Statements and acts afterward might throw light on what then took place, hut that which makes for as well as that which makes against Mrs. Charch, should be considered. Conversations about the time of the probating of the will are testified to which, if believed, tend to show that Mrs. Charch then consented that the proceeds of her certificates might go into the estate, and give color to the claim that she had so understood the matter all along, and certain acts shortly after that are consistent with that conclusion, but, on the other hand, other acts and claims made by her about the same time, or shortly after, are wholly at variance with it. Taken together, they evidence a woman somewhat broken, and one who did not well know her own mind. But our conclusion upon the controlling facts of the case renders it unnecessary to dwell upon this feature of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The evidence was introduced for two purposes : (1) To establish the alleged contract of Mrs. Charch with her husband to give up her insurance certificates, or the proceeds, and (2) to maintain the claim that it was the intent of the testator to include the certificates which belonged to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>among those which the executor was to collect and distribute in accordance with the will and codicil, and that she, at the time of the execution of the codicil, understood that intent and assented to it, and that her election afterward to take under the will and codicil instead of under the law, and the receipt by her of the benefits thus granted to her preclude her from now claiming the benefit of the insurance certificates. If competent for either purpose the evidence was properly received.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">First, as to the contract. To sustain it two elements are necessary: a meeting of the minds, and valid consideration. It will be noted that. the evidence shows no discussion upon the night in question respecting the will so far as Mrs. Charch was concerned, and no suggestion that the provisions therein made for her benefit were to be disturbed. It will be farther noted that the only benefit she was to derive from the codicil was the legacy of one thousand dollars. The proposition; then, is, that she, knowingly and intentionally, agreed to surrender the sum of five thousand dollars already secured to her by the certificates and take in return the one thousand dollars provided by the codicil, a thing so inherently improbable that very strong and direct proof of the promise would be needed to justify a holding that she knowingly assented to the proposition. The alleged promise on her part should be clearly shown. It may, however, be said that the evidence tends to show that she assented to such an arrangement, and, while we think that in a case like this one the fact of the promise should be clearly established, or the contention ought to fail, still, as this presents aquestion of preponderance of evidence, this court would not be disposed to disturb the holding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>the court below upon such a difference of opinion. Waiving this, there remains the matter of consideration for the promise. What was it in this case? We scan the record in vain to find one that is'substantial, or that will stand in law. The benefit to be derived for this surrender, if any there were, was the thousand dollar legacy. But that was simply a provision for the payment by the husband of a debt he owed her, one which, had he made no provision for paying\", she could have collected against his estate, and that without in the least affecting any other benefit which accrued to her by the will. He was, then, paying an undisputed debt, not making a gift, nor giving a legacy in lieu of any other benefit. The consideration for the legacy was the obligation arising from the loan of the money by the wife'; she was in this way simply getting back her own. Under such circumstances the agreement to pay the debt by a legacy can afford no consideration for any other promise by the wife, if one were made ; and it results that the claimed contract wholly fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Second, as to the intent of the testator. The proposition is to establish that intent by oral testimony. Can it be done? The provision in question is : \u201cI direct that my executor collect and realize on all my life insurance policies, which I hold on my life, and distribute the proceeds in accordance with the terms of my will and codicil,\u201d etc. The subject-matter is <em>Ms policies </em>\u2014 my policies, is the phrase. The words following, \u201c which I hold \u201d would, in common parlance, signify manual possession, but the expression is subordinate to that which precedes, and, taken in connection with it, implies possession of that which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>his. Nor is the result different if a technical legal meaning be given the word \u201chold. \u201d In deeds it signifies tenure. But tenure cannot exist in favor of one respecting that in which he has no property interest. If the question were as to a devise of land in this form : \u201call my land of which I have possession,\u201d would any intelligent mind assume that the will evinced a purpose to convey land of another which might at the time happen to be in the possession of the testator ? Surely not. The canons of construction will not permit a provision clearly disposing only of property in the possession of the testator of which he is the owner to be held to include property in his possession which belongs to another. It follows that clause three of the codicil means that what insurance policies were his the testator disposed of. Those which were not his he did not dispose of, nor attempt to. By the undisputed facts it is established that the certificates in question were issued to the wife and so remained. Under the law, her interest in them, while not a vested one during the husband\u2019s life, was such as he could not change by testamentary disposition. When the by-laws provide, as those of these two orders do, a method by which the beneficiary may be changed that method must be pursued, and, where-no change is thus made, the company\u2019s promise to pay runs only to the person named in the certificate. This point is ruled for us by <em>Arthur </em>v. <em>Odd Fellows' Association, </em>29 Ohio St., 557. See also, as bearing upon the subject: <em>Weisert </em>v. Muehl, 81 Ky., 336; <em>Block </em>v. Association, 52 Ark., 201; <em>De Silva </em>v. <em>Supreme </em>Council, 109 Cal., 373; Bacon on Beneficial Societies, section 307; <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>111 Ind., 121; <em>Martin v. </em>Stubbings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>126 Ill., 387; <em>Association </em>v. Bunch, 109 Mo., 560; <em>Masonic Association </em>v. Jones, 154 Penna. State, 107. Nor is the fact that the insured paid the dues or assessments sufficient to overcome the legal effect of the terms of the contract. <em>Weber </em>v. Paxton, 48 Ohio St., 266. The by-laws of the orders forbid any other conclusion so long as the certificates remain in force, and this doubtless was known to the testator since he had been for years an officer in one of the orders, and presumably familiar with the rules of both. It follows that, giving effect to the terms of the codicil, the certificates of Mrs. Charch were not disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">But, under favor of the rule that the true intent of the testator is to be the guiding star in the interpretation of a will, it is proposed to extend the meaning of the words used in clause three so as to make them embrace insurance policies not his, and this by oral testimony. It cannot be done unless it be first shown thatthereis a false description, that is, that there are no policies or certificates on which the provision can operate. The rule is so well established that parol evidence cannot be permitted, either to contradict, add to or explain the contents of a written will, that authorities are hardly needed in its support. We content ourselves with citing\u2019 1 Jarman on Wills, 6th Ed., p. 412; <em>Painter </em>v. <em>Painter, </em>18 Ohio Rep., 247; <em>Collins </em>v. Hope, 20 Ohio Rep., 493, and Wigram on Wills, section 159, from which latter authority we quote : \u201cIf the words of the will are applicable to any subject, the court is inflexible in applying them accordingly.\u201d It therefore devolved upon those attacking Mrs. Charch\u2019s right to the certificate to show that, unless these should be included there would be nothing for the provision, as here<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>inbefore construed, to operate upon. There is no attempt affirmatively to show this, and the presumption from the whole record is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Our conclusion upon the whole case is that the widow was not required to elect between the provisions of the will and codicil and the benefit secured by these certificates. As held in <em>Huston </em>v. <em>Cone, </em>24 Ohio St., 11, \u201cwhere a will assumes to give to one of its beneficiaries property belonging to another person for whom provision is likewise made in the will, the latter is bound to elect whether he will claim the property so disposed of, or take the provision-made for him in the will. \u201d But it is also well settled that the language of the will expressive of the intent to give another\u2019s property must be unequivocal. If the provision in question, taken in connection with the whole will, will reasonably admit a construction not involving a disposition of such property, that construction must prevail. In order to create the necessity for an election, there must appear upon the face of the will itself a clear, unmistakable intention on the part of the testator to dispose of property which is in fact not his own. The language must be so clear as to leave no doubt as to the testator\u2019s design; the necessity for an election cannot arise from an uncertain or dubious interpretation of the will. We are not, however, required to look farther than the third clause of the codicil, for no other portion helps to explain that. Pomeroy\u2019s Equity, sections 472-3; 1 Jarman on Wills, 6th Ed., 460; 2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., section 1086. The case at bar is dissimiliar from <em>Hibbs </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>40 Ohio St., 543, relied upon in argument, in this important particular. There the description of the property of the wife was clearly defined, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>it was clearly included in the devise; here it is not only not clearly included, but is, as we think, clearly excluded by the terms of the codicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">It results that the controlling considerations in the case were the legal effect of the insurance certificates standing in the name of Mrs. Charch, and clause three of the codicil, as properly construed. The material facts being conceded it remained only to apply the correct rule of law. And the law being how held in her favor, Mrs. Charch is, under the ruling in <em>Minnear </em>v. <em>Hollo</em>way, 56 Ohio St., 148, entitled to judgment. The circuit court, therefore, did not err in rendering final judgment, but as we think and hold, did err in giving- judgment for the wrong party. The judgment of the circuit court will be reversed and that of the common pleas affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
