The cause came on for hearing in the circuit court on appeal, upon the following petition and supplemental petition:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-16\">The defendant is a corporation formed and organized under the laws of Ohio.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-17\">\u201cOne John F. Hastings, of Findlay, in said county, is owner in fee seized and possessed of one hundred and sixty-five acres of valuable mineral oil land, in Findlay, Ohio, and .more particularly designated as the west half of the northwest quarter of section No. 1, and the east half of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the northeast quarter of section No. 2, in township one, north range, ten east, and that plaintiff has a contract and agreement with said Hastings whereby plaintiff has the right to operate said lands for oil, and take the oil from said land, yielding to said Hastings, a portion or royalty of the oil so produced, the balance to be retained by plaintiff as his own property, and in virtue of said contract, plaintiff is now at work on said land, has two wells completed and a rig- up and ready to begin the drilling of a third well thereon. That said Hastings\u2019 land is joined on the east and west by lands now in the possession and control for oil purposes of the defendant, on which they now have producing oil wells; and the east eighty acres of said Hastings\u2019 farm is joined on the .south by mineral oil lands owned in fee by the said defendant, and on which also the defendant has producing oil wells.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-5\">\u201cThat underlying the land of said Hastings, and the lands so adjoining the same on the south and west and east, as aforesaid, is a formation of porous sand or Trenton rock, so-called, which is permeated with valuable mineral oil; that the nature of said mineral oil deposit is such, that when in the process of operating, an oil well is drilled from the surface down into and through said oil-bearing rock, and the usual pumping appliances attached to and employed on said well to extract oil therein, the oil will be drawn to said opening from a long distance through said porous rock, and all the oil within a radius of from two hundred to two hundred and fifty feet surrounding such well, will be drawn to and extracted by means of such well, so that in order to drain and exhaust all the oil in the land it is only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>necessary to drill the wells from four to five hundred feet apart.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-6\">\u201cThe defendants, well knowing the premises and designing wilfully and unlawfully to extract the mineral oil from in and under the said Hastings\u2019 land, by means of surface operations on the land so owned and controlled by them, in fraud and violation of the plaintiff; \u2019s right, and from motives of unmixed malice, have located a line of oil wells along the entire east line of said farm, and upon and along- the said south line of the east eighty acres of said farm, which wells are so located just twenty-five feet from the line of Hastings\u2019 land, and just four hundred feet apart, all of which wells so located, the defendants threaten and intend to drill at once, with the design and to the unlawful intent and purpose of aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-7\">\u201cThat in view of the well-known tendency of said wells to drain a large extent of territory immediately surrounding them, it is the custom and almost- universal practice of oil operators when operating adjoining lands, to locate their wells at least two hundred feet from the line of lands, in order that so far as reasonably practicable, each operator\u2019s well shall draw its supply from his own land, and not unnecessarily disturb or detract from the oil mineral wealth of the adjoining lands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-8\">\u201cThat the defendant\u2019s holding on the east, consist of about one hundred and sixty acres in a body, and on the south, a very large tract, to-wit: several hundred acres, and there is in the defendants operating said land for oil, no sort of necessity or excuse for the defendants to locate their said wells so unusually near the Hastings line, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>there are no wells at all on the Hastings\u2019 east or south line, except the wells operated by the defendant, which are more than two hundred feet from the defendant\u2019s line, and by plaintiff\u2019s contract with Hastings, which is of record well known to the defendant, no well is to be drilled by the plaintiff within two hundred feet of the exterior line of the farm unless it becomes necessary in order to protect the line ; so that the only motive of the defendant in so locating its said wells, was to injure the plaintiff and to get the oil which would be available to him in his operation of said farm. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-5\">\u2018 \u2018If the defendants are permitted to extract the plaintiff\u2019s oil in the manner as aforesaid, the plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury and will have no adequate legal remedy, for the reason that it will be impossible to determine the exact proportion of the product belonging to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-6\">\u201cWherefore, the plaintiff prays that a temporary restraining order issue, enjoining the defendant from drilling and operating any oil well twenty-live feet, or at any point within two hundred feet,of the line of said Hastings\u2019 farm, unless it should become necessary to approach nearer in order to protect the line, and that on the final hearing that said injunction be made perpetual.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-7\">\u201cAnd now comes the plaintiff by leave of this court, and for a supplemental petition and in addition to the allegations of the original petition, alleges that since the dissolution of the temporary injunction granted in this action, the defendants have proceeded and located and drilled, and are now operating for oil, or about to begin operating twelve oil wells, nine of which are at the points stated in the petition; and three of which are on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the Reimund farm adjoining the Hastings farm on the west; all of which wells are so completed and operating by means of pumping appliances, and all which wells are so operating about twenty-five feet from the lines of said farm.. That all of said wells are oil producing wells of greater or less capacity ; and that by means thereof, the defendants are daily extracting large and valuable quantities of mineral oil, a large part of which mineral oil is so drawn and extracted from the deposits thereof in the land of said Hastings, and which oil the plaintiff has, by his contract with said Hastings, the right to take and use and enjoy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-6\">\u201cThat said wells draw their supply so indiscriminately from the -mines and lands of said Hastings and of the. defendants, that it is impossible to distinguish that of the defendant from that of the plaintiff, but all of said oil is so being taken by the said defendant and converted to its own use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-7\">\u201cWherefore, in addition to the prayer of the petition, the plaintiff prays that the defendant be required to account to the plaintiff for the oil so taken ; that the amount thereof be ascertained and that the plaintiff may have a decree in judgment against the defendant therefor and for all proper relief.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-8\">The circuit court was of opinion that the petition and supplemental petition failed to state a cause of action against the Oil Company, and therefore refused to hear any evidence, and found from the pleadings in favor of the' defendant, to which plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number><em>George H.

Section 19 of Art. 1, Constitution of Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-9\">Much is said about the nature of petroleum oil, and quite a good deal of labor expended in efforts to find out whether it is part of the real estate in place, or whether it is not like the turkey and the deer, wild by nature, and belong-s to him only who first reduces it to possession. In the first place, it may be observed that those things which are termed in the books <em>feres natures </em>are <em>animate </em>not <em>inanimate; </em>these move themselves and do not wait to be moved by attraction, gravitation, or by any other force outside of themselves. A lake may receive its waters by percolating, oozing or filtering through the ground, and be furnished an outlet bjr similar processes, so that these waters as well while they compose the lake, as before they entered the basin and after they leave it, are \u201con <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the move, \u2019 \u2019 and so this modern philosophy stumbles at the problem of distinguishing between the waters of that lake and the flock of wild ducks as they float upon its placid bosom. And this same philosophy reaches the conclusion that inasmuch as both are \u201cwild by nature\u201d that neither is the subject of ownership until the water has been put into barrels and the ducks into game bags; and that the water no more than the ducks, as they swim, are conveyed by a deed of the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-4\">We think the authorities support the view that percolating water, and by like reason percolating 011 is a part of the real estate. <em>Roath </em>v. <em>Discoll, </em>20 Conn., 533. Water standing or percolating in the soil is part of it. <em>Wheatley </em>v. Baugh, 25 Pa. St., 528.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-7\">Where a subterranean flow of water has become so well defined as to constitute a regular and constant stream, the owner of the land above through which it flows, may not divert or destroy it to the injury of the person below on whose land it flows. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Vandergrift, </em>80 Pa. St., 147; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Spillman, </em>152 U. S., 665; <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>12 Ohio St., 294; <em>R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>14 Ind. Observe: The point is attempted to be made by plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the lateral support is removed from the plaintiff\u2019s oil, so that it sort of caves into the land of defendant and there is taken and used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-10\">There can be no substantial claim based upon such ground:</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-11\">1. Because the walls of the well do not cave, but there remains the 25 feet of solid rock between the well and plaintiff\u2019s line, and the excavation is not sufficient to cause or permit a cave or the giving way of lateral support.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>2. In the eases in which an action is maintainable for the removal of lateral support, reference is had to lateral support <em>in which the law recognizes the correlative rights of adjacent </em>owners, but never has an action been sustained for the removal of percolating fluids in which <em>the law recognizes no correlative rights in the owners. </em>If the law will not forbid its removal neither will the law, or equity, by mandatory injunction,, compel it to be left and not disturbed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-6\">3. Percolating oil cannot in the nature of things form such lateral support as is referred to in the line of cases mentioned; being itself \u2018 \u2018on the move,\u201d the idea of its forming a permanent lateral support cannot be entertained for a moment.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b345-7\">Burket, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akg\">The question is not as to the motive, fraud or malice which may have induced the oil company to drill the wells sought to be \u00e9n- ' joined. The only question of practical importance is, had the oil company the legal right to drill the wells ?</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">When a person has the legal right to do a certain' act, the motive with which it is done is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">The right to acquire, enjoy and own property, carries with it the right to use it as the owner pleases, so long as such use does not interfere with the legal rights of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">To drill an oil well near the line of one\u2019s land, can not interfere with the legal rights of the owner of the adjoining lands, so long as all operations are confined to the lands upon which the well is drilled. Whatever gets into the well, belongs to the owner of the well, no matter where it came from. In such cases the well and its contents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>belong to the owner or lessee of the land, and no one can tell to a certainty from whence the oil, gas or water which enters the well came, and no legal right as to the same can be established or enforced by an adjoining- land owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The right to drill and produce oil on .one\u2019s own land is absolute and can not be supervised or controlled by a court, or an adjoining land owner. So long as the operations are legal, their reasonableness can not be drawn in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">As was pointed out in <em>Letts </em>v. <em>Kessler, </em>54 Ohio St., 73, it is intolerable that the owner of real property, before making improvements on his own lands, should be compelled to submit to what his neighbor, or court of equity might regard as a reasonable use of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Petroleum oil is a mineral, and while in the earth it is part of the realty, and should it move from place to place by percolation or otherwise, it forms part of that tract of land in which it tarries for the time being, and if it moves to the next adjoining tract, it becomes part and parcel of that tract; and it forms part of some tract, until it reaches a well and is raised to the surface, and then for the first time it becomes the subject of distinct ownership separate from the realty, and becomes personal property, the property of the person into whose well it came. And this is so whether the oil moves, percolates, or exists in pools or deposits. In either event, it is property of, and belongs to, the person who reaches it by means of a well, and severs it from the realty and converts it into personalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">While it is generally supposed that oil is drained into wells for a distance of several hundred feet, the is matter somewhat uncertain, and no right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>sufficient weight can be founded upon such uncertain supposition, to overcome the well-known right which every man has to use his property as he pleases, so long he does not interfere with the legal rights of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Protection of lines of adjoining lands by the drilling of wells on both sides of such lines, affords an ample and sufficient remedy for the supposed grievances complained of in the petition and supplemental petition, without resort to either an injunction or an accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The case of <em>Coal Company </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>48 Ohio St., 41, and <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Chartiers Valley Gas Company, </em>131 Pa. St., 143, and other like cases in which some harmful substance was sent, conveyed or caused to go from the premises .of one to the premises of another, have no application here, because in this case, nothing reached the plaintiff\u2019s lands from the premises of the defendant, and the only complaint is, that the oil company soused its own premises as to secure and appropriate to its own use, that which came into its lands by percolation, or by flowing through, unknown natural underground channels. This it had a right to do. While the drilled oil well is artificial, the pores and channels through which the oil reached the bottom of the well, are natural.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
