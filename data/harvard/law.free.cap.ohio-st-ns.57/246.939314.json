The charge meets the case as plaintiff made it, and he cannot complain if the court did not read a treatise or essay on fraud to the jury, covering all its \u25a0various phases. Vol. 28, Amer. and Eng. Ency., 858.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-17\">Fraud and deceit implies bad faith, and has for its basis guilty knowledge, , and hence the charge correctly announced the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>The circuit court held that there were two causes of action set forth in the petition filed in the action in the court of common pleas, the first, declared upon an express warranty of the mare, and the second upon a false warrant}\u201d or deceit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-4\">This was not the theory upon which the action was tried in that court, and we confidently submit, the petition will not bear any such construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-5\">We submit that it sets forth but one cause of action, that of false warranty or deceit, with special damages. <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Mc </em>Coy, 21 Ohio St., 655.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-6\">We may admit that a sufficient number of allegations of fact might be taken from this petition to make a cause of action upon an express warranty, but how could 'a petition be drawn declaring upon a false warranty or deceit of which the same could not be said? The allegations of fact declaring upon an express warranty, and a false warranty would be practically the same, except in the latter, the scienter must be alleged, and this, is what distinguishes the two actions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-7\">The weight of authority is to the effect that the code provisions have not abolished the distinction between causes of action <em>excontractu </em>and exdelicto, even when they arise out of the same transaction, although there are decisions to the contrary. <em>Cohoon </em>v. <em>Bank of </em>Utica, 4 How.

A fraudulent sale is not void but voidable, at the election of the vendee. If there is a warranty, and the sale is fraudulent, the party may elect to keep the property and sue for a breach of the warranty, or he may return the property and avoid the sale.

B. Foster </em>and <em>W. E.

Bronson, 20 Ohio St., 54; 1 Herman Estop, etc., section 258.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-8\">The question presented is, whether or not a plaintiff must resort to a new action for his remedy on a warranty, when he fails in his action for fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-9\">A plaintiff is directed, in his petition to state the facts constituting his cause of action in ordinary and concise language, and demand the relief to which he thinks himself entitled. Section 5060, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-10\">The plaintiff, in this case, alleged the facts just as he believed them to be \u2014 he had been informed' and he believed that the defendant knew the representations in question to be false, and he so averred, and asked for the relief to which he thought himself entitled; but, according to the charge of the trial court, he did so at his peril \u2014 if he failed to satisfy the jury that the defendant knew the representations to be false, he could not recover anything although he proved the warranty, the breach of it, and damages resulting; and he must go out of court, and in a new action reaver and reprove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the same things averred and proved in the trial had, against the same party, in order to get the relief to which he is entitled, omitting only in the petition the averment that the defendant knew the representations w\u00e9re false.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-5\">The claim to recover on the warranty in the event of failure to establish the fraud was made on the trial; but the court, in the charge to the jury, positively prohibited such a recovery. An exception was taken to the charge for that reason. Section 5019, Revised Statutes, expressly authorizes the joinder of several causes of action when they are included in \u201cthe same transaction, or transactions, connected with the same subject of action.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-6\">And this includes causes of action legal and equitable, <em>excontractu </em>and <em>exdelicto.

The petition alleges, in addition to the warranty and its breach, that the defendant knew, at the time of the sale that the animal was not what it was warranted to be. On the trial of the issued joined by a denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>of the warranty and its breach, and of the defendant\u2019s knowledge that the warranty was false, the jury was instructed, in substance, that to entitle the plaintiff to a verdict in the case, it was necessary for him to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant knew the warranty was false in some material particular, or had reason to believe it to be false. The judgment rendered on the verdict, which was for the defendant, was reversed for error in giving the foregoing instruction; and, upon the question concerning which the courts below entertained different opinions, the case has been ordered to be reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The contention of counsel for the plaintiff in error appears to be, that the effect of the averment charging the defendant with knowledge of the falsity of the warranty, was to make the action one for deceit or fraud; and, therefore, proof of such knowledge was essential to the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery; otherwise, the petition would include two inconsistent causes of action which could not be joined.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The code permits a plaintiff to state the' facts which constitute his cause of action; and when, upon any of the facts so stated, he is entitled to recover, he cannot be denied that right because he has alleged other facts that he is unable to prove. A warranty in a sale of chattel property is a part of the contract; and the warrantor is bound by it, and answerable in damages for its breach, though he may have honestly believed the article to be as warranted. But the representations of the seller may fall short of an express warranty\u00bb and yet may be such as induce the purchaser to rely upon them, and entitle him to redress against the seller if the latter knew they were false, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>recklessly made them without reasonable ground for believing them to be true. And which of these phases of his case the purchaser may be able to sustain by proof, can only be determined on the trial. But proof of either, entitles him to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">And it is competent, we think, for a plaintiff to state in his pleading all the facts of the transaction which enter into his right to recover, as he believes them to be, though they present different grounds of recovery, and admit of different modes or measures of relief; and he may ultimately have that relief to which the allegations proved, show him entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The petition of the plaintiff alleges an express warranty of the horse, and a breach of that warranty; and, his right to recover the damages resulting from that breach was not affected by the allegation of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the falsity of the warranty. The latter allegation did not, as counsel for the plaintiff in error contends, change the action to one exclusively for deceit, nor is it inconsistent with those upon the warranty; they may all be true. Whether there is more than one cause of action stated in the petition, is a question upon which differences of opinion may exist. But it need not now be determined. If there are two, one for breach of the warranty, .and the other for fraud, they grew out of the same transaction, and may be properly joined in the same petition; and no motion having been made to require them to be separately stated, that objection to the petition, if it were open to it, was waived by answer. In favor of the view that there is but one cause of action stated, it may be said, there was but a single transaction between the parties \u2014 the negotiations resulting in the sale of the horse; there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>was but one wrong of the defendant \u2014 the sale of an unsound animal as and for a sound- one; and there is but one right of the plaintiff growing out of the wrong, and that is, to have redress for the injury he sustained in consequence of it, and for which he can have but one recovery. And a statement of all the facts of the transaction, with a demand for the relief desired, as one cause of action, seems more in harmony with our reformed system of pleading than a repetition of them, which becomes necessary, in part at least, in their statement as separate causes of action. But in either event, whether the petition contains but one cause of action, or two, the plaintiff, upon proof of the warranty and that it was broken to his damage was entitled to a verdict, notwithstanding he failed to establish by proof the defendant\u2019s knowledge that the warranty was false; and as this right was denied him by the instruction given to the jury, the reversal of the judgment for that reason was not error</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\n<em>Judgment affi/rmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
