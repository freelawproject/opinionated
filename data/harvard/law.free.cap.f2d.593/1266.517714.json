ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1327-20\">Appellees are operators of retail stores in the Washington-Baltimore area known as Ply* Gem paneling centers. They instituted this litigation in the District Court for the District of Columbia against the Ply* Gem companies, related concerns engaged in the manufacture and marketing of wood paneling and associated products.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One of these companies, Ply*Gem of Laurel, Inc., licensed appellees to operate their paneling centers, which feature Ply*Gem products as their principal line and utilize Ply*Gem trademarks and tradenames in their advertising. The first two counts of the complaint charge the companies with foisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>exclusive dealing and tying arrangements upon their franchisees in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Section 3 of the Clayton Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The remaining three counts allege fraud, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">Appellants, the Ply*Gem companies, moved to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction and for improper venue. The District Court rebuffed these challenges, finding that the companies had transacted business in the District of Columbia at the time of the alleged antitrust violations<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and deeming that fact sufficient to sustain venue and extraterritorial service of process under Section 12 of the Clayton Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The companies also requested the court to stay prosecution of the fraud, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty counts pending arbitration of those claims pursuant to a provision common to the franchise agreements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court denied the stay, reasoning that \u201c[ajrbitration will not resolve the basic antitrust claims and the parties have already attempted arbitration without success.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This ensuing appeal tenders several issues for our consideration. We conclude initially that the District Court\u2019s order refusing a stay is appealable,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that its denial of the motion to dismiss for want of proper venue and service is also properly before us.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We then affirm the court\u2019s disposition of the latter motion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We reverse, however, the order refusing to stay proceedings on the common law counts to enable arbitration.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-20\">I. APPEALABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"A7o\">A. <em>The Stay Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-21\">The District Court\u2019s refusal to stay itself obviously is not a final order for purposes of this appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is well established, however, that an order disposing of a motion for a stay is to be treated as a ruling on a motion for an injunction \u2014 and as such, though interlocutory, immediately appealable <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 provided that two conditions are satisfied.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> First, the litigation in which the order is entered must be legal rather than equitable in character.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Second, the stay must have been sought to enable the prior determination of an equitable defense.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>This rule, much-maligned as divorced from any rational or coherent appeals policy,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> is the result of reasoning by historical analogy to the days when the chancellor would enjoin a court of law from proceeding in an action after an equitable defense thereto had been asserted.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-4\">An agreement to arbitrate a legal dispute is considered an equitable defense.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus the appealability of the order denying the stay here turns wholly upon whether the underlying litigation is legal or equitable in nature. If legal, the ruling is analogous to the chancellor\u2019s refusal to enjoin proceedings in a law court; if equitable, the order is comparable to the chancellor\u2019s decree on the sequence in which issues shall be tried in his own court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">All five counts of the franchisees\u2019 complaint clamor for extensive damages.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The first two, incorporating the antitrust claims, also pray that the Ply*Gem companies \u201cbe required to refund to the [franchisees] all profits and/or kickbacks and/or mark-ups of Ply*Gem and/or its affiliates in connection with the sale of merchandise, supplies, material and services to the\u201d franchisees.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Additionally, the first four counts request \u201csuch other relief as shall be deemed just and proper.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-9\">We thus are faced with a complaint seeking both equitable and legal relief, presenting what we have called \u201cthe most troublesome case[ ]\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> in this area of federal appellate jurisdiction. Because piecemeal appeals are disfavored, we have embraced a presumption that the pending action is equitable, but that may be overborne if the request for equitable relief is incidental or clearly subordinate to essentially legal claims.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We believe that the franchisees\u2019 claims are basically legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-10\">The principal relief sought is an award of damages.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Although the call for return of profits, kickbacks and mark-ups arguably constitutes a plea for an accounting and restitution, we have held that an entreaty of this sort does not divest an action for damages of \u201cits character as an action at law . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Moreover, recoupment of these items is asked in the antitrust counts, while the order appealed from is a refusal to stay proceedings on the common law counts.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The franchisees also rely on the prayer of the first four counts for \u201csuch other relief as shall be deemed just and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>proper.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> This boilerplate is simply a byproduct of cautious pleading, however, and does not alter the fundamental nature of the litigation.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">In short, the historical analysis by which the appealability of orders granting or denying stays of judicial proceedings is to be determined indicates that the order appealed from is a contemporary analogue to the chancellor\u2019s refusal to enjoin an action at law. We therefore have jurisdiction.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">B. <em>The Denial of the Motion to Dismiss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">In general, of course, an order denying a motion to dismiss is not immediately appealable.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> But, on appeal of an interlocutory order granting or denying an injunction, an appellate court may properly determine whether there is an \u201cinsuperable objection to maintaining the bill\u201d and hence whether dismissal is required.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> In <em>Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp.,</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court held that a federal court of appeals reviewing an interlocutory injunctive order has power to pass on the correctness of a denial of a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction and failure to state a cause of action. This principle applies with full force to the Ply*Gem companies\u2019 motion to dismiss for improper venue<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and lack of personal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Thus, the District Court\u2019s rejection of the companies\u2019 challenge to its venue and jurisdiction is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-15\">II. VENUE AND PERSONAL JURISDICTION UNDER SECTION 12 OF THE CLAYTON ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-16\">The Ply* Gem companies implore us to order dismissal of the antitrust claims for improper venue and ineffective service of process. With respect to each of these prerequisites to their action, the franchisees rely primarily<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> upon Section 12 of the Clayton Act, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1330-17\">Any suit, action, or proceeding under the antitrust laws against a corporation may be brought not only in the judicial district wherein it is an inhabitant, but also in any district wherein it may be found or transacts business; and all process in such cases may be served in the district of which it is an inhabitant, or wherever it may be found.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>The companies moved to dismiss the suit on the grounds that venue was not properly laid in the District of Columbia and that personal jurisdiction was not obtained over them. The District Court denied the motion, holding that the \u201c[djefendants had a continuing relationship with some plaintiff corporations found in the District of Columbia,\u201d that \u201crevenues were obtained from the District of Columbia in sufficient quantity,\u201d and that \u201cit is not essential to venue that business must still be transacted as of the date of the filing of the complaint.\u201d <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> We concur with the District Court, though we find it necessary to expand somewhat upon its rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\">Ply*Gem of Laurel authorized the franchisees to operate retail paneling stores exhibiting the Ply*Gem tradename and carrying products bearing the Ply* Gem trademark.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Ply*Gem of Laurel further covenanted to provide each franchisee with a guaranteed source of supply of Ply*Gem and other products and with training and guidance in the management of their outlets.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Each franchise was granted for a period of fifteen years, running well into the 1980s.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> In return, each of the franchisees paid Ply* Gem of Laurel $10,000.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Effectiveness of each agreement was contingent upon approval by Ply*Gem Industries, the corporate parent of Ply*Gem of Laurel.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1331-15\">The Ply* Gem companies launch their attack upon the propriety of suit in the District of Columbia from two facts: Ply*Gem of Laurel sold its last shipment of products to a plaintiff franchisee located in the District \u2014 Harbinger\u2019s, Inc. \u2014 in July, 1976, but the franchisees\u2019 action was not commenced until August 12, 1976.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The temporal reference of Section 12\u2019s \u201ctransactpng] business\u201d test, the companies argue, is the date suit is brought. Accordingly, they conclude, venue may not be laid in the District under Section 12 and extraterritorial service on them was not authorized thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-16\">We disavow the companies\u2019 hyperliteral interpretation of Section 12. To be sure, the section is cast in the present tense; <footnotemark>46</footnotemark> but Congress may have intended it to be read in the historical present tense.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The discernible decisional trend is to deem a judicial district an appropriate forum under Section 12 so long as the defendant transacted substantial business therein when the events giving rise to the putative antitrust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>violation occurred.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The policy and legislative history of Section 12, to which we now turn, persuade us to hew to that course.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">General venue statutes are drafted to specify trial locations convenient for parties and witnesses.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Section 12, by contrast, is a special venue provision tailored for corporate antitrust defendants, whose convenience Congress was not particularly solicitous of.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Section 12, this court has said, \u201cwas intended by Congress to be an important facet in the scheme of private remedies devised to promote the objectives of the antitrust laws.\u201d <footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">As introduced, the provision that was to become Section 12 simply reiterated the language of Section 7 of the Sherman Act, which specified that suits against a corporation could be brought only in the district where it was an \u201cinhabitant\u201d or could be \u201cfound.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> This was unsatisfactory to the House, where Congressman Cullop summed up the sentiment: \u201cI do not want to make a resident of California come to Trenton, N.J. to bring a suit for violation of this law, but I want him to sue at home in the jurisdiction where the cause of action arose.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Toward that end, the House amended the provision by adding \u201cor has an agent.\u201d <footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The Senate Judiciary Committee rejected this amendment and changed the provision to its present form.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The final version attracted little attention until Congressman Webb, the manager of the bill in conference, explained just before approval of the Conference Report that \u201cwe have thrown the doors of the court wide open for the first time to every man who is injured. He can enter the court at his home and sue a man or corporation who injures him. \u00bb <footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>While this history does not specifically answer the question presented to us, we think we would dishonor the evident purpose of Congress should we rule that venue under Section 12 is improper as to a corporate defendant that transacts substantial business in a district, which assertedly gives rise to antitrust violations, but then departs prior to the institution of suit.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> We thus conclude that at least in situations where the business activities relied on to establish Section 12 venue are bound up in the course of conduct alleged to transgress the antitrust laws, the temporal frame of reference of that section is the point at which the cause of action arises, not the date suit is commenced.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-10\">The upshot of this is that venue as to Ply* Gem of Laurel is proper in the District of Columbia. And since this litigation must continue, we leave to the District Court the initial determination of whether the related corporate defendants, Ply*Gem Industries, Inc., and Ply*Gem Home Centers, Inc., have themselves transacted business in the District either independently or by controlling the operations of Ply*Gem of Laurel.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> These matters are not sufficiently explicated by the franchisees\u2019 complaint or the companies\u2019 moving affidavit to per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>mit a sound resolution of them on this appeal. In these circumstances, we think the franchisees should be afforded the opportunity to amend their complaint to state with more specificity just what business activities these defendants may have conducted in the District.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1334-4\">III. ARBITRATION</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-5\">[V] We agree with the Ply* Gem companies, however, that the District Court erred in declining to stay proceedings on the common law counts of the franchisees\u2019 complaint pending arbitration. Each of the franchise contracts contains a provision specifying that \u201c[a]ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The enforceability of this stipulation is governed by the United States Arbitration Act,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> under which an arbitration clause in a contract involving interstate commerce is made \u201cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d <footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The Act specifically requires a federal court in which suit is brought \u201cupon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration\u201d to stay its hand while arbitration ensues.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1334-7\">There is no dispute among the parties over the scope of the arbitration provision of the franchise agreements: the common law claims are covered, while the antitrust claims are not.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Yet the franchisees concur in the District Court\u2019s refusal to stay proceedings on the common law counts, arguing that the issues raised therein are intertwined legally and factually with those generated by the antitrust counts. Invoking the so-called permeation doctrine,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> they reason that where it would be impracticable for an arbitrator to separate the antitrust questions from the arbitrable ones, the entire action should be tried by the court lest the important public policies served by judicial resolution of antitrust controversies be subverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-17\">The franchisees misread the permeation doctrine. Many of our sister circuits have held that where substantial antitrust claims are legally and factually inextricable from arbitrable contract claims, arbitration may be stayed pending the court\u2019s decision on the antitrust issues.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> This conclusion stems from two considerations. First, arbitral determinations are by statute accorded considerable deference in court; judicial authority to tamper with an arbitration award is limited.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Second, antitrust claims should not be resolved by arbitration. For one thing, antitrust violations are public matters, and Congress probably did not intend \u201cthe national interest in a competitive economy\u201d to be subject to private methods of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>dispute resolution.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> For another, the complexity of antitrust issues makes them \u201cfar better suited to judicial than to arbitration procedures.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Additionally, it has been thought to be of \u201cquestionable propriety\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> to entrust the decision of antitrust questions to commercial arbitrators when \u201cit is the business community generally that is regulated by the antitrust laws.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">We perceive no present need to evaluate the soundness of the permeation doctrine. For even in the cases fashioning and applying that doctrine, arbitration proceedings were simply postponed pending definitive resolution of the antitrust issues in a federal court.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> They provide no authority for the ruling that the franchisees seek: that arbitrable claims become subject to adjudication in court merely because they are related to non-arbitrable claims. Protection of the policy interest furthered by judicial resolution of antitrust disputes does not require judicial proceedings so inclusive, given the court\u2019s capacity to stay arbitration proceedings when necessary or desirable.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1335-6\">The District Court\u2019s refusal to stay litigation of the claims arising out of the franchise contracts pending arbitration deprived the Ply*Gem companies of the benefit of their bargain and ran counter to the Arbitration Act, which clearly expresses a mandate for judicial recognition of commercial arbitration agreements.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> It must, then, be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-13\">The District Court\u2019s order denying the Ply*Gem companies\u2019 motion to dismiss the antitrust counts for want of personal jurisdiction and for improper venue is affirmed as to defendant Ply* Gem of Laurel. Its order refusing to stay proceedings on the common law counts of the franchisees\u2019 complaint pending arbitration is reversed. The case is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-14\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1327-13\">.

Section 22 of the Sherman Act, </em>115 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1007, 1009 (1967), that reliance on this language as authority for construing \u00a7 12 to encompass the transaction of business at the time the cause of action accrues is unwarranted for two reasons. First, the Court was discussing the extraterritorial service provision of \u00a7 12, not its venue provision. Second, the Court was concerned with a foreign corporation whose withdrawal might preclude suit altogether, as distinguished from an American corporation necessarily subject to suit in some district. While a close reading of <em>Scophony, </em>in light of the authorities therein cited, e. <em>g., People\u2019s Tobacco Co. v. American Tobacco Co., </em>246 U.S. 79, 38 S.Ct. 233, 62 L.Ed. 587 (1918) cited in <em>United States v.

And there is no reason to suppose that \u00a7 12 was designed to reach foreign national corporations but not American corporations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"58\">\n<p id=\"b1333-12\">. The court in <em>In re Chicken Antitrust Litigation, </em>407 F.Supp. 1285, 1293 (N.D.Ga.1975), opined that when business transacted in the forum district is related to the alleged antitrust violations, the \u201ctime of accrual\u201d construction of \u00a7 12 may be correct. On the other hand, the court held, where the business conducted in the forum district prior to commencement of suit bears no relation to the cause of action, such business cannot be relied upon to lay venue under \u00a7 12. We have no occasion to consider the validity of the latter thesis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"59\">\n<p id=\"b1333-13\">. On the control question, see <em>San Antonio Tel. Co., Inc. v.

This appeal does not present the question whether in the instant case arbitration proceedings should be stayed pending judicial determination of the antitrust claims. See, e. <em>g., A. &amp; E. Plastik Pak Co. v. Monsanto Co., </em>396 F.2d 710, 716 (9th Cir. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"75\">\n<p id=\"b1335-23\">. See generally, <em>Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., </em>417 U.S. 506, 94 S.Ct. 2449, 41 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974); <em>Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., </em>388 U.S. 395, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-24\">The District Court\u2019s order refusing to stay proceedings on the common law counts also rested on the belief that arbitration had already been unsuccessfully attempted. <em>Lee v. Ply*Gem Indus., Inc., supra </em>note 5, at 1, App. 207. The record reveals, however, that while the franchisees initially pressed for arbitration as provided by the contracts, they voluntarily withdrew their request before arbitration proceedings commenced. App. 183. We are at a loss to perceive why the franchisees\u2019 retraction of their demand for arbitration should preclude the Ply*Gem companies from relying on the agreement to arbitrate instead of litigate disputes arising out of the sublicense contracts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
