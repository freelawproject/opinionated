Fulford contends that the Florida conviction, for the offense of escape, is constitutionally invalid because he was denied the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed him by the sixth amendment. The district court dismissed the petition without a hearing on alternative grounds: (1) Fulford was not \u201cin custody\u201d as required by section 2254 because he had completed service of the prison sentence imposed for the escape conviction, and (2) the petition fails to allege facts showing that his counsel was ineffective. Because we find that Fulford\u2019s constitutional claim is without merit, it is unnecessary for us to resolve the in custody issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Fulford is presently confined in the Louisiana State Penitentiary, Angola, Louisiana, while serving a life sentence for murder. He filed the petition now before us because the director of classification at the Angola penitentiary has informed him that two pri- or Florida convictions, one being the escape conviction presently under attack, are hampering him in regard to job assignments and custody classification as well as parole consideration. Record, at 1, Exh. \u201cG.\u201d These collateral consequences, Fulford argues, satisfy the in custody requirement of section 2254 and, coupled with his assertion that his escape conviction is infirm under the sixth amendment, mandate the issuance of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b78-15\">The background of Fulford\u2019s prosecution for escape is as follows. On October 5, 1954, Fulford was convicted in Florida state court on a charge of assault with intent to commit manslaughter and sentenced to a prison term of ten years. On January 7, 1957, while serving that sentence, Fulford escaped. He was apprehended and on September 4, 1957 was sentenced to four years for escape. On appeal, his escape conviction was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial. <em>See Fulford </em>v. <em>State, </em>113 So.2d 572 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1959). On remand, Fulford was tried, without the benefit of counsel, and again convicted; on September 8, 1959, he was once more sentenced to four years. The conviction was affirmed on appeal. <em>See Fulford v. State, </em>121 So.2d 490 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1960) (per curiam). On April 17, 1963, Fulford moved the state trial court to vacate the escape conviction and sentence on the theory that his counselless trial was invalid under <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963). The motion was granted and a new trial ordered. On May 8, 1963, Fulford, through court-appointed counsel, negotiated a plea agreement; Fulford pled guilty and received a bargained-for indeterminate sentence of six months to two years. In fashioning the sentence the trial judge gave Fulford credit for time served under the four-year sentence previously imposed on the escape charge. This credit resulted in Fulford\u2019s unconditional release from state custody after serving an additional 47 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-16\">When Fulford escaped from prison on January 7, 1957, the penalty provided by the Florida escape statute, Fla.Stat. \u00a7 954.-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>30 (1955),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for one occupying Fulford\u2019s status (/. e., serving a sentence on a felony conviction) was a determinate prison sentence of up to ten years. Other statutory provisions also authorized the sentencing judge to withhold the imposition of a prison sentence and to place the escapee on probation. Fla.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 948.01-.06 (1955). Six years later, however, when Fulford came on for sentencing pursuant to his plea agreement, a third sentencing alternative was available to the trial court. In addition to the options of handing down a determinate prison sentence of up to ten years or placing the escapee on probation, the trial court was authorized to impose an indeterminate prison sentence of six months to ten years. Fla.Stat. \u00a7 921.18 (1961).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Fulford\u2019s plea agreement called for an indeterminate sentence under this latter provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The state concedes that the indeterminate six month to two years sentence Fulford received was not an authorized sentencing alternative for the offense he committed; if the court were to order Fulford incarcerated all that it could require was that he serve a determinate sentence of up to ten years. Fulford contends that by bargaining for and persuading Fulford to agree to the unauthorized indeterminate sentence, his lawyer rendered him ineffective assistance of counsel in a sixth amendment sense. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Fulford suggests that any lawyer who advises his client to enter into a plea agreement premised upon the receipt of a sen-fence unauthorized under state law is necessarily rendering ineffective assistance of counsel under the sixth amendment. We are unwilling to treat the rendition of such legal advice as a sixth amendment violation in all cases, especially one such as this. Fulford admits that he was correctly advised by his attorney, at the time the plea bargain was struck, that he faced a maximum ten-year prison sentence and that he pled guilty because an early release was guaranteed. He makes no claim that a determinate sentence would have resulted in an even earlier discharge from custody or that he would not have entered into the plea arrangement had he been informed that the indeterminate sentencing option was unavailable to the trial court. In fact, Fulford\u2019s argument concedes that the result actually achieved could have been fashioned by the parties and the court under the determinate sentence alternative. In sum, the allegations of Fulford\u2019s pro se petition demonstrate no prejudice resulting from his counsel\u2019s oversight. Consequently, a sixth amendment claim has not been made out. <em>See Sand v. Estelle, </em>559 F.2d 365 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1076, 98 S.Ct. 1267, 55 L.Ed.2d 783 (1978). The judgment of the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"A_\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-9\">.
