The district court granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment and Zeidman now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-15\">The two major issues in this appeal are concerned with parole guidelines adopted by the Parole Commission in an effort to promote a more consistent and equitable exercise of its discretion. See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.20 (1976). Under the guidelines, an inmate\u2019s record is first examined to determine the so-called \u201csalient factor score,\u201d a rating that is designed to reflect the estimated risk of parole violation. Next, the inmates\u2019s criminal behavior is classified on an \u201coffense severity scale\u201d which ranges from \u201clow\u201d to \u201cgreatest.\u201d These two factors are then taken together to determine a suggested time range during which the inmate should remain incarcerated. In Zeidman\u2019s case, for example, the Commission found that his salient factor score and offense severity rating \u201cindicate a range of 20-26 months to be served before release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-16\">Zeidman argues that the Commission applied the guidelines in a fixed and mechanical manner, and thus deprived him of the due process right to meaningful parole consideration. In making the claim, he relies solely on statistics cited in <em>Kortness v. United States, </em>514 F.2d 167 (8th Cir. 1975) which indicate that 88.4% of the Commission\u2019s parole decisions are made within the guidelines. These statistics, he argues, are sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact on the due process claim, particularly in light of the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Geraghty v. United States Parole Commission, </em>579 F.2d 238 (3rd Cir. 1978). In that case, the Court found summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>to be inappropriate because the statistics cited by the petitioners seemed to suggest that \u201cthe \u2018channel for discretion\u2019 provided by the guidelines is in actuality an unyielding conduit.\u201d 579 F.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">We cannot agree, however, that either the <em>Geraghty </em>decision or the statistics cited by the appellant are relevant to the case at hand. While <em>Geraghty </em>involved a class action, this ease is concerned only with Zeidman\u2019s claim, and it is clear from the record that he received individualized consideration from the Commission. In particular, the Commission\u2019s Hearing Summary shows that it looked not only to the guidelines but also to such factors as Zeidman\u2019s health and institutional adjustment. Indeed, only after a \u201creview of all relevant factors and information presented\u201d did it conclude that \u201ca decision outside the guidelines . is not found warranted.\u201d We cannot agree, therefore, that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the appellant\u2019s due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The appellant also argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on his <em>ex post facto </em>claim. In this connection, Zeidman notes that the guidelines in effect at the time of his sentencing were subsequently changed, so that, in his case, the recommended period of incarceration increased from 12-16 months to 20 \u2014 26 months. He thus contends that the application of the new guidelines violated the Constitution\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">However, both the Second Circuit, in <em>Shepard v. Taylor, </em>556 F.2d 648 (2d Cir. 1977), and the Sixth Circuit, in <em>Ruip v. United States, </em>555 F.2d 1331 (6th Cir. 1977), have held that such an application is constitutional since the guidelines do not have the force and effect of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-7\">\u201c[Wjhat is involved in this case is not agency interpretation of law but an agency\u2019s setting up guidelines for itself to assure the uniform execution of its business. These guidelines are not law, but guideposts which assist the Parole Commission (and which assisted the Board of Parole) in exercising its discretion. Nor do these guidelines have the characteristics of law. They are not fixed and rigid, but are flexible. The Commission remains free to make parole decisions outside of these guidelines.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">555 F.2d at 1335. To be sure, the Third Circuit has found that the new guidelines could violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause if applied in a fixed and mechanical manner. <em>Geraghty v. United States, </em>579 F.2d 238, 267 (3rd Cir. 1978). However, as was noted above, the record indicates that Zeidman received individualized consideration from the Commission. Accordingly, we find no basis for holding that the new guidelines violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clause in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">The judgment of the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
