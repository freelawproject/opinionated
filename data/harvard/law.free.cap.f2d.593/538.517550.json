We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Appellant obtained an automobile loan from Capital Consumer Discount Company. After defaulting on the loan for reasons unrelated to this claim, she sought damages of $1000 plus costs and attorney\u2019s fees under the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a). Her claim alleged that five improper disclosures in the form constituted eleven separate violations of Regulation Z. The district court analyzed each of the allegedly improper disclosures, found that none violated the Act or the regulation, and granted summary judgment for the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">The court stated \u201ctwo distinct and independent reasons\u201d for its decision. \u201cFirst, the alleged technical deficiencies of the document bear no relationship to the achievement of the Congressional purposes of the Truth in Lending Act.\u201d <em>Dzadovsky v. Lyons Ford Sales, Inc., </em>452 F.Supp. 606, 611 (W.D.Pa.1978). This conclusion was based on appellant\u2019s failure to claim that she was actually deceived by the alleged inaccuracies or that they related to her inability to repay her debt. <em>Id. </em>at 607, 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">We are unable to accept this rationale because it suggests the requirement of financial loss before a borrower may bring an action. It is clear, however, that such injury need not be alleged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One of the legislative purposes of the Act is to enable consumers to compare various available credit terms. Any proven violation of the disclosure requirements of the Act is presumed to injure a borrower by frustrating that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">We do not disagree, however, with the district court\u2019s second conclusion that none of appellant\u2019s \u201callegations of technical non-compliance . . . forms the basis of a violation of the Truth in Lending Act or its underlying regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 609. The appeal reiterates the contentions that were considered and rejected below. We find no error in the analysis of the disclosures set forth in the district court s opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 609-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-9\">. <em>See Gennuso v.
