Arnold (Arnold) seeks review of a district court decision dismissing as moot his constitutional attack on a Massachusetts statute dealing with persons charged with drunken driving. Arnold alleges that since only persons convicted of drunken driving <em>after a trial </em>(such as Arnold) lose their licenses, the statutory scheme places a penalty upon exercising the right to a trial. However, we agree with the district court that the reinstatement of Arnold\u2019s license moots this action and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-27\">Under Massachusetts law, the license of a defendant convicted after a trial of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor is to be revoked for one year. Mass.G.L. ch. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(b), (c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2; <em>Commonwealth v, </em>LeRoy, - Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>-, 380 N.E.2d 128 (1978). A defendant who does not demand a trial, but rather admits to sufficient facts to support a conviction (generally referred to in Massachusetts as a \u201cdisposition without a finding\u201d) does not suffer automatic license revocation. Mass.G.L. ch. 90, \u00a7 24E<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; <em>LeRoy, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">Arnold was charged in state court in July 1975 with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He pleaded not guilty in the district court, was tried, and was found guilty. On August 11,1975, Arnold\u2019s request for a disposition \u201cwithout a finding\u201d of guilt was denied,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> since Arnold had been found guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>after a trial. His ease was continued until September 9, 1975, in order to allow him additional time to decide if he wanted to exercise his right to a trial <em>de novo </em>in superior court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Robert A. Panora, the Registrar of Motor Vehicles (Registrar), revoked Arnold\u2019s license on September 7, 1975. Two days later, Arnold exercised his right to a trial <em>de novo. See </em>note 5, <em>supra. </em>On November 24, 1975, Arnold was found not guilty by the superior court<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the next day his license was reinstated. Arnold made an unsuccessful request to have the Registrar expunge the record of his conviction on February 18, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">While the above sequence of events was taking place in state court, Arnold also sought relief in federal court. On August 26, 1975, he commenced a class action against the Registrar, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief due to the alleged unconstitutionality of these Massachusetts statutes. Arnold sought to file \u00e1 supplemental complaint on November 19, 1975, further alleging that his July conviction was unconstitutional in that the state court judge had refused to decide whether the state statutes involved violated the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">In March 1976, the Registrar moved to dismiss the federal complaint on the ground <em>inter alia </em>of mootness. In November 1976, Arnold moved to certify the class. The three-judge district court that had been convened then remanded this action to the single district judge for determination of the issue of mootness. On February 27, 1978, the district judge allowed plaintiff\u2019s November 19, 1975 motion to file a supplemental complaint, <em>but then dismissed the entire ease as moot. </em>At this point the <em>state </em>court case has been closed for over two years, and now the <em>federal </em>case is dismissed as moot. Arnold appeals from that dismissal and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">The district court was correct in holding this case to be moot since Arnold\u2019s license had been reinstated. Arnold attempts to circumvent this hurdle by claiming that there are collateral consequences emanating from the revocation that require expungement and preclude mootness. In simple language, he feels the matters involved are far from moot with regard to himself. Relying on <em>Sibron v. New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968), Arnold argues that damage to his reputation and possible economic discrimination at the hands of automobile insurance companies<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> will occur unless the record of his conviction and license revocation is expunged.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">Arnold\u2019s reliance on <em>Sibron </em>is misplaced. <em>Sibron </em>turned on the fact that <em>legal </em>collateral consequences were involved. Here the possibility of any adverse <em>legal </em>consequences is precluded by the fact that Arnold had been found not guilty by the state court. It is, of course, true that Arnold may be called upon to state that he was once convicted. However, that he may have to answer a question in a certain way, and then qualify the answer with an explanation of his subsequent acquittal, is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>legal collateral consequence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Legal collateral consequences as used in <em>Sibron </em>relate to consequences \u201cimposed on the basis of the challenged conviction.\u201d 392 U.S. at 57, 88 S.Ct. at 1900. However, Arnold has already successfully challenged his conviction in the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Arnold next relies on <em>Weinstein v. Bradford, </em>423 U.S. 147, 96 S.Ct. 347, 46 L.Ed.2d 350 (1975), for supporting his argument that his cause is not moot. In <em>Bradford, </em>a prisoner claimed that a state was obligated to provide him certain procedural rights in considering his eligibility for parole. Before the case was argued before the Court, the prisoner received a complete release and thus had no further interest in the controverted state procedures. As in the present case, the party seeking to avoid mootness relied on the \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The Court, applying the test of <em>Sosna v. Iowa, </em>419 U.S. 393, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975), noted that, in the absence of a certified class, this doctrine is \u201climited to the situation where two elements combined: (1) the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there was a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.\u201d <em>Bradford, supra, </em>423 U.S. at 149, 96 S.Ct. at 349. Neither element is found in Arnold\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">It is true that Arnold\u2019s license was suspended for less than three months. However, the shortness of the period was due to the fact that Arnold was eventually cleared. A full one-year revocation would provide enough time to'litigate this issue. <em>See Le-Roy, supra. </em>Furthermore, where the driver is never cleared, and thus the conviction remains, the \u201ccollateral consequences,\u201d which Arnold lacks, would still be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Nor is there a reasonable expectation that Arnold will again be subject to the alleged unconstitutional statutory procedure. Arnold would have to be again arrested for drunken driving, and he has provided no evidence that such an event is likely to happen. Arnold\u2019s case does not escape mootness by falling within this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">Arnold next argues that even if moot as to him, the case is not moot as to the other members of his class. Since Arnold\u2019s claim became moot prior to certification of the class, dismissal of the complaint was required. <em>Sosna v. Iowa, </em>419 U.S. 393, 399, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975). Arnold argues that an exception should be made here, since the time period involved was so short that certification would always be precluded. <em>See Sosna, supra, </em>419 U.S. at 402 n. 11, 95 S.Ct. 559. However, the full-year suspension, not to mention any later collateral effects, would provide sufficient time for a member of the class to file suit and seek certification.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">Arnold\u2019s second claim, raised in his supplemental complaint, that his conviction was unconstitutional because of the state court judge\u2019s refusal to decide the constitutionality issue, has also been mooted by his subsequent acquittal. <em>See Costerelli v. Massachusetts, </em>421 U.S. 193, 196, 95 S.Ct. 1534, 44 L.Ed.2d 76 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">Accordingly, we hold, upon careful consideration of all the briefs and submissions, and after oral argument, that dismissal of the complaint as moot was correct. The district court decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-15\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-19\">.

The cases of those persons who admit sufficient facts to support a conviction are continued without a finding and eventually dismissed upon completion of a Driver Treatment Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-17\">In 1976, the Chief Justice of the Massachusetts District Court promulgated Bulletin 76-3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>which put forth a policy of treating defendants found guilty at trial equally with those who pled guilty or admitted sufficient facts to support a conviction. The Second District Court of Plymouth (where Arnold was tried) then began following this policy. However, this approach is no longer valid because of the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in <em>Commonwealth v. LeRoy, </em>Mass., 380 N.E.2d 128 (1978). That case held that the statutes involved <em>require </em>the license suspension of one convicted after a trial, and that any policy changes are up to the Legislature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b223-11\">. Massachusetts operates a two-tiered system of criminal procedure for certain offenses. A defendant is first tried before a judge in district court, and, if found guilty, has a right to a jury trial <em>de novo </em>in superior court. <em>See Ludwig v. Massachusetts, </em>427 U.S. 618, 620-22 (1976). Under the Massachusetts Court Reform Act of 1978, Mass.St.1978, ch. 478, \u00a7\u00a7 188-89, which went into effect January 1, 1979, a defendant has a right to a trial by jury without going through the first \u201ctier.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b223-16\">. Arnold waived a jury trial and was tried before a single judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b223-17\">. Arnold provided in his complaint copies of various insurance forms which asked if the applicant had been convicted of drunk driving or had his or her license revoked.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b224-8\">. To hold otherwise would be to say that a defendant whose conviction is reversed on appeal is entitled to expungement of his record from arrest on.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b224-17\">. Arnold in this regard is not representative of his alleged class, in that his revocation period was so short and he suffers no legal collateral consequences, due to his acquittal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
