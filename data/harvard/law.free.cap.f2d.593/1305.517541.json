Petitioners, certain interstate railroads operating in the state of North Carolina, seek review of Interstate Commerce Commission orders <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rejecting a tariff filing which the Commission claims it has no authority to process. The tariff sought to apply to traffic moving wholly within North Carolina a four per cent general rate increase that had previously been filed and placed into effect for interstate traffic nationwide, including North Carolina. We believe the Commission has correctly construed its statutory authority affecting intrastate rates and, accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-6\">A. <em>History and Statutory Structure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1366-7\">An understanding of this controversy requires a little background. At least since the <em>Shreveport </em>case <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it has been settled that there is federal authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate <em>intrastate </em>rates which affect interstate commerce. Congress exercised this authority in the Transportation Act of 1920 which, by adding new paragraphs (3) and (4) to \u00a7 13 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Interstate Commerce Act, in effect codified the <em>Shreveport </em>decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 13(3) authorized the Commission to investigate intrastate rates and \u00a7 13(4) expressly empowered the Commission to \u201cprescribe\u201d intrastate rates in order to cure undue discrimination against interstate commerce, but only \u201cafter [a] full hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-18\">The procedures which have historically governed <em>interstate </em>ratemaking are quite different. These are set out in \u00a7 15 of the Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under these provisions the ratemaking initiative lies with the railroads. Rate changes are filed with the ICC<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and take effect immediately unless suspended by the Commission. Section 15(8) provides that when a tariff schedule is filed, the Commission, on its own initiative or on complaint of an interested party, may conduct a hearing to determine if the proposed rates are lawful.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If a hearing is held, the Commission may suspend operation of the new rates for a maximum of seven months, but only if it is shown by a complainant (1) that the proposed rate change will cause him substantial injury and (2) that he is likely to prevail on the merits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although the complainant has the burden of establishing the conditions for a suspension,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the railroads <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>have the ultimate burden of proving that their rates are lawful.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">Petitioners contend that this long-standing difference in the procedures governing interstate and intrastate ratemaking was changed by the addition in 1976 of a new paragraph (5) to \u00a7 13 of the Act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 13(5) allows state regulatory authorities 120 days to act upon carrier applications to adjust intrastate rates to correspond to the rates for similar interstate traffic. However, if the state authority has not \u201cacted finally\u201d within the 120-day period, the ICC is given \u201cexclusive authority ... to prescribe the intrastate rate.\u201d Petitioners argue that the grant of \u201cexclusive authority\u201d to the ICC entitles the railroads to file intrastate rate changes pursuant to \u00a7 15(8), just as they file interstate rates, thus making intrastate rate changes automatically effective unless a complainant can meet the \u00a7 15(8) burden. The Commission disagrees, maintaining that \u00a7 13(4), with its \u201cfull hearing\u201d requirement, affords the exclusive means of affecting intrastate rates contemplated by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-13\">Finally, the Interstate Commerce Act was newly codified in October 1978, shortly before this case was argued. Although Congress expressly stated that it intended no substantive change in the law, it did alter the structure and wording of numerous provisions, including \u00a7\u00a7 13(4) and 13(5).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We think the codification largely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>resolves against petitioners the ambiguities which led to the instant controversy, but it should be recalled that the parties proceeded throughout on the basis of the earlier version.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">B. <em>The Course of These Proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1368-5\">1. <em>The X-336 Proceeding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1368-6\">On 9 November 1976 the nation\u2019s railroads petitioned the ICC for permission to file a master tariff and connecting supplements in order to implement a general four percent increase on freight rates nationwide. The petition showed that the railroads had experienced increases in annual operating costs of nearly $1 billion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Even were the rate increase implemented nationwide on both interstate and intrastate traffic, there would have been a revenue shortfall of some $300 million.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Commission permitted<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the railroads to file master tariff X-336 to effect the four percent increase nationwide for interstate traffic. Finding the railroads\u2019 revenue needs unquestionable, the ICC concluded that it was unnecessary to suspend and investigate the X-336 tariff as permitted under section 15(8).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Commission concluded that the increase was \u201cnecessary to prevent a further decline in the railroads\u2019 overall financial condition\u201d; that the railroads\u2019 rate of return continued to be \u201csubstandard\u201d; and that, absent the increase, the railroads would not have \u201csufficient funds . to defray the cost escalations\u201d established.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1368-12\">2. <em>The North Carolina Proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1368-13\">As is ordinarily the case, the cost increases justifying the four percent general rate increase in tariff X-336 affected intrastate as well as interstate traffic. Consequently, the southern railroads in January 1977 began to seek, through state proceedings, identical increases in intrastate rates in each of the states within the Southern Freight Association Territory. The increase was eventually accepted and implemented in each of those states, except North Carolina.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1368-14\">On 4 January 1977 the railroads filed with the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) a tariff supplement which would have applied the four percent increase to North Carolina traffic. The NCUC suspended the increase until 6 November 1977 and began an investigation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Because the NCUC did not act finally on the railroads\u2019 four percent increase within 120 days after the filing of the tariff supplement, the railroads moved to discontinue the proceedings, arguing that \u00a7 13(5) had ousted the North Carolina authorities of jurisdiction. The NCUC terminated its investigation by order of 16 May 1977.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1368-15\">3. <em>The ICC Proceeding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1368-16\">On 9 May 1977 the railroads petitioned the Commission to investigate the allegedly discriminatory North Carolina rates pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>ant to its \u00a7 13(4) authority. An investigation was ordered on 25 May 1977.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">On 31 May 1977 the railroads sought to invoke what they conceived to be an alternative procedure for implementing the intrastate rate increase under \u00a7 13(5). The railroads filed with the ICC tariff supplement S-20 to master tariff X-336 in order to apply the general increase to North Carolina traffic. Contemplating the ordinary course of practice under \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 15, the railroads filed the supplements to become effective on 7 July 1977, after more than 30 days notice, unless suspended by the ICC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-6\">The Commission rejected tariff supplement S-20 by letter of 5 July 1977.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Noting that an investigation into the North Carolina rates had been docketed pursuant to \u00a7 13(4), the letter asserted that there was no \u201cauthority\u201d to establish the increase \u201c[ijnasmuch as no order of the Commission has been served authorizing the increase to be placed in effect.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AOe\">The railroads appealed the decision letter within the Commission. On 18 July 1977, Division 2 of the ICC denied the railroads\u2019 application for review,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> finding that the railroads were required to observe the existing rates until the Commission had concluded its \u00a7 13(4) investigation of those rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-7\">Ten days later, the railroads sought review in this court<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and a stay of the orders <em>pendente lite. </em>On 13 September 1977, without ruling on the motion for a stay, we remanded the record and directed the Commission to file a supplemental memorandum regarding the railroads\u2019 motion. While the record was on remand, Division 2 entered a further order on 6 October 1977.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The latest order reaffirmed the 18 July order, although on slightly different grounds, disclaiming authority to process the railroads\u2019 tariff supplement pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13(5) and 15(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-16\">Finally, during the course of the filing controversy, the ICC had been conducting its investigation of the North Carolina rates pursuant to \u00a7 13(4). On 18 November 1977 the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that the North Carolina rates caused an unjust discrimination against interstate commerce and ordered that the rates be raised to the interstate level.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> After 30 days, no exceptions having been filed, this ruling became the final decision of the ICC. In light of the outcome of the \u00a7 13(4) proceeding, the Commission moved for dismissal of the instant petition for review, arguing that the controversy had become moot. The motion to dismiss was denied and our review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-17\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-18\">This case requires us to construe the ICG\u2019s statutory authority over intrastate rates. If, as petitioners contend, \u00a7 13(5) permits the Commission to process rates under the procedures set out in \u00a7 15(8), we may assume without deciding that the Commission could not otherwise decline to exercise its jurisdiction.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We interpret the statutory language at issue in light of its legislative history and the Congressional purpose which that history discloses. Although we entirely agree that petitioners\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>construction is consistent with the general purposes Congress apparently had in enacting the 1976 amendments, we cannot accept it as our own for two reasons. First, the construction is linguistically implausible and second, we are pai1 :cularly -\\-luctant to rewrite statutes afft \u25a0 'ing sensitive issues of federalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">A. <em>Statutory Language.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1370-5\">As we have noted, the provisions we are called upon to interpret were recodified shortly before oral argument in this case. Some of the language has been changed, but we are told that this worked no substantive change in the law.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The new language is much clearer, however, with respect to the procedures for changing intrastate rates. We think the persuasiveness of petitioners\u2019 position is undercut by the fact that their construction would never occur to us from reading the pertinent codified passages of the Act. Concededly, the language in which \u00a7 13(5) was originally enacted is not entirely irrelevant and could somewhat plausibly be construed as petitioners suggest.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Of course, if the original version had had some established or fairly obvious meaning, that understanding would largely inform our construction of the codification.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> However, particularly because the codified language admits of little doubt, if any, we do not find the mere ambiguity in the earlier language of much help.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-11\">Sections 13(4) and 13(5) were codified, as we have said, as 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Section 11501(b)(1) provides that the Commission \u201chas exclusive authority to prescribe\u201d an intrastate rate where (A) a railroad has filed an application with a state authority to adjust such rate to the similar interstate rate and (B) the state authority has not \u201cacted finally\u201d within 120 days. Section 11501(b)(2) provides that the Commission shall \u201cprescribe\u201d the intrastate rate under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>the standards of \u00a7 11501(a)(1) which restated the criteria formerly contained in \u00a7 13(4). Finally, \u00a7 11501(c) provides that the Commission may take action under the section \u201conly after a full hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">It is apparently undisputed that the Commission obtained exclusive authority over the controversy pursuant to \u00a7 11501(b)(1). The live question is what this entails procedurally. Petitioners opine that the Commission, having ousted the state of jurisdiction, should treat the rate like any other over which it has exclusive jurisdiction <em>(i. e., </em>all interstate rates) and permit filing under \u00a7 15(8), codified as 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10707.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">Petitioners\u2019 analysis of the statute\u2019s \u201cplain language\u201d is straightforward and, we think, wrong. Section 10707 is said to be entirely general, applying to all rate changes over which the Commission has authority.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Inasmuch as \u00a7 11501 gives the Commission \u201cexclusive authority\u201d over certain intrastate rates, \u00a7 10707 must likewise apply. The \u201cfull hearing\u201d requirement of \u00a7 11501(c) is said to be inapposite as it applies only to rates which the Commission imposes and not to those initiated by railroads under \u00a7 10707<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-7\">We begin with the observation that the Commission\u2019s statutory authority over intrastate rates derives entirely from \u00a7 11501; <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and we do not think that that section\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cexclusive authority,\u201d without more, enables railroads to implement changes in intrastate rates simply by filing them with the ICC. Apart from being scant predicate for such an abrupt departure from practice, the phrase in any event cannot sensibly be read as an operative cross-reference to \u00a7 10707. Section 11501 nowhere refers to \u00a7 10707 or to equivalent procedures, and a reference cannot, we think, fairly be implied from the language. The \u201cexclusive authority\u201d which the Commission is given is not plenary, but rather is expressly confined by \u00a7 11501(b) to prescribing an intrastate rate under the circumstances set out in subsection (b)(1) and the substantive standards set out in \u00a7 11501(a). Moreover, when the Commission thus prescribes an intrastate rate, it is plainly \u201ctakpng] action under section [11501]\u201d for purposes of the prior hearing requirement in \u00a7 11501(c). Thus it is fairly apparent on the face of the statute that the Commission\u2019s power to prescribe rates under \u00a7 11501 exhausts its authority over intrastate rates and is governed, <em>inter alia, </em>by the requirement of a hearing in subsection (c).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-13\">B. <em>Congressional Purposes and Intent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-14\">Were the meaning of the statutory language less plain, we would be somewhat inclined to adopt petitioners\u2019 construction in light of the apparent purposes of the 1976 amendments. The legislative history of the 1976 amendments contains extensive Congressional findings about the financial decline of the industry, occasioned in no small part by the \u201ccumbersome slow process of making rates.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-15\">The ratemaking scheme advanced by petitioners would be a quite rational answer to the damaging delays which have often occurred before discriminatory intrastate rates are raised to the interstate level. Under petitioners\u2019 construction, after 120 days of inaction by the state authorities the railroads would place the rates into effect by filing them (with notice) under \u00a7 10707. Shippers would be protected from unlawful rates through the customary suspension and refund provisions of \u00a7 10707,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and the au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>tonomy of the states would be assured for at least the 120 day exhaustion period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">Moreover, this construction would avoid some anomalous possibilities admitted by the scheme Congress chose. First,' to the extent that \u00a7 11501 ousts the Commission of concurrent jurisdiction for 120 days,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> it may (if state authorities do not take their national obligations seriously) simply tack that period of delay onto the time ordinarily consumed by a \u00a7 13(4) investigation. Second, if state authorities do not act within 120 days, there will always be some period of time during which no one may implement the rates \u2014 the state may not, having been ousted of jurisdiction, and the ICC may not until it has conducted the \u201cfull hearing\u201d assured by \u00a7 11501.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Although to be sure the paralysis would be relieved by expediting the ICC hearing, former tardigrade practice is not a source of hope.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">Of course, petitioners\u2019 construction would not be free of anomaly either. The procedural consequences attaching to the passage to 120 days without \u201cfinal action\u201d might encourage the railroads to delay state proceedings in order to avail themselves of \u00a7 10707. On the other hand, state authorities could bar recourse to \u00a7 10707 simply by acting even if summarily and adversely, on the 119 th day. Although we would not expect such perverse behavior,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> it is hardly a strong argument for petitioners\u2019 construction that such conduct would be encouraged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-11\">In any event, we think it apparent that the changes intended by Congress, at least in enacting \u00a7 13(5), were undramatic. Although other of the 1976 amendments did streamline aspects of railroad ratemaking,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> \u00a7 13(5) operates, we think, exclusively as a jurisdictional provision. That is, of course, precisely what its minimal legislative history said that it did. The Conference Committee Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1372-12\">[The bill] assurefs] State regulatory bodies at least 120 days exclusive jurisdiction over an intrastate rate case, require[s] a railroad to exhaust its State remedy for a change in intrastate rates, and provide[s] that if a State failed to act on the railroad\u2019s application for rate change within 120 days the Interstate Commerce Commission would have exclusive authority to determine these intrastate rates.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>Insofar as \u00a7 13(5) may be said to expand federal authority over intrastate rates, it does so only by ousting the states of their former concurrent jurisdiction after 120 days of inaction. As we have explained, the language Congress chose cannot support a more expansive reading, and nothing in the' legislative history suggests its choice of language was mere drafting error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">Even were the linguistic argument closer, we would be hesitant to construe loosely an ambiguous passage so as to unsettle the practice of conducting a prior hearing. A finding (after hearing) of discrimination against interstate commerce has always conditioned the exercise of federal power over intrastate rates.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Inasmuch as the most plausible construction of the statute\u2019s language would continue the practice, we decline to strain a reading which Congress could freely enact, especially in view of Congress\u2019 historic sensitivity to the legitimate role of the states in this field.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-7\">We believe that the railroads are not entitled by \u00a7 11501, formerly \u00a7 13(5), to place changes in intrastate rates into effect by filing them with the Commission under \u00a7 10707. Rather, federal authority to affect intrastate rates is confined to the power of the Commission to prescribe rates \u201cafter a full hearing.\u201d Adopting this construction, however, we do not imply that the Commission should ignore the urgency which prompted Congress to enact the 1976 amendments. It is plain that in giving the ICC exclusive authority Congress intended that it move expeditiously in prescribing rates after the statutory exhaustion period. The substantive inquiry called for when intrastate rates recurrently lag behind general interstate rate increases is straightforward. The interstate rate will ordinarily already have been found just and reasonable. The Commission may confine the hearing to the ostensible justifications for the varying intrastate rate. We contemplate that the Commission will devise appropriately expedited procedures to avoid all escapable delay.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-13\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1366-8\">.

The codifying statute and its legislative history make plain that Congress intended no substantive change in any provision of the Act. Public Law No. 95-473 is specifically titled \u201c[a]n Act to revise, codify and enact <em>without substantive change </em>the Interstate Commerce Act and related laws . . (Emphasis added.) Section 3(a) of the statute likewise declares that the codification \u201crestate[s] <em>without substantive change, </em>laws enacted before May 16, 1978, that were replaced\u201d by the codification. 92 Stat. 1466 (emphasis added). The legislative history contains numerous statements to the same effect. <em>See, e. g., </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1395, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 9, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, 1978, pp. 3009, 3018 (provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act are \u201cintended to remain substantively unchanged\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1370-9\">. Some of petitioners\u2019 finer parsing of the statutory language was quite undone by the codification. For example, \u00a7 13(5), as enacted, provided that the Commission had exclusive authority to <em>\u201cdetermine </em>and prescribe\u201d intrastate rates under the circumstances set out in the section. (Emphasis added.) Because \u00a7 15(8) defined the Commission\u2019s customary authority to \u201cdetermine\u201d the lawfulness of rates, it was argued that in using that word in \u00a7 13(5), Congress intended that the practice of \u00a7 15(8) would govern ratemaking in those cases over which \u00a7 13(5) gave the Commission exclusive authority. <em>See </em>Brief for Petitioners at 20-21. In codifying the first sentence of \u00a7 13(5) in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(b)(1), the revisers deleted the phrase \u201cdetermine and,\u201d in order \u201cto eliminate redundancy.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1395, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 176 (1978). Petitioners rather courageously opine that the revisers \u201capparently considered the term \u2018prescribe\u2019 sufficiently broad to encompass ICC determination\u201d under \u00a7 15(8). <em>See </em>Supplemental Memorandum for Petitioners at 6-7. We think rather that the excision of the allegedly operative language as redundant is all but fatal to petitioners\u2019 purely linguistic argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-13\">Petitioners additionally argued that the last sentence of \u00a7 13(5) showed that Congress contemplated an alternative to the procedures in \u00a7 13(4). That sentence stated that \u201c[njothing in this [section] shall affect\u201d the Commission\u2019s authority \u201cto institute an investigation\u201d or otherwise act under \u00a7 13(3) and (4). Apart from the fact that this language too was omitted from the codification, we think its probable meaning differs somewhat from what petitioners believe. In light of the apparent intention of Congress to require that railroads exhaust their state remedies for up to 120 days, <em>see </em>note 43 <em>infra, </em>it is likely that the proviso in the last sentence of \u00a7 13(5) merely reserves the Commission\u2019s power to proceed during the exhaustion period on its own initiative and, of course, under \u00a7 13(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1370-14\">. <em>See Cass v.

Of course, in those cases in which the state would not, for whatever reasons, ever take corrective action, ousting it of jurisdiction is harmless. The objection to the construction we adopt must be (apart from petitioners\u2019 primary quarrel that it denies them use of \u00a7 15(8\u00bb that it forecloses corrective state action which would fall after 120 days but before the ICC would have occasion to hold a hearing. States may avoid being ousted of jurisdiction, of course, by simply completing their proceedings within 120 days.

It is not obvious that our expectations are justified. For example, there may have been some such dilatory conduct in <em>Montana Intrastate Freight Rates and Changes, </em>357 I.C.C. 281 (1978).

Nor did they respond to interrogatories with substantive answers. Having no evidence, Montana could do nothing substantive within 120 days. It lost jurisdiction. In future proceedings, before State commissions, the railroads are cautioned to cooperate with State authorities.

Nevertheless, it is Congress\u2019 intent, although unapparent from the face of the statute, which is controlling. Of course, the precise effects of Congress\u2019 less obvious intentions (requiring railroads to exhaust state remedies and giving states exclusive authority for 120 days) are for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"AL0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>However, we note that the intention to make the state jurisdiction exclusive for 120 days, at least as to changes sought on motion of the railroads, would explain the excision by the 1976 act of the proviso in former \u00a7 13(4) requiring that, upon the filing of a petition under \u00a7 13(3) [challenging the lawfulness of an intrastate rate], the Commission \u201cshall forthwith\u201d investigate the rate \u201cwhether or not theretofore considered by any State agency . . and without regard to the pendency before any State agency\u201d of any related proceeding. See Pub.L. No. 94-210, tit. II, \u00a7 210, 90 Stat. 46. That proviso had been construed, in at least one case, to remove the Commission\u2019s discretion (which it had customarily exercised) to await completion of state proceedings prior to commencing a \u00a7 13(4) investigation. <em>North Carolina ex rel. North Carolina Utilities Commission v. ICC, </em>347 F.Supp. 103, 109 (E.D.N.C. 1972), <em>aff'd, </em>410 U.S. 919, 93 S.Ct. 1362, 35 L.Ed.2d 582 (1973). It was apparently Congress\u2019 intention in the 1976 Act to restore and make nondiscretionary the prior informal practice of exhausting state remedies, at least for 120 days, but subject to the Commission\u2019s reserved power to proceed on its own initiative in proper cases within the 120 days. <em>See </em>note 30 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b1373-16\">. Former practice governed by \u00a7 13(5) cannot, of course, dispose of the construction of an amendment which arguably changes the practice.
