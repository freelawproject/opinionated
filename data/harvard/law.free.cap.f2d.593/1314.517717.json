Accumulating evidence that these wiring systems might present a fire hazard prompted the industry to develop new performance standards for aluminum wiring and for the devices used with aluminum conductors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to this development, \u201cold technology\u201d aluminum branch circuit wiring systems were installed in at least 1.5 million residences throughout the United States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">The Consumer Product Safety Commission (\u201cCPSC\u201d or the \u201cCommission\u201d), an agency established pursuant to the Consumer Product Safety Act of 1972 (\u201cCPSA\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> has exercised certain of its investigative, rulemaking, and adjudicatory powers in an effort to isolate the causes of, and to alleviate the hazard associated with, old technology aluminum wiring systems. These interlocutory appeals arise from an action filed by CPSC in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia pursuant to CPSA \u00a7 12. That section authorizes the Commission, upon discovery that a consumer product \u201cpresents imminent and unreasonable risk of death, serious personal illness, or severe personal injury,\u201d to seek a declaratory judgment that the product is \u201can imminently hazardous consumer product,\u201d and to obtain such affirmative relief \u201cas may be necessary to protect the public.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The complaint named as defendants 26 corporations that between 1965 and 1973 manufactured and sold various components of the old technology aluminum wiring systems.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It sought temporary relief in the form of an order requiring widespread public notice of the hazard, the danger signals to look for, and precautionary measures to take, and sought as well an order requiring the permanent repair of residences wired with old technology aluminum wiring systems.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction was denied, except in the case of Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corporation, which presented a special claim of collateral estoppel. Most of the defendants appear before us as appellants (No. 78-1070).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Kaiser is before us as appellee (No. 78 \u2014 1054). For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>convenience, we shall refer collectively to the \u201cdefendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-4\">Section 12 is applicable only when the allegedly hazardous item is a \u201cconsumer product\u201d as that term is defined by the Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In certain respects CPSC enjoys a broad jurisdiction over products that may cause injury to consumers. However, that jurisdiction is circumscribed by the Act\u2019s complex definition of \u201cconsumer product.\u201d Defendants contend that an aluminum branch circuit wiring system is not a \u201cconsumer product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">These wiring systems are manufactured from a number of products, some or all of which may qualify as \u201cconsumer products\u201d within the applicable definition. But the alleged fire hazard is not caused by a defect in a component part; rather it arises from the improper design or installation of the wiring system as a whole. The Commission\u2019s view concerning the nature of the hazard is stated in the Notice of Proceeding for Development of Consumer Product Safety Standard, 40 Fed.Reg. 51218, 51219 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1377-17\">In many cases, connections within \u201caluminum wire systems\u201d become defective over a period of time, resulting in overheating or arcing at the point where the wire is connected to other elements of the system. These defects are caused by the presence in the joint of aluminum oxide and by the effects of vibration, creep, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>expansion and contraction, and transient electrical surges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1378-5\">The Commission notes further that poor workmanship in assembling aluminum wire connections appears co increase the likelihood of defective connections and component failure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1378-6\">In 1973, shortly after its establishment, the Commission began to investigate various reports that fires resulting in injury and loss of life had been caused by failures in residential aluminum branch circuit wiring systems. In March and April of 1974 CPSC held public hearings on the subject. <em>See </em>40 Fed.Reg. 51218 (1975). In November, 1975, the Commission instituted a rule-making proceeding for the development of one or more consumer product safety standards designed to reduce or eliminate the risks associated with aluminum branch circuit wiring systems. <em>Id. </em>Shortly thereafter, it directed the Commission staff to commence proceedings to seek relief for residences that already had the possibly hazardous aluminum wiring systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-7\">Pursuant to its responsibilities under CPSA \u00a7 5,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Commission disseminated information alerting the public to the potential hazard posed by aluminum wiring systems and suggesting ways to alleviate the danger. In January of 1976, Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corporation brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware to enjoin the Commission from continuing to release allegedly inaccurate information concerning aluminum wiring. In March, District Judge Walter K. Stapleton held that CPSC was without jurisdiction to investigate aluminum wiring and to disseminate information with respect to the product because aluminum wiring was not a \u201cconsumer product\u201d within the meaning of the Act. <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. v. CPSC, </em>428 F.Supp. 177 (D.Del.1976). This ruling was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in March, 1978. <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. v. CPSC, </em>574 F.2d 178 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 99 S.Ct. 218, 58 L.Ed.2d 193 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-13\">In September, 1976, as a part of its ongoing investigation, CPSC issued subpoenas to various manufacturers of aluminum wiring and electrical devices that were used in old technology aluminum branch circuit wiring systems. In due course, it brought an action in the District Court for the District of Columbia to enforce the subpoenas against those companies that had refused to comply. In June, 1977, District Judge Thomas A. Flannery ruled that aluminum wiring systems were \u201cconsumer products\u201d within the Act and generally granted enforcement of the subpoenas. However, the court gave collateral estoppel effect to the then extant ruling of the Delaware district court and denied the petition with respect to Kaiser. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Anaconda Co., </em>445 F.Supp. 486 (D.D.C.1977).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1378-14\">In October, 1977, the Commission commenced the present action to obtain a declaration that old technology aluminum branch circuit wiring systems are \u201cimminently hazardous consumer products,\u201d and to obtain such affirmative injunctive relief as might be required. In December, 1977, in response to defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds, District Judge Flannery issued an order reaffirming his June ruling that aluminum wiring systems were \u201cconsumer products.\u201d The memorandum opinion incorporated by reference the prior jurisdictional analysis. Again, the court granted Kaiser\u2019s motion to dismiss. Judge Flannery then certified the jurisdictional and collateral estoppel questions to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (1976). <em>CPSC v. Anaconda Co., </em>445 F.Supp. 498, 503 (D.D.C.1977). This court accepted the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-15\">A. <em>The Definition of \u201cConsumer Product\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1378-16\">Various products have been involved in the Commission\u2019s investigation and rule-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>making activity with respect to aluminum wiring systems: the wiring system as a whole, the aluminum wiring, as well as the various connecting devices. In this case we need consider only the aluminum branch circuit wiring system as a whole. Two factors converge to narrow our focus: First, the alleged fire hazard arises from a deficiency in the design or installation of the wiring system as a whole rather than from a defect in one or more of the component parts. Second, the jurisdiction of the Commission to bring a section 12 action is narrowly limited by the Act; jurisdiction exists only if the product that presents an \u201cimminent and unreasonable risk\u201d qualifies as a \u201cconsumer product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-4\">The Commission\u2019s authority to initiate an adjudicatory action under section 12 is more limited than its jurisdiction to engage in investigation or rulemaking. Under section 5(a)(1) of the Act, the Commission may investigate the causes of injuries that are \u201cassociated with\u201d consumer products.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Similarly, section 7(a)(1) of the Act authorizes rulemaking \u201cto prevent or reduce an unreasonable risk of injury associated with\u201d a consumer product.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus if one or more of the components of an aluminum branch circuit wiring system qualifies as a consumer product, then the Commission would have jurisdiction to engage in investigation or rulemaking with respect to that product without regard to whether an aluminum branch circuit wiring system, as a distinct product, qualifies as a consumer product. <em>See Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>CPSC, supra. </em>In sum, if a component is a consumer product, the Commission has jurisdiction to investigate the entire system, since the hazard is \u201cassociated with\u201d the component, but the Commission does not have jurisdiction to seek an adjudicatory order as to the system as a whole unless that system itself qualifies as a consumer product.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-12\">We now turn to this all-important definition. The complete text of CPSA \u00a7 3(a)(1) appears in the margin.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Its core provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1379-13\">The term \u201cconsumer product\u201d means any article, or component part thereof, produced or distributed (i) for sale to a consumer for use in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise, or (ii) for the personal use, consumption or enjoyment of a consumer in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1379-14\">1. <em>The term \u201carticle.\u201d A </em>consumer product may be \u201cany article, or component part thereof.\u201d From the context of the term \u201carticle,\u201d and particularly its juxtaposition with the phrase, \u201ccomponent part thereof,\u201d we discern that Congress contemplated an object produced or distributed as a distinct article of commerce, rather than any physical entity that might exist only at an intermediate stage of production.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Senate Committee explained the reason for its insertion of the phrase \u201cor component part thereof:\u201d \u201cThe definition of \u2018consumer product\u2019 has been broadened to include \u2018a component\u2019 of the product, so that the Agency could regulate just a part of a product, if only such regulation is warranted.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, a product may be a \u201cconsumer product\u201d if it either is produced or dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>tributed as a distinct article of commerce (and fulfills the other definitional requirements), or is produced or distributed as a component part of such a distinct article.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">2. <em>Alternative modes of distribution. </em>A consumer product must be produced or distributed either \u201c(i) for sale to a consumer . . .,\u201d or \u201c(ii) for the personal use, consumption or enjoyment of a consumer . . . .\u201d What clause (i) contemplates is a direct sale of the product to the consumer. The legislative history reveals that clause (ii) was intended to complement clause (i) by reaching situations in which a consumer acquires the use of a product other than through a direct sale transaction, e. <em>g., </em>through lease, promotional gift, or purchase by an institution for consumer use.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Together, clauses (i) and (ii) were designed to ensure that the definition of consumer product would encompass the various modes of distribution through which consumers acquire products and are exposed to the risks of injury associated with those products.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1380-10\">3. <em>Housing is not a \u201cconsumer product.\u201d </em>Generally, an aluminum branch circuit wiring system is produced and distributed for sale to a consumer or for the use of a consumer as a component part of a residential structure. The language of the statute as well as the legislative history make clear that housing as such is not a \u201cconsumer product.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> However, the Commission has taken the position that its jurisdiction extends to every component part of a dwelling including the central wiring and plumbing systems as well as the wall and flooring systems and their various building components. Such an extension of the statutory language would seem to ignore a contrary congressional intention and potentially raises significant problems of federalism in areas of building construction currently regulated extensively by local jurisdictions. Despite the best efforts of able counsel, the Commission had obvious difficulty at oral argument defending its interpretation in the face of the conceded congressional unwillingness to grant jurisdiction over housing, and the pervasive tone of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>a statutory scheme that carefully limits the scope of the agency\u2019s authority.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1381-4\">4. <em>Requirement that product be \u201ccustomarily\u201d sold to consumers as a distinct article. </em>Since housing as such is not a consumer product, a component part of a residence \u2014 its aluminum branch circuit wiring system \u2014 cannot qualify as a consumer product unless it is produced or distributed as a distinct article of commerce. The legislative history makes clear that when a consumer buys all of the component parts of an aluminum branch circuit wiring system, and then puts together the system himself, for his own use, the resulting product is not within the definition of \u201cconsumer product.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Nor does the Act cover aluminum branch circuit wiring systems merely because they are purchased as a component part of a house, for a house is not a consumer product. But the definition may apply if the wirings systems are bought separately by consumers \u2014 one may hypothesize consumers who act as their own general contractors in residential construction, and contract with electricians to install the wiring systems.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Nevertheless, if such situations are rare and out of the ordinary they would not suffice to ground the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-24\">Subsection 3(a)(1)(A) provides that the term \u201cconsumer product\u201d does not include: \u201cany article which is not customarily produced or distributed for sale to, or use or consumption by, or enjoyment of, a consumer.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Apparently one motivation for this provision was to exclude \u201cindustrial products\u201d from the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>but the provision is not so defined. The limitation on jurisdiction applies whenever the production for sale or use by a consumer is only occasional and is not customary. Conversely, if a product is customarily sold or otherwise distributed to consumers, then it remains a \u201cconsumer product\u201d notwithstanding that a large portion of the product\u2019s distribution is for industrial purposes.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Jurisdiction does not require a showing that a majority of product sales are to consumers, but there must be a significant marketing of the product as a distinct article of commerce for sale to consumers or for the use of consumers before the product may be considered as \u201ccustomarily\u201d produced or distributed in that manner.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\">We are dealing here not with an exemption, which often triggers the conception that the burden is on the one claiming the exemption, but with a provision defining jurisdiction \u2014 it includes A, but not B. The Commission\u2019s jurisdiction is ultimately dependent on a determination that aluminum branch circuit wiring systems are customarily sold or otherwise distributed to consumers as distinct articles of commerce. While this appears unlikely, it is inappropriate to take judicial notice of the nonexistence of such a jurisdictional fact. This determination should be made in the first instance by the agency. We remand to the district court for further consideration. It should first inquire whether the Commission has made the jurisdictional findings necessary to bring an action maintainable only as to a consumer product. If the agency has undertaken the requisite analysis, the court should conduct appropriate review. If the agency has not made the analysis necessary for jurisdiction, the district court will enter an appropriate order.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1382-9\">B. <em>Collateral Estoppel Effect of Decision of Delaware District Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1382-10\">The district court dismissed the Commission\u2019s complaint as to Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. because it felt constrained to give collateral estoppel effect to Judge Stapleton\u2019s jurisdictional ruling in <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>CPSC, </em>428 F.Supp. 177 (D.Del.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-11\">A ruling for which collateral estoppel effect is sought must have been essential to the judgment in a prior proceeding. IB J. Moore, Federal Practice 10.441[2], at 3777 (1974); <em>see </em>Restatement of Judgments \u00a7 70, Comment b (1942). The jurisdictional question in this case is whether aluminum branch circuit wiring systems are \u201cconsumer products.\u201d This was not the issue before the Delaware district court. A fair reading of Judge Stapleton\u2019s decision makes clear that the only issue actually litigated in Delaware related to aluminum wiring, a distinct product from the one involved in this case. The dicta relating to aluminum branch circuit wiring systems were unnecessary to the judgment in the Delaware case. For the same reason, the Third Circuit\u2019s ruling on appeal, <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. v. CPSC, </em>574 F.2d 178 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S.-, 99 S.Ct. 218, 58 L.Ed.2d 193 (1978), is not entitled to effect on the basis of collateral estoppel in this case. We find the doctrine of collateral estoppel inapplicable, and vacate this portion of the ruling so that the district court may proceed as to Kaiser in the same manner it finds appropriate as to the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-14\">\n<em>Remanded for further proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">. Prior to the mid-1960\u2019s copper wiring was the choice of electrical contractors for use in residential wiring systems. Although aluminum is an excellent conductor of electricity, the metal found its principal use as a conductor in utility distribution lines, feeder lines, and aircraft wiring, uses for which its light weight and low cost gave it a competitive advantage over copper. As the cost of copper began to exceed significantly the cost of aluminum, aluminum wiring came into widespread use in residential branch circuit wiring systems. <em>See </em>Brief of CPSC at 12-13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1376-6\">.

The Report of the Senate Commerce Committee on CPSA, S.Rep.No.92-749, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. (1972), elaborated on the somewhat ambiguous language of subpart (ii):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1380-8\">To qualify as a \u201cconsumer product,\u201d therefore, the product must be one capable of production or distribution for sale to an individual but it is not necessary that the product actually be sold. For example, new razor blades distributed free of charge as a promotion would be considered \u201cconsumer products\u201d under the terms of [the Act], or a product offered \u201cfree\u201d but requiring other consideration would be a consumer product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApK\"><em>Id. </em>at 12. The Report of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on CPSA, H.R.Rep.No.92-1153, 92d Cong., 2d Sess.

Thus products which are manufactured for lease and products distributed without charge (for promotional purposes or otherwise) are included within the definition and would be subject to regulation under this bill. Also, products which are primarily or exclusively sold to industrial or institutional buyers would be included within the definition of consumer product so long as they were produced or distributed for use of consumers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKk\"><em>Id. </em>at 27 (emphasis and ellipses in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1380-12\">.

The phrasing in the definitional section requiring that a consumer product be \u201cfor use in or around a permanent or temporary household or residence, a school, in recreation, or otherwise,\u201d would on its face seem to preclude the possibility that housing was intended to be within the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction. This natural reading of the statutory language is confirmed in the legislative history. <em>See, e. g., </em>118 Cong.Rec. 21897-901 (1972) (Senate debate preceding the defeat of an amendment to include mobile homes within CPSC\u2019s jurisdiction).
