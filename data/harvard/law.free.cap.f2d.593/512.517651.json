Belle, </em>and the substitution of an en banc decision in said case. <em>See </em>593 F.2d 487 (3d Cir. 1979). These changes, entered subsequent to the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of certiorari in this case, <em>United States v. Munford, </em>have no effect on the legal substance of either opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b572-17\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"ApM\">GIBBONS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b572-18\">Joe Chatman Munford appeals from a judgment of sentence after a jury found him guilty of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. The facts of the case are provided in the majority opinion for the court en banc in <em>United States v. Belle, </em>3 Cir., 593 F.2d 487, No. 77 1903. There, Judge Garth sets forth the reasons why a <em>Terry </em>stop of Belle was proper. Those reasons apply with equivalent force to Mun-ford. Similarly, the majority\u2019s conclusions that Belle\u2019s arrest was lawful and that the seizure of the heroin from the Lincoln Continental under Munford\u2019s control was proper govern Munford\u2019s assertion to like effect as well. Munford also contends: (1) that his post-arrest statements, made after he received <em>Miranda </em>warnings, should have been excluded; (2) that there was insufficient evidence to sustain a verdict against him; (3) that the district court impermissibly summarized the evidence; and (4) that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper. We reject all these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-21\">The judgment appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
