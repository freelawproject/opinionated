Specifically, \u00a7 134.57 limits the availability of the nonprofit rate to matter owned by a qualified nonprofit organization; prohibits a quali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>fied nonprofit organization from delegating or lending the use of its special privilege; and denies the nonprofit rate to \u201c[cjooperative mailings involving the mailing of matter in behalf of or produced for an organization not authorized to mail at the special bulk third-class rate.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aod\">Appellants, affiliated nonprofit organizations with a combined membership of 12 million, are qualified nonprofit organizations under DMCS \u00a7 300.221. In the summer of 1975, they sought to mail to their newly enrolled members, at the third-class nonprofit rate, a catalog of pharmaceutical products available for purchase by mail. Mail orders were to be serviced by Retired Persons Services, Inc. (RPS), a separate nonprofit corporation controlled by appellants. RPS was not qualified for special third-class mailing privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">USPS refused to accept the catalog for mailing at the third-class nonprofit rate. Upon application by the appellant associations, the Director of the Office of Mail Classification ruled that the proposed mailing was a cooperative mailing under \u00a7 134.-57 and was therefore ineligible for the nonprofit rate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1422-8\">Appellants sought judicial review, hardly surprising in view of the substantial financial impact of the ruling.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court granted USPS\u2019 motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On appeal, the associations press three claims: 1) USPS lacked authority to issue \u00a7 134.57 because the regulation constituted a change in a mail classification, a matter reserved exclusively to the Postal Rate Commission (PRC) under the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 (Act); <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 2) assuming USPS authority, \u00a7 134.57 is nevertheless invalid because it was not issued in accordance with the notice and comment procedures required by the Administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>Procedure Act (APA); <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 3) the district court erred in granting summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact remained unresolved. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-4\">A. <em>Rule As Valid Interpretation Of Mail Classifications</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">As to appellants\u2019 first claim, we conclude that \u00a7 134.57 was a valid exercise by USPS of authority to interpret the mail classification schedule established by the PRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-6\">Under the Act, ultimate authority to fix mail classifications resides with the Governors of USPS.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This authority is exercised by means of a three step classification process. First, USPS must request a recommended decision from the Postal Rate Commission, a regulatory body independent from USPS.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The PRC must then make a recommended decision, taking into account the policies of the Act and certain enumerated factors.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Finally, the Governors may approve, allow under protest, reject, or modify a recommended decision of the PRC.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1423-7\">Although appellants state flatly that \u201call congressionally delegated authority over mail classifications was assigned to the [PRC];\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we think it clear that the PRC does not have exclusive jurisdiction of all matters touching on mail classifications. Instead, PRC jurisdiction need be invoked only where a USPS proposal amounts to a change in a mail classification. USPS possesses a residuum of authority to interpret mail classifications in the process of implementing them, so long as that interpretation does not effect a substantive change in the types of mail or the identity of mailers encompassed within the classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-16\">This conclusion is fairly apparent from the language of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3623 (1976), the provision of the Act governing mail classifications. That section requires that USPS request a recommended decision from the PRC only \u201con <em>changes </em>in the mail classification schedule.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The conclusion also stems from the practical reality that a classification schedule can only define general outlines; USPS must retain some flexibility and discretion to interpret the general provisions of the mail classification schedule in day-to-day implementation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> USPS need not rely solely on case-by-case interpretation. It may choose to exercise its rulemaking power<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> by an interpretative rule. Such an interpretative rule is general, in the sense that it guides all postal officials in applying a mail classification and assures that they will provide a consistent and uniform interpretation, but the rule remains one of interpretation of the classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-17\">The essence of appellants\u2019 claim is not that USPS has no interpretative discretion, but that \u00a7 134.57 does indeed work a change in the scope of a mail classification. In support, appellants place principal reliance on the language of DMCS \u00a7 300.221 and the statutory classification that it replaced.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>Under those provisions, the third-class bulk nonprofit rate is available for matter \u201cmailed by\u201d qualified nonprofit organizations. These words are read literally by appellants, so as to place no restriction on what may be mailed so long as the mailing itself is by the qualified nonprofit organization. Thus, appellants argue that by adopting \u00a7 134.57, USPS impermissibly restricted the availability of the special third-class rate, a function reserved to the PRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-4\">We believe USPS validly exercised its interpretative discretion in concluding in \u00a7 134.57 that the \u201cmailed by\u201d language of the governing provisions contained, by fair implication, limitations on the use of the nonprofit rate. Congress, in enacting the statutory classification, and the PRC, in adopting it following passage of the Act, established certain criteria for qualification for the nonprofit rate. Chief among them was the requirement that an organization be a \u201creligious, educational, scientific, philanthropic, agricultural, labor, veterans or fraternal\u201d organization.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The USPS interpretation reflects a conclusion that Congress and the PRC contemplated that the nonprofit rate would be used for the purposes of the listed organizations, and not for other purposes \u2014 such as commercial activities \u2014 inconsistent with the grant of qualification. Viewed in this light, \u00a7 134.-57\u2019s limitations are eminently reasonable as effectuating the implicit purpose of the provisions.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1424-11\">Appellants\u2019 position implies that, whatever the reasonableness of USPS\u2019s interpretation, it represents a departure from USPS\u2019s prior actual practice or policy. Yet appellants point to no record evidence demonstrating a different application by USPS prior to the issuance of \u00a7 134.57. The record does not illuminate the practice of the Post Office Department under the statutory classification prior to the enactment of the Postal Reorganization Act. But it does show that since the passage of the Act, USPS has applied the classification in a manner consistent with the interpretation adopted in \u00a7 134.57.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In this posture, we credit USPS\u2019s contention that the interpretation did not change appellants\u2019 rights and obligations under DMCS \u00a7 300.221 and the earlier classifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-12\">B. <em>Notice And Comment Requirement Inapplicable</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1424-13\">Appellants\u2019 other contentions do not require extended discussion. As to the claim that notice and comment procedures were not followed, USPS urges that 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(a) (1976) exempts it from the requirements of the APA.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We do not decide this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>question. Our discussion of \u00a7 134.57 as an exercise of interpretative discretion by USPS indicates that, in any event, the section would fall within the \u201cinterpretative rule\u201d exception to the notice and comment procedures.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1425-5\">C. <em>Propriety Of Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1425-6\">We find little merit in appellants\u2019 claim of error in the granting of summary judgment. The associations assert that a genuine issue of fact remained as to whether the Director of the Office of Mail Classification considered all factors in concluding that Retired Persons Services benefited in part from the cooperative mailing. Because RPS is a nonprofit corporation controlled by the associations, it is argued, any benefit inures not to the corporation but to the associations\u2019 membership. We do not think form can be so lightly disregarded. The separate corporate structure was necessary precisely because RPS\u2019s commercial activities are inconsistent with the types of purposes required for qualification under DMCS \u00a7 300.221. The associations could not have engaged in such activity themselves without risking loss of their nonprofit privileges. The focus of \u00a7 134.57 is the nature of the activities of the cooperative organizations, not the ultimate beneficiaries of the mailing. For this reason, the Director\u2019s determination that the cooperative mailing proposed here fell within the rule is clearly supportable.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1425-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1421-14\">. 40 Fed.Reg. 37209 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1421-15\">.

The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, Pub.L. No. 91-375, 84 Stat. 719, effectively repealed all statutory mail classifications, and created a new procedure for administrative determination of mail classifications. 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3623(a) (1976) required USPS to request from the Postal Rate Commission (PRC) a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the applicable effective date. In response to that request, the PRC recommended the adoption of the DMCS including \u00a7 300.221. <em>See </em>Postal Rate Commission, Docket No. MC73-1, <em>Opinion and Recommended Decision </em>128 (April 15, 1976). Pursuant to 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3625 (1976), the Governors of the Postal Service approved the recommended decision. <em>Decision of the Governors of the United States Postal Service on Establishing a Mail Classification Schedule </em>(June 2, 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-6\">During the interim between passage of the Act and promulgation of the new classification schedule, the old classifications remained in effect as regulations of the Postal Service.

USPS could certainly take this prohibition into account in devising the proper interpretation of the applicable classifications. We do not suggest, however, that \u00a7 403(c) provides USPS the power unilaterally to change classifications when it perceives undue discrimination or preferences in the classifications established by the PRC. In that circumstance, the proper recourse would be a request to the PRC for a recommended decision on a classification change.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1424-8\">. <em>See </em>J.A. at 133-81.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1424-9\">. 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(a) (1976) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1424-14\">Except as otherwise provided ... no Federal law dealing with public or Federal contracts, property, works, officers, employees, budgets, or funds, including the provisions of chapters 5 and 7 of title 5 [the APA], shall apply to the exercise of the powers of the Postal Service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1424-15\">The district court concluded that a reading of \u00a7 410(a) that exempted USPS from the APA would defy \u201csimple rules of grammar.\u201d <em>National Retired Teachers Ass\u2019n v.

In the district court\u2019s view, the APA\u2019s rulemaking provision, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1976), was not a federal law \u201cdealing with public or Federal contracts, property, works, officers, employees, budgets, or funds.\u201d USPS contends that its view is entirely supportable by a natural reading of \u00a7 410(a). In effect, insertion of the phrase \u201cincluding the provisions of chapters 5 and 7 of title 5\u201d reflected a congressional conclusion that the APA was itself a law dealing with federal officers or employees.
