Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Randolph Phillips appeals from a memorandum order and a judgment entered June 27, 1978 in the Southern District of New York, Honorable Vincent L. Broderick, Judge, granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint in this action brought for an alleged violation of section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) (The Act), as barred by the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment and remand to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">On May 20, 1968, appellant opened an account with appellee Phillips Appel &amp; Walden, Inc. (Appel), a member of the New York Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers and a licensed broker-dealer. At that time appellee Levie,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> an account representative of Appel, assisted Phillips in completing a \u201cnew account form\u201d which reflected Phillips\u2019 standing instructions that all shares purchased for his account were to be mailed to him. Upon Levie\u2019s recommendation Phillips purchased through Appel 3,000 shares of Kloof Gold Mining Co., Ltd. (Kloof) from Singer &amp; Mackie, Inc. (Singer). Pursuant to the terms of the written confirmation of the purchase order Phillips remitted payment of the $24,298.50 purchase price<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to Weis, Voisin, Cannon, Inc. (Weis), clearing broker for Appel. Delivery of the shares to appellant was to be made on the settlement date, May 27, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">Weis, however, did not mail the Kloof shares to Phillips. Instead Phillips received a monthly statement dated May 31, 1968 which indicated that the Kloof shares were being held by Weis for Phillips\u2019 account. This statement was not accurate. In fact, the Kloof shares had not yet been delivered to Weis by the selling broker, Singer. Weis did not receive the Kloof stock from Singer until June 13, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-16\">In any event, after receipt of .the monthly statement Phillips requested in a letter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>June 7, 1968 that Weis forward the shares to the firm of Halle &amp; Steiglitz. When the shares were not forthcoming Phillips directed subsequent requests for delivery of the Kloof stock to Weis\u2019 vice-president on July 2, 1968 and at an unspecified date soon thereafter. These requests were also unavailing. Finally, on July 16, 1968 Phillips instructed Weis to sell the stock. After effecting the transaction Weis sent Phillips a cheek in the amount of $23,475 covering the proceeds of the sale minus tax and commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Phillips filed a complaint in the district court on June 10, 1974, alleging jurisdiction under the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the district court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AieL\">The gravamen of [Phillips\u2019] complaint is that Appel, through its agent Weis, fraudulently retained possession of plaintiff\u2019s shares; that when the price of those shares began to fall plaintiff was precluded from selling them; and that on July 16, 1968 plaintiff was compelled to sell the shares through Weis in order to free his funds, thereby paying a \u201ccoerced commission,\u201d having been unable to sell through the broker of his choice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Phillips asserted that the above facts stated a claim under section 10(b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240,10b-5.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Additionally, he maintained that his complaint set forth a state law breach of contract action over which the district court had pendent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">Appel denied the material allegations of the complaint and asserted numerous affirmative defenses, including that of statute of limitations. Appel subsequently moved for summary judgment on five of its affirmative defenses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Phillips cross-moved for summary judgment. The district court granted Appel\u2019s motion solely on the basis that the federal securities law claim was time-barred and dismissed the complaint. Phillips\u2019 motion for reargument was denied and this appeal followed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b521-16\">Since the Act provides no statute of limitations for actions brought under section 10(b) the federal courts apply the limitations period applicable to the forum\u2019s most closely analogous state law action. <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 210 n.18, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976); see <em>Stull v. Bayard, </em>561 F.2d 429, 431 (2d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1035, 98 S.Ct. 769, 54 L.Ed.2d 783 (1978). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>This circuit has repeatedly held that New York\u2019s statute of limitations governing common law fraud actions is applicable to section 10(b) claims. E. g., <em>Klein v. Shields &amp; Co., </em>470 F.2d 1344 (2d Cir. 1972); <em>Klein v. Auchincloss, Parker &amp; Redpath, </em>436 F.2d 339, 341 (2d Cir. 1971). At the same time federal law determines when the period begins to run as to a federal securities law claim. <em>Arneil v. Ramsey, </em>550 F.2d 774, 780 (2d Cir. 1977). Under federal law the statute begins to run \u201cwhen the plaintiff has actual knowledge of the alleged fraud or knowledge of facts which in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have led to actual knowledge.\u201d <em>Stull v. Bayard, supra, </em>at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Applying these principles the district court looked to N.Y.C.P.L.R. \u00a7 213(8),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which sets forth a six year statute of limitations period for fraud actions, and held that pursuant to federal law the statute began to run from the time Phillips reasonably should have discovered the fraudulent scheme. The district judge then found that Phillips \u201cwas in possession of all the information necessary to alert him to the alleged fraud\u201d by June 7, 1968, the date on which he wrote to Weis insisting that the Kloof shares be sent to him according to his earlier instructions. The district court held, therefore, that the six year limitation period had run by June 10, 1974 when Phillips filed his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">We fully agree that commencement of the statutory period does not await a plaintiff\u2019s \u201cleisurely discovery of the full details of the alleged scheme,\u201d <em>Klein v. Bower, </em>421 F.2d 338, 343 (2d Cir. 1970); accord, <em>Arneil v. Ramsey, supra, </em>550 F.2d at 780. However, here Phillips did not act in a dilatory fashion. He was advised on May 31, 1968 that the Kloof shares were being held by Weis for his account. Phillips then made several prompt requests for delivery between June 7 and July 16. Had appellant made an immediate investigation he would have found that Weis had not even received the Kloof stock until June 13, 1968. Thus the circumstances prior to that date might have indicated either a negligent or intentional breach of the agreement with Phillips, but they did not demonstrate a fraudulent <em>retention </em>of the shares, which is the gist of the complaint.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The alleged fraudulent retention could only have commenced on June 13, not at an earlier date as found below.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, the action commenced on June 10, 1974 was timely under the six year statute of limitations applicable in New York.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Avx\">. 74 Civ. 2502 (June 13, 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b520-11\">. Since the complaint was filed and summons issued June 10, 1974 and Levie was never served, the district court dismissed the complaint against Levie for failure to prosecute. Appellant has not contested this ruling on appeal and we see no reason to disturb this portion of the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b520-18\">. The total included the $7.95 per share price of Kloof stock and the $484.50 commission on the transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\">. In 1969 Phillips filed an action against Weis in the Southern District of New York alleging federal securities law violations arising from Weis\u2019 failure to deliver the shares. Soon after initiation of that action Weis went into bankruptcy and the suit has not been actively pursued. On this appeal Phillips contends that filing of the 1969 action against Weis tolled the statute of limitations from running in favor of appellees. See N.Y.C.P.L.R. \u00a7 203(b). In view of our disposition of this appeal we need not address this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b521-9\">. Phillips also claimed a violation of section 10(a) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(a) and Reg. 10a-2(a), 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10a-2(a). Section 10(a), however, is concerned with regulation of manipulative and deceptive practices in short sales. On appeal Phillips has conceded that no short sale was involved here and that section 10(a) is, accordingly, not relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b521-10\">. See generally Jacobs, The Impact of Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 on Broker-Dealers, 57 Cornell L.Rev. 869, 957-63 (1972). In view of its holding that any action under section 10(b) arising out of these facts was time-barred, the district court made no attempt to examine the substantive viability of Phillips\u2019 federal securities law claims. Absent findings on this matter in the district court we are disinclined to make such a determination in the first instance. See <em>Republic Technology Fund, Inc. v. Lionel Corp., </em>483 F.2d 540, 553 (2d Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 918, 94 S.Ct. 1416, 39 L.Ed.2d 472 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b521-18\">. These affirmative defenses were 1) failure to join a party needed for just adjudication pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 19; 2) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; 3) lack of subject matter jurisdiction; 4) statute of limitations; 5) estoppel, waiver, affirmance and laches.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b521-19\">. The lower court also denied Phillips\u2019 cross-motion, denied attorney\u2019s fees to both parties, and awarded appellee costs. Although noting that the common law breach of contract action also appeared to be time-barred, the district court simply dismissed that pendent claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b522-5\">. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 213(8) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">an action based upon fraud; the time within which the action must be commenced shall be computed from the time the plaintiff or the person under whom he claims discovered the fraud, or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\">. Had Phillips looked deeper into the circumstances surrounding Weis\u2019 failure to comply with his directives of May 20 and June 7, we simply cannot say with assurance that he would have been alerted to the alleged fraudulent withholding of his shares by Weis. Compare <em>Arneil </em>v. <em>Ramsey, supra </em>(plaintiff should have discovered his claim after New York Stock Exchange issued public notice of defendant\u2019s financial difficulties and one defendant had admitted willful securities law violations in an S.E.C. release); <em>Berry Petroleum Co. v. Adams &amp; Peck, </em>518 F.2d 402, 410 (2d Cir. 1975) (plaintiffs should have discovered fraud in view of suspension of trading in defendant\u2019s stock and the filing of lawsuits against defendant by S.E.C. and private parties).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b522-10\">. We are not unmindful of a district court\u2019s obligation to examine the essence of a plaintiffs action rather than its label so that the plaintiff cannot \u201cevade the strictures of limitations statutes simply by clever characterization of claims.\u201d <em>Korry v. ITT Corp., </em>444 F.Supp. 193, 195 (S.D.N.Y.1978). In the instant case, however, the allegation of actual possession by Weis of the Kloof shares is so integral to the alleged fraudulent retention that we do not view Phillips\u2019 complaint as an exercise in legal legerdemain. Whether on these facts appellant can establish a 10(b) violation, of course, is an issue upon which we make no judgment. See note 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b522-11\">. The court below failed to indicate that section 213(8) is not the sole statute involved in determining the New York limitation period for fraud actions. N.Y.C.P.L.R. \u00a7 203(f) must also be consulted. E. g., <em>Klein v. Shields &amp; Co., supra; Hoff Research &amp; Development Laboratories, Inc. v. Philippine National Bank, </em>426 F.2d 1023, 1025-26 (2d Cir. 1970). That section provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH-M\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>. [W]here the time within which an action must be commenced is computed from the time when facts were discovered or from the time when facts could with reasonable diligence have been discovered, or from either of such times, the action must be commenced within two years after such actual or imputed discovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">When sections 213(8) and 203(f) are read together, they have been construed to mean that in fraud actions suit must be commenced within six years after the commission of the fraud or within two years of the date the fraud was or should have been discovered, <em>whichever is longer. Stull v. Bayard, supra, </em>561 F.2d at 432; <em>Rutland House Associates v. Danoff, </em>37 A.D.2d 828, 325 N.Y.S.2d 273 (1st Dept. 1971); see McLaughlin, Commentary to N.Y.C.P.L.R. \u00a7 203(f) at 125-26 (McKinney 1972). Since the fraud claimed here could not have commenced until June 13, 1968, this action is, in any event, timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
