SKELLY WRIGHT, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1399-20\">Like Scylla and Charybdis, the petitioners in these two cases challenge from opposite sides Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208, which requires \u201cpassive restraints,\u201d such as automatic seatbelts or airbags, in all pas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>senger cars sold in this country after September 1, 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In No. 77-1797 petitioners argue that there is insufficient empirical support for Standard 208, and that the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) violated the Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (Safety Act)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by failing to consider public reaction to passive restraints and by ignoring potential hazards posed by them. Petitioners in No. 78-1034, in contrast, insist that the Secretary improperly delayed implementation of the Standard and lacked good cause for permitting car manufacturers to introduce passive restraints gradually, rather than requiring full compliance by the effective date. We find that the Secretary acted within his statutory authority and validly issued the passive restraint order under his rulemaking powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-5\">After the \u201cfirst collision\u201d between an automobile and an external object, passenger restraint systems protect against the \u201csecond collision\u201d between vehicle occupants and the interior of the car.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 1967 the Secretary of Transportation issued the original Standard 208, requiring seatbelts in all passenger cars to reduce damages from the second collision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By July 1969, however, the Department of Transportation (DOT) concluded that the level of seatbelt use was far too low to reduce traffic injuries to an acceptable level.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, DOT sought to develop \u201cpassive restraints\u201d that would protect car occupants automatically. Two currently available systems protect against injuries from the second collision without requiring independent action by motorists. \u201cPassive seatbelts,\u201d which function like shoulder belts when in position, deploy around front seat occupants as they enter the car and close the doors, but are largely restricted to use in cars with bucket seats.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Airbags are cushions stored under the dashboard that, when triggered by a frontal collision, fill with stored or rapidly generated gas to protect the rider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>from collision with the car\u2019s interior.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Both are designed to protect occupants in frontal crashes, so riders must wear lap belts to guard against injury from lateral-impact crashes and roll-overs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1401-4\">Beginning in May 1970 the agency conducted a lengthy rulemaking proceeding on passenger restraint systems, and in 1972 adopted a rule that established a three-step approach.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Between January 1972 and August 1973 new cars would have to be equipped with lap and shoulder belts for front seats, with a warning to go off when the belts were not fastened, and lap belts at other seating positions. From August 1973 to August 1975 new cars would have to provide at least lap and shoulder belts for front seat occupants with an \u201cignition interlock\u201d system that would prevent the car from starting while those belts were not connected. Finally, after August 1975 new cars would have passive protection for all passengers. The 1972 passive restraint standard, like the rule before us now, was a performance standard. Rather than dictate any particular form of passive protection, the rule established minimum criteria that cars would have to meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-5\">The 1972 rule foundered both in the courts and in Congress. In December of that year the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that, although \u201cthe Agency\u2019s decision to require passive restraints is supported by substantial evidence,\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> its testing procedures did not satisfy the Safety Act\u2019s requirement that standards be \u201cobjective.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court found that the anthropomorphic dummies used in crash tests had been insufficiently uniform and had not replicated several characteristics of the human body.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The ignition interlock system mandated by the second step of the 1972 rule was unaffected by the Sixth Circuit\u2019s finding,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and briefly increased seatbelt use.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> By late 1974, however, the nation\u2019s irritation at being unable to start a car without fastening the seat-belts drove Congress to ban ignition interlocks and continuous buzzers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That legislation also limited DOT\u2019s discretion to amend Standard 208 in the future. If any modification could not be satisfied by a seatbelt system, it would have to be submitted to Congress, which could veto it by concurrent resolution of both houses.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1401-15\">Despite the demise of the 1972 rule, DOT continued to study passive restraints,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and. in 1976 then Secretary William Coleman initiated a new rulemaking proceeding on the issue.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> After hearing public testimony' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>and reviewing written comments, Coleman concluded that passive restraints were technologically and economically feasible and would \u201cprovide substantially increased protection to the public in traffic accidents * * <em>*n </em><footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Nevertheless, because he anticipated public resistance to passive restraints, Coleman did not order their introduction. Instead, he proposed to contract with four automobile manufacturers for production of up to 500,000 cars with passive restraints as a demonstration program to smooth public reception of the new safety systems.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1402-4\">The current Secretary of Transportation, Brock Adams, reopened the passive restraint rulemaking only four months after Coleman\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Following another round of written comments and a public hearing, Adams issued the mandatory passive restraint rule now before us.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Adams squarely rejected Coleman\u2019s view of the likely public reaction to passive restraints, which had been based largely on the ignition interlock episode.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Adams insisted that the interlock system met with public obloquy because it required affirmative action by the occupant, while passive restraints, by definition, make no such demand.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Because passive restraints would not force changes in the public\u2019s behavior, Adams concluded, there was no need to wait for a demonstration program to convert public attitudes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-13\">On related issues Adams agreed with Coleman that (1) according to available experimental data and limited field experience, passive restraints could prevent approximately 9,000 deaths and over 100,000 injuries;<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> (2) with these expected benefits reflected in lower insurance premiums, passive restraint systems would not present an unreasonable economic burden for motorists; <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and (3) possible negative effects, such as accidental deployment of airbags, lower use of lap belts, and possible danger from the gases used in airbags, would be offset by the advantages of passive restraints.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The Secretary ordered a \u201cphasing-in\u201d of passive restraint systems. For model year 1982 all new cars with wheelbases above 114 inches would have to be equipped with full passive restraint systems for front seat occupants. In the following year cars with wheelbases between 100 and 114 inches would have to comply, and all 1984 models would be held to the Standard.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1402-14\">Revised Standard 208 was then submitted to the Congress, where no action was taken to veto it.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Secretary rejected petitions for reconsideration from both groups <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>participating in these cases,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and these appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-5\">Our review proceeds under both the informal rulemaking provision of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and the substantive sections of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act. The latter statute requires that Motor Vehicle Safety Standards \u201cshall be practicable, shall meet the need for motor vehicle safety, and shall be stated in objective terms.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In addition, the Secretary must \u201cconsider relevant available motor vehicle safety data\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and determine the appropriateness of the standard for the type of vehicle covered by it.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> As applied, these standards can be tested as part of our \u201cthorough, probing, in-depth review\u201d of the record on appeals of informal rulemaking under the APA.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Of course, we may not substitute our judgment for the agency\u2019s. Still, we must determine that the agency action was consistent with its statutory mandate, rational, and not arbitrary. As this court noted in an earlier Safety Act case, a court must decide \u201cwhether the agency has performed in accordance with the Congressional purposes.\u201d In that effort</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag5\">[t]he paramount objective is to see whether the agency, given an essentially legislative task to perform, has carried it out in a manner calculated to negate the dangers of arbitrariness and irrationality in the formulation of rules for general application in the future. * * * [<footnotemark>36</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1403-17\">In addition, because the order under review here reversed a prior policy, the agency must provide \u201can opinion or analysis indicating that the standard is being changed and not ignored, and assuring that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>faithful and not indifferent to the rule of law.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1404-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-5\">Petitioners Pacific Legal Foundation <em>et. ah </em>offer three major reasons for overturning revised Standard 208: (A) that experimental and real-world data do not support the Secretary\u2019s findings on the effectiveness of airbags; (B) that the Secretary violated the Safety Act by failing to consider public reaction to the revised Standard; and (C) that the rule ignores collateral dangers to public safety posed by airbags.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1404-6\">A. <em>Effectiveness of Passive Restraints</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aq7S\">Petitioners concede that seatbelts, including passive belts, are an effective passenger restraint system. They challenge, however, DOT\u2019s conclusion that laboratory tests and limited field experience establish the reliability of airbags which, given current technology and the rule before us, would probably have to be installed in 75 percent of American cars.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> After reviewing the record in this case, we find that the Secretary\u2019s decision was rational.</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-7\">Since this rulemaking began in 1969 DOT has conducted over 2,000 crash tests of airbags, including 188 with human volunteers in the vehicles, 274 with dummies,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and a handful with cadavers and baboons.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Following these experiments, involving collisions at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour, the agency concluded that if airbags were installed in all cars over 9,000 fatalities and over 100,000 injuries would be averted.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> When these figures were first released the Secretary conceded that \u201c[sjimulations can, of course, never duplicate * * * real-world collisions and thus there is greater uncertainty in the accuracy of the estimates * * * \u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Nevertheless, carefully conducted tests can provide the basis for a standard under the Safety Act. As the Sixth Circuit acknowledged in <em>Chrysler, </em>the statute authorizes safety standards that push the automobile industry beyond present engineering capabilities,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and such standards could not be developed without heavy reliance on experimental simulations. A necessary corollary to this position is that DOT must monitor closely the road experience with any standard based on experimental data and make needed modifications.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1404-17\">Petitioners also insist that the Secretary\u2019s conclusion on airbag effectiveness is contradicted by experience with the 12,000 airbag cars currently in operation in this country.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>Indeed, there have been more fatalities in frontal accidents involving airbag cars than the statistical projections from/experimental data would have indicated.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Nevertheless, in view of the relatively small sample involved,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and the extraordinary nature of several of the accidents,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> this variation does not undermine the agency\u2019s conclusion that airbags are effective. Moreover, airbags have been very effective in reducing or preventing major injuries.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1405-4\">B. <em>Public Reaction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1405-5\">Petitioners assert that the Secretary violated his statutory mandate by refusing to consider public reaction to his decision. The importance of popular response, they contend, can be seen in the Safety Act\u2019s requirements that a safety standard be \u201cpracticable.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The Secretary stated in his order, however, that \u201cpublic acceptance or rejection of passive restraints is not one of the statutory criteria which the Department is charged by law to apply in establishing standards.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Although we agree with petitioners\u2019 view of the requirements of the Safety Act, we believe that the Secretary did take public reaction into account and satisfactorily explained his conclusion that widespread public resistance to passive restraints is unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-12\">Much as economic analysis must evaluate both supply and demand conditions, motor vehicle safety standards cannot be considered practicable unless we know both that the needed production capability is within reach and that motorists will avail themselves of the safety system. Indeed, the protracted effort to install passive restraints has been dictated by the public\u2019s steadfast refusal to use seatbelts voluntarily.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> We believe that the agency cannot fulfill its statutory responsibility unless it considers popular reaction. Without public cooperation there can be no assurance that a safety system can \u201cmeet the need for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>motor vehicle safety.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> And it would be difficult to term \u201cpracticable\u201d a system, like the ignition interlock, that so annoyed motorists that they deactivated it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-4\">Despite the Secretary\u2019s claim that he need not consider the response to the new standard, he adequately justified his action in terms of the anticipated public reaction. As noted earlier, Adams distinguished the ignition interlock affair from passive restraints on the basis of the nature of the intrusion on the individual. Passive restraints do not require independent action by passengers to activate them.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> In the 1976 decision Secretary Coleman characterized his estimate of public resistance as \u201ca matter of judgment.\u201d <footnotemark>56</footnotemark> In our view Secretary Adams provided a sufficient explanation why his judgment differed from his predecessor\u2019s.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> And on several other issues, including airbag cost<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> and maintenance,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Adams explicitly discussed the relationship between the revised Standard and public attitudes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1406-5\">Petitioners raise two related points. First, they argue that the Secretary\u2019s calculations of expected benefits from passive restraints fail to take into account the possible deactivation of systems by individual motorists, as was common with the ignition interlock. If Secretary Adams correctly anticipates minimal popular resistance to passive restraints, petitioners\u2019 argument has no force. In addition, experience with approximately 65,000 cars equipped with passive seatbelts, which are admittedly more intrusive than airbags, indicates a low deactivation rate.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> We see no basis here for disturbing the DOT rule, especially since the agency\u2019s injury-reduction estimates were revised downward by projecting less-than-total compliance with Standard 208.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-15\">Second, petitioners contend that installation of passive restraints may deter use of lap belts, noting that even if passive restraints are in place lap belts are needed to protect motorists in nonfrontal collisions. A drop in lap belt use would result in higher fatalities and injuries. DOT defends its estimate that lap belt use will continue at the 20 percent level, citing an agency study concluding that with no further need for more intrusive shoulder belts, lap belt use would actually increase to 26 percent.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Petitioners point to nothing in the record to refute the agency\u2019s estimates.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-16\">C. <em>Collateral Dangers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1406-17\">Airbags may also present collateral dangers to the public, petitioners argue, which are not justified by the expected benefits from Standard 208. We note at the outset that the Safety Act charges the Secretary with authority to balance present injuries against possible risks posed by safety equipment. As this court has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>The [agency] must of necessity consider many variables, and make \u201ctrade-offs\u201d between various desiderata in deciding upon a particular standard for auto safety * * * [<footnotemark>64</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1407-5\">The major danger associated with airbags is inadvertent deployment that might cause the driver to lose control of the car.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> There is evidence, however, that such deployments do not present a substantial hazard. In road experience three such incidents have occurred, and none caused a collision or injury,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> while tests with human volunteers have shown little loss of control by drivers.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Moreover, the agency is optimistic that the causes of the three inadvertent deployments are understood and can be remedied,<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> so there is some prospect of reducing their likelihood in the future. Even without such improvements, DOT gauges at one in 200 the chance that in a lifetime an individual would experience an inadvertent deployment as an occupant of a ear.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1407-6\">Rapidly inflating airbags also may injure out-of-position passengers in the front seat, especially children. New methods of gas generation, however, permit an initially slower inflation, with the aim of more gently moving the occupant back from the dashboard and out of harm\u2019s way.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1407-15\">Finally, the chemical used to generate the gas, usually sodium azide, may present a danger in its own right, either during the car\u2019s lifetime or upon its demolition for scrap. But placement of the carefully sealed chemical cannister behind the dashboard should be sufficiently remote to prevent most accidents with it, and the cannister could be removed prior to shredding of the car, as is currently done with batteries and gas tanks.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1407-16\">In view of these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the Secretary abused his discretion in assessing the tradeoffs between the expected benefits and the potential dangers of airbags.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1407-17\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-18\">Petitioners Nader <em>et a1. </em>present two major challenges to the delayed implementation of Standard 208: (A) the Safety Act does not authorize either the delay until the 1982 model year or the ensuing phase-in program on the basis of wheelbase size; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>and (B) the delay and phase-in were improperly adopted to avoid congressional rejection of the standard under the arguably unconstitutional one-house veto provision of the 1974 Amendments to the Safety Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-4\">A. <em>Delay and Phase-In</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1408-5\">Petitioners argue first that the Secretary did not satisfy the Safety Act\u2019s requirement that he demonstrate \u201cgood cause\u201d for not implementing the new safety standard within one year of issuance.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> They contend that \u201cmere\u201d economic hardship cannot constitute such cause when the statute\u2019s central goal \u2014 greater vehicle safety \u2014 is at stake. In his decision the Secretary explained the delay until model year 1982 as an attempt to assure \u201corderly implementation\u201d of the new standard.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> The four-year lead-in period, according to the Secretary, grants car and airbag manufacturers breathing room to gear up production.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Moreover, by encouraging voluntary production of cars with passive restraints before the 1982 models the Secretary hopes to increase the public\u2019s familiarity with the systems and facilitate their eventual acceptance.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1408-6\">We cannot agree with petitioners on this point. Although the time limit placed on implementation of new safety standards reflects Congress\u2019 conviction that safety must be a high national priority, Congress also provided the \u201cgood cause\u201d exception along with the general requirement of practicability. When dealing with a \u201ctechnology-forcing\u201d rule like Standard 208, the agency must consider the abilities of producers to comply with the new requirement and of the public to grasp the need for the change. On this record, these concerns were good cause for the delay in implementation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-14\">Petitioners also insist that the Secretary lacked statutory authority to schedule introduction of airbags according to the size of a car\u2019s wheelbase. We find no basis for this protest in the statute. Section 103(f)(3) of the Safety Act provides that the Secretary shall</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1408-15\">consider whether any such proposed standard is reasonable, practicable and appropriate for the particular <em>type </em>of motor vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment for which it is prescribed[.] t<footnotemark>77</footnotemark>l</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afz\">Petitioners; relying on \u201ccommon sense,\u201d interpret \u201ctype\u201d as referring to distinctions between vehicle functions, such as passenger cars and trucks, not vehicle size. We view the term as including both distinctions, in the effort to provide the Secretary with sufficient flexibility to tailor safety standards to engineering realities. In this instance it will be far easier to install airbags in larger cars than smaller, simply because there is more room for the system in the larger cars.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> The Secretary reasonably decided on a phase-in because of the difficulty of providing airbags in smaller cars and the likely usefulness to that endeavor of experience with larger cars.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>B. <em>Legislative Veto</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-4\">Petitioners allege that Standard 208 should not stand because the prospect of the one-house veto established by the 1974 amendments distorted the Secretary\u2019s deci- \u25a0 sion on the implementation schedule. As we have discussed, substantial basis exists in the record for the Secretary\u2019s timetable for passive restraints. Petitioners\u2019 assertion is supported only by an arguable inference from one event in the record.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> In the absence of concrete evidence, we must accept the substantial reasons offered by the Secretary for his decision.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-5\">Petitioners also claim that revised Standard 208 was not covered by the legislative veto provision because a \u201cbelt system\u201d can satisfy its requirements.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Thus they argue that Standard 208 should not have been submitted to Congress at all. We decline to reach this statutory interpretation question. Even if we assume that the Secretary was not compelled to send the standard to Congress, we can discern no consequences of his action that would constitute cause to vacate the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-6\">Finally, petitioners challenge the constitutionality of the legislative veto provision. Following this court\u2019s decision in <em>Clark v. Valeo,</em><footnotemark><em>83</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we will not review this contention in a case where Congress has not exercised the veto and where there has been no showing of direct congressional influence over the rulemaking process. In such circumstances there is serious question whether a \u201cease or controversy,\u201d as required by Article III of the Constitution, is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-7\">Accordingly, the Secretary\u2019s order is</p>\n<p id=\"A4z\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1400-6\">.

All parties agree that judicial review in this case is limited to determining whether the promulgation of the safety standards in suit is arbitrary and capricious under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1976). It might be argued, as the Sixth Circuit apparently did in <em>Chrysler Corp. v.

This position is strengthened by the provision in the 1974 Amendments to the Safety Act that the Secretary must hold a public hearing on any proposed passive restraint standard, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1410b(c)(2) (1976). Thus the action in this case might be seen to trigger the substantial evidence test for cases \u201creviewed on the record of an agency hearing provided by statute.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-19\">We do not follow this reasoning because we agree with the emerging consensus of the Courts of Appeals that the distinction between the arbitrary and capricious standard and substantial evidence review is largely semantic, and that \u201cin the review of rules of general applicability made after notice and comment rulemaking, the two criteria to tend to converge.\u201d <em>Associated Industries of New York State, Inc. v.

Petitioners emphasize that small cars provide the least crash protection to occupants and, accordingly, present the greatest need for passive restraints. Thus they argue that the implementation timetable is unfair because it leaves small car riders without passive restraints longer. Although we share petitioners\u2019 concern for small car riders, there is a rational basis for the Secretary\u2019s schedule, so we have no basis for upsetting his decision on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"80\">\n<p id=\"b1409-8\">. Petitioners cite only the Secretary\u2019s failure to follow the recommendation of NHTSA for full implementation by September 1, 1980.
