ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1337-7\">This appeal emanates from a summary judgment rejecting a claim of intentional interference by a third party with contractual relations subsisting between franchisees of retail paneling stores and their franchisor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The pivotal issue is whether the franchise contracts conferred upon the franchisees the exclusive right to sell the franchisor\u2019s products within the territories respectively franchised. A subsidiary question is whether the agreements were ambiguous on that score and thus opened the door to introduction of extrinsic evidence purporting to reflect the parties\u2019 intentions. We answer both questions in the negative and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-9\">Appellants are owners and operators of individually-franchised retail outlets in the Washington-Baltimore area known as Ply*Gem paneling centers. They obtained their franchises between 1969 and 1974 through essentially similar contracts made with a unit of a corporate group which we shall refer to as Ply*Gem.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants as-serf that by the terms of the franchise agreements, Ply*Gem guaranteed each franchisee the exclusive right to sell Ply*Gem paneling and related products within two and one-half miles of the location of his paneling center.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-21\">In March, 1976, by virtue of a contract with Ply* Gem, the Flintkote Company became the general distributor of Ply*Gem products.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *Appellants claim that Flintkote thereby gained, and began exercising, authority to sell Ply*Gem products to other retail dealers in their exclusive areas. For this they sued Flintkote for damages, alleging that it entered into the agreement \u201cwith full knowledge of the contracts between [appellants] and PLY*GEM Companies, and with the intent to injure, destroy and otherwise interfere with the due prosecution of [appellants\u2019] businesses. \u00bb<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1337-23\">Finding no ambiguity in the franchise agreements \u2014 which contained an express merger clause <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 the District Court rejected appellants\u2019 contention that by virtue of the contracts they acquired the sole right to sell Ply* Gem products within their stores\u2019 territories.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather, the court held, such exclusivity as was conferred was simply the right to be the only \u201cPly*Gem outlet within a two and one-half mile radius.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court further held that extra-contractual evidence proffered by appellants in an effort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>to support their position was either irrelevant or barred by the parol evidence rule.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since, in its view, appellants did not possess exclusive selling rights under their franchise agreements, the court concluded that Flintkote was not interfering with their business relations with Ply*Gem,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and it granted Flintkote\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1338-4\">Appellants assert that the franchise agreements, properly construed, endow them with the exclusive right to sell Ply*Gem products within their designated territories. Alternatively, they contend that the contractual language was at least ambiguous, that the evidence they unsuccessfully sought to introduce was admissible to clarify its meaning, and consequently that the case was not in a posture permitting summary judgment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree with appellants on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-12\">II. THE CHOICE OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"AN4\">This litigation is maintainable in the federal courts because the parties are of diverse citizenship.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> With federal jurisdiction so based, we normally would first determine the applicable local law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> All of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>the franchise agreements, however, expressly state that they are to be interpreted conformably to the law of New York.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Whether such a provision is operative in a federal court action founded on diversity depends upon the conflict of laws principles of the jurisdiction in which the court sits.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1339-5\">At no time during the course of this litigation have the parties briefed the choice of law question.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Nor have they, either in the District Court or here, relied upon the law of New York or of any other jurisdiction in particular as the sole source of controlling precedent. The District Court apparently assumed that District of Columbia law governed the issues presented,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and with that the litigants seem perfectly content. Our initial concern is whether we ourselves should take a different tack.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-14\">We were confronted with this problem once before. The occasion was presented in 1961 when an appellant who at the trial level relied on District of Columbia caselaw complained on appeal that Ohio law should have been applied. After an extensive review of the authorities, we disagreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7N\">[Ojrderly administration of justice suggests that plaintiff should not at this late stage be allowed to rely on the law of another jurisdiction. While this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>recognizes its power to take judicial notice of applicable state law, or to remand for its application, nothing in this record suggests that it is appropriate to do so in order to avoid injustice or to promote the ends of justice. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court was not bound to notice and apply the law of Ohio or Maryland statutory law when appellant not only failed to rely on either but affirmatively argued the law of the District.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au1z\">Four years later, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals endorsed this approach.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\">These decisions, pronounced when both courts shaped the evolving common law of the District of Columbia,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> chart the course we must pursue here. The rule they established, whether viewed as purely procedural in nature<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> or as the expression of a conflict of laws policy of the District,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> dictates recourse to District law. We believe, moreover, that sound judicial administration and the potential unfairness of invoking a body of foreign law that neither side has considered applicable strongly support that approach here.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We turn, then, to identify the principles relevant to the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-13\">III. THE PAROL EVIDENCE RULE AND THE \u201cPLAIN MEANING\u201d RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-14\">The District of Columbia recognizes both the parol evidence rule<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and its relative, the \u201cplain meaning\u201d canon of contract interpretation.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The District Court felt that consideration of minutes of a 1968 management meeting of Ply*Gem featuring promotional techniques \u2014 prior to execution of any of appellants\u2019 franchise agreements \u2014 was barred by the parol evidence rule. A segment of those minutes captioned, \u201cIn Answer to Questions Posed by Potential Franchisees,\u201d reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>Q. 26. WHY DO I NEED YOU? I CAN OPEN A PANELING STORE AND BUY THROUGH OTHER PANEL DISTRIBUTORS WITHOUT GIVING YOU $10,000. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1341-4\">In addition, you receive the exclusive rights within your area to the Ply*Gem name and their products. . . ,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\">Insofar as these minutes may have been offered to show an antecedent compact or understanding varying or supplementing the terms of the franchise agreements, the District Court correctly rejected them. The franchise contracts state unequivocally that they embody the final and exclusive understanding of the parties,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and District law gives full effect to that stipulation.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1341-6\">On the other hand, the minutes conceivably could evidence custom and practice in the paneling industry, and that, in turn, arguably could indicate in some degree the parties\u2019 intentions when they entered into the contracts in question.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Strictly speaking, the parol evidence rule does not bar extra-contractual evidence of meanings assigned the terms of an agreement;<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> that is the function of the plain meaning rule, which prohibits consideration of extrinsic evidence of intent when the contract is unequivocal.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1341-12\">Speaking to the role of ambiguity in this connection, we have summarized the District of Columbia law in this manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A61Q\">Construction of unambiguous features of a written contract is a problem for the court, not the jury. Put another way, the legal effect of reasonably clear terms of a contract is a question of law for judges. The admissibility of extrinsic evidence, and possible need for the jury to assess it, depend upon the existence of an ambiguity in the contract. Only if its meaning is dubious, and the evidence of the parties\u2019 intention is uncertain or conflicting, is there appropriate occasion to seek the conclusion of jurors as to what was in mind. Moreover, the question whether the contract is ambiguous or not is one of law to be determined by the court.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae7\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the franchise agreements in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-13\">IV. THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-14\">In the federal courts, a party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of establishing the absence of any issue of material fact.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> This principle obtains although the movant would not have the burden of proof at trial.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>party opposing summary judgment need not present any evidentiary matter unless the movant has made a prima facie showing that the case is completely free from any significant question of fact.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The movant thus faces a formidable task,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> but we think it was accomplished here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-4\">We must, at the outset, agree with Flintkote that if Ply*Gem\u2019s promise not to approve a \u201clicensed location\u201d within two and a half miles of a franchise\u2019s store was intended as a grant of exclusive selling rights within that area, it was most awkwardly put.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We are skeptical, too, that so important a feature of the franchise agreement would be so infelizcitously phrased by those as astute as businessmen generally are.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Our role on this appeal, however, is not to construe the franchise contract but to determine whether it so lucidly fails to confer an exclusive right to sell as to foreclose consideration of evidence beyond its four corners.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1342-11\">By the law of the District of Columbia, a contract is ambiguous when it is \u201creasonably susceptible of different constructions or interpretations.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Indeed, essentially that standard for determining ambiguity appears to be in fairly general use by American courts.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The question at this point, then, is whether the franchise agreements in suit can reasonably be given more than one meaning with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>exclusivity or non-exclusivity of the franchisee\u2019s right to sell Ply* Gem products within his territory. We conclude that it cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">The franchise contracts confer upon the franchisee \u201cthe right to open and operate one retail store for the sale and distribution of building materials and allied products under the trade and service names and marks, including PLY*GEM PANELING CENTERS, owned by\u201d Ply*Gem.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> To this grant the contracts specifically tie the right to use the Ply* Gem name and marks,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> as well as entitlement to designated franchisor-supplied services.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The franchisees\u2019 retail stores are thus portrayed as specially endowed and supported outlets of the Ply* Gem line of products.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1343-11\">Appellants point, however, to the one and only passage in the franchise agreements connoting any sort of exclusivity. That is a provision stating that \u201c[o]nce a particular site or location\u201d for a franchised store \u201chas been approved, [Ply*Gem] shall not approve another licensed location within a radius of two and one-half (2V2) miles of such location, without the consent of the\u201d franchisee.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number><footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The argument is that the prohibition on \u201canother license location\u201d bars any and all sales of Ply* Gem products within the designated area by anyone other than the franchisee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-4\">Whatever appeal this claim may superficially engender evaporates when the expression \u201canother licensed location\u201d is viewed in its contractual context. Within a single paragraph,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> the franchise agreements do three things. First, they \u201clicense\u201d the operation of a retail store,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> and thrice denominate the franchise a \u201clicense.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Second, they erect a procedure by which the \u201clocation\u201d of a franchised retail store is to be fixed, and make plain that the \u201clocation\u201d spoken of is the physical situs of the store.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Third, the franchise contracts then impose the ban on \u201canother license location\u201d within the radius specified,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> and we see nothing to which the interdiction could plausibly refer save an additional franchise retail outlet for the Ply* Gem line. Put slightly differently, the contractual language makes it well nigh obvious that what is forbidden is some other (\u201canother\u201d) franchised (\u201clicensed\u201d) site (\u201clocation\u201d) for a retail store \u2014 the only thing the Ply* Gem companies franchise\u2014 within the proscribed area.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> As the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-5\">It is clear to this Court that the only exclusive right granted in the franchise agreement is the right of the franchisee to operate an exclusive Ply*Gem outlet within a two and one-half mile radius. There is <em>no </em>provision which even arguably gives the operator the right to be the exclusive seller of Ply*Gem products, either to contractors or to retail customers in general, in that territory. Nothing in the contract would preclude Ply*Gem or its distributor from selling Ply*Gem products to other retailers in the territory, as long as those retailers did not operate Ply*Gem outlets. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-13\">The conclusion set forth above extinguishes [appellants\u2019] claim: If [appellants] had no exclusive selling rights under the contracts], then there were no such rights with which Flintkote could have interfered.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1344-15\">This interpretation hardly does violence to the franchise contracts taken as a whole. For a consideration of $10,000<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> and a promise to remit royalty payments of five percent of weekly gross receipts,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> the franchisee acquired the right to operate a Ply*Gem paneling center, complete with trademarks and trade names, a guaranteed source of supply, and various forms of business support by the franchisor. Customers would be attracted to the paneling center rather than to other nearby stores that might also carry Ply* Gem products by the completeness of the center\u2019s inventory, assistance by trained sales personnel and the lure of the franchisor\u2019s advertising for the benefit of the franchisees. With these advantages inuring to the licensed Ply*Gem outlets, the franchise agreements, though lacking a provision conferring exclusive selling rights, could not seriously be viewed as empty business transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-16\">We are mindful that our present call is not to construe the franchise agreements, but simply to determine whether the written language is amenable to more than one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>reading. We realize, too, that the language might conceivably be strained to connote the grant of an exclusive agency to sell within the franchisee\u2019s territory. Neither of these considerations, however, alters our conclusion. We adhere to the accepted test for ambiguity<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> and, looking solely at the pertinent contractual language<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> and undertaking only to determine whether it is \u201creasonably susceptible of different constructions or interpretations,\u201d <footnotemark>59</footnotemark> hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-5\">Since the franchise agreements do not so much as ambiguously portend an exclusive right to sell Ply*Gem products, there is nothing that Flintkote\u2019s marketing operations could have treaded on. It follows that the District Court\u2019s ruling excluding extrinsic evidence and awarding summary judgment to Flintkote was eminently correct, and that judgment is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1337-10\">.

We do not mean to imply that application of District of Columbia law is mandated by <em>Erie R. R. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). In the first place, Congress, when enacting the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970, Pub.L.No.91-358, 84 Stat. 473 (1970), did not amend the Rules of Decision Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1652 (1976), to include the District of Columbia within its ambit. Had Congress wished the Rules of Decision Act to govern in situations such as the one before us, it could easily have revised the act after the fashion of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d) (1976), which denominates the District of Columbia a \u201cstate\u201d for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. See <em>Palmore v. United States, </em>411 U.S. 389, 395, 93 S.Ct. 1670, 1675, 36 L.Ed.2d 342, 350 (1973) (\u201c[w]e are entitled to assume that in amending \u00a7 1257 [of Title 28], Congress legislated with care, and that had Congress intended to equate the District code and state statutes for the purposes of \u00a7 1257, it would have said so expressly, and not left the matter to mere implication\u201d). Secondly, the constitutional considerations discussed in <em>Erie R. R. </em>v. <em>Tompkins, supra, </em>304 U.S. at 78, 58 S. Ct. at 822, 82 L.Ed. at 1194 (\u201cCongress has no power to declare substantive rules of common law applicable in a State whether they be local in their nature or \u2018general\u2019 . . .\u201d) have no force in this context, for the District, unlike the states, has no reserved power to be guaranteed by the Tenth Amendment. <em>Cf. Hepburn v.

See <em>Semler v. Psychiatric Inst., </em>188 U.S.App.D.C. 41, 45-50, 575 F.2d 922, 926-931 (1978); <em>cf. Blair v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>153 U.S.App.D.C. 281, 472 F.2d 1356 (1972). That seems proper because the Court Reform Act made the District of Columbia Court of Appeals the \u201chighest court\u201d of the District, and thus the principal arbiter of District law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1338-19\">The highest court of the District of Columbia is the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.

Indeed, were we not to yield a measure of deference to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, two courts \u2014 neither of which could review the other\u2019s decisions \u2014 would engage independently in the process of formulating the local law of the District.

D.C.Code \u00a7 28.1-105(1) (1973) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1339-12\">Except as provided hereafter in this section, when a transaction bears a reasonable relation to the District and also to a state or nation the parties may agree that the law either of the District or of such state or nation shall govern their rights and duties. Failing such agreement this subtitle applies to transactions bearing on appropriate relation to the District.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1339-15\">There appears to have been no occasion for consideration of the efficacy of a choice of law contractual provision in District of Columbia decisionmaking, which incorporates an interest-analysis approach in cases bereft of such a specification. See, e. <em>g., Fox-Greenwald Sheet Metal Co. v. Markowitz Bros., Inc., </em>147 U.S.App.D.C. 14, 21-22, 452 F.2d 1346, 1353-1354 (1971); <em>Fowler v. A. &amp; A. Co., </em>262 A.2d 344, 348 (D.C.App.1970); <em>McCrossin v. Hicks Chevrolet, Inc., </em>248 A.2d 917, 921 (D.C.App.1969); Milhollin, <em>The New Choice of Law in the District of Columbia, </em>24 Cath.U.L.Rev. 448 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-16\">Determination of the applicability of \u00a7 28:1-105(1) here would involve a decision on whether the Uniform Commercial Code extends to franchise contracts. In general, Article 2 of the Code applies to \u201ctransactions in goods,\u201d not merely sales. D.C.Code, \u00a7 28:2-102 (1973). With scant discussion of this initial problem, some courts have applied the Code to franchise agreements. <em>E. g., Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Donahue, </em>W.Va., 223 S.E.2d 433 (1976), <em>noted, </em>55 Tex.L.Rev. 541 (1977). Others have ignored the Code in franchise cases. <em>E. g., Bak-A-Lum Corp. of America v. Alcoa Bldg.

The restrictive view of the summary judgment device summarized in text has been criticized as contrary to the salutary function of the procedure: to determine early on if a party has enough evidence to justify the time and expense of a trial. See Currie, <em>Thoughts on Directed Verdicts and Summary Judgments, </em>45 U.Chi.L.Rev. 72, 76-79 (1977); <em>cf. </em>Louis, <em>Federal Summary Judgment Doctrine: A Critical Analysis, </em>83 Yale L.J. 745, 752-753 (1974). If, in response to a motion for summary judgment, the argument runs, the party having the burden of proof on an issue is unable to muster sufficient evidence to withstand a motion for a directed verdict, then summary judgment should be entered against him even though the movant has not made a strong showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-8\">We need not enter the debate, however, for whatever merit this critique may have, we are constrained by controlling precedent.
