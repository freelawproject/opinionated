(hereinafter Merrill Lynch). Merrill Lynch initiated the action to recover an alleged deficiency of $119,145.00 in appellant\u2019s commodities margin trading account.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">For reversal appellant argues that the district court erred in (1) making certain findings of fact and conclusions of law, (2) not finding that false financial statements were submitted by broker Palmen and thus constituted a violation of the antifraud provisions of the Commodities Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6b, and (3) dismissing Count III of appellant\u2019s second amended counterclaim. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">In early May of 1976, appellant opened a commodities margin trading account with Merrill Lynch. Appellant\u2019s account executive was a broker named Stephen Palmen. Appellant eventually purchased five futures contracts through Merrill Lynch. These contracts were agreements to purchase one million pesos on a given maturity date at a given price. Unfortunately for appellant, on August 31, 1976, the Mexican government announced that it would no longer support the peso at the fixed rate of eight cents per peso and instead would permit the peso to \u201cfloat.\u201d As a result, the peso decreased markedly in value. Appellant sustained an approximate loss of 44% of his entire investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">Of more immediate concern, however, was the fact that the International Monetary Market substantially increased its margin requirements in light of the peso devaluation. On September 2, 1976, Merrill Lynch notified appellant of the increased margin requirements and requested appellant to deposit $125,000 in satisfaction thereof. Appellant did not do so. On September 8, 1976, Merrill Lynch sold appellant\u2019s five peso futures contracts at a loss of over $119,000 to appellant\u2019s account. This sale was pursuant to the broker-client Com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>modify Account Agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The deficiency in appellant\u2019s account is the subject of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Appellant filed a counterclaim in four counts, which appellant characterized<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as alleging common law fraud (I), statutory fraud in violation of the Commodities Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et <em>seq. </em>(II), breach of Merrill Lynch\u2019s \u201cduty to know your customer\u201d and to supervise the account (III), and conflict of interest (IV). Although Counts II, III and IV were dismissed,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the district court did permit appellant to introduce evidence relevant to these counts. After a trial, the district court entered its judgment in favor of Merrill Lynch for $119,145.00 plus interest. The district court specifically found that Merrill Lynch had committed no fraud, no misrepresentation and no violation of the Commodities Exchange Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Appellant first argues that the district court erred in making certain findings of fact and conclusions of law. Appellant specifically challenges the findings that (1) appellant was a \u201cknowledgeable investor,\u201d (2) Merrill Lynch extended the margin trading limits of appellant\u2019s account to $50,000, (3) appellant prepared the New Account Information form and supplied erroneous financial information to broker Palmen and Merrill Lynch, (4) Palmen made no representations to appellant concerning the safety and stability of the peso as an investment, and (5) Merrill Lynch committed no violation of the <em>Securities </em>Exchange Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">These allegations of error as well as the record indicate that the present case involved many disputed issues of fact. Because this case was tried by the district court, sitting without a jury, our review is somewhat limited. <em>Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. </em>52(a). The findings of the trial court will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous and unsupported by substantial evidence or, if supported by substantial evidence, we are satisfied that a mistake has been made. <em>E. g., Birdwell v. Hazelwood School Dist., </em>491 F.2d 490, 494 (8th Cir. 1974). In particular we note that \u201cit is not the function of an appellate court to try the case <em>de novo, </em>or to pass upon the credibility of witnesses or the weight to be given their testimony . . .\u201d <em>Shull v. Dain, Kalman &amp; Quail, Inc., </em>561 F.2d 152, 155 (8th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1086, 98 S.Ct. 1281, 55 L.Ed.2d 792 (1978). This is especially true where the case is primarily based upon oral testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>and where the trial judge has had an opportunity to view the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses. <em>E. g., Snodgrass v. Nelson, </em>503 F.2d 94, 96 (8th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">After a careful review of the evidence, we are unable to agree with appellant. We cannot say that three of the challenged findings of the trial court are clearly erroneous: (1) that appellant was a \u201cknowledgeable investor,\u201d (2) that appellant prepared the New Account Information form and supplied erroneous financial information to broker Palmen and Merrill Lynch, and (3) that Palmen made no representations to appellant about the safety of the peso as an investment. There was evidence that appellant was aware of the circumstances that made the peso more profitable and more speculative an investment and that appellant had already invested a substantial amount in certificates of deposit in Mexican banks. There was also evidence that appellant completed the New Account Information form as part of the forms every new commodities customer is required to complete and that this information was used by the clerical staff of Merrill Lynch in typing the form itself. We also note, without any evaluation of its accuracy, that a credit service report prepared at the request of Merrill Lynch contained information roughly similar to that reported on the form. This finding and the finding about the lack of representations made to appellant are particularly dependent upon the district court\u2019s evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses. The parties presented directly contradictory evidence on each of these factual issues. With this observation in mind, we note that the evidence showed appellant approached Palmen with an interest in peso futures (developed from reading unsolicited investment newsletters), appellant discussed the peso with Palmen, Pal-men then telephoned Merrill Lynch\u2019s foreign currency specialists in Chicago, the specialists noted the peso market was erratic and speculative and expressed \u201cno opinion,\u201d and the next day appellant placed his first order to purchase peso futures contracts. Of the two findings that are erroneous, the limit of appellant\u2019s margin and the reference to the <em>Securities </em>Exchange Act instead of the <em>Commodities </em>Exchange Act, neither error in our opinion prejudiced appellant\u2019s case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Secondly, appellant argues the district court erred in not finding that Palmen submitted the false financial statements to his superiors at Merrill Lynch in violation of the antifraud provisions of the Commodities Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6b. The informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>tion on the form indicated appellant had $500,000 in stocks and commodities, his annual income was approximately $50,000, his estimated net worth was $2 million, and his available risk capital for commodities trading was $100,000. Appellant\u2019s actual financial position was considerably below these figures. Appellant argues that Palmen was responsible for supplying the false information and that Palmen, and ultimately Merrill Lynch, was in fact engaged in a scheme to attempt to defraud appellant. Appellant contends the false financial information was just one part of this fraudulent scheme intended to involve appellant in an ambitious investing program for which he was unqualified. The district court expressly found that appellant himself supplied this false information. As was true of the other challenged conclusions of the district court, this finding was based to a large extent upon the district court\u2019s evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses, to which we defer. We are unable to say the finding of the district court was clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">Finally, appellant argues that the district court erred in dismissing Count III of appellant\u2019s counterclaim which alleged Merrill Lynch failed to supervise appellant\u2019s account and Palmen\u2019s handling of the account, failed to \u201cknow your customer\u201d and failed to review appellant\u2019s suitability and qualifications as a commodities investor. Appellant argues Merrill Lynch in so doing violated its house rules,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> stock exchange rules,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> dealer association rules,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and good brokerage practice. Appellant argues these violations give rise to a private cause of action. Under the facts of the present case, we must disagree with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>We note initially that none of the cases cited by appellant have recognized a private cause of action for alleged violations of a broker\u2019s house rules. The question whether a violation of a private stock exchange or trade association rule, required to be promulgated by federal law, such as a rule of the New York Stock Exchange or the National Association of Security Dealers, gives rise to a private cause of action in favor of a customer damaged as a result of the violation is a \u201ctroublesome one.\u201d <em>Shull v. Dain, Kalman &amp; Quail, Inc., supra, </em>561 F.2d at 160. Most of the cases have answered the question affirmatively <em>but </em>with some reservations. <em>See Avern Trust v. Clarke, </em>415 F.2d 1238, 1242 (7th Cir. 1969); <em>Buttrey v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>410 F.2d 135, 142 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 838, 90 S.Ct. 98, 24 L.Ed.2d 88 (1969); <em>Evans v. Kerbs &amp; Co., </em>411 F.Supp. 616, 624 (S.D.N.Y.1976); <em>cf. Colonial Realty Corp. v. Bache &amp; Co., </em>358 F.2d 178, 181-83 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 817, 87 S.Ct. 40, 17 L.Ed.2d 56 (1966) (sets forth test under which to evaluate whether to imply private cause of action from federal regulatory statutes); <em>see generally </em>Lowenfels, <em>Implied Liabilities Based Upon Stock Exchange Rules, </em>66 <em>Colum.L.Rev. </em>12 (1966); Note, <em>Private Rights of Action for Commodity Futures Investors, </em>55 <em>B.U.L.Rev. </em>804 (1974). In particular, the courts have typically found no private right of action exists for violation of exchange or dealer association rules in the absence of a finding of fraud. See, e. <em>g., Shull v. Dain, Kalman &amp; Quail, Inc., supra, </em>561 F.2d at 160; <em>Lincoln Commodity Services v. Meade, </em>558 F.2d 469, 474 n.l (8th Cir. 1977); <em>Carras v. Burns, supra, </em>516 F.2d at 260; <em>Evans v. Kerbs &amp; Co., supra, </em>411 F.Supp. at 624; <em>Architectural League v. Bartos, supra, </em>404 F.Supp. at 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">In the present case the district court should not have dismissed Count III because appellant did state a private cause of action by alleging violations of exchange and dealer association rules accompanied by allegations of fraud. <em>See Evans v. Kerbs &amp; Co., supra, </em>411 F.Supp. at 624 (cases cited therein). As noted above, however, the district court permissibly found that appellant failed to prove fraud on the part of Merrill Lynch. Even if Merrill Lynch had been found to have violated the exchange and/or dealer association rules, such a violation, in the absence of facts establishing fraud, would not constitute an independent basis for liability. <em>See, e. g., Lincoln Commodity Services v. Meade, supra, </em>558 F.2d at 474 n.1. Therefore, we conclude in this case that the district court committed no reversible error in dismissing Count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-17\">. The Honorable James H. Meredith, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AcM\">. The basis of jurisdiction was diversity of citizenship. Merrill Lynch is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in New York; appellant is a resident of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\">. The Commodity Account Agreement (Exhibit # 2) is one of several forms filled out by persons opening commodities margin trading accounts. Basically, the agreement authorizes Merrill Lynch to sell any or all of the commodities or contracts in an account whenever in its discretion it considers it necessary and to hold the investor liable for any deficiency remaining in the account in the event of liquidation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\">. Appellant\u2019s characterization of Count II is disputed by Merrill Lynch. Merrill Lynch argues that Count II did not, as alleged by appellant, allege that Palmen intentionally submitted a false financial statement on appellant in violation of the Commodities Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6b. Count I alleged that Merrill Lynch, through Stephen Palmen, defrauded appellant by misrepresenting the soundness of the peso as an investment in violation of the Commodities Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6b, 6o. Count II adopted all of Count I and further alleged that Merrill Lynch, through Stephen Palmen, defrauded appellant by \u201cwrongfully\u201d attempting to enlist appellant in the Guided Investment Program in violation of exchange rules, Merrill Lynch\u2019s house rules and good brokerage practice. Count III adopted all of Counts I and II and further alleged that Merrill Lynch breached its duty to adequately review and supervise appellant\u2019s account. Appellant specifically asserted that Palmen was the source of the false and inaccurate financial and personal information on the New Account Information form (Exhibit #1). Count IV adopted all of Counts I, II and III and further alleged that Merrill Lynch had inside information about the devaluation of the peso which it selectively disclosed in reckless disregard of appellant\u2019s financial welfare. Appellant was unable to establish either that Merrill Lynch knew in advance of the devaluation or had disclosed such information to selected customers. \u201cFor all practical purposes, Count IV is not involved in this appeal.\u201d Brief of Appellant at 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b191-13\">. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v. Goldman, </em>No. 76-852C(1) (E.D.Mo., Dec. 29, 1977) (order granting plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss Counts II, III and IV of defendant\u2019s second amended counterclaim).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b192-5\">. Appellant accurately challenged the validity of the district court\u2019s finding that Merrill Lynch raised the margin trading limit of appellant\u2019s account to $50,000. The record indicates that Merrill Lynch at no time raised appellant\u2019s trading limit. Merrill Lynch concedes this in its brief. Brief of Appellee at 34. We do not find this error was prejudicial. Count II of appellant\u2019s counterclaim alleged a failure on the part of Merrill Lynch to \u201cknow your customer\u201d and thus a failure to place appropriate limits on appellant\u2019s account. It does appear from the evidence that at one point appellant\u2019s account exceeded its margin trading limit by about $7,000. Even assuming, however, that appellant sought to allege a violation of the margin maintenance rules, such a failure in the absence of fraud would not constitute a basis for the imposition of liability upon the broker. <em>Cf. Carras v. Burns, </em>516 F.2d 251 (4th Cir. 1975) (Securities Exchange Act). In <em>Carras v. Burns </em>the executors of an estate sued a stock-brokerage firm and two of its employees for losses sustained by the estate\u2019s margined securities account, allegedly as a result of the firm\u2019s failure to make timely margin calls to maintain the estate\u2019s equity. Such a failure violated the stock exchange rules. The court, however, declined to recognize a private cause of action for the breach of the rules alone and in the absence of fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 260. The court noted the margin rules had been promulgated primarily to protect the solvency of <em>brokers </em>by requiring adequate collateral to finance margin trading by their customers. <em>Id. </em>Further, the court observed that violation of the margin rules would perhaps subject the broker to discipline by the exchange but not to liability for loss unless the breach of rules also violated the securities act by operating as a fraud. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">The other error was the district court\u2019s reference to the <em>Securities </em>Exchange Act in its second conclusion of law. In our opinion this reference can be characterized as a clerical error and does not indicate the district court misunderstood the nature of appellant\u2019s defenses or counterclaims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b193-4\">. Further, in our opinion, appellant\u2019s statutory fraud issue was raised in Count I of the amended counterclaim even though, as appellant argues in his reply brief, it was more explicitly set forth in Count II. In any event, the allegation of statutory fraud was given adequate consideration by the district court and ultimately rejected. The district court memorandum reveals that Count II was dismissed as repetitive of Counts I and III and not for the reason that the district court failed to recognize a private cause of action for violations of the Commodities Exchange Act. Such actions are well recognized. <em>See Hirk v. Agri-Research Council, Inc., </em>561 F.2d 96, 103 n.8 (7th Cir. 1977); <em>Deaktor </em>v. L. <em>D.
