Benson, </em>409 U.S. 63, 93 S.Ct. 253, 34 L.Ed.2d 273, 175 USPQ 673 (1972), \u201cindicated that a program that has no substantial practical application except in connection with a digital computer is not patentable under 35 USC 101\u201d; and that the Court, by quoting from the Report of the President\u2019s Commission on the Patent System in which policy matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>were raised against the patenting of computer programs, \u201cdeclined to decide such policy matters and refused to extend the patent statutes to embrace computer programming, absent a considered action by the Congress.\u201d On reconsideration, the board says simply that appellants\u2019 process is an \u201calgorithm\u201d (\u201ca procedure for solving a given type of mathematical problem\u201d) within the meaning given that term in <em>Benson </em>and <em>Parker v. Flook, </em>437 U.S. 584, 98 S.Ct. 2522, 57 L.Ed.2d 451, 198 USPQ 193 (1978), apparently because use of a digital computer is contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">The board recognizes that the claims involved in <em>Benson </em>were method claims, but says that it regards the strictures of <em>Benson </em>as applicable to apparatus claims, for to do otherwise would be to allow a prospective patentee to achieve indirectly what he may not achieve directly. It says it finds nothing in <em>In re Chatfield, </em>545 F.2d 152, 191 USPQ 730 (CCPA 1976), or <em>In re Noll, </em>545 F.2d 141, 191 USPQ 721 (CCPA 1976), that would remove the instant application from the principles enunciated in <em>Benson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">Although the board says that each new appeal must be decided on its own facts \u201cin view of interpretations of the patent law as handed down by the Supreme Court\u201d (citing <em>In re Christensen, </em>478 F.2d 1392, 178 USPQ 35 (CCPA 1973)), the board\u2019s opinion, nevertheless, lacks the specifics of a detailed factual analysis of the subject matter as a whole of appellants\u2019 invention (see this court\u2019s opinions in <em>In re Johnson, </em>589 F.2d 1070, 200 USPQ 199 (CCPA 1978), and <em>In re Gelnovatch, </em>595 F.2d 32 (CCPA 1979)), which is required to show wherein this court\u2019s opinions in <em>In re Chatfield, supra, In re Noll, supra, In re Deutsch, </em>553 F.2d 689, 193 USPQ 645 (CCPA 1977), <em>In re Toma, </em>575 F.2d 872, 197 USPQ 852 (CCPA 1978), and <em>In re Freeman, </em>573 F.2d 1237, 197 USPQ 464 (CCPA 1978), do not apply to the instant claims and, particularly, wherein the differences between the instant claims and those involved in <em>Benson </em>are insufficient to bring those claims within the Supreme Court\u2019s disclaimer in <em>Benson </em>(repeated in <em>Dann v. Johnston, </em>425 U.S. 219, 96 S.Ct. 1393, 47 L.Ed.2d 692, 189 USPQ 257 (1976)) that it was not holding that all computer program inventions are unpatentable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">Accordingly, it is ordered that the case be removed from the calendar and be remanded to the board for preparation of a supplemental opinion that will provide the specifies of a detailed factual analysis, as indicated above, to enable the court to properly consider the appeal; on receipt of the supplemental opinion, this appeal will be restored to the docket.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
