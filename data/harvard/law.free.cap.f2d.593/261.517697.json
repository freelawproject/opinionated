Finally, the court concludes that the Board\u2019s order is not moot, notwithstanding the intervening lapse of the collective bargaining agreement in question. Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">IT IS ORDERED that the petition for review filed herein by Cox Corporation is denied and the Board\u2019s application for enforcement of the order entered on October 13, 1976 is hereby granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
