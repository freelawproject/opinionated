Simon\u2019s 1970 application for retirement insurance benefits to include an application for child\u2019s insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">The facts are not in dispute. In August 1970, Mrs. Simon applied for retirement insurance benefits under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402 (Act). At that time, Mrs. Simon\u2019s two children were eligible for child\u2019s insurance benefits under section 202 of the Act. A trainee claims representative of the Social Security Administration filled out the application for Mrs. Simon. Without asking Mrs. Simon if she had children, the trainee wrote \u201cNone\u201d in answer to the question: \u201cHow many children do you have who may be eligible for benefits?\u201d When the form was completed, Mrs. Simon was asked to sign her name beneath the words: \u201cI certify that the above statements are true.\u201d Mrs. Simon signed the application without reading it.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">Mrs. Simon\u2019s application was approved, and she received benefits for herself from August 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-15\">Two years later, Mrs. Simon learned of the trainee\u2019s error and of her children\u2019s eligibility for benefits during those years. Mrs. Simon asked HEW to reconsider her application and award benefits to her children retroactive to August 1970. HEW refused. She filed an administrative appeal, and an administrative law judge held that the children were entitled to benefits beginning in August 1970. The Appeals Council reversed on the ground that Mrs. Simon had not applied for benefits for her children in 1970 and therefore did not comply with a substantive condition of entitlement. The Appeals Council held that the trainee\u2019s error in completing the form was insufficient to estop the government from requiring compliance with the terms of the Act. This became the final decision of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-16\">Mrs. Simon timely filed this action in the district court under section 205(g) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), to review the final decision of the Secretary. On summary judgment, the district court held that the doctrine of equitable estoppel applied and that HEW could not avail itself of Mrs. Simon\u2019s failure to apply for child\u2019s benefits in August 1970, but that her application at that time must be deemed as an application for child\u2019s insurance benefits on the part of her two children.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-17\">The issue of this appeal is whether the trainee\u2019s error was sufficient to estop HEW from enforcing the terms of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-18\">In <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>572 F.2d 697 (9th Cir. 1978), we decided that filing an application is a substantive condition to receiving benefits under section 202 of the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here no application was made for Mrs. Simon\u2019s children until 1972. The Secretary therefore contends that, regardless of the trainee\u2019s error, the Act precludes HEW from lawfully awarding benefits retroactive to August 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Mrs. Simon, on the other hand, argues that the court should not permit HEW to require strict compliance with section 202 when it was the trainee\u2019s fault that no application for the children was filed in 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Our cases<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> have formulated a four-part test in determining when and whether equitable estoppel may be applied against the government. We need not decide in this case whether that test was satisfied because the doctrine of equitable estoppel may still not be invoked against the government in its sovereign capacity<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> unless that conduct can properly be called \u201caffirmative misconduct.\u201d Mere neglect of duty is not enough. <em>INS v. Hibi, </em>414 U.S. 5, 94 S.Ct. 19, 38 L.Ed.2d 7 (1973); <em>Shon Ning Lee v. INS, </em>576 F.2d 1380 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>Santiago v. INS, </em>526 F.2d 488 (9th Cir., <em>en banc, </em>1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Here, the trainee was guilty of negligence, but that negligence does not amount to affirmative misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The district court therefore erred in invoking the doctrine of estoppel against HEW.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">There is a further reason for our decision. In <em>United States v. Lazy FC Ranch, </em>481 F.2d 985 (9th Cir. 1973), we said that it is now well established that \u201cestoppel is available as a defense against the government if the government\u2019s wrongful conduct threatens to work a serious injustice and if the public\u2019s interest would not be unduly damaged by the imposition of estoppel.\u201d At 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Mrs. Simon filed a second application in July 1972 and was awarded child\u2019s insurance benefits retroactive to July 1971. The trainee\u2019s error deprived her of benefits to her children only between August 1970 and June 1971. We recognize that Mrs. Simon has suffered a loss, but we do not believe that her loss is of such magnitude and is so serious that HEW should be estopped from enforcing the express terms of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-17\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-14\">. \u201cEvery child [as defined in section 416(e)] of an individual entitled to old-age or disability insurance benefits, ... if such child\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AWG\">(A) has filed application for child\u2019s insurance benefits . shall be entitled to such benefits.
