De Witt appeals from the summary judgment entered by the district court in favor of the United States. The question this case presents is whether the plaintiff\u2019s malpractice claim against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act is so conclusively time-barred by \u00a7 2401 of the Act that a summary judgment was proper. We hold that it was not. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-26\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b337-27\">Mrs. De Witt, plaintiff-appellant, a veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States, has suffered from rheumatoid arthritis dating back to 1960. During the years 1971 and 1972, she underwent five operations at the Veterans Administration (VA) Hospital in Hines, Illinois, for treatment of her arthritis. The dates and descriptions of these operations are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>September 24,1971 Synovectomy and stabilization of the right wrist</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-4\">November 12, 1971 Synovectomy and stabilization of the left wrist</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">December 20,1971 Placement arthroplasty of the metacarpophalangeal joints with Swanson Metacarpophalangeal prosthesis of the second to fifth joints of the right hand</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">April 19, 1972 Placement arthroplasty of the metacarpophalangeal joints with Swanson prosthesis of the second to fifth joints of the left hand</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">September 6,1972 Removal of the Swanson prosthesis from the middle finger of the left hand</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">She was under continuous care at the Hines hospital, as either an admitted patient or an outpatient, from September 1971 until November 28, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">On August 19,1975, she filed an administrative claim for damages with the VA under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671 <em>et seq. </em>She alleged that she had received negligent treatment for her hands at the Hines hospital. The VA denied the claim on March 29, 1976, on the ground that it was time-barred because it had accrued more than two years before the date she filed her administrative claim. On April 29,1976, De Witt reasserted the same claim by filing this action against the United States. The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment on December 15, 1977, on the ground that De Witt\u2019s cause of action was time-barred, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-12\">A tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within two years after such claim accrues or unless action is begun within six months after the date of mailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice of final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">We have been unable to find any case in the Seventh Circuit dealing with when a claim accrues under Section 2401(b) for negligent medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-15\">The cause of action in a medical malpractice suit brought against the Government accrues when \u201cthe claimant [has] discovered, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the acts constituting ' the alleged malpractice\u201d. <em>Quinton v. United States, </em>5 Cir. 1962, 304 F.2d 234, 240 (Tuttle, J.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Judge Tuttle derived this rule from the \u201cblameless ignorance\u201d approach earlier applied by the Supreme Court to the statute of limitations on claims brought under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51 <em>et seq. See Urie </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>1949, 337 U.S. 163, 170, 69 S.Ct. 1018, 1025, 93 L.Ed. 1282.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-16\">The <em>Quinton </em>rule has been accepted by many courts. <em>See Kubrick v. United States, </em>1977 E.D.Pa., 435 F.Supp. 166, 180 (citing eases), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>3 Cir. 1978, 581 F.2d 1092. It is, however, susceptible to varying interpretations. <em>Kubrick, </em>a malpractice suit against the Government arising out of treatment at a VA hospital, provides a good example of how the rule can be literally interpreted to thwart the policy supporting it. In that case, the Government read \u201cthe rule to mean that the statute begins to run, without more, when the plaintiff becomes aware that he has been injured as the result of a physician\u2019s treatment\u201d. 435 F.Supp. at 180-81. The district court disagreed. It held that the limitations period does not begin to run if the patient has exercised reasonable diligence in investigating the cause of his injury and found no negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-17\">A related case is <em>Portis v. United States, </em>4 Cir. 1973, 483 F.2d 670, in which the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the statute does not begin to run if the patient, though aware that a negligent act had been performed, was unaware that the act had injured him. Similarly, in <em>Jordan v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>United States, </em>6 Cir. 1974, 503 F.2d 620, a plaintiff suffered injury to one of his eyes while undergoing surgery for his nose. He knew that his eye injury was attributable to the surgery, but was not aware that the procedure constituted malpractice. He brought suit against the Government three years after the operation. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that the limitation period did not begin to run until the plaintiff learned of the malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">A literal reading of the <em>Quinton </em>rule would have barred the approaches taken in <em>Kubrick, Portis, </em>and <em>Jordan. </em>These decisions properly recognized that the <em>Quinton </em>rule must be flexibly construed to promote the sound policy that \u201cblameless ignorance\u201d should not result in the loss of the right to assert a malpractice claim. Indeed, the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and the Tenth Circuit have now extended the \u201cblameless ignorance\u201d approach to its logical conclusion. In <em>Bridgford v. United States, </em>4 Cir. 1977, 550 F.2d 978, the Fourth Circuit held that \u201cuntil a claimant has had a reasonable opportunity to discover <em>all </em>of the essential elements of a possible cause of. action \u2014 duty, breach, causation, damages\u2014 his claim against the Government does not accrue\u201d. 550 F.2d at 981-82 (emphasis in original). The Tenth Circuit has recently adopted the <em>Bridgford </em>standard. <em>Exnicious v. United States, </em>10 Cir. 1977, 563 F.2d 418, 420.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">We agree with the Third, Fourth, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits that \u00a7 2401(b) should not bar suit before a potential medical malpractice claimant has a reasonable basis for believing that he has a claim against the Government. Therefore, we adopt the <em>Bridgford </em>standard as the law of this Circuit. Restating the rule to encompass both a subjective and an objective test, we hold that the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the claimant has discovered, or has had a reasonable opportunity to discover, all the essential elements of a possible cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Summary judgment is appropriate only when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\u201d. F.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The date when a cause of action accrues is, of course, a question of fact. <em>E. g., Ciccarone v. United States, </em>3 Cir. 1973, 486 F.2d 253, 256. Summary judgment, then, is usually inappropriate on that question. In this case, the district court determined that there was no genuine issue of fact whether De Witt\u2019s cause of action had accrued more than two years before she filed her administrative claim. To reach this conclusion, the district court must have believed that De Witt\u2019s deposition testimony revealed, as a matter of law, that she knew or should have known that her cause of action accrued prior to August 19, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Before this Court, the Government does not argue that the record indicates that, as a matter of law, De Witt should have known of the accrual of the cause of action prior to August 19, 1973. Rather, the Government seeks to uphold the summary judgment on the theory that her deposition testimony shows that she actually knew of the accrual before that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">In reviewing the record on appeal from the granting of a motion for summary judgment, \u201cthe inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts contained in [the affidavits, depositions, and exhibits] must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion\u201d. <em>United States v. Diebold, Inc., </em>1962, 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993, 994, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (per curiam). Judged under this standard, we are unable to affirm this summary judgment. We conclude that reasonable persons could differ on whether De W\u2019tt\u2019s deposition testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>revealed that she knew that her cause of action had accrued before August 19, 1973. <em>Compare Central Oil &amp; Supply Corp. v. United States, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 557 F.2d 511, 515; <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Parwatikar, </em>8 Cir. 1978, 570 F.2d 801, 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The import of De Witt\u2019s deposition testimony, when viewed in the light most favorable to her, is not as clear as the Government suggests. In her administrative claim and her complaint in this action, she alleged that both of her hands were damaged by negligent surgery and postoperative care. We find nothing in the record that conclusively indicates that, before August 19, 1973, she knew that the cause of action had accrued for any injury to her right hand. Indeed, all of her statements relied upon by the Government to show her knowledge refer only to either the surgery upon, or postoperative treatment of her left hand. A triable issue of fact is present, then, on when the cause of action accrued for the alleged injury to her right hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">De Witt\u2019s deposition testimony does indicate that she was disappointed by the outcome of the surgery upon her left hand. The Government argues that the cause of action as to negligent surgery upon that hand accrued at least by April 1973. At that time, De Witt consulted a private physician about the condition of her left hand. According to that physician\u2019s deposition, De Witt informed him that her left hand \u201cdid not turn out as it was supposed to have\u201d and that the use of that hand had become impaired. Viewed in the light most favorable to De Witt, we cannot find that her statement was an unequivocal admission that she was aware that all of the elements of a possible cause of action for negligent surgery had occurred. A surgical procedure is not malpractice simply because it does \u201cnot turn out as it was supposed to have\u201d. To recover damages, the patient must prove that the disappointing outcome of the surgery resulted from a breach of care by medical personnel. As we read De Witt\u2019s testimony, it fails to reveal beyond doubt that she was aware that any breach of care or procedure, constituting malpractice, had occurred in the surgery upon her left hand. Summary judgment, then, was inappropriate on whether that cause of action had accrued prior to August 19, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The Government strongly asserts that De Witt\u2019s deposition testimony reveals that her cause of action for negligent postoperative treatment to her left hand had accrued before August 19, 1973. \u25a0 It appears from her testimony that the physician who conducted most of her postoperative treatment, a Dr. Larson, administered it in an abusive manner. During the postoperative treatment period, De Witt had complained that Dr. Larson wantonly disregarded whether he was damaging her left hand or causing her excessive pain when he removed the cast on that hand, removed the stitches in it, and fitted a brace on it. She characterizes these remarks as simply complaints about the doctor\u2019s \u201cbedside manner\u201d, and not evidence that she knew that her hand had been damaged as the result of negligent treatment. She also contends that the VA doctors assured her that her hand would improve if she adhered to the regimen of postoperative therapy they had prescribed. She asserts that, notwithstanding Dr. Larson\u2019s rough treatment of her left hand, she continued to follow the prescribed postoperative therapy until December 1973. A fair inference may be drawn that her adherence to the therapy indicates that she trusted her doctors and believed that they had not performed any negligent acts that could have resulted in damage in her hand. <em>Compare Toal v. United States, </em>2 Cir. 1971, 438 F.2d 222, 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">After carefully reviewing the record in the light most favorable to De Witt, we conclude that reasonable persons could disagree on whether prior to August 19, 1973 she knew that all the elements of her cause of action on negligent postoperative care to her left hand had occurred. It is for the finder of fact to determine whether her actions in following the therapy speak louder than both her words of complaint about Dr. Larson and any other portions of her deposition testimony that might tend to show that she had the sort of knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>that would preclude her recovery in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">In conclusion, we note that the district court supported its summary judgment order by making findings of fact regarding De Witt\u2019s knowledge of when her cause of action accrued. These findings of fact carry with them the inference that this case presents issues of fact not properly resolved by summary judgment. <em>Cf. A R Inc. v. Electro-Voice, Inc., </em>7 Cir. 1962, 311 F.2d 508, 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The fact question concerning the plaintiff\u2019s reasons for delay and whether she had a reasonable opportunity to discover all the elements of a possible cause of action are not so conclusively removed that summary judgment is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">It is important to note, however, that the party who claims the benefit of . an exception from the operation of a statute of limitations bears the burden of showing that he is entitled to it. <em>See Baker v. F &amp; F Investment, </em>7 Cir. 1970, 420 F.2d 1191, 1199, <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 821, 91 S.Ct. 40, 27 L.Ed.2d 49; <em>Lukenas v. Bryce\u2019s Mountain Resort, </em>4 Cir. 1976, 538 F.2d 594, 597. Thus, on remand De Witt will bear the burden of showing that her delay in asserting her claim was the result of blameless ignorance.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Reversed and Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-13\">. In <em>Cooper v. United States, </em>7 Cir. 1971, 442 F.2d 908, 911-12, this Court recognized the existence of the Quinton standard. In that case, however, the plaintiff alleged that Government officials had negligently failed to provide him with medical treatment, not that they had negligently treated him. The Court concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action accrued when he knew or should have known that no treatment was forthcoming. 442 F.2d at 912. That decision is consistent with our holding in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b339-11\">. The Third Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Kubrick </em>suggests that it also finds merit in the <em>Bridgford </em>standard. See 581 F.2d at 1096-97.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b341-9\">HARLINGTON WOOD, Jr., Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A47\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">Not sharing the views of my colleagues, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">The <em>Quinton </em>statute of limitations rule,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as the majority suggests, is susceptible to varying interpretations. Some reasonable flexibility is no doubt desirable, but when flexibility becomes an unwarranted extension, then I believe we are permitting the statute of limitations to dissolve into a statute of indefiniteness. Under the majority opinion the triggering of the statute of limitations is indefinitely suspended until claimant has discovered or had reasonable opportunity to discover, not just the alleged negligent acts, but all the essential elements of a possible cause of action \u2014 duty, breach, causation and damages. Such a rule involving legal as well as factual issues becomes, in my view, unrealistically subjective. We may expect under this rule for courts to spend as much time trying to determine when the statute of limitations began to run as with the merits of a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">As laudable as concern may be for claimants with possible meritorious claims, even though negligent in their timely prosecution, I believe that flexibility should be restrained by remembering that the statutory waiver of sovereign immunity<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is to be liberally construed, not in favor of claimants, but \u201cin favor of repose for the United States.\u201d <em>Cooper v. United States, </em>442 F.2d 908, 912 (7th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-16\">In <em>Quinton </em>the court noted that the majority rule then was that the cause of action for malpractice accrued on the date of the negligent act even though the claimant was unaware of his plight. That rule was so harsh, the court determined, as to justify modification. The rule adopted was stated to be that a claim for malpractice accrued against the Government when the claimant discovered, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered the acts constituting the alleged malpractice. I would leave that rule as it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">If there may be any merit in some further liberalization of the <em>Quinton </em>rule as accomplished by the majority, this case serves as little justification for it. My view necessitates some detailed consideration of the facts. In her deposition, claimant stated specifically that her complaint was only about the treatment of her left hand by VA doctor Larson.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-18\">Let us review in this montage of her own words taken from her tardy administrative claim and deposition the critical events. I would expect that most will agree that at least the doctor-patient relationship here revealed is fortunately rare.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>He [Dr. Larson] came into my room on the following Monday, without holding my arm or without warning, cut the hand down and let it fall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\">* <em>* * </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">A. Yes, I was scheduled to have it off on Thursday. And so then he put the tool that he cut it off over the middle finger and pushed the middle finger down and clipped the clipper underneath the cast and proceeded to cut it off. In the meantime, I was yelling with pain and asking him not to do that. And I kept telling him it is hurting and heshouldn\u2019t do that, <em>you are injuring my hand, </em>and he told me to shut up or he could take the same tool and cut my tongue out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">Q. What sort of tone of voice did he use?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">A. Sort of snide and he proceeded to cut the cast off <em>and that is when I started having problems with the middle finger.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">Q. <em>So you began suffering pain during the time he was cutting the cast off?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">Q. <em>And that is somewhere around April of 1972?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-12\">Q. And did he say anything else to you during the removal of this cast?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-13\">A. He had to try to fit the brace on my hand and it was the right hand brace that I had used on the right hand and instead of him adjusting the brace first and then trying it to my hand, he put it on my hand and held the brace and grabbed right above the prosthesis and tried to fit the brace on my hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-14\">Q. Did that cause you to suffer pain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-15\">A. Yes, it sure did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-16\">Q. Did you tell him about the pain you were suffering?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-17\">A. Yes, I did. He kept right on going.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-18\">Q. Was <em>it from that time on that you had difficulty with your middle fingers?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-19\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-20\">Q. <em>Were you suffering pain in your other fingers in your left hand from that time?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-21\">A. <em>From that time but not too much before.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-22\">(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-23\">* * * * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-24\">Larson had no foreknowledge of the Pope brace, I was to wear, and proceeded to try to fit it to my hand, squeezing the part where the implants are. When he removed the cast, my little finger and index finger had rotated on the shaft. At the stub of the ulna, I kept complaining and he wouldn\u2019t examine it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-25\">The record contains further evidence of claimant\u2019s awareness from the very beginning of the problems which form the basis of her claim, but for the purposes of this dissent, I see no need to further pursue those details. Within two years of claimant\u2019s last VA treatment, claimant also consulted her private physician about these complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-26\">I would affirm as being barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-12\">. <em>Quinton v.
