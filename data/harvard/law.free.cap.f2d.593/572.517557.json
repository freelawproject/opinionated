His complaint was dismissed upon a finding that South Carolina\u2019s \u201cdoor-closing\u201d statute, S.C. Code \u00a7 15-5-150, barred the action. Bumgarder appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">The district court properly determined that Bumgarder\u2019s case did not fall within the terms of \u00a7 15-5-150, for he is neither a resident of South Carolina, nor did his cause of action against Keene or Forty-Eight arise within the state. Although Bumgarder relies upon <em>Szantay v. Beech Aircraft Corp., </em>349 F.2d 60 (4th Cir. 1965), we do not think countervailing federal considerations required the district court to entertain his suit and to ignore the South Carolina statute. Bumgarder could have maintained his suit in North Carolina, the place where he lived, worked and was allegedly exposed to asbestos. Because there was an alternate forum to the South Carolina court where Bumgarder could gain full relief, we find <em>Szantay </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
