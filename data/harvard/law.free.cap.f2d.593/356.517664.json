Hanson, United States Senior District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b417-10\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">This is an appeal from the order of the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> affirming a bankruptcy judge\u2019s finding that a debt in the form of a state court judgment against George D. Phillips in the amount of $13,772.93 is not dischargeable under Section 17(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(a)(4)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because judgment was based on Phillips\u2019 embezzlement of funds from the appellee Union while the former was a Union officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">The bankruptcy judge dismissed the complaint against Mrs. Phillips and no issue remains with respect to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-16\">The judgment in question was a default judgment entered in the Jackson County, Missouri Circuit Court in favor of the Union. The judgment, which was admitted into evidence before the bankruptcy judge, does not state the basis of the cause of action, but does recite that upon the pleadings and evidence \u201cthe Court finds . the issues on plaintiff\u2019s petition in favor of plaintiff and against defendant . . .\u201d To determine the issues found in favor of the Union, the bankruptcy judge reviewed \u201c[t]he pleadings behind the state judgment,\u201d specifically, the Union\u2019s state court petition which, the bankruptcy judge observed, \u201cmade it abundantly clear that the tort involved was based on embezzlement of union funds . . .\u201d The bankruptcy judge had before him the state court petition filed by the Union against Phillips, though it was not formally received in evidence. Thus, the bankruptcy judge appeared to take judicial notice of the state court pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-19\">On appeal to the district court, Phillips maintained, <em>inter alia, </em>that the bankruptcy judge erroneously went outside the record to take judicial notice of the Union\u2019s state court petition in order to determine the nature of the debt created by the default judgment. The district court declined to reverse the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding of non-dischargeability on this ground. Prior to doing so, the district court, through a show cause order, afforded Phillips an opportunity to contest the propriety of taking judicial notice of the state court petition. <em>See </em>Rule 201(e), F.R.Evid. Notwithstanding this opportunity, the district court noted that Phillips \u201chas never questioned the authenticity of the photocopy of the state court petition attached to [the Union\u2019s] complaint [in bankruptcy court] of March 11, 1976 and again attached to this Court\u2019s Order to Show Cause dated April 5, 1978.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>The district court accordingly took judicial notice of the state pleading in its review. <em>See </em>Rule 201(f), F.R.Evid.; J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, 1 Weinstein\u2019s Evidence 1201[06]. Nor, we note, does Phillips raise any question as to the contents of the state petition in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">On appeal Phillips raises only the issue of whether it was permissible for the bankruptcy judge and district court to judicially notice the pleading referred to in the state judgment entry offered into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record and are of the opinion that the district court\u2019s order should be affirmed on the basis of Judge Hunter\u2019s well-reasoned analysis. No substantial issue concerning the propriety of judicial notice is raised in this Court in the absence of a dispute over the fact judicially noticed, here the contents of a state court pleading. Moreover, as Judge Hunter noted, there is other substantial evidence on which to sustain the bankruptcy judge\u2019s finding that the judgment was a non-dischargeable debt based on embezzlement, including Phillips\u2019 own testimony at the bankruptcy hearing and Phillips\u2019 guilty plea to related criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-14\">. The Honorable Elmo B. Hunter, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b417-20\">.
