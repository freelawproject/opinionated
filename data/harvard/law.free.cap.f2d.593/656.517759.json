He appealed his dismissal to the Personnel Board of Fulton County, which, after a full-blown hearing, upheld the termination. Webb then sought relief in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claiming that the circumstances surrounding his dismissal deprived him of procedural due process. The District Court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-19\">We first uphold the District Court\u2019s finding that, under the holdings of <em>Board of Regents v. </em>Roth<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3and <em>Perry v. Sindermann,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 24A-603<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Section 18 of the Fulton County Civil Service Act<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> gave appellant at least a minimal property interest in his employment with the Fulton County Juvenile Court. The Georgia Supreme Court in <em>Brownlee v. Williams, </em>233 Ga. 548, 212 S.E.2d 359 (1975), held that personnel covered by Section 18 have legitimate property interests in their jobs. And District Judge Henderson, a Georgia practitioner of long experience,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>has determined that the joint operation of \u00a7 24A-603 and Section 18 grants court personnel like Webb a similar right. Appellant, therefore, was entitled to minimum due process protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Examining the record, we have found that Webb\u2019s supervisors informed him several times, both orally and in writing, that they were dissatisfied with his insubordinate attitude toward his immediate superior and with the quality of a report he was responsible for. He also had at least two conferences with superiors, prior to his termination, concerning the problems that led to his ultimate dismissal. At the time of his termination he was given written notice of the reasons therefor, and afterward he received a full-blown hearing, at which he subpoenaed, examined, and cross-examined witnesses on the issues involved in the decision to fire him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Aside from any question regarding compliance with the state statutes,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we find that the procedures employed in terminating Webb comported with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-12\">. Appellant filed an \u201cAction for Declaratory Judgment\u201d on October 8, 1975, seeking reinstatement, back pay, a restraining order preventing further action by the Fulton County Civil Service Board, a declaration that the act creating the Fulton County Juvenile Court was unconstitutional, and costs of litigation. Appellant then filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment seeking a temporary restraining order. Defendants responded, filing motions to dismiss the action. In two orders dated February 13, 1976, and April 16, 1976, the District Judge denied appellant\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and dismissed all of his claims except for counts 1 and 2, which assert that appellant\u2019s civil rights had been violated and that he had been denied due process and equal protection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b717-13\">. 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b717-14\">. 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b717-15\">.
