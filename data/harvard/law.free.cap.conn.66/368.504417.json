On the 12th of April, 1879, said society then having a fund of $64,000, which arose from the sale of their former church property, already invested in United States bonds, formed a constitution for their government, declaring the objects and purposes of the society as follows, <em>viz: </em>\u2018The objects of this society shall be the learning, teaching, and practice of the truths and principles of a pure religion, the enjoyment and support of public worship, the affording of a spiritual home and fellowship with Christian sympathy and assistance to all who by creed or tradition are debarred from other churches, and co-operation with all other workers in advancing the moral reforms of society, and in extending over the earth the reign of righteousness, temperance, love, and good-will.\u2019 And said constitution also contained the following article, <em>viz: </em>\u2018Inasmuch as the funds of the society were originally contributed by its older members, and by their fidelity, care, and business sagacity, have been increased to the present sum, these older members (naming them) shall constitute and are hereby constituted and continued a Board of Trustees, to have exclusive management of said funds for the benefit of the society, the same as <em>now; </em>provided that whenever the society shall vote to procure or build a place of its own for its meetings, an amount not exceeding half of the sum then in hand shall be devoted to such a purpose, and that the yearly income of all its property, without trenching on the principal, shall be used for the current expenses of the society. * * * This article is not to be changed or amended except by concurrent action of the society and said Board of Trustees, and the funds under no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>-circumstances are to be alienated from the support of liberal Christianity.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-5\">\u201c3. In the.year 1880, as requested by vote of the society, the Board of Trustees purchased a lot at 26 Pratt street, for the purpose of erecting a church building, for which lot they paid from said fund $20,000 ; and in 1881 said society erected a church building on the rear half of said lot at a cost, including the half of said lot (estimated at $10,000), and the equipment of said church, of the sum of $30,000, the balance of $20,000 being paid from said fund; and said building was duly dedicated as \u2018\u2018Unity Church and Hall\u2019 on the 3d day of April, 1881, and from that day to the present time has been regularly and statedly occupied for religious worship.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b378-6\">\u201c 4.

Said Unity Church and Hall is also provided with a platform or stage, facilitating the use of said church, audience-room or hall for entertainments and amusements.

In 1891 and 1892 said society erected on the front portion of their said lot, a building which is known as Unity Building. This Unity Building the society has since rented for stores and offices, and the Board of Trustees of the society used the balance of their fund of $64,000, to wit, the $24,000 above referred to, in erecting said building, and all the net income of this latter building has been used exclusively for the maintenance of religious services in said Unity Church and Hall.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-8\"><em>Elisha Carpenter </em>and <em>Horace </em>Cornwall, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-9\">I.

Statutes or charters exempting property, persons, or corporations, from the common burden of taxation, are to be strictly construed.

In all cases where exemptions of this character are claimed, it is necessary that those making such claims should show a state of facts entitling the property to exemption. <em>Wyman </em>v. <em>City of St. Louis, </em>17 Mo., 337; <em>Y.

The claim of the plaintiff that under \u00a7 3823, $10,000 of a certain fund invested in Unity Building should be exempt from taxation, is not tenable, for the reason that it is not the investment of a \u201c fund \u201d within the meaning of the statute. The original fund has disappeared, and in its stead the soeiety have become owners of a block of real estate. This they rent, and from such renting derive profit for the corporation and compete with other landlords for remunerative tenants.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Andrews, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnO\">The plaintiff claims that Unity Building is exempt from taxation, by reason of the provisions of \u00a7 3823 of the General Statutes. We cannot assent to that claim. By that section only personal property can be exempted. Unity Building is not personal property, with whatever form of funds it may have been purchased. \u201c Funds invested,\u201d as that expression is used in the section, means invested in a form like bonds or mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Unity Church and Hall is exempt from being taxed, if it is a building exclusively occupied as a church; otherwise not. The plaintiff is an ecclesiastical society in the town of Hartford, duly organized pursuant to the statutes of this State, and has existed as such for more than fifty years. In 1880 it purchased a lot of land for the purpose of erecting thereon a church building, and in 1881 it did erect on the rear part of that lot a church building, which was on the 3d day of April, 1881, dedicated as Unity Church and Hall; and from that day to this time the said building has been regularly and statedly occupied for religious worship.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">If the finding stopped here, it would be reasonably clear that this building should not be assessed for taxation. It is what follows that causes any doubt. It appears that a few days after the church was dedicated, the society made their religious services free to all worshipers, and authorized its committee \u201c to derive income by renting the church'building for lectures, concerts, readings, and any other thing not inappropriate to be had in a church.\u201d The society has derived from such rentals some five or six hundred dollars a year, which it has used exclusively for the maintenance of religious services in said church and hall. Some of the entertainments so permitted for hire in said church and hall, have consisted of lectures, vocal and instrumental concerts, mesmeric performances; dramas by amateurs, and at times political conventions.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The expression used in the statute, \u201coccupied as a church,\u201d must be taken to mean occupied as a church building is usually occupied, or as a church building may properly be occupied; because that is the ordinary meaning of the words. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>And the plaintiff has exclusively occupied Unity Church and Hall as a church, unless some of the things it has permitted to be done there have, within the meaning indicated, interrupted such occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Very many ecclesiastical societies defray the expenses of their religious services by requiring worshipers.to pay a rent, for the pews or seats which they occupy at such services. The plaintiff, in the hope perhaps that the poor might have the gospel preached unto them, made the seats in its audience-room free to all worshipers on all occasions of its stated religious services, and sought to defray the expenses of such services by renting its audience-room at other times for lectures, concerts, readings, and other things not inappropriate to be had in a church. If the method of raising money with which to pay the expenses of their religious services practiced by the many ecclesiastical societies, does not interrupt the exclusive occupation bjr any one of these of its church building as a church, it must be conceded that the method of raising money for the same purposes practiced by the plaintiff, does not interrupt its exclusive occupation of Unity Church and Hall as a church. In neither case is the money earned for or applied to a secular use. <em>Conn. Spiritualist Camp-Meeting Assn. </em>v. <em>East Lyme, </em>54 Conn., 152; <em>Manresa Institute </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>61 id., 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The policy on which the exemption of church buildings from taxation is granted, is the encouragement of religion; and that policy is not hindered, but rather promoted, by permitting this building to be used for profit, when not needed for those services distinctly called religious services ; for literary, scientific or entertaining exercises, or for any other thing not inappropriate to be had in a church. In earlier times in this State, and in all the New England States, the church \u2014 commonly called the Meeting House \u2014 was customarily used for town meetings, lectures, concerts, temperance meetings, political addresses, and for other like special occasions ; and no one ever supposed that such use made the Meeting House liable to taxation. In the country towns the like use still prevails. In view of such general use it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>to be supposed that the legislature intended, by any language it has used, to make all such church buildings taxable. We think Unity Church and Hall is exempt from taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The Superior Court is advised to render judgment that Unity Building is taxable, and that Unity Church and Hall is not taxable'.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
