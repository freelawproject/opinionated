At the present time I hold the \u2018 debenture \u2019 bonds of the Middlesex Banking Co. of Middletown, Connecticut, to over the amount above named and I would recommend her to select those I also give her for her use as \u2018 pocket money \u2019 $300. Three Hundred Dollars, which sum my \u2018representatives,\u2019 executors, or administrators, as the case may be, are authorized hereby to draw from any bank in which I may have money on deposit, and pay over to her: \u2014 or she, if she accept the position of executrix, as which she will below herein be named, may draw the same at once. I also give and bequeath to the said S.

I bequeath and devise to my second cousin, S.

Hunt, (grantee and grantor) and who (my mother) duly sold and conveyed to me, as will be made clear by deeds, which will readily be found among my papers, \u2014 or by reference to the records of the Town of Winchester ; and if my cousin, the said S. Elizabeth Gillette, shall be <em>unwilling </em>to accept the charge and care of so many rocky acres (as I would advise her to be, \u2018 to be frank \u2019) then I direct that so much of the same as is desirable on the east side of said land, comprising the \u2018 Cabin \u2019 and the \u2018 brook,\u2019 which runs through the lower part, be set off to her, together with the \u2018 hemlock grove,\u2019 and all included within the fence on the eastward of the old \u2018 dancing platform \u2019\u2019 spot \u2014 and the rest, the pasture grounds, \u2018 Mount Case,\u2019 etc., be sold for whatever fair price it will bring, and the avails of sale be given her, my said cousin, for \u2018 pin money.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-6\">\u201c 11. In view of the enactment by the last legislature of the State of Connecticut of a law which I consider unjust and extortionate, I have already (fearing that I may die within the jurisdiction of Connecticut, and that my estate will be administered0 upon under its law) in order to avoid said unjust law, to wit, the \u2018 Collateral Inheritance Tax Act,\u2019 passed to some others in trust for my use during my life, however, certain bonds, and landed properties \u2014 the latter situate in states and countries beyond the jurisdiction of infamous Connecticut. These I shall probably in no case recall, though some of the same may revert to me by the death of a conditional donee, or grantee; but aside from these, I judge (from a careful estimate made yesterday) I shall be likely to leave at my death more than enough to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>all the positive or direct legacies made in the foregoing items hereof, and leave a balance to the credit of my estate, without the sale of any other real estate I have (besides Highland Park) \u2014 in Winsted, or Winchester. So the homestead I now occupy \u2014 which is to become the property of the Connecticut Baptist Convention, if on the second of June, 1891, they pay therefor $5,400, and the \u2018 office house,\u2019 opposite my homestead, together with the strip of land running to the foundation wall of the house next east of said \u2018office house,\u2019 may not need to be utilized to make out the sum sufficient to dis charge all the legacies \u2014 but they may. I therefore direct\u2014 that, first, all my bequests in manner and form as above written to my cousin, Miss S. Elizabeth Gillette, be first regarded in every respect, both bequests and devises \u2014 I mean and next what I had overlooked, to wit, the following item be regarded second in turn to wit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-5\">\u201c12. I give and bequeath to myniece, Mrs. Kate C. Newton, wife of Allen Newton, of Hartford, Connecticut, the sum of One Hundred Dollars ($100). I would bequeath to her a larger sum \u2014 indeed I might have given her ten thousand dollars, a sum once considered by my late mother and myself as eventually to be given by her, my mother or by myself, to the said Kate \u2014 had she, the said Kate, deported herself toward my mother in the latter years of her, my late mother\u2019s life, affectionately and kindly, or with the manifest respect and appreciation due from a grandchild to a worthy and noble woman, her grandmother. But the said Kate, unfortunately for herself, so conducted as to fail to command her grandmother's esteem \u2014 a statement of which fact is set forth at considerable length in the last will of her grandmother, Mrs. Emily W. Case, whicli will my executors may find among my papers \u2014 and which was not presented for probate for two reasons. 1, because my late mother died leaving no property, having in 1884 assigned to me all \u2018bonds,\u2019 <em>choses in </em>action, etc. \u2014 and all household furniture \u2014 by bill of sale, duly executed \u2014 (at another later time) and having from time to time conveyed to me her real estate in this State, and in Iowa, and other States so, in fact, \u2018everything\u2019 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>mine save the interest on certain bonds, which interest she reserved, to herself for her own use during her lifetime. She also received the dividends on certain bank stocks and railroad stocks which were by her sold and assigned to me. I remark all this here, because I think my executors should be advised of the facts, in view of the possibility that the mother of said Kate and other of her relatives, may \u2018grumble \u2019 and oe disposed to \u2018 make difficulty \u2019 if they could', because no more of Dr. Case\u2019s or Mrs. Emily W. Case\u2019s money or property \u2014 which they eagerly coveted for themselves and the said Kate, fell into her hands. My executors will find bill of sale of furniture, assignments of bonds, (such particularly as were lodged with, and bought of) Gilbert &amp; Gay \u2014 these written by my mother\u2019s hand in a little \u2018 bank book \u2019 in which a list of the bonds was then (in 1886) written) and various deeds of land among my papers in my bank boxes; and the assignment of bank stocks and \u2018 corporations, stocks,\u2019 railroad and otherwise, can be found, of course, in the files or books of the various banks and corporations concerned. My executors will probably also find papers written by my late mother, showing that said Kate had received from her grandfather and grandmother several thousand dollars, so she has no real ground for complaint, especially in view of her treatment of her grandmother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-5\">\u201c13. I direct and bequeath that in case any one of my various legatees in the foregoing twelve items named should die- before-me, (and if I, by codicil hereto, shall have made no disposition of his or her bequest) then the sum bequeathed to such person decedent, shall be given, share and share alike, to all the other legatees in this instrument named \u2014 except the said Kate C. Newton, my intention and will being that she in no case whatever, be paid over or more than ($100) One Hundred Dollars \u2014 minus the 5^&gt; \u201c collateral inheritance tax,\u2019\u2019 if the State shall be mean enough to demand that: \u2014 but this item (13) shall not be construed as having any relation (and it really has none, strictly interpreted) to the sums of $14,000, <em>and </em>the Naugatuck R. R. stocks left to the <em>use </em>of S. Elizabeth Gillette or the moneys $4,000, and $5,000, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>use of which sums is given to my aunt, Urania, and to Mrs. Marie Howland, respectively, \u2014 I refer therefore in this to the possible death of any other of my above named legatees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-5\">\u201c14. On the death of my cousin, S. Elizabeth Gillette, or of my aunt, Urania, or of the said Mrs. Marie Howland, the sums given to their use will, of course, revert to my estate (and I make the following disposition of them, together with whatever else in the shape of a \u2018fund\u2019 may belong to my estate \u2014 to <em>wit </em>\u2014 first, I direct that as soon as any one of the above named Elizabeth Gillette\u2019s or Urania Whiting Wilder\u2019s or Marie Howland\u2019s death shall be duly made known to my executors or administrators, then One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) clear in money, over and above any rascally State tax, or \u2018 collateral inheritance tax,\u2019 which may be demauded of my estate, shall be paid to Ellen Hayes, or Nellie Hayes as she is more commonly called, who has lived with me and my late mother for twelve years past \u2014 which sum of $1,000 I hereby give and bequeath to the said Ellen Hayes \u2014 (to whom I am indebted at this present writing, in the sum of $800 evidenced by my note for that amount, which note falls due the last day of 1891, but which I now expect to pay long before then). Secondly, I further direct that whenever the said sums of $14,000 and $8,400 (\u2018 bonds \u2019 and Naug. R. R. stocks or \u2018 shares \u2019) given to my cousin, Elizabeth Gillette\u2019s use, and the $4,000 assigned to my Aunt Urania\u2019s use, and the $5,000 assigned to Mrs. Howland\u2019s use, shall revert to my estate \u2014 then (after the payment of One Thousand Dollars to Ellen Hayes as aforesaid) one-half of each and all of said sums, shall be given to that \u201c Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,\u201d which has its office in the City of New York, and of which the late Henry Bergh was a chief promoter, and head \u2014 or \u2018 President,\u2019 (if I have not correctly quoted its name, the above is, I think, its sufficiently distinct designation \u2014 \u2018Bergh\u2019s Society\u2019) \u2014 to which society or corporate body I give and bequeath said one-half.\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">\u201c The other half, I direct to be divided into as many parts or small sums as is \u2014 that is shall be found on inquiry to be\u2014 the number of individuals among my above named legatees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>then living, to whom I have in this will bequeathed the sum of only One Thousand Dollars (the $8,000 and $2,000 ones not to be considered, and my neice, Mrs. Newton, also excepted) <em>plus </em>Elizabeth Gillette if she shall be living when Mrs. Wilder and Mrs. Howland or either of them die, or dies; and to each of such number living, one of said parts shall be given \u2014 my executors or administrators to endeavor to pay the abominable collateral inheritance tax on said sum\u2014 the <em>two </em>halves out of any fund which may still belong to my estate</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-5\">\u201c16. As I have already placed certain of my property\u2014 (as I have before written) where it will serve me in life, and be in the hands of those I wish to have it when I am gone ; I purpose, if I live to do so, to pass over to some of my legatees herein the sums (or portion of the same) herein bequeathed to them \u2014 during my life, by sale and due assignment, reserving to myself a life interest in the use of the same \u2014 and I shall probably in such case make a codicil hereto, revoking the bequests herein to such said persons, or (said legatees, \u2014 or shall take some other course to outwit the infamous collateral inheritance law \u2014 especially shall I probably do so in the case of my second cousin, S. Elizabeth Gillette as to the $5,000 and the $300 in item \u2018 2 \u2019 bequeathed to her. And now I beg the pardon of my above named executrix and executor and of any other person properly \u2018 concerned,\u2019 for the rambling construction and bad chirography (\u2018 cachography\u2019) of this instrument, which I have constructed \u2018 on the jump \u2019 on the eve of leaving home for a few days and almost without pause, except for supper, on this p. m. of February 16th, 1891.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-6\">By other clauses $13,000 was bequeathed to five persons in legacies of $2,000 and $3,000 each; $8,000 was bequeathed to eight persons in legacies of $1,000 each; all the testator\u2019s household furniture, clothing, manuscripts, paintings, silverware, books, etc., were bequeathed to S.

In execution of that purpose he directs that upon the termination of the first life estate in the legacies given for life, his executors shall pay $1,000, free of any inheritance tax, to Ellen Hayes, and shall give one half of the sum remaining to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and shall give the other half in equal portions to his legatees then living to whom $1,000 only has been bequeathed; and that upon the termination of each of the other life estates, the amount of each legacy shall be given, one half to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the other half in equal portions to the 11,000 legatees then living; he also directs that \u201c any fund which may still belong to my estate \u201d shall.be used to pay the collateral inheritance tax on all the amounts above mentioned, and then proceeds to dispose of \u201c whatever else in the shape of a \u2018fund\u2019 may belong to my estate.\u201d The testator then, in clause 15, bequeaths to his favorite legatee Miss Gillette, his furniture and all his personal .belongings, even tq his clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u2022The claim is made, and supported by argument ingenious and plausible, that the word \u201c fund \u201d as used by the testator is indefinite, and not broad enough to cover the whole residue of his estate; and also that the language used in describing the disposition of the \u201cfund,\u201d whatever that may mean, inadvertently confines any actual disposition of property to the sums given to legatees for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">We are satisfied from the will itself that it was the intention of the testator to cut off his only heir and next of kin with a bequest of one hundred dollars, to dispose by will of his whole estate, and to divide any residue there might be, in the manner specified in clause 14; and that, whatever difficulties may be suggested, it certainly cannot be maintained that clause 14 is clearly insusceptible of a construction which carries out that intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The rules of construction in such case are well settled: the clear intent of the testator as expressed in the will should prevail; an.obvious general intent to be gathered from the whole will is rarely defeated by an inaccuracy or inconsistency in the expression of a particular intent; every intendment is to be made against holding a man to be intestate who sits down to dispose of the residue of his property. <em>Alsop </em>v. Russell, 38 Conn., 101; <em>Goodrich </em>v. Lambert, 10 id., 452; <em>Warner </em>v. Willard, 54 id., 472. Applying these rules to this very peculiar will, and reading it in the light of the testator\u2019s mannerisms so patent on its face, and in connection with his general purpose expressed with a clearness and certainty that excludes any possibility of misunderstanding, we cannot doubt that when the testator, in clause 14, wrote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>\u201cI make the following disposition of (the sums bequeathed to legatees for life and of) whatever else in the shape of a \u2018fund\u2019 may belong to my estate,\u201d he intended to and did dispose of all the residuum.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Ellen Hayes is plainly included among the \u201c above named legatees to whom I have in this will bequeathed the sum of only one thousand dollars.\u201d The force of the language which unqualifiedly includes her among those legatees, cannot be weakened by the doubt suggested as to whether she is also included for a different purpose, under the provisions of clause 13, among \u201cthe other legatees in this instrument named.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The letter offered in evidence is plainly inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">We think the executors are made trustees of the bequests for life to Mrs. Wilder and Mrs. Howland, and that they may properly and safely commit the trust funds to the care and management of a security company such as is described in clause two.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The Superior Court is advised to render judgment answering the questions submitted, as follows:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\"><em>First: </em>The residuum of the estate is given, one half to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; and one half in equal proportions to the persons named in the will as legatees of the precise sum of $1,000, who were living at the death of Miss Gillette; payable on the final settlement of the estate after the death of all life tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\"><em>Second: </em>The sums given to Miss S. Elizabeth Gillette for life became, upon her death, payable by the executors as follows : One thousand dollars, free of any collateral inheritance tax, to Ellen Hayes, and one half of the remainder to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the other half to the $1,000 legatees living at the death of said Gillette; these payments to be made free of any collateral tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\"><em>Third: </em>The sum given to Mrs. Urania W. Wilder for life, is payable on her death as follows: One half to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the other half to the $1,000 legatees living at her death; and the sum given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>to Mrs. Marie Howland for life, is payable on her death as follows: One half to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the other half to the $1,000 legatees living at her death. All these payments to be made free of any collateral inheritance tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\"><em>Fourth: </em>Ellen Hayes is included among the $1,000 legatees, and is entitled to the portion of such legatee upon the division of the life legacies and of the residuum.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\"><em>Fifth: </em>The executors are made trustees of the $4,000 bequeathed by clause three to Mrs. Urania W. Wilder for life, and of the $5,000 bequeathed by clause four to Mrs. Marie Howland for life; they are authorized to commit these funds to the care and management of a security company such as is described in clause two, and exercising due care in the selection of such security company, and in continuing it as agent, will not be held responsible for the defaults of such company in regard to said funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
