His father then said to him, that it seemed too simple to have every trifle written <em>out; </em>\u2014 uyou <em>have a right to make rails on that land; you have witnesses to it;\u201d </em>that he could go and make rails; he said, he had witnesses sufficient for his right. Upon this declaration, the deed and articles of agreement were executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-16\">On the 27th December 1855, Jeremiah Yeakle sold the piece of woodland in question, by articles of agreement, to John Jacob and Henry Eox, the plaintiffs; who purchased with notice of the claim of the defendant of a right to enter and cut timber for making rails.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-17\">The court below (Jones, P. J.) charged the jury, that the , statute of frauds and perjuries was a positive bar to the right claimed on the part of the defendant, and that the plaintiffs, with knowledge of the defendant\u2019s claim, had a perfect right to purchase, and might well resist the claim of right presented by Benjamin, the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-18\">To this instruction the defendant excepted; and a verdict and judgment having been rendered for the plaintiffs for $33.75, the defendant removed the cause to this court, and here assigned the same for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number><em>Banks, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMc\">Parol evidence may he received in cases of trust, fraud, or mistake, to rectify a written instrument, and make it conform to the real contract of the parties: Gower <em>v. </em>Sterner, 2 <em>Wh. </em>79; Lauchner <em>v. </em>Rex, 8 <em>Harris </em>467-8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-6\">The sale of the timber, as claimed by the defendant, was not a sale of any interest concerning land.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbPa\">There might be some sort of plausibility in the right here set up, if it was only a temporary one, to obtain timber for a single repair of certain fences. But it is a perpetual right to resort to a certain woodland for a perpetual supply of fencing material for a certain other tract of land; and it is difficult to point out any kind of interest in land that more needs a written definition than. this. Even with a written definition it would be a constant cause of dissension; and without it, it would be apt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>be much more so. With such a servitude on a tract of land, no wise man would buy it, except at such a discount as would be some compensation for the risk of litigation which he would necessarily incur. And no wise man can easily be' believed to have granted such a servitude of his lands; for it is equivalent, for a small tract, to a perpetual dedication of it to the purpose of growing timber, and almost equivalent to a grant of the land itself, so far as the title of the real owner of it is concerned. We are very sure that, if the contract, as the defendant understands it, had been put into writing, his father would not have signed it. At all events, it is plainly within the principle of the statute of frauds; and, not having been put into writing, no more than a license at will passed by it; and the defendant was a trespasser in cutting timber on the land after the sale of it by his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
