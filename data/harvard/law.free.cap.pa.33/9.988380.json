The present rules of the Girard College admit as orphans, within the meaning of Mr. Girard\u2019s will, none but children who have lost both parents. Are these rules consonant to the intent of the testator; and if so, are those rules repugnant to any principle of law ? In the absence of judicial decisions, we must resort to law dictionaries, compiled by men of acknowledged learning and research, as furnishing the best authority attainable. <em>Bouvier </em>(2 <em>vol. Dict. </em>225) defines \u201c the word orphan,\u201d \u201c a minor or infant, who has lost both of his or her parents \u2014 sometimes the term is applied to such a person who has lost only one of his or her parents.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-7\">In literary dictionaries, <em>Webster </em>is, perhaps, the best guide; and he makes a distinction between the word when used as a substantive and as an adjective \u2014 the former is defined \u201c a child who is bereaved of both parents;\u201d the latter is said to mean \u201c bereaved of parents.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-8\">An orphan, says the complainant, is a <em>fatherless </em>child; such, aJ definition is not supported by reason or authority. The custom of London, which is relied upon as supporting this construction, shows that the practical meaning held by the Orphans\u2019 Court of that city, was, that an orphan, within the jurisdiction of that court, was a child who had lost either parent. For, if any man or <em>ivoman, </em>free of the city of London, died, leaving children within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>age, a court of record, composed of the mayor and aldermen of the city, had the custody of the persons, lands, and chattels of such orphans: <em>Wood\u2019s Inst. </em>532; <em>Macpherson on Infants </em>48. This custom proves too much for the appellee, as it widens this charity greater than the most liberal constructionists have yet done \u2014 so wide as to reach children whose fathers are living. For, if it is held that an orphan is any other than a child bereaved of both parents, there is no place to pause until it is decided that the loss of either makes an orphan.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-6\">The counsel then argued, that from the reading' of Stephen Girard\u2019s will, it was evident that, by the word \u201c orphan,\u201d he meant a child bereaved of both parents.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b14-7\"><em>Olmsted, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4\">\u2014 1. In the admission of orphans to the Girard College, preference is to be given to those born within the corporate limits of the city of Philadelphia, as existing at the death of the testator: <em>Girard\u2019s Will, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 20, 22; Blenon\u2019s Estate, <em>Brightly </em>338 ; Plymouth Township <em>v. </em>Jackson Township, 3 <em>Harris </em>44; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Erie and North-East Railroad Co., 3 <em>Casey 339.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-9\">2. For the purpose of admission into the Girard College for Orphans, a fatherless child is an orphan.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-10\">The appellant has argued that Mr. Girard\u2019s definition of an orphan may be collected from his will. This is first attempted to be shown by the argument, that when he first describes the objects of his legacy, he calls them \u201corphan children.\u201d And that the adjective \u201corphan\u201d has a different signification than the noun \u201c orphanthe former being defined by lexicographers to be \u201c a parentless child.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-11\">In answer to this argument, and all arguments which rest on verbal criticisms, the reply is to be found in the opinion of the court, in the case of Beck <em>v. </em>City, 5 <em>Harris </em>112. That case arose under the will of Mr. Girard, and involved the construction of a portion of it; and in answer to an argument, similar to the one under consideration, Judge Lewis observes, that verbal criticisms \u25a0\u201c are-certainly not entitled to controlling influence in the construction of instruments supposed to be frequently prepared in the hour of extremity, without the assistance of professional advice.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-12\">The Act of 1847 did certainly define an orphan, for admission into the college, to be a fatherless child. And this act, in the language of Lewis, J., in the case before mentioned, when speaking of an Act of the Legislature, having reference to this will, \u201c may be regarded as the enlightened judgment of a co-ordinate branch of the government, in the exercise of its legislative functions of legislation.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-13\">It is believed that no case can be found, where it is decided that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>an orphan is a fatherless child; nor has any case decided that an orphan is a child who has lost both parents. But there are several cases, where it is taken for granted, and mentioned without question, that a child, who has lost its father, is an orphan, while its mother is still living: 2 <em>Salk. </em>426; 2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>519; 4 <em>Burns\u2019 Ecc. L. </em>443, 444; 7 <em>Vin. Abr. </em>213; 1 <em>Macpherson on Infants </em>54; <em>Tomlin\u2019s L. D., </em>tit. <em>Orphan; Wharton\u2019s L. </em>Lexicon, tit. <em>Orphan.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-5\">In Pennsylvania, by the Act of 1713, a fatherless child is recognised as an orphan: 1 <em>Smith\u2019s Laws </em>81.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-6\">The understanding of a people, as to the meaning of a word or phrase, can only be ascertained by reference to written works habitually in use among them. With this view, the following are presented: \u2014 Book of Lamentations, ch. v., verse 3: <em>We are orphans and fatherless, and our mothers are as widows. </em>In the translation of the Septuagint version, by Charles Thompson, published in Philadelphia, in 1808, the verse is rendered: <em>We are become orphans, our father is no more; our mothers are like widows. </em>In the Psalter, in the Book of Common Prayer of the Chur'ch of England, Psalm 68, v. 5, reads: \u201c <em>He is a father of the fatherless, and defendeth the cause of the widows; even God in his holy habitation.\u201d </em>Psalm 82, v. 3, reads: \u201c <em>Defend the poor and fatherless; see that such as are in need and necessity have right.\u201d </em>Psalm 109, v. 8 : \u201c <em>Let his children be fatherless : aud his wife a widow.\u201d </em>Verse 11: <em>uLet there be no man to pity him: nor to have compassion upon his fatherless children.\u201d </em>In the English Bible, Psalm 10, v. 18: \u201c <em>To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.\u201d </em>Psalm 140, v. 9: \u201c <em>The Lord preserveth the strangers: he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-7\">Whenever the translators of the Bible, and' the compilers of the English Book of Common Prayer, intended to present the idea of destitution, friendlessness, helplessness, or abandonment, they described the object as fatherless. The following are examples:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-8\">Epistle of St. James, 1, v. 27: <em>Pure religion, and undefiled before God and the Father, is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, </em>&amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-9\">Psalm 10, v. 20: <em>To help the fatherless and poor unto their right, that the man of the earth be no more exalted against them.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-10\">Litany in Book Common Prayer: <em>That it may please thee to defend and provide for the fatherless children and widows, and aU that are desolate and oppressed.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-11\">Commination Service, same book: <em>Oursed is he thatperverteih the judgment of the stranger, the fatherless and widow.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-12\">These expressions show that fatherless was considered as equivalent to friendless, destitute, and helpless; and therefore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>word orphan, which originally meant bereaved, or needy, came to be used as its synonym.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-5\">Henry V., Act 2, Scene 4:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-6\">And on your head</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-7\">Turning the widow\u2019s tears, the <em>orphan\u2019s </em>cries,</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-8\">The dead men\u2019s blood, the pining maiden\u2019s groans</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-9\">Por husbands, <em>fathers, </em>and betrothed lovers, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-10\">Richard III., Act 2, Scene 2:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-11\">Why do you look on us, and shake your head,</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-12\">And call us <em>orphans, </em>wretches, castaways?</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-13\">If that our noble father were alive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-14\">Same, Act 2, Scene 2: \u2014 \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-15\"><em>Children </em>\u2014 Were never <em>orphans </em>had so dear a loss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-16\"><em>Dutchess </em>\u2014 These babes for Clarence weep, and So do I.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-17\">In a ballad published in England shortly after the battle of the Nile, the following verses occur:\u2014 \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-18\">Yes!

Thus we find in the first, <em>Huerfano: persona de menor edad d quien han faltado su padre y madre 6 alguno de los </em>dos\u2014 a literal translation of the French. Of <em>Orfandad, </em>however, the same work gives this definition: <em>Falta de los padres: y tambi\u00e9n se toma por la falta del padre solo. </em>The Portuguese <em>orfao </em>signifies, in general and law language, always, a fatherless or parent-less child. <em>Orfanologia </em>is a work on laws of orphans, <em>i. e. </em>fatherless children; because there are no special laws respecting children bereft of their mothers only.

The situation is a neck of land, and lieth between two navigable rivers, Delaware and Schulkill, whereby it hath two fronts on the water, each a mile, and two from river to river. Delaware is a glorious river; but Schulkill, being a hundred miles boatable above the falls, and its course north-east, towards the fountain of Susquehanna, .that leads to the heart of the province, and both sides our own, it is like to be a great part of the settlement of this age. I say little of the town itself, because a platform will be shown you, by my agent, in which those who are purchasers of me, will find their names and interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b17-9\">In a short advertisement, upon the situation and extent of the city of Philadelphia, and the platform thereof, by the surveyor-general, Thomas Holme, he says: \u201c The city of Philadelphia now extends from river to river, two miles, and in breadth, near a mile; and the governor, as a further manifestation of his kindness unto the purchasers, hath freely given them their respective lots, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>city, without defalcation of any of their quantities of purchased lands; and as it is now placed and modelled between two rivers, upon a neck of land, and that ships may ride in good anchorage in six or eight fathoms water, in both, close to the city, and the land of the city, level, dry, and wholesome \u2014 such a situation is scarce to be paralleled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">Throughout the whole of this document, it is spoken of as the city; and in mentioning the public squares, uses this language: \u201c There 'are also in each quarter of the city, a square of eight acres, to be for the like uses as the Moorfields are in London.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b18-7\">\u2018 \u201cThe air,\u201d says the Proprietary, \u201cis sweet and clear; the heavens serene \u2014 like the south parts of France, rarely overcast; and as the woods come, by numbers of people, to be more cleared, that itself will refine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b18-8\">In the same year, 1688, that the city was laid out by the proprietary, it is called, in the heading to the laws made at an assembly, held at Philadelphia, the 27th day of the eighth month, \u201c The city of Philadelphia;\u201d and in various acts, up to the year 1701 inclusive, \u201c The town of Philadelphia:\u201d 1 <em>Hall &amp; Sellers, </em>p. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-9\">On the 25th October 1701, the proprietary granted a charter to the city of Philadelphia, in which he said, \u201c that at the humble request of the inhabitants and settlers of this town of Philadelphia, being some of the first adventurers and purchasers, within this province, for their encouragement, and for the -more immediate and entire government of the said town, and better regulation of trade therein, I have, by virtue of the king\u2019s letter patent, under the great seal of England, erected the said town into a borough, and by these presents, do erect the said town and borough of Philadelphia, into a city, which said city shall extend the limits and bounds, as it is laid out between Delaware and Schuylkill.\u201d And its corporate title was the \u201cMayor and Commonalty of the City of Philadelphia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b18-10\">By the revolution, according to the expressive language of the legislature of 1777, all powers and jurisdictions, not founded on the authority of the people only, became null and void; and the corporation of the city was, therefore, dissolved, and all its powers and jurisdictions entirely ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-11\">The affairs of the city were managed by various local bodies, until the passage of the act to incorporate the city of Philadelphia, on the 11th March 1789, by which \u201cthe inhabitants of the city of Philadelphia, <em>as the same extends and is laid out </em>between the rivers Delaware and Schuylkill, be, and they and their successors for ever, are hereby constituted a corporation and body politic in fact and in law, by the name and style of \u201c The Mayor, Aider-men and Citizens of Philadelphia; \u2019 \u201d and so continued, until their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>consolidation with the rest of the county of Philadelphia into one great city, under the Act of the 2d February 1854.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\">On the 18th April 1794, the district of Southwark was incorporated by the name of \u201c The Commissioners and Inhabitants of the District of Southwarkon the 28th March 1803, the district of the Northern Liberties was incorporated; on the 12th March 1812, the township of Moyamensing; on the 22d March 1813, the district of Spring Garden; and on the 6th of' March 1820, the Kensington district was incorporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">The city of Philadelphia, in 1744, contained 1500 houses, and 13,000 people; in 1790, 28,552; in 1800, 41,220; in 1810, 53,722; in 1820, 63,802 inhabitants; whilst the rest of the county of Philadelphia, from 1800 to 1820, numbered about as many as the city proper. In 1830, the population of the city was 80,458; of the surrounding incorporated districts above enumerated, 80,952; and of the rural districts of the county, 27,451.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\">The city of London, like the city of Philadelphia, is surrounded by other municipal communities, entirely distinct from it, as to revenue, expenditures, and local administration; and whilst the whole metropolis, in 1841, covered a surface of 10,000 acres, with a population of nearly 2,000,000, its territory is limited to about one square mile, .or 600 acres, and its population to 129,251 souls. The corporate and parochial income of the city of London, for public objects, and derived from trust estates for the relief of the poor, care of the sick, education, religion, and general purposes, local rates, coal and metage duties, street and market tolls, freedom and livery fines, and other charges for corporate and trading privileges, the port of London, and the conservancy of the river, is estimated to amount to the annual sum of \u00bf\u00a3900,000 sterling, or $4,500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-8\">Stephen Girard was born in Bordeaux, in France, on the 21st day of May 1750. His father was a sea captain, and at the age of fourteen, young Girard became a sailor, and made several voyages to the West Indies. On the 4th October 1773, after undergoing the necessary examination, a license was duly granted, giving to Stephen Girard, of Bordeaux, full authority to act as captain, master, and patron of a merchant vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-9\">Plaving purchased goods to the value of nearly 16,000 livres, or about $3000, in federal money, Mr. Girard started on his first mercantile adventure, and sailed again from his home (which he never afterwards revisited), arriving at St. Marc\u2019s, in the island of St. Domingo, in the month of February 1774. After disposing of his venture, and converting the proceeds into produce, he left the West Indies, and arrived, for the first time, in the North American colonies, at the port of New York, in the month of July, of the same year. For several years, first as mate, and subsequently as master and part owner of a small vessel and cargo, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>he traded between New York, New Orleans, and Port au Prince; and in May 1777, in the latter capacity, Mr. Girard entered the waters of the Delaware, and arrived, for the' first time, at Philadelphia, where he commenced business, and rented a store in Water street, within a short distance of the spot where he located himself permanently.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">On the approach of the British troops, he left for Mount Holly, in New\u2019Jersey, where he purchased a small property; and after the evacuation of Philadelphia by the enemy, on the 17th of June 1778, he again returned, and resumed his business in Water street.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\">In this neighbourhood, with the exception of a voyage to Charleston and the Mediterranean, in a brig owned and commanded by himself, and which terminated in July 1788; Stephen Girard lived and died a citizen of the city of Philadelphia.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-8\">In the great yellow fever of 1793, which broke out in Water street, within a square of his residence, Mr. Girard distinguished himself by visiting and attending upon the sick, and by his invaluable services as an active manager of the hospital at Bush Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-10\">Seventeen thousand persons left the city, and of the remainder, upwards of four thousand, or nearly a fifth, died. At a meeting of the citizens of Philadelphia, the Northern Liberties, and district of Southwark, assembled on Saturday, the 22d day of March 1794, and presided over by Thomas McKean, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and then chief justice, and after-wards governor of the state, their most cordial, grateful, and fraternal thanks were presented to their fellow-citizens named in the proceedings, \u201c for their benevolent and patriotic exertions in relieving the miseries of suffering humanity on the late occasion.\u201d One of these citizens, thus gratefully remembered, was Stephen Girard, under whose <em>\u201c </em>meritorious exertions and peculiar care,\u201d at the Bush Hill hospital, in conjunction with Peter Helm, \u201c every possible comfort was provided for the sick, and decent burial for those whom their efforts could not preserve from the ravages of the prevailing distemper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b20-11\">In 1797 and 1798, the fever again prevailed in Philadelphia with fearful violence, and again Mr. Girard exhibited the same enlarged philanthropy, and the same disregard of danger, by liberal contributions, and personal services to the sick and dying.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-12\">In 1802, Mr. Girard was elected a member of the city councils, and so continued for several years. Upon the expiration of the charter of the first Bank of the United States, he established his own private bank, in the building occupied by the late national institution, and his first cashier was Mr. George Simpson, the cashier of the late bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-13\">During the war, he rendered essential services by his loans and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>subscriptions, and after its close, became a large stockholder in the second Bank of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">For a period of upwards, of forty years, although engaged in a most extensive commerce, and the owner of numerous vessels employed in a very large foreign trade, and in the latter part of it, the head of the greatest private bank in the Union, his life was spent in his counting-house in Water street, or in his-banking-room in Third street, varied by almost daily visits to his modest farm in Passyunk. With a reputation extending over the United States and Europe, as a wealthy and successful merchant and banker, his habits were so retired, plain, and frugal, that his person was unknown to many of his fellow-citizens. His fame and his name are indissolubly connected with the great charity which creates the subject of this dispute \u2014 his orphan college.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">Stephen Girard died on the 26th December 1831, and his will was dated the 16th February 1880, and was republished by two accompanying codicils, dated the 25th December 1830, and 20th June 1831.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-8\">His will commences, \u201c I, Stephen Girard, of the city of Philadelphia, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, mariner and merchant, being of sound mind, memory and understanding, do make and publish this my last will- and testament in manner following, that is to say;\u201d and after various devises and bequests, he proceeds in the twentieth clause of his will, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-9\">\u201c And whereas, I have for a long time been impressed with the importance of educating the poor, and by placing them by early cultivation of their minds, and the development of their moral principles, above the many temptations to which through poverty and ignorance they are exposed: and I am particularly desirous to provide for such a number of poor white male orphan children, as can be trained in one institution, a better education, as well as a more comfortable maintenance than they usually receive from the application of the public funds. And whereas, together with the objects just adverted to, I have sincerely at heart <em>the welfare of the city of Philadelphia\u2022 </em>\u2014 and as a part of it am desirous to improve the neighbourhood of the river Delaware, so that the health of the citizens may be promoted and preserved, and that \u2022 the eastern part of <em>the city </em>may be made to correspond better with the interior. Now I do give, devise, and bequeath <em>all the residue and remainder of my real and personal estate, </em>of every sort and kind wheresoever situate (the real estate in Pennsylvania charged as aforesaid) unto\u201d the Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens of Philadelphia, in trust, and amongst others, to keep that part of \u25a0the real estate situate in the city and liberties of Philadelphia, constantly in good repair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b21-10\">The 21st clause provides, <em>\u201c </em>and so far as regards the residue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>my personal estate, in trust as to <em>two millions of dollars, </em>part thereof, to apply and expend so much of that sum as may be necessary, in erecting, as soon as practicably may be, <em>in the centre of my square of ground between High and Chestnut streets and Eleventh and Twelfth streets in the city of Philadelphia </em>(which square of ground I hereby devote for the purposes hereinafter stated, and for no other, for ever), a permanent college with suitable outbuildings, sufficiently spacious for the residence and accommodation of at least three hundred scholars, and the requisite teachers, and other persons necessary in such an institution as I direct to be established, and in supplying the said college and outbuildings, with decent and suitable furniture, as well as books, and all things needful to carry into effect my design.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">Then followed minute and accurate directions for the erection of his college: \u201cand when the college and appurtenances shall have been constructed, and supplied with plain and suitable furniture and books, philosophical and experimental instruments and apparatus, and all other matters needful to carry,\u201d as he says, \u201cmy design into execution, the income, issues, and profits of so much of the said two millions of dollars as shall remain unexpended shall be applied to maintain the college according to my directions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">Then follow ten paragraphs in which he directs how his college shall be organized and managed, and what orphans shall be admitted into it. They must be <em>poor white male orphans </em>between the age of six and ten years, and must be bound to the corporation of the city. Priority of application to entitle to preference, all other things concurring; if more applicants than vacancies preference shall be given, <em>\u201cFirst, </em>to orphans bom in the city of Philadelphia; <em>Secondly, </em>to those born in any other part of Pennsylvania ; <em>Thirdly, </em>to those born in the city of New York (that being the first port on the continent of North America at which I arrived); and lastly, to those born in the city of New Orleans, (being the first port on the said continent at which I first traded in the first instance, as first officer, and subsequently as master and part owner of a vessel and cargo).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">If the income arising from the residue of the two millions, remaining after the construction and furnishing of the college and outbuildings, shall be inadequate to the construction of new buildings, or the maintenance and education of as many orphans as may apply for admission, then such sum as may be necessary for those purposes shall be taken from the final residuary fund \u2014 \u201c my design and desire being,\u201d says the testator, \u201c that the benefits of said institution shall be extended to as great a number of orphans as the limits of the said square and buildings thereon can accommodate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-9\">By the 22d clause there is a trust created in the city, as to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>further sum of <em>five hundred thousand dollars, </em>the income of which is to he exclusively applied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-5\">1. To lay out, regulate, curb, light, and pave a passage or street on the east part of the city of Philadelphia, fronting the river Delaware, and to be called Delaware Avenue, extending <em>from Vine to Qedar streets; </em>and amongst other things, to completely clean and keep clean all the docks within the limits of the city fronting on the Delaware.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-6\">2. To remove and prohibit all wooden buildings within the limits of the city.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-7\">3. To widen Water street, east and west, from Yine street all the way to South, street, and to distribute the Schuylkill water therein. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">By the 24th clause of his will, the remainder of the residue of his personal estate is to be invested by his said trustee, the corporation of the city, and with its accumulations to form a permanent fund, the income of which is to be applied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-9\">1. To the further improvement and maintenance of the college.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-10\">2. To establish a competent police for the security of the persons and property of the inhabitants of the city.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-11\">3. To improve the city property, <em>and the general appearance of the city itself, </em>and to the reduction of taxes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b23-12\">\u201c To all which objects,\u201d says the testator, \u201cthe prosperity of the city, and the' health and comfort of its inhabitants, I devote the said fund aforesaid, and direct the income thereof to be applied yearly, and every year for ever, after providing for the college as hereinbefore directed, as my primary object.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b23-13\">By his last codicil, Mr. Girard changed the location of his college from the lot on Ohesnut street to the farm called Peel Hall, on the Ridge Road, in Penn township.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-14\">By the Acts of the 24th March and 4th April 1832, the Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens of Philadelphia wrere enabled to carry into effect the improvements, and to execute certain trusts contained in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-15\">The corner stone of the college was laid on the 4th July 1833, and the building was finished, and the institution organized and opened on the 1st January 1848 \u2014 fourteen years and a half after-wards ; and nearly two millions of dollars were expended in its erection. By actual expenditure, and by depreciation of the stocks, in which the great charity fund of two millions was invested, every dollar of this most munificent appropriation, for the benefit' of the poor white male orphans, the objects of Stephen Girard\u2019s bounty, has entirely disappeared, and the college is now supported by the income of the residuary real and personal estate which was originally devoted to other objects.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-16\">If the simple plan of Stephen Girard had been strictly followed, and if, as advised at the time, the whole of the personal property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>had been gradually laid out in safe mortgages in the city and county of Philadelphia, a very large portion of the two millions would have been still remaining to maintain and increase the Girard College for Orphans, and at the same time, have improved-the whole district by affording an additional sum to be laid out in the improvement of real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">The college was erected under the charge of a building committee of the select and common councils, whilst a board of trustees regulated the other affairs of the institution, until it was abolished by ordinance on the 23d of December 1841, together with the offices of secretary to the said board, and of president of the Girard College for Orphans. By the tenth section of the ordinance of the 21st March 1833, it was made the duty of the said trustees to prepare as soon as practicable, and submit to councils for their approbation, the plan of a system of government and instruction for the said college, \u201chaving reference to the will of Stephen Girard, so far as they are express on this subject.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">Dr. Francis Lieber having been charged by the trustees to draw up this plan, on the 5th December 1833, submitted it to them, with an introductory report, which were both printed by order of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">In this report, the question of what was the meaning of the word <em>orphan, </em>in Mr. Girard\u2019s will, was fully and learnedly discussed ; and it was settled by Dr. Lieber, after a most extensive and elaborate examination, to mean a fatherless child.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">\u201cWhen Mr. Girard,\u201d says he, \u201cuses the word orphan, we are sure he did not look for the etymology of the word, but used it in that sense which presented itself as the readiest in his mind \u2014 \u25a0 which sense was this ? Mr. Girard, a native Frenchman, spoke much French, and better than English, throughout his whole life. It is possible, therefore, that though his will is drawn up in English, the word orphan presented itself to his mind with that meaning which <em>orphelin </em>has in French, because if two languages are equally ready to a mind, as means of thought and utterance, which is much more than the capacity of speaking two languages, phenomena take place in the human mind, which can be known by personal experience only. Sometimes we think in one language, sometimes in another: sometimes we use one language, and yet <em>i </em>transplant to certain words the meaning which belongs to their fellow words in the other language. We must then take the word orphan in its English or French sense, if we wish to ascertain its precise meaning, as to the will in question, <em>and in both languages, the word orphan, in common language, means a fatherless child, </em>as the following note and the succeeding lines will show; it never means anything different, if used to designate asylums, or any institutions for them. Whatever may be the poet\u2019s use of the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>orphan, </em>as soon as it assumes in any degree a legal or official sense, it signifies, and very naturally so, fatherless children only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">After discussing briefly the question, whether the word orphan in the will of Mr. Girard includes children who have lost their mothers only, he says: \u201c A learned judge of our city has shown, as you are well aware, that in those few cases, in which the English courts have been called upon to construe the word orphan, it has been taken in the sense of a fatherless child. In our country, as I have been informed by some of the first jurists\u201d (Chancellor Kent and Judge Story), \u201c it is believed that no such official decisions exist, but that the meaning attached to the word orphan, by the people at large, is unquestionably that of a fatherless child\u2014 a meaning which entirely agrees with our whole social system. I am fully aware of the paramount importance of the mother in the education of a child; this importance even increases the farther we descend in the scale of social relations. I have enlarged upon this point in another work. But our whole social system would be overturned, were we no longer to consider the father the chief of the house, the <em>\u2018 </em>lord\u2019 of the family! In all civilized countries, the law justly takes cognisance of the death of a father; it appoints guardians, it administers the property of the minors, and watches over their interests; but in no country does the law take cognisance of the death of the mother only, except in some special cases, where her property has been kept separately. The respective relations of the father and the mother to the child, are founded in the necessity of things, and therefore established by Him who assigned different spheres of activity to everybody in the universe, \u2014relations, and conditions, against which we can never act with impunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The third article of the constitution framed by Dr. Lieber says: \u201c an orphan is a fatherless child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">This question had been discussed in the spring of 1833, in a friendly correspondence between ex-president John Quincy Adams and Judge Hopkinson; the first maintaining that the word orphan includes all those children who had lost both or either parent, the latter that it was to be confined to those who had lost their fathers only, in other words to fatherless children. (14 <em>Hazard\u2019s Register of Pennsylvania, </em>p. 188.)</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">Until 1847, annual appropriations were made out of the residuary estate, for the support of the police, the improvement of the city property, and the general appearance of the city, and in effect to diminish the burden of taxation, but they ceased of course with the completion of the college \u2014 the erection of which had entirely exhausted the special fund of two millions.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">As the time approached for the organization and opening of the college, the legislature, on the 27th February 1847, passed an act relative to the Girard College for Orphans, by which the guardians <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>of the poor were authorized, with the consent of the <em>surviving </em>mother, guardian, or next friend of any poor white male orphan child, within this Commonwealth, between the age of six and ten years, for whose admission to the Girard College for Orphans, application shall have been made, to bind such orphan child by indenture, to the Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens of Philadelphia, as trustees under the will of Stephen Girard, deceased, as an orphan to be admitted into the said college; to be there maintained and educated, according to the provisions and in the manner, and under all, the regulations and restraints, directed or contained in the said will. And tile said corporation of the Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens of Philadelphia, was constituted the guardian of such orphan child.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">On the 27th May 1847, councils passed an ordinance, to provide for the organization and management of the Girard College for Orphans, which provided for the election by councils of a board of sixteen directors, who were to elect a president and secretary, and to submit a plan for the government and instruction of the college, to give notice of its opening, and to present estimates annually, in the month of December, for the ensuing year.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">By another ordinance, passed 16th September 1847, to provide for the opening of the Girard College for Orphans, the building committee were authorized to deliver possession of the college, as soon as completed, with the books, furniture, and apparatus, to the directors; who were to furnish the building, from the college fund, to give thirty days\u2019 notice of the intended opening, and who were to prepare and publish with the notice of the intended opening, <em>a form of application for the admission of orphans, </em>in which the regulations of the will of Stephen Girard, in regard to the birthplace, residence, and age of each applicant, his name, health, and condition as to relatives, and other particulars useful to be known, of each orphan, shall be carefully observed. The ordinance then designated the officers of the institution, who were to hold their offices during the pleasure of the directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">To the form of application for admission into the college, framed and published by the directors, are attached several questions, among which are the following ?\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-8\">2. When was he born ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-9\">3. Where was he born?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-10\">4. What was his father\u2019s name, and when and where did he die ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-11\">6. Is his mother living ? and if she is, what is her name, and where does she reside ? \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-13\">10. Are there any pecuniary means at the disposal of his mother, or other persons, for his maintenance and education ?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-14\">The building committee was dissolved, and the members of the select and common councils were constituted a standing committee of visitation of the Girard College for Orphans, and a recording <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>secretary was elected by the board of directors, who is removable at their pleasure, and whose duties are defined by the ordinances of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The first president of the college, after its organization, was the Honourable Joel Jones, the second and present one, Professor William II. Allen, both men of high moral and intellectual worth, and admirably fitted, by temper and disposition, for the administration of this noble charity.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">In every annual report of the directors of the college, previous to the present dispute, the original construction given to the will, recognising every fatherless child as an orphan, has been approved, and the whole institution has been conducted upon this principle. On January 1st 1851, Benjamin Gerhard, Esquire, in addressing \u201cthe board of directors and officers, and pupils of the college, with the councils of the city, and other city, county, and state officers, and numerous <em>parents </em>and friends of the children, and other citizens assembled in the chapel of the institution, said: \u2018 Who are orphans ?\u2019 This inquiry was answered by the counsel, consulted by the corporation, that such are orphans as have lost their fathers, and the opinion was at once acquiesced in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">On the 1st January 1850, the honourable Joseph R. Chandler, president of the board, in addressing an audience similarly composed, says: \u201c Another objection was, that boys long separated from maternal association and care, would lose a part of that home love, that filial affection which lies so close to the foundation of all good feeling, all pure benevolence. We have been enabled to keep the control of the conduct of these children, to direct it and them in all ways; and yet to keep up their association with mother, sister, brother, friend, so that at no time has the chain of affection been weakened by neglect, or been allowed to rust for want of use. Home love has been cultivated, and <em>filial </em>piety improved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">On the same occasion, President Allen said, \u201c The institution is no longer without precedents for guide, for it has established them for itself.\u201d After drawing a beautiful picture of one of its young inmates, expiring in the arms of his mother, he says, \u201c I am here, under that Being who is the God and Father of us all, to be a father to the fatherless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">We thus see by a simple narrative of the origin and progress of this great charity, that in the commencement, the only difference of opinion was, whether the term orphan did not include a motherless as well as a fatherless child. Upon full discussion and a deliberate examination, and after an unreserved communication with the first jurists in the United States, the settled construction adopted and continued for a quarter of a century, was, that it included <em>fatherless </em>but <em>not motherless </em>children. This was published to the world and sanctioned by the legislature, and it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>entered into the whole administration of the college, from its organization and opening, on the 1st January 1848, until the month of June 1858, a period of more than the tenth of a century, and under the immediate eye of <em>the grand committee of visitation, </em>the select and common councils of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">In the tenth annual report to the select and common councils of the city of Philadelphia, the directors say, \u201c The condition of all orphans, now within the institution, shows that at the time of their admission fifty-four of them had\u2019 neither father nor mother, and that the remaining two hundred and eighty-one had mothers. During the ten years elapsed, since the opening of the institution, one hundred and sixteen of the orphans received into it had neither father nor mother, and five hundred and forty-two had mothers. Of the applicants for admission during the same period, two hundred and seventy-three were without father or mother, and eleven hundred and ninetyrsix had mothers <em>only.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">This sacred trust was confided by Stephen Girard to the mayor, aldermen, and citizens of Philadelphia, who, by legislative enactment, have been succeeded by the City of Philadelphia, under and subject to the general provisions in the consolidation act. That all the estates and- incomes, now held in trust by the county (present' city) and each of the townships, districts, and other municipal corporations united by the act, shall be held by the City of Philadelphia, upon and for the same uses, trusts, limitations, charities, and conditions, as the same are now held by the said corporations respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">The directors of the Girard College are the creatures of an ordinance, and are merely the agents of the real trustee, the city, and yet, in June 1858, without (as far as it appears) taking the written opinion of any eminent professional man, of consulting the legislative authorities of the corporation, they make an entire change in the administration of this charity, and narrow its range of objects by excluding all children who are fatherless but not motherless, as recipients of Stephen Girard\u2019s bounty, by a new and restrictive meaning given to the word orphan. The effect of this new regulation is simply this, that the two hundred and eighty-one who were orphans on the 1st January 1858, are not-orphans in June 1858, and of course should be expelled from the college; and that the five hundred and forty-two children, admitted as orphans since the opening of the institution, were never entitled to its benefits, and have been maintained and educated by the funds of this charity in direct violation of the will and of the clear intention of the testator. It was a decision that all former trustees and directors, all former councils, all the eminent jurists in this city and in the Union, including Chancellor Kent and Judge Story, had entirely mistaken the will of Mr. Girard, and that it was proper, immediately upon this discovery being made, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>change at once the whole course of administration, and to exclude, for ever, a very large class of orphans from all participation in the benevolence of the great benefactor of his adopted city.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">In this state of affairs, it is perhaps proper to examine this question, to see if it is possible that so gross a mistake could have been committed by the very able, enlightened, and conscientious citizens who preceded the present direction of the college.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">William Penn was born in the parish called St. Catherine\u2019s, near the Tower of London, and just outside of the walls of the city of London, on the 14th day of October (then the 8th month), A. <em>j&gt;. </em>1644.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">By the customs of the city, if a freeman of London died intestate, possessed of personal property more than sufficient to pay his debts and funeral expenses, his residuary estate was distributable in the following manner. After deducting for the widow her apparel and the furniture of her bedchamber (which in London is called the widow\u2019s chamber), the property was divided into three parts, one of which belonged to the widow, another to the children, and the third to the intestate\u2019s administrator. This custom was the remains of the old common law, and this portion which fell to the administrator, or, as it is termed, the <em>dead man\u2019s part, </em>or <em>death\u2019s part, </em>he formerly appropriated to his own use till the stat. 1 Jac. II. cap. 17, declared, that the same should be subject to the statute of distributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">The share of a child is called the orphanage part or share, and the Lord Mayor\u2019s Court, or Court of Aldermen of the outer chamber, which is a court of record of law and equity, has jurisdiction of the distributiou of intestates\u2019 estates, and the custody and education of citizens\u2019 orphans.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">This branch of the equitable jurisdiction is exercised by the Mayor\u2019s Court, in the character of a Court of Orphans; which exercises a similar control over citizens\u2019 orphans to that which the Court of Chancery does over infants in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">By a law made at an Assembly, held at Philadelphia the 10th day of the 1st month (March) 1683, it was enacted, that the justices of each respective county court shall sit twice every year, to inspect and take care of the estates, usage, and employment of orphans, which shall be called the Orphans\u2019 Court, and sit the first third day of the week, in the first and eighth months yearly, that care may be taken for those that are not able to take care of themselves; which court, in the laws about testates\u2019 and intestates\u2019 estates, passed in 1693, is called the <em>Court of Orphans.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-12\">The proprietary, in his letter of the 16th of the 6th month, called August, 1683, thus describes this court, \u2014 \u201c and spring and fall, there is an <em>Orphans\u2019 Court </em>in each county, to inspect and regulate the affairs of <em>orphans </em>and <em>widows.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-13\">We perceive, therefore, that William Penn brought with him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>from the city of London, whose customs and usages were followed in many particulars by his favourite city of Philadelphia, a construction of the word orphan which included a fatherless child. This was the familiar understanding of the word in his days, as is proved by King James\u2019s translation of the Bible, and by the writings of Shakspeare, which immediately preceded his birth, and which together form an ample and enduring record of pure and undefiled English.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">In the sixth edition of Jacob\u2019s Law Dictionary, published in 1750, \u201c orphan (orphanus) is a fatherless child;\u201d and the same definition is given in Tomlin\u2019s Law Dictionary, 4th London edition by Granger, published in 1835; and in Wharton\u2019s Law Lexicon, published in London in October 1847, and republished at Harrisburg in 1848, in the New Library of Law and Equity, edited by Mr. Troubat and Chief Justice Lewis and Judge McOandless, it is thus defined: \u201c Orphan, a fatherless child or minor, or one deprived of both father and mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">In the case of Powell <em>v. </em>The Attorney-general and Robert Pendleton, 3 <em>Merivale </em>48, decided July 24th 1817, by Sir William Grant, Master of .the Rolls, there was a bequest of the residue of his estate, by Joseph Pendleton, \u201c to the widows and children of seamep belonging to the town of Liverpool.\u201d Upon a reference to the master, he reported among other charities, one under the will of Elizabeth Cain, dated the 8th of June 1778, whereby she directed the residue of her estate to be continued at interest, or placed out on government securities, at the discretion of her executors, and after their death, of the rectors of Liverpool, for the time being, the interest to be paid, and distributed into and among such <em>poor sailors\u2019 widows and orphans, inhabitants </em>of Liverpool, as should in their judgment be deserving objects of charity.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The master of the rolls held, that it was a valid bequest, and that the words were sufliciently descriptive of the last of the charities, mentioned in the master\u2019s report, and a decree was made accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">The subject of the orphanage share, and its distribution under the customs of London, are fully discussed by Yice-Chancellor Shadwell, in Bruin <em>v. </em>Knott, 12 <em>Simons </em>436.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">The counsel for the appellee has collected numerous instances in which the word orphan is the equivalent of fatherless child, as in the book of Lamentations, ch. 5, verse 3, \u201c we are orphans and fatherless, and our mothers are as widows.\u201d In the translation of the Septuagint version by Charles Thomson, published in Philadelphia in 1808, the verse is rendered, \u201c we are become orphans, our father is no more; our mothers are like widows.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">In the Psalter, in the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England, psalm lxviii, v. 5, reads, \u201c he is a father of the father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>less, and defendeth the cause of the <em>widows; </em>even God in his holy-habitation.\u201d In the metrical version of the psalms in the same book the verse is rendered,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-5\">\u201c 5. Him from his empire of the skies,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-6\">To this low world compassion draws ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-7\">The <em>orphan\u2019s </em>claim to patronize,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-8\">And judge the injured widow\u2019s cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">See also in the Psalter, Psalm lxxxii., v. 3, and in the metrical version 2 and 3, Psalm cix., v. 8 and 11, and in the metrical version by Brady and Tate, v. 9,10, and 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">In the English Bible, Psalm x., v. 18, and in the metrical version of the Psalms by Francis Rous used in the Scottish Presbyterian church, fatherless and orphan are used as <em>synonymous; </em>as also in Psalm cxl., v. 9, \u201cthe Lord preserveth the strangers, he relieveth the fatherless and <em>widow; </em>but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down,\u201d which is rendered in the metrical version,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-11\">\u201c The stranger\u2019s shield, the widow\u2019s stay,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-12\">The <em>orphan\u2019s </em>help is he ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-13\">But yet by him the wicked\u2019s way Turn\u2019d upside down shall be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-14\">In the Litany in the Book of Common Prayer, \u201c that it may please thee to defend and provide for the fatherless children and widows, and all that are desolate and oppressed,\u201d which is rendered in a Latin version, published in London, in 1744, \u201c <em>ut orphanis omnibus et viduis, desolatis et oppressis, prospicere digneris.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-15\">The word is originally Greek, and in Liddell and Scott\u2019s Greek Lexicon, it is translated \u201c orphaned, without parents, fatherless,\u201d and in the same work, it is said, at Athens, the <em>orphanophulaJces </em>were guardians of orphans, who had lost their fathers in war. In Ainsworth\u2019s Quarto Latin Dictionary, published in London, in 1761, an orphan is translated <em>\u201cparentibus vel altero parentum orbatus.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-16\">In the first American, from the eleventh London edition of Dr. Johnson\u2019s Quarto Dictionary, published in Philadelphia, in 1819, it is defined, after giving the Greek and French words, \u201c a child who has lost father, or mother, or both,\u201d exemplified by quotations from Spenser, Shakspeare, Sandys, Waller, Dryden, and Nelson.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-17\">In Allison\u2019s Dictionary, published in 1813, at Burlington, for M. Thomas and others, the same definition is given, and Webster\u2019s definition is substantially the same. In the American edition of Rees\u2019s Cyclopedia, published by S. F. Bradford, Murray Fairman &amp; Co., orphan is one that is fatherless, or that has neither father or mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-18\">One or two eases have been cited to support the proposition that an orphan is one bereft of parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>By the third section of the Act of 3d April 1804, directing the mode of selling unseated lands for taxes, minors are allowed five years, after the disability is removed, to bring their action for the recovery of the lands. By the 4th section of the Act of 13th March 1815, to amend the same, the words orphan or orphans are used instead of minor. By the 20th section of the Act of 12th April 1842, and the 30th section of the Act of 25th April 1850 <em>(Dunlop, </em>pages 866 &amp; 1098), the words orphan or orphans, in the Act of 1815, shall be construed- to mean minor or minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">In the case of Sidle <em>v. </em>Walters, 5 <em>Watts </em>389, the word orphan, in the Act of 1815, is considered by Judge Rogers as the equivalent of minor. In Cooper <em>v. </em>Brockway, 8 <em>Watts </em>162, Judge Huston held, that land held by a father in trust for an infant child was not within the exception; and in Downing <em>v. </em>Shoenberger, 9 <em>Watts </em>298, published in 1841, Judge Huston gave the definition <em>\u201c </em>an orphan is one bereft of parents, a minor is one under twenty-one years of age,\u201d which was entirely extrajudicial and inapplicable to the case before him, as the father and mother of the infant were both living.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The current, therefore, of English, American, and French authority, being clearly in favour of the construction of the word orphan in the will of Stephen Girard, originally adopted and consistently pursued, we are necessarily brought to the conclusion that a fatherless child is an orphan, and if born within the limits of the city of Philadelphia, as laid out by William Penn, and existing at the death of the testator, comes within the first preference which he has chose to declare in relation to the objects of his bounty: Blenon\u2019s Estate, 1 <em>Brightly\u2019s Reports </em>338; Plymouth Township <em>v. </em>Jackson Township, 3 <em>Harris </em>44; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>The Erie and North-East Railroad Company, 3 <em>Casey </em>339.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">We have discussed this question at great length, but we have deemed it essential to the future management of this most munificent charity founded by a philanthropic citizen, that it should be settled now and for all time to come.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The decree is affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
