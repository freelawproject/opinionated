That the notes endorsed by Rheem for Klinefelter were given for the purchase, from James Dunlap, of one half of a steam saw-mill, which had been erected by Dunlap and Klinefelter. That to secure these endorsements, Rheem took the conveyance of the one-half of the mill to himself; and at the same time, took from Klinefelter a bond and warrant of attorney to confess judgment in the sum of $1000, with a stay of execution for three months. That on the same day, Klinefelter, and Rheem, as his surety, executed a bond to James Dunlap, in $700, conditioned that they would pay the debts of the late firm, and indemnify and save harmless the said James Dunlap, And that on the 20th May 1857, Rheem issued a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>fieri facias </em>on his judgment for $1000, under which the sheriff levied on all the property of Klinefelter, including the spoke-machine, all which was purchased by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-6\">In the course of the trial, the court admitted evidence on the part of the defendant, tending to prove that the machine sold to Klinefelter was a violation of the Blanchard patent; but subsequently instructed the jury to disregard this evidence as irrelevant to the issue trying.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-7\">The court below (Graham, P. J.) delivered the following charge to the jury: \u2014 \u201c This is an action brought by the plaintiffs against Jacob Rheem to recover damages for a fraud, which they allege was practised upon them under the following circumstances. A man named David Klinefelter was conducting the business of a steam saw-mill near Mount Rock, in this county. He had leased a lot of about an acre from the Messrs. Trego, on which he had erected his steam saw-mill; and while engaged in carrying on his business, applied to the plaintiffs to purchase from them a machine for making carriage spokes, to be used at his mill. Before the purchase was made, Klinefelter wrote to plaintiffs, requesting them to forward the machine, and in reference to his ability to pay, forwarded to them a letter from Jacob Rheem, dated 15th of November, 1856. This letter of Mr. Rheem\u2019s is the subject of complaint, and the plaintiffs allege was a fraud practised upon them, by which they were induced to give credit to Klinefelter, who was unable to pay, and they thus lost the value of the property sold to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-8\">\u201c The gist of this action is fraud and deceit. To sustain it, there must be fraud accompanied with damage; and where both fraud and damage to the person on whom it was practised is shown, the action of deceit may be sustained. A naked lie will not sustain a suit of this nature ; for a person may honestly make a statement upon incorrect information, which he believes to be true, although it may in fact be untrue. But if such falsehood is uttered with a knowledge of its falsity, <em>mali animo </em>\u2014 with an evil mind, a dishonest purpose, this is a deceit for which the party will be held responsible, so far as it may occasion damage or loss to the party to whom it is made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-9\">\u201c The letter upon which the plaintiffs allege they gave Klinefelter credit, is as follows(The court here read the letter to the jury.) \u201c As to the assertion that Rheem had considerable dealings with Klinefelter, and found him industrious and honest, it appears to be fully sustained by the evidence; for dealings between these parties, both before and after this transaction, are shown; and witnesses have been called to show that Klinefelter was a man of remarkable industry, and that his honesty was not suspected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-10\">\u201cMr. Rheem further states, that he had endorsed for Klinefelter to the amount of $800, and would do so again whenever he wanted, and would trust him to the amount of $500 or $600. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>The plaintiffs complain, that in this there was a suppression of the truth, for the purpose of obtaining the credit for Klinefelter; that at the time he endorsed Klinefelter\u2019s paper for $800, he had a conveyance of one-half his property, and a judgment of $1000, as security for his endorsement, and that these facts were not stated in his letter. If these facts were withheld through improper motives, and to obtain a credit for an individual he did not consider worthy of such credit, this would be practising a deceit for which defendant would be responsible. On the contrary, if the fact of the security he held for his endorsement was not withheld through dishonest or impure motives, and if he honestly believed at the time he wrote to plaintiffs that Klinefelter was worthy of credit, and would have given him credit as he there states, then there is no such fraud or deceit as would subject him to damages. Did Jacob Rheem in this transaction act the part of an honest, moral man ? if he did, the law will not punish <em>him; </em>if he did not, but acted dishonestly and immorally, and thus practised a deceit upon plaintiffs, he is responsible to plaintiffs for the deceit thus practised.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-6\">The defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to instruct the jury as follows: \u2014 \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-7\">1. If the jury believe that, on the 15th of November 1856, when Jacob Rheem made the recommendation in writing of David Klinefelter to the plaintiffs, he then had endorsed the three or four notes to the amount of $800, or more, given to James Dunlap, and withheld and suppressed the fact that, to induce him to make these endorsements, he had taken a conveyance of one-half of Klinefelter\u2019s property, and had taken a judgment from him for $1000, upon which he could issue execution within three months, this was a suppression of the truth, and amounted to a falsehood, and if it induced the plaintiffs to trust Klinefelter and they thereby lost their money \u2014 the defendant is liable to the consequences of such loss in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-8\">Answer. \u2014 \u201c The facts recited in this point would be a suppression of the truth, and equivalent to a falsehood. But if this suppression of the truth was inadvertently made, and not with intention to deceive the plaintiffs, such omission to state the whole truth would not necessarily make Rheem liable in this case; but if such omission was deceitfully made to procure a credit Rheem did not honestly consider Klinefelter worthy of, then he would be responsible.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-9\">2. If the jury believe that Jacob Rheem wrote the recommendation of David Klinefelter of the 15th of November 1856, and at the time he held a conveyance of the one-half of all Klinefelter\u2019s property, and held a judgment against Klinefelter for $1000, all of which he had taken as an indemnity for endorsing the notes for him mentioned in that communication of the 15th of November 1856, and he withheld and suppressed the fact that he had taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>such securities for his endorsement, he thereby asserted a falsehood, \u2014 and if his assertion, as made, induced the plaintiffs to part with their property, which they have thereby lost, although he may have had <em>alone </em>as his intention <em>to benefit the .said David </em>Klinefelter, he is liable in damages to the plaintiffs to indemnify them for their loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-6\">Answer. \u2014 \u201cWe have said that the suppression of the truth may be equivalent to the assertion of a falsehood, and if suppressed with intent to deceive and perpetrate a fraud, it would make Rheem responsible, even if his only design was to benefit Klinefelter. But if the letter was honestly written, and Rheem really believed all that he stated was true, and that Klinefelter was worthy of the credit he asked, and would have given him credit to that amount himself \u2014 then he is not guilty of such fraud and deceit as would render him responsible in damages.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-7\">To this charge the defendant excepted ; and a verdict and judgment having been rendered for the plaintiffs for $627.50, he removed the cause to this court, and here assigned for error: 1. The admission in evidence of the proof given of plaintiffs\u2019 incorporation. 2. The admission in evidence of the correspondence mentioned in the bill of exceptions. 3. The answers to the points presented on the trial. 4. The withdrawal from the jury of the evidence in reference to the Blanchard patent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-8\"><em>Williamson, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4f\">There was no competent evidence that the plaintiffs are a corporation: <em>Ang. &amp; Ames on Corp. </em>338; 2 <em>Cow. </em>778; 8 <em>Johns. </em>378; 19 <em>Id. </em>300, 302-3.

The want of an act of incorporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>must be pleaded in abatement, or in bar specially: Zion Church <em>v. </em>The St. Peter\u2019s Church, 5 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>215. This is the proper rule, and is the settled practice of the Supreme Court of the United States; Conard <em>v. </em>Atlantic Insurance Company, 1 <em>Peters </em>450; Society for Preaching the Gospel <em>v. </em>Town of Pawlet, 4 <em>Peters </em>480; who have also decided, that the question of the citizenship of the plaintiff can only be raised by a plea to the jurisdiction : Sheppard <em>v. </em>Graves, 14 <em>Howard </em>505, 512. This disposes of the first error assigned, as the plaintiffs were not required, under the pleadings, to exhibit or prove their act of incorporation, orcharter under the laws of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The second and third errors may be considered together, consisting of the objections to the admission of testimony to prove the deceit, and of the answers of the court to the points of the plaintiffs in relation to this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The evidence offered and admitted, consisted of a letter of David Klinefelter, dated Mount Rock, November 15, 1856, upon the subject of his desiring to purchase a machine, and replying to a letter on the same subject, in which the writer said he had no acquaintance with him, and that he had no knowledge about his ability to pay for it. The postscript was in these words: \u201c P. S.\u2014 Please send the machine, so that it can be put up at the same time as the other machine, to save expenses. You will find Mr. Rheem\u2019s reference on the other side of this\u201d \u2014 which is as follows:\u2014 \u201c I am acquainted with Mr. Klinefelter, and have had, and still have considerable dealings with him, and find him industrious and honest. I have endorsed for him to the amount of $800, and would do so again whenever he wants. I would trust him any amount \u2014 a machine or anything else, the amount of $500 or $600. This I would, and have no fear ^s to the pay. You can do as you please, as I do believe he will pay anything he contracts for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Also, of a letter to Klinefelter, from the president of the company, dated Naugatuck, November 19, 1856, acknowledging the receipt of the above letter of the 15th, and also another of the 17th, and requesting him to come on and see their machines operate. \u201cFrom their contents,\u201d says the president, \u201cwe are inclined to think you are all right as to ability to pay.\u201d \u201cProvided you can\u2019t come, if you will get the principal of the Carlisle Seminary to certify that the gentleman to whom you refer is responsible (viz. Mr. Rheem), we will forward the machines forthwith.\u201d Upon this was an endorsement by the principal of the seminary : \u201c As .far as my acquaintance with Mr. Rheem extends, he is a responsible person. Chas. Clark.\u201d And then by Mr, Rheem: \u2014 \u201c Mr. Clark forgot to state that I am a stockholder in the erection of his academy to a considerable extent. The cars just off, or I would say more. J. Rheem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">These letters were to be followed, and were followed with evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>denees that a machine was forwarded on the 29th November 1856, and that David Klinefelter gave his notes for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">This evidence was entirely pertinent, and was properly admitted, for it proved the origin. of the transaction, the inquiries of the plaintiffs about the ability of Klinefelter to pay, and the assertion by Rheem of his responsibility, and that Klinefelter would pay anything he contracted for. In these days of cheap postage, the address is often not on the letter, but on the envelope; but there can be no doubt that the letter of the 15th November, backed by Rheem, was addressed to the president of the company, whose letter of the 19th, in reply, and asking for a certificate of the principal of the Carlisle Seminary, that Mr. Rheem, to whom Klinefelter refers, is responsible, contains on it, not only Mr. Clark\u2019s certificate, but another, backed by Rheem, to show that he is what Mr. Clark represents him to be. This letter, with the endorsements, was, no doubt, returned to the president as the answer to his inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">It is, therefore, clear that Klinefelter bought with a full knowledge of what he was purchasing \u2014 and the sale was made to him on the faith of Rheem\u2019s assertion of his ability to pay. If these representations were true, and if they disclosed all the material facts, then Rheem incurred no liability of any kind; but if he, knowingly falsified, or wilfully suppressed the truth, with a view of giving Klinefelter a credit to which he was not entitled, then he was responsible to the plaintiffs for the damage sustained by them in consequence of his false representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The evidence showed a clear suppression of material facts by Rheem, such as that when he endorsed Klinefelter\u2019s paper for $800, he had a conveyance of one-half of his property and a judgment of $1000 as security for his endorsement. If this had been stated in his letter, the company never would have sold this machine to Klinefelter. The question whether these facts were withheld through improper motives, and to obtain a credit for an individual he did not consider worthy of such credit, or whether they were not withheld through dishonest or impure motives, and that he honestly believed, at the time, that Klinefelter was worthy of credit, and would have given him credit, as he stated, was fairly put to the jury, by the court, with the instruction, that in the first case put, the defendant would be responsible for practising such a deceit, and in the second, or alternative case, there would be no such fraud or deceit as would subject him to damages. The same idea pervades the answers to the plaintiff\u2019s points; and we can perceive no error in the answers themselves, or in the mode in which the case was left to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">It was also in evidence, that there were other judgments against Klinefelter at the time of this transaction, besides Rheem\u2019s judgment, and that executions on one of these judgments, and on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Rheem\u2019s judgment, were issued in 1857, and property sold under them. The judgment in favour of Jacob Rheem was entered on the 16th August 1836. On the 10th March 1857, a <em>fi. fa. </em>was issued and stayed; and on the 9th May 1857, an alias <em>fi. fa., </em>on which a sale of Klinefelter\u2019s personal property took place on the 20th June 1857, and this spoke-machine was sold to Jacob Rheem, the plaintiff, for $230; three items sold, the spoke-machine, engine, and boiler, produced $730 \u2014 which, with other moneys, were appropriated to Rheem\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The court admitted evidence, showing that this machine was an infringement of another patent, but instructed the jury to discard from their consideration this evidence, as irrelevant to the issue trying \u2014 and this is assigned for error. \u25a0 Klinefelter received and kept the machine, and never complained of this alleged defect, or attempted to set it up as a defence; and the defendant purchased it at the sheriff\u2019s sale of Klinefelter\u2019s property, and became the owner of it. Neither Klinefelter nor Rheem ever offered to return the spoke-machine, but both retained it as a thing of value.' Under these circumstances, this evidence formed no defence in this suit, and was, therefore, properly withdrawn from the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
