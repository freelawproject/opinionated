On appeal, Love argues that in resentencing him, the district court (1) failed to resolve disputed facts and (2) imposed an unreasonable sentence. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-27\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AUI\">A. Offense</p>\n<p id=\"b953-28\">Love pled guilty to one count of transportation of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(l). Love contacted via the internet an undercover police officer posing as a 15-year-old boy using the screen name \u201cTyboy88\u201d and sent the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>undercover police officer emails containing child pornography. Over the course of a month, Love sent the undercover officer emails containing pictures of teenage males engaged in anal intercourse, nude teenage males, prepubescent females displaying their genitals in a lascivious manner, prepubescent females engaging in vaginal and anal intercourse with adult males and prepubescent females performing oral intercourse on adult males.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">When FBI Agent James Hendricks visited Love at his home, Love admitted to collecting child pornography, some depicting children as young as two years old. He also admitted communicating with and sending images to Tyboy88, whom he thought was fifteen years old. When Agent Hendricks asked Love if Tyboy88 had told him how old he was, Love responded, \u201cHe told me he was fifteen.\u201d A subsequent search of Love\u2019s computer revealed approximately 650 images of adult and child pornography. The FBI confirmed that some of these images depicted victims of child sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">B. First Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) assigned Love a base offense level of 17 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(a) (2003). The PSI recommended four enhancements: (1) a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(1) because the material involved a prepubescent minor or a minor under the age of 12; (2) a five-level enhancement under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2)(C) because the offense involved distribution to a person Love thought was a minor; (3) a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3) because the offense involved material portraying sadistic or masochistic imagery; and (4) a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(5) for use of a computer. After a three-level reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility, the PSI calculated a total offense level of 27. With a criminal history category 1, the PSI recommended a guideline range of 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">Love objected to the five-level enhancement for distribution to a person Love thought was a minor because he did not believe the undercover officer was a minor. The probation officer responded that the enhancement should apply, noting that Love\u2019s claim disputed information provided by Agent Hendricks that Love had stated that he thought that Tyboy88 was a 15-year-old boy. The probation officer also cited <em>United States v. Morton, </em>364 F.3d 1300 (11th Cir.2004), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>543 U.S. 1136, 125 S.Ct. 1338,161 L.Ed.2d 95, <em>opinion reinstated, </em>144 Fed. Appx. 804 (11th Cir.). <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 785, 163 L.Ed.2d 608 (2005), for the proposition that an undercover officer posing as a minor is considered a minor for purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines. Prior to sentencing, Love also objected to the enhancements under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The district court sentenced Love to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment, the low end of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">Love appealed to this Court, raising his <em>Blakely </em>claim and also arguing that the district court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 by failing to resolve the factual dispute regarding his belief that Tyboy88 was a minor. On May 6, 2005, we vacated Love\u2019s 70-month sentence and remanded for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), but did not address Love\u2019s Rule 32 argument. <em>See United States v. Love, </em>136 Fed. Appx. 215 (11th Cir.2005) (unpublished). In our prior opinion, this Court stated, \u2018We need not reach Love\u2019s Rule 32 contentions, as his preserved <em>Blakely </em>(now <em>Booker </em>) claim requires that we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>C. Resentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">At resentencing, Love reiterated his previous objection to the PSI\u2019s factual contention that Love thought Tyboy88 was a minor and the corresponding recommended five-level enhancement under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(2)(C). The government cited <em>Morton </em>and argued that, when a defendant is dealing with an undercover officer who represents himself to be a minor and the defendant does not refrain from further contact, the defendant accepts the representation that the officer is a minor. The district court, after considering the objections and the evidence, adopted the position of the probation officer in the PSI Addendum and ordered that the Addendum be attached to the statement of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">When defense counsel again pressed the issue regarding Love\u2019s knowledge of Tyboy88\u2019s age, the district court expressed scepticism for Love\u2019s claim and stated that Love would need some evidence other than his own self-serving statement, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIS\">Well, you know, Mr. Walker, I\u2019m trying to take your argument seriously, but when an undercover agent tells someone like your client, I\u2019m 15 years old, or I\u2019m 14 years old, and then the defendant continues on with that conduct and doesn\u2019t cut off that conduct, other than every defendant at any time coming in Court and saying, well, I never actually saw the person, Judge, but in my mind I wasn\u2019t dealing with a minor. I mean, it\u2019s going to require some proof other than just the defendant saying, well, in my mind I wasn\u2019t dealing with a minor; particularly when you\u2019ve got a case like this where the depictions and the images all involve minors. I mean, anybody that looks at them knows that there are minors involved. So all of these images that he\u2019s got, this six, or seven or 800, or however many of them that are out there, are all minors; minor boys, minor girls. And then he\u2019s talking on the internet with these undercover officers, but yet he wants to say, I had no idea I was dealing with a minor. In my mind I wasn\u2019t dealing with a minor. In his mind, if he wasn\u2019t dealing with a minor, why wasn\u2019t this adult pornography?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">The district court then noted that it struggled with this type of case, where the defendant has no prior criminal history, was employed, was otherwise a responsible citizen, had made efforts to rehabilitate and was not a trafficker. The court also noted that it had heard the evidence presented, had reviewed the PSI and had considered the parties\u2019 arguments. The district court then sentenced Love to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment, stating that it found \u201cno reason to depart from the sentence called for by application of the advisory sentencing guidelines inasmuch as the facts as found are the kind contemplated by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AyI\">A. Rule 32</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">Love asserts that the district court failed to resolve a factual dispute in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d). He contends that the district court merely adopted the PSI\u2019s findings, which was insufficient to satisfy Rule 32.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">When any portion of the PSI is disputed, Rule 32 requires the sentencing court to \u201crule on the dispute or determine that a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect the sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in sentencing.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B). We agree with Love that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>mere adoption of the PSI does not satisfy the district court\u2019s obligation under Rule 32 to resolve objections raised at sentencing. <em>United States v. Khawaja, </em>118 F.3d 1454, 1460 (11th Cir.1997) (citing <em>United States v. Page, </em>69 F.3d 482, 493-94 (11th Cir.1995), which noted that findings in a PSI that have not considered the parties\u2019 objections may be unreliable).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">However, the record shows that the district court did rule on Love\u2019s objection to the PSI\u2019s factual allegation that Love thought Tyboy88 was a minor. Contrary to Love\u2019s assertion, the district court did not adopt the PSI. Rather, the district court adopted the probation officer\u2019s response to Love\u2019s objection, contained in the PSI Addendum. In addition, the district court discussed on the record Love\u2019s contention that he did not know Tyboy88 was a minor, expressing scepticism about this claim and concluding that Love\u2019s self-serving statement was insufficient. Accordingly, the district court adequately resolved the disputed portion of the PSI against the defendant and satisfied its obligations under Rule 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">B. <em>Booker </em>Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">On appeal, Love argues that his 70-month sentence on remand is unreasonable under <em>Booker. </em>After <em>Booker, </em>a district court, in determining a reasonable sentence, must consider the correctly calculated sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at -, 125 S.Ct. at 764-66; <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence, in its entirety, for unreasonableness in light of the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">After review, we conclude that nothing in the record shows that Love\u2019s 70-month sentence is unreasonable. First, the district court imposed a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range and almost one-third the length of the fifteen-year statutory maximum sentence. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (explaining that, although we have declined to hold that a sentence within the guidelines range is <em>per se </em>reasonable, ordinarily we expect such a sentence to be reasonable); <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246 (comparing, as one indication of reasonableness, the actual prison term imposed to the statutory maximum). The court also considered the following facts in mitigation: Love (1) had no prior criminal history, (2) was gainfully employed and otherwise a responsible citizen, (3) had made efforts to rehabilitate, and (4) was only a viewer and transmitter, and not a trafficker, in child pornography. In other words, the district court considered the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant. Nonetheless, the district court concluded that these factors did not warrant imposing a sentence below that contemplated by the advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">Love points to comments made by the district court during Love\u2019s <em>initial </em>sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>fencing wherein the district court expressed a desire to impose a lower sentence and stated that a 70-month sentence was too severe given that Love was only a viewer of child pornography and had no physical contact with children. These comments are insufficient to carry Love\u2019s burden to demonstrate that his post-remand sentence is unreasonable. While those comments aided Love in obtaining a <em>Booker </em>remand for the district court to sentence Love under advisory sentencing guidelines, those comments did not bind the district court to give a lesser sentence. Indeed, at resentencing, the district court again expressly considered the fact that Love was only a viewer and transmitter of child pornography and concluded that these facts were insufficient to warrant imposing a sentence below the advisory guidelines range. We cannot say that the district court\u2019s final determination on this point was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">For all these reasons, we affirm Love\u2019s 70-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b955-7\">. We review a district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Grant, </em>397 F.3d 1330, 1332 (11fth Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b956-7\">. \"The factors in \u00a7 3553(a) include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment; (4) the need to protect the public; and (5) the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1328-29 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). \"[Njothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329. Instead, indications in the record that the district court considered facts and circumstances falling within \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factors will suffice. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786; <em>Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329-30.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
