For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-21\">Lofton\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising the following potential issues: (1) whether the district court erred in denying Lofton\u2019s pretrial motion for a hearing pursuant to <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978); (2) whether the district court erred in denying Lofton\u2019s motion to suppress; (3) whether the magistrate judge conducted a thorough colloquy pursuant to Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; and (4) whether the district court erred in assigning Lofton a base offense level of 34 based on its finding that Lofton possessed the firearm during the commission of a controlled substance offense pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) (2002). Lofton filed a pro se supplemental brief, raising additional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">As to counsel\u2019s first issue, under <em>Franks, </em>a defendant is entitled to a hearing to challenge a facially sufficient affidavit only when (1) the defendant makes \u201callegations of deliberate falsehood or of reckless disregard for the truth\u201d and supports his allegations with a detailed offer of proof including affidavits and/or sworn statements, and (2) the affidavit without the allegedly false statements is insufficient to show probable cause. <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 171-72, 98 S.Ct. 2674; <em>see also United States v. Colkley, </em>899 F.2d 297, 300-03 (4th Cir.1990) (discussing scope of <em>Franks). </em>Specifically, the defendant must make a \u201csubstantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit.\u201d <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674. Based on our review of the record, we find that Lofton failed to make such a showing and therefore uphold the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for an evidentiary hearing under <em>Franks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Counsel next questions whether the district court erred in denying Lofton\u2019s motion to suppress. We review the legal conclusions underlying the denial of a motion to suppress de novo and review factual findings for clear error. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). Reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, <em>see United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998), we find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of the motion. Our review of the record reveals that the district court correctly upheld the officers\u2019 entry into Lofton\u2019s residence and found that the firearms were properly seized pursuant to the plain view doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">Counsel\u2019s third issue questions whether the magistrate judge conducted a thorough Rule 11 colloquy. A plea is presumed to be final and binding if the Rule 11 hearing is adequate. <em>United States v. Puckett, </em>61 F.3d 1092, 1099 (4th Cir.1995). We have thoroughly reviewed the transcript of Lofton\u2019s plea hearing and conclude that the magistrate judge conducted a thorough Rule 11 colloquy in accordance with the mandates of the rule. Accordingly, Lofton cannot show that his plea was unknowing or involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">Before turning to counsel\u2019s remaining sentencing issue, we will consider the larger issue of whether Lofton\u2019s sentence was imposed in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We have reviewed Lofton\u2019s sentence for plain error in light of <em>Booker, </em>and find that any error in the district court\u2019s designation of Lofton as a career offender, its imposition of a four-level enhancement pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> or its treatment of the guidelines as mandatory did not affect Lofton\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 351-54 (4th Cir. 2005) (holding that the armed career crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>nal designation based on prior convictions does not violate <em>Booker); United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 225 (4th Cir.2005) (requiring an appellant to demonstrate actual prejudice from the application of the mandatory guideline scheme on plain error review).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">As for the remaining <em>Anders </em>issue, counsel argues that the district court erred in ruling that Lofton possessed the firearms in connection with a controlled substance offense pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A). This finding subjected Lofton to an offense level of 34, rather than an offense level of 33. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3). Although counsel does not raise this issue in the <em>Booker </em>context, we note that this finding was based on facts that were not admitted by Lofton nor proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We discern no error under <em>Booker, </em>however. Absent the one-level increase for possessing the firearms in connection with a controlled substance offense, Lofton\u2019s maximum offense level, based on facts to which he admitted, would have been 33. An offense level of 33 with a criminal history category of VI results in a guideline range of 235-293 months. Because Lofton\u2019s 188-month sentence does not exceed the maximum sentence authorized by the facts he admitted, we find there was no Sixth Amendment violation. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We have also reviewed the issues raised in Lofton\u2019s pro se supplemental brief and find them without merit. Accordingly, we affirm Lofton\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny Lofton\u2019s \u201cMotion to Correct Error of Factual and Actual Innocence.\u201d This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b244-6\"> We find that this enhancement did not impact the total offense level because the district court found Lofton to be a career offender. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 523-24 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
