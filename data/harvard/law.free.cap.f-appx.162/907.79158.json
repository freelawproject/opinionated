After review, we vacate Stevenson\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-22\">In a prior appeal, this Court affirmed the district court\u2019s criminal history calculation and concluded that there was no constitutional violation under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Stevenson, </em>131 Fed.Appx. 248 (11th Cir. 2005) (unpublished). However, in the pri- or appeal, this Court also found statutory <em>Booker </em>error and thus vacated Stevenson\u2019s sentence and remanded for resentencing in light of <em>Booker. </em>On remand, the district court resentenced Stevenson to the same 57-month sentence without a hearing or an opportunity for Stevenson to allocute.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-23\">Because Stevenson\u2019s original sentence was vacated in its entirety, the district court erred by not granting him a hearing and affording him the opportunity to allocute at resentencing. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>11 F.3d 149, 151 (11th Cir.1994) (holding that a defendant\u2019s rights, under Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 32 and 43, to be present at sentencing and to allocute \u201cextends to sentencing when the original sentencing package is vacated in its entirety on appeal and a case is remanded for resentencing\u201d); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>923 F.2d 1494, 1496 (11th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>1991) (holding that, when a sentencing \u201cpackage\u201d has been vacated on appeal, the defendant\u2019s presence at a hearing is necessary). Additionally, although Stevenson\u2019s guidelines range was correctly calculated, the district court must still have a hearing to consult the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) as now required by <em>Booker </em>under an advisory guidelines system. We therefore vacate Stevenson\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court so that the district court may hold a hearing, consult the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) as required by <em>Booker </em>and provide Stevenson the opportunity to address the court prior to imposing a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
