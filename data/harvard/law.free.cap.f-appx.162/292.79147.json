Estrada\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>raised claims not only under Rule 60(b)(3) and (6), but also under the court\u2019s inherent equitable powers to respond to a fraud on the court. The district court ruled that Estrada\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was essentially a second or successive petition for habeas corpus relief, which it could not consider unless this court authorized its filing. The district court also determined that Estrada\u2019s allegations of fraud did not meet the requirements of fraud on the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">A COA may be issued only if Estrada has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. 28 U.S.C \u00a7 2253(c). To the extent that Estrada raised an equitable claim in district court, however, he does not need a COA to proceed on appeal. <em>See Fierro v. Johnson, </em>197 F.3d 147,150 (5th Cir.1999). He does, however, need leave to proceed IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Estrada argues that the Respondent committed a fraud on the court when he alleged in his brief that Estrada had signed a judicial confession to aggravated sexual assault, when the state court record introduced by the Respondent shows that Estrada had not signed it. The district court determined that the Respondent\u2019s misstatement did not amount to fraud on the court. \u201cTo establish fraud on the court, it is necessary to show an unconscionable plan or scheme which is designed to improperly influence the court in its discretion.\u201d <em>Fierro, </em>197 F.3d at 154. Assuming, without deciding, that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b) has not foreclosed the use of the courts\u2019 inherent powers to vacate prior judgments for fraud on the federal courts, Estrada has failed to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the Respondent perpetrated a fraud on the courts. <em>See Kinnear-Weed Corp. v. Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co., </em>441 F.2d 631, 636 (5th Cir.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">To the extent that Estrada\u2019s motion to vacate judgment is construed as sounding under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), his motion for a COA is DENIED. <em>See Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>\u2014U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2647-48, 2651, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). To the extent that Estrada argues that he is entitled to equitable relief from a fraudulently obtained judgment, his motion for a COA is DENIED AS UNNECESSARY. <em>See Fierro v. Johnson, </em>197 F.3d 147, 150 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">Estrada also moves for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. The district court denied his IFP motion, certifying under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) and Feb. R.App. P. 24(a)(3) that Estrada\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith. We construe his motion to proceed IFP on appeal as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification decision. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). We limit our inquiry \u201cto whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Estrada\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s equitable ruling does not involve legal points arguable on their merits. Accordingly, we DENY IFP status and DISMISS Estrada\u2019s appeal as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">COA DENIED AS TO FED. R. CIV. P. 60(b) CLAIMS; COA DENIED AS UNNECESSARY AS TO EQUITABLE CLAIMS; IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
