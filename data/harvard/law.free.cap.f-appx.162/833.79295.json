Phoenician brought its action under the Warsaw Convention and claimed damages resulting from Federal Express\u2019s delay and delivery of goods. On November 28, 2001, a panel of our court affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of Phoenician\u2019s amended complaint against Federal Express but concluded that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing Phoenician\u2019s amended complaint without first allowing Phoenician leave to amend to restate its claims. <em>Phoenician Imports, Inc. v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>No. 01-12417 (11th Cir. Nov. 28, 2001) (\u201cPhoenician I\u201d). After Phoenician amended its complaint, the case was tried to a jury and a judgment was entered on the jury\u2019s verdict against Federal Express. We affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment entered on the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Phoenician Imports, Inc. v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>No. 04-14767 (11th Cir. June 14, 2005) (\u201cPhoenician II\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-20\">In the present appeal, Federal Express appeals the judgment of the district court adopting a report and recommendation of a magistrate judge awarding Phoenician attorney\u2019s fees, costs and prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-21\">After reviewing the record, and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees based on the reasoning contained in the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge filed on August 17, 2004, and on the district court\u2019s order adopting the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge filed on March 22, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
