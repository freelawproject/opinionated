He argues that he was not subject to removal because he was not convicted of an aggravated felony. He argues that his conviction for failure to appear was not punishable by a sentence of two or more years under the United States Sentencing Guidelines and, therefore, his conviction was not an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(T). Restrepo also argues that the IJ\u2019s removal order was invalid because it designated Mexico rather than Columbia as the country of removal and that the Department of Homeland Security acted without authority by changing the country of removal to Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-19\">On May 11, 2005, Congress passed the REAL ID Act (the Act). That Act \u201cdivested the district courts of jurisdiction of \u00a7 2241 petitions attacking removal orders.\u201d <em>Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1055,\u2014L.Ed.2d-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>(2006). Under \u00a7 106(a) of the Act, \u201ca petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal entered or issued under any provision of [the Immigration and Nationality Act].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting the Act, \u00a7 106(a), 119 Stat. at 310). The section took effect upon its enactment on May 11, 2005, and by its express terms, the Act is retroactive and applies to cases \u201cin which the final administrative order of removal, deportation, or exclusion was issued before, on, or after\u201d the date of enactment. Pub. L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 106(b); <em>Bonhometre v. Gonzales, </em>414 F.3d 442, 446 (3d Cir.2005); <em>Rosales, </em>426 F.3d at 736 (\u201cCongress neglected, however, to specify what was to happen to habeas petitions, such as this one, that were already on appeal as of the REAL ID Act\u2019s effective date.... [W]e hold that despite Congress\u2019s silence on this issue, habeas petitions on appeal as of May 11, 2005, [the date of enactment], are properly converted into petitions for review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The district court denied Restrepo\u2019s habeas petition on September 27, 2004, and this appeal was pending at the time that the Act was enacted. Under the language of \u00a7 106(b), this provision applies retroactively to Restrepo\u2019s habeas petition because the removal order challenged was issued before the date of enactment of this provision. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to consider this appeal under the Act. Even if Restrepo\u2019s habeas petition were converted to a petition for review of the removal order, he would not be entitled to relief from the removal order. Because Restrepo had previously filed a petition for review of the removal order, we lack jurisdiction to consider a second petition for review of the removal order under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(2). Accordingly, Restrepo\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his habeas petition is DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
