Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000). This standard applies irrespective of the alien\u2019s underlying basis for relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\"><em>Matter ofLozada </em>provides three procedural requirements that an alien must meet for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim: (1) the alien\u2019s affidavit stating the relevant facts, including the agreement with counsel regarding the alien\u2019s representation; (2) evidence that counsel was informed of the allegations and was allowed to respond, including any response given; and (3) where the alien alleges counsel violated his legal or ethical responsibilities, evidence a complaint has been lodged with the relevant disciplinary authorities or an adequate explanation for the failure to do so. 19 I &amp; N Dec. 637. Our court adopted these requirements because they are necessary to \u201cto assess the substantial number of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that come before the [BIA]\u201d. <em>Lara, </em>216 F.3d at 496 (internal citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">Singh has complied with neither the second nor the third requirement. While Singh maintains his attorney \u201cdid not return any of [his] new counsel\u2019s messages\u201d, and he could not file a complaint with the relevant disciplinary authorities because he was \u201cunable to locate any family members or friend(s) who had allegedly spoken with [his] attorney\u201d, Singh has not presented any evidence that he attempted to contact these individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-15\">In sum, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reopen proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-16\">\n<em>DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
