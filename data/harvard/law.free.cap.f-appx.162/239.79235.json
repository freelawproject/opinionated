The district court granted summary judgment to Prudential, and Johnny\u2019s appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-17\">Johnny\u2019s Enterprises is a used car dealer in Moncks Corner, South Carolina. In March 2001, Johnny\u2019s signed a contract with the Deltagroup<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that allowed Johnny\u2019s to sell the Deltagroup\u2019s vehicle service contracts to car buyers. J.A. 46. The vehicle service contracts provided car buyers with warranty coverage for some repairs. <em>Id. </em>Under the contract between the Deltagroup and Johnny\u2019s, Johnny\u2019s would remit the money from the service contract sales to the Deltagroup. <em>Id. </em>According to a second contract known as \u201cthe Addendum,\u201d the Deltagroup would deposit the money from Johnny\u2019s service-contract sales (less some administrative fees) into a money-market account with Prudential Securities. <em>Id. </em>at 48. The Deltagroup would pay claims made by the car buyers under the vehicle service contracts with the money in the Prudential account. <em>Id. </em>at 46. Each year, the Deltagroup would also distribute to Johnny\u2019s any profits generated from the Prudential account \u2014 that is, any money not spent paying claims. <em>Id. </em>at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-18\">On July 10, 2001, an agent of one of the Deltagroup\u2019s affiliates signed the documents to open the Prudential account intended to hold the money from service contract sales made by Johnny\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>at 92. In late 2002, the Deltagroup encountered financial trouble. As a result, the Deltagroup ordered Prudential to transfer the money from the Johnny\u2019s service-contract sales to a consolidated account containing money from several of the Delta-group\u2019s clients. <em>Id. </em>at 117. On December 30, 2002, the Deltagroup ordered Prudential to transfer what remained of that money from the consolidated account at Pru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>dential to a bank account at Wells Fargo. <em>Id. </em>at 128. By spring of 2003, the Delta-group could no longer pay service-contract claims regularly, and the Deltagroup affiliate responsible for paying claims ultimately filed for bankruptcy in the Cayman Islands. <em>Id. </em>at 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">In May 2003, Johnny\u2019s learned that the money in the Prudential account had been transferred and that the Deltagroup could no longer be relied upon to pay claims. <em>Id. </em>at 416. With the Deltagroup unable to pay claims, Johnny\u2019s paid for repairs to the cars of service-contract purchasers. <em>Id. </em>at 419. Johnny\u2019s sued the Deltagroup and its involved affiliates on a number of theories. <em>Id. </em>at 14-19. Johnny\u2019s also sued Prudential for its role in transferring the money intended to pay claims under the service contracts Johnny\u2019s sold. Against Prudential, Johnny\u2019s asserted claims of breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and unfair trade practices. <em>Id. </em>at 18-19. This appeal concerns only the claims against Prudential.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The district court granted summary judgment to Prudential. It held that there was \u201cno theory under which Prudential owes a fiduciary duty to\u201d Johnny\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>at 580. Specifically, it concluded that state banking law\u2019s \u201cspecial account\u201d doctrine did not give rise to a fiduciary duty because Prudential is not a bank and Johnny\u2019s was not a depositor. <em>Id. </em>at 580-82. It also concluded that no duty arose from a trust or bailment relationship between Prudential and Johnny\u2019s because no such relationship existed and that Prudential owed Johnny\u2019s no duty under the Investment Advisors Act. <em>Id. </em>at 582-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The district court also held that South Carolina had not adopted a cause of action for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and accordingly the court dismissed those claims against Prudential. <em>Id. </em>at 586-89. Finally, the district court concluded that no liability could attach to Prudential under the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act because Prudential was required by statute to transfer the money in question as a \u201csecurities intermediar/\u2019 taking direction from an \u201centitlement holder\u201d \u2014 namely, an agent from the Delta-group listed as a fiduciary on the account. <em>Id. </em>at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">At the summary judgment stage, we view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, which in this case is Johnny's. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>See Dawkins v. Witt, </em>318 F.3d 606, 610 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">Having thoroughly reviewed the district court\u2019s opinion and the parties\u2019 briefs and submissions on appeal and having heard argument in this case, we conclude that the district court did not err in its grant of summary judgment to Prudential. There is no legal or factual basis upon which to conclude that Prudential owed a fiduciary duty to Johnny\u2019s. We therefore affirm on the reasoning of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-13\"> Several of the Deltagroup\u2019s affiliates played a part in the events at issue. The differences between them are inconsequential for this appeal. For the sake of simplicity, all of the affiliates are referred to as the Deltagroup.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
