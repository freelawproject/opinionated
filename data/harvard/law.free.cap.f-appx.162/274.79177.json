Mulumba appeals his jury conviction and sentence for making a false claim of United States citizenship in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 911. Mulumba does not appeal his jury conviction for possession of a firearm by an illegal alien in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(5) and 924(a)(2), and, thus, this conviction is not affected by the disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Mulumba contends that the Government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he represented himself to be a United States citizen. Because Mulumba did not move for a judgment of acquittal in the district court, this court\u2019s review of the sufficiency of the evidence \u201cis limited to determining whether there was a manifest miscarriage of justice, that is, whether the record is devoid of evidence pointing to guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Delgado, </em>256 F.3d 264, 274 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">A conviction for making a false claim of United States citizenship requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201cfalsely and willfully representad] himself to be a citizen of the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 911. The sole evidence presented by the Government to establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 911 was an 1-9 Employment Eligibility Verification Form wherein Mulumba checked a box certifying that he was \u201c[a] citizen <em>or </em>national of the United States.\u201d (emphasis added). Because 18 U.S.C. \u00a7911 criminalizes only false representations of United States citizenship and a person can be a national of the United States and yet not a citizen, the record is devoid of evidence that Mulumba falsely represented himself to be a citizen of the United States. Therefore, Mulumba\u2019s conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 911 is REVERSED. Further, because Mulumba\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 911 conviction affected the sentence imposed in connection with his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5) conviction, his sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for resentencing on the remaining count of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 911 CONVICTION REVERSED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING ON THE REMAINING COUNT OF CONVICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
