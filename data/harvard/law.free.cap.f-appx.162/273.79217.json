He seeks to challenge the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). He argues that the appeal waiver contained in his plea agreement does not bar the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-25\">Rodriguez\u2019s appeal waiver was rendered not knowing and voluntary when the magistrate judge advised Rodriguez at his rearraignment hearing that he could appeal an \u201cillegal sentence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517-18 (5th Cir.1999). Therefore, his appeal waiver does not bar the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-26\">Rodriguez argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>tional in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He concedes that his challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219,140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and he raises it to preserve it for further review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). We therefore must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b295-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
