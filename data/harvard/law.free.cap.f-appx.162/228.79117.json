McCartney pled guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, in which, in exchange for his plea, the government agreed to \u201crecommend the low end of the applicable guideline range.\u201d On appeal, McCartney argues that the government breached the plea agreement by failing to comply with this term of the agreement. We agree and therefore vacate McCartney\u2019s sentence and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">At sentencing, McCartney\u2019s counsel argued in support of a sentence at the low end of the applicable advisory guideline range or lower. When the court inquired of the government its position on sentencing, the Assistant United States Attorney responded: \u201cJust that we\u2019d ask that you stay within the advisory guideline range, Sir, but I don\u2019t have an opinion as to whether it should be the low end or the high end at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">After McCartney\u2019s counsel noted that the plea agreement required the government to recommend a sentence at the low end of the applicable guideline range, the court stated, \u2018Well, I understand that and I will consider that [the AUSA] has done so after your having called this to her attention.\u201d The court proceeded to sentence McCartney to 115 months, the top of the advisory guideline range of 92 to 115 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">A plea agreement is breached when a government promise which induces the plea goes unfulfilled. <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971); <em>United States v. Ringling, </em>988 F.2d 504, 506 (4th Cir.1993). By not recommending a sentence at the low end of the guidelines range, the government did not fulfill its obligations under the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Peglera, </em>33 F.3d 412, 414 (4th Cir.1994) (\u201cGiven the express inclusion of [a promise to recommend a lower sentence] in the plea agreement, there would seem to be little question that the government\u2019s [failure to do so] constituted a breach.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">After McCartney\u2019s counsel informed the sentencing court of the government\u2019s promise in the plea agreement, the court deemed the recommendation made. This is not sufficient to excuse the government\u2019s failure to comply with its promise made in the plea agreement. <em>See id. </em>\u201c[Resentencing is required under <em>Santobello </em>regardless of the judge\u2019s awareness of the government\u2019s \u2018real\u2019 position as indicated in the plea agreement.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>United States v. Kurkculer, </em>918 F.2d 295, 302 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">Case law requires us to remand this case to a different district judge for resentencing. <em>See Santobello, </em>404 U.S. at 263, 92 S.Ct. 495; <em>Peglera, </em>33 F.3d at 415. Our decision in no way impugns the sentencing judge, who competently conducted the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">We vacate the sentence and remand the case to a different district judge for resentencing. Upon remand, the district court shall resentence McCartney consistent with the requirements of this opinion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
