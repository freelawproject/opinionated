Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See Guz</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>man-Reyes v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1407, 161 L.Ed.2d 177 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Jose Antonio Guzman-Reyes pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more thanlOO kilograms of marijuana, in contravention of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 and \u00a7 846. The applicable U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) range was 51-63 months based on his Offense Level of 24 and his Criminal History Category of I. However, because his conduct mandated a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of at least 60 months imprisonment, his U.S.S.G. range was in essence 60-63 months. The district court sentenced Guzman-Reyes to 60 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">In his original appeal to this court, Guzman-Reyes raised a number of claims. He contended, inter alia, that the district court erroneously deemed him to be a manager or leader of the conspiracy, in accordance with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l.(e), thereby proscribing the district court from granting him a \u201csafety valve\u201d sentencing departure pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(4), and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a). We found that the district court did not err when it found that Guzman-Reyes was ineligible for a \u201csafety valve\u201d departure given the following, each of which militates in favor of a finding that he was a leader of the conspiracy: (1) Guzman-Reyes\u2019s attempt to purchase more than 840 pounds of marijuana, (2) his directing a family member (also a conspiracy member) to deliver cash to consummate the transaction, and (3) his attempt to take possession of the marijuana. <em>See United States v. Guzman-Reyes, </em>113 Fed.Appx. 607, 608-09 (5th Cir.2004). Moreover, for the first time on appeal, Guzman-Reyes argued that the district court\u2019s finding that he was the manager or leader of the conspiracy, should have actually been determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore was improper under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We rejected this claim as well, and affirmed Guzman-Reyes\u2019s sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">Guzman-Reyes petitioned the United States Supreme Court for relief. The Supreme Court granted his petition for writ of certiorari, vacated our earlier judgment, and remanded the case for our consideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">FURTHER CONSIDERATION IN LIGHT OF <em>BOOKER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">Pursuant to our instructions, the parties filed briefs on <em>Booker\u2019s </em>impact upon the sentence imposed by the district court. Guzman-Reyes acknowledges that he did not argue before the district court that his sentence was infirm because it was enhanced based on facts that were not proven by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Likewise, he concede she has not previously argued it was improper for him to be sentenced under mandatory sentencing guidelines. Therefore, we review these claims for plain error. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, Mares v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). We have recognized that in order to demonstrate plain error, a party must establish: (1) an error; (2) that was clear and obvious; and (3) said error affected the substantial rights of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>If the foregoing elements are satisfied, a reviewing court may then use its discretion to find plain error only if: (4) the error seriously affected \u201cthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-15\">Guzman-Reyes argues that the enhancement based on his leadership role in the conspiracy constitutes plain error. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>claims that without the enhancement he would have been entitled to a safety valve pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a), therefore he is entitled to be resentenced. This argument has already been rejected by this Court, as Guzman-Reyes has not directed this panel to anything in the record that indicates he would have received a lesser sentence had he been sentenced under advisory sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Santana, </em>2005 WL 1467228 (5th Cir. June 21, 2005); <em>see also United States v. Dilks, </em>135 Fed.Appx. 653, 655 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cBecause Dilks was subject to the mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years, he has not shown that his sentence would likely have been different if the judge had sentenced him under the <em>Booker </em>advisory regime; therefore, he has not shown plain <em>error.\u201d). </em>Accordingly, Guzman-Reyes\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
