We affirmed his conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. Bullard, </em>83 F.3d 435 (Table), 11th Cir. (Fla.), Apr. 04, 1996. In July 1998, appellant moved the court to modify his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) based on an intervening modification of the Sentencing Guidelines. The court granted the motion, and reduced appellant\u2019s sentence to 480 months\u2019 imprisonment. Appellant appealed, and we affirmed. <em>United States v. Bullard, </em>251 F.3d 161 (Table), 11th Cir. (Fla.), June 08, 2001. While this appeal was pending, appellant moved the district court to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, contending that his sentence was unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The court denied his motion, and we affirmed, holding that <em>Apprendi </em>afforded appellant no relief on collateral attack. <em>Bullard v. United States, </em>31 Fed.Appx. 941 (Table), 11th Cir. (Fla.), Feb. 04, 2002. Lastly, in March 2005, appellant moved the court for relief from his sentence pursuant to former Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a), again challenging the constitutionality of his motion\u2014 apparently under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>621 (2005). He contended that the former rule was applicable because the conspiracy with which he was charged began before the effective date of the Sentencing Guidelines, i.e., November 1, 1987. The court denied his motion. It did so without passing on whether former Rule 35(a) applied. Instead, assuming that the rule applied, the court, citing <em>In re Anderson, </em>396 F.3d 1336, 1340 (11th Cir.2005), denied appellant\u2019s motion on the ground that <em>Booker </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. Appellant now appeals the denial of his motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">In appealing his conviction and sentence, appellant did not challenge the court\u2019s imposition of his sentence pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act and the Sentencing Guidelines. In other words, he did not contend that the conspiracy of which he was convicted ceased prior to November 1, 1987, such that he should have been sentenced under pre-Guidelines law. The district court therefore lacked authority under the Criminal Rules to entertain appellant\u2019s former Rule 35(a) motion (which is not applicable to sentences imposed under the Guidelines). The rule that does apply is the current version of Rule 35 (effective December 1, 2002) which states that the court may correct a sentence that \u201cresulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error\u201d within 7 days after sentencing. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a) (2005). This 7-day requirement is jurisdictional. <em>United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310. 1317 (11th Cir.2002). Hence, the court should have denied appellant\u2019s motion for lack of jurisdiction. In passing, we agree with the court that <em>Booker </em>provides no relief on collateral attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
