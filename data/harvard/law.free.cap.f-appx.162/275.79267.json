In addition to filing a brief on the merits, the Attorney General submitted a motion to strike new evidence submitted with Berzosa\u2019s brief, which has been carried with the instant appeal. For the following reasons, we GRANT the Attorney General\u2019s motion to strike the new evidence submitted with Berzosa\u2019s brief and DISMISS Berzosa\u2019s petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-21\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b298-22\">Berzosa, a native and citizen of Mexico, illegally entered El Paso, Texas without being admitted or paroled on or about October 28, 1989. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> initiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>removal proceedings against Berzosa by filing a Notice To Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) in the El Paso Immigration Court on October 19, 2000. The NTA charged Berzosa with removability as an alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)(i). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (2000). On February 13, 2001, Berzosa appeared before the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) with Marcela Garcia Moreno, an accredited representative from the United Neighborhood Organization but not a licensed attorney. At the hearing, Berzosa admitted the factual allegations contained in his NTA and conceded removability on those grounds. He sought a cancellation of removal under INA \u00a7 240A(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or, in the alternative, voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Following a hearing on the merits on December 13, 2002, the IJ issued a written decision denying Berzosa\u2019s application for cancellation of removal but granting his request for voluntary departure. Specifically, the IJ found that the inconsistencies in Berzosa\u2019s testimony failed to establish the necessary continuous physical presence under \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, the IJ held that the medical condition of Berzosa\u2019s twin daughters, Joanna and Jacqueline, who are both United States citizens, did not rise to the level of \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d necessary to garner relief under \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). On January 14, 2003, Berzosa appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">The BIA dismissed the appeal on May 3, 2004, expressly affirming and adopting the IJ\u2019s determination that Berzosa failed to meet the statutory requirements for cancellation of removal, specifically the physical presence and hardship requirements under \u00a7 1229b(b)(l). On June 30, 2004, Berzosa filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings with the BIA to consider new evidence in support of his original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>application for cancellation of removal. He also asserted that his due process rights were violated on account of ineffective assistance of counsel at the first hearing. The BIA denied Berzosa\u2019s motion to reopen on November 30, 2004, finding (1) that the newly submitted evidence was not previously unavailable as required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) that Berzosa failed to comply with the requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 1988 WL 235454 (B.I.A.1988) in presenting his ineffective assistance of counsel claim by failing to submit evidence that he had filed a bar complaint against his prior counsel; and (3) that Berzosa had failed to prove any prejudice resulting from his former counsel\u2019s performance. On December 27, 2004, Berzosa filed a timely petition for review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AMD\">A. Motion to Strike New Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Ordinarily, this court examines a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as a basis to support a motion to reopen under <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. 637, 639, 1988 WL 235454 (B.I.A.1988), <em>affd, </em>857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir.1988). In <em>Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 389 (5th Cir.2001), we stated that a petitioner, who is seeking to reopen or reconsider his removal proceedings to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, must provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfO\">1) an affidavit by the alien setting forth the relevant facts, including the agreement with counsel regarding the alien\u2019s representation; 2) evidence that counsel was informed of the allegations and allowed to respond, including any response; and 3) an indication that, assuming that a violation of \u201cethical or legal responsibilities\u201d was claimed, a complaint has been lodged with the relevant disciplinary authorities, or an adequate explanation for the failure to file such a complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-9\"><em>Id. </em>The parties do not dispute, and the record demonstrates, that Berzosa\u2019s motion to reopen met the first and second prongs of the <em>Lozada </em>inquiry. With respect to the third prong, however, the BIA determined that the record did not contain evidence that a complaint had been lodged with the relevant disciplinary authorities, and Berzosa failed to provide a sufficient explanation for his failure to do so. Indeed, our review of the record confirms that Berzosa\u2019s first effort to meet the third prong of <em>Lozada </em>did not occur until he filed the instant appeal and attached a letter of complaint to the Executive Office for Immigration Review (\u201cEOIR\u201d) dated June 24, 2002 stating his grievance about Moreno\u2019s representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">On May 20, 2005, the Attorney General filed a motion to strike the new evidence submitted with Berzosa\u2019s brief to this court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> More specifically, Berzosa\u2019s brief attached two additional pieces of evidence not found within the administrative record: (1) the letter of complaint dated June 24, 2004 from Berzosa to the EOIR concerning Moreno\u2019s allegedly deficient representation in his case; and (2) school records of Joanna and Jacqueline discussing their special education needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>The Attorney General correctly noted that additional evidence outside of the administrative record cannot be considered in this appeal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (providing that on review of orders of removal \u201cthe court of appeals shall decide the petition <em>only </em>on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Goonsuwan, </em>252 F.3d at 390 n. 15 (\u201cIt is a bedrock principle of judicial review that a court reviewing an agency decision should not go outside of the administrative record.\u201d). Accordingly, we grant the motion and confine our review to the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">B. Jurisdiction Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">As a preliminary matter, the Attorney General contends that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Berzosa\u2019s motion to reopen under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), which bars judicial review of \u201cany judgment regarding the granting of relief under section 1182(h), 1182)(i), 1229b, 1229c, or 1255 of this title.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because Berzosa attempted to reopen his removal proceedings to challenge the IJ\u2019s determination that he was not eligible for the discretionary relief under \u00a7 1229b(b)(1), the jurisdictional bar of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) applies. <em>See Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004) (dismissing petition for review of hardship determination under \u00a7 1229(b)(1)(D) for lack of jurisdiction). Even though Berzosa raises his challenge through a motion to reopen his proceedings rather than a direct challenge to the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s merits determination, this circuit has held that the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of \u00a7 1252(a)(2) apply with equal force in this context. <em>Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 474 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201c[J]ust as our power to review a final order is circumscribed by \u00a7 1252(a)(2)\u2019s various jurisdiction-stripping provisions, our \u2018jurisdiction to entertain an attack on that order mounted through filing of a motion to reopen\u2019 is equally curtailed.\u201d) (quoting <em>Patel v. United States, </em>334 F.3d 1259,1262 (11th Cir.2003)). Accordingly, we agree with the Attorney General that Berzosa cannot \u201cmanufacture jurisdiction simply by petitioning this court to review the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Although the holding in <em>Rueda </em>clearly precludes review of a discretionary hardship determination under \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(D), Berzosa also challenges the IJ\u2019s finding that he failed to meet the physical presence requirement under \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(A). This circuit has not extended the reach of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u2019s jurisdictional bar to the determination of whether a petitioner has been continually present for a period of not less than ten years. <em>See Garcia-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 661 (5th Cir.2003) (describing the continuous physical presence requirement as \u201ca factual determination which is subject to appellate review\u201d); <em>Gonzalez-Torres v. I.N.S, </em>213 F.3d 899, 901 (5th Cir.2000). We review the IJ\u2019s factual conclusion on the issue of whether Berzosa established ten years of continuous presence for substantial evidence. Garc<em>ia-Melendez, </em>351 F.3d at 661. Because all four requirements of \u00a7 1229b(b)(1) must be satisfied for cancel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>lation of removal, however, our lack of jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination on hardship is fatal to Berzosa\u2019s claim. Therefore, it would be a hollow act for us to separately consider the IJ\u2019s finding on continuous presence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">C. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Although this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s holding with respect to discretionary relief under \u00a7 1229b(b)(1), we retain jurisdiction over \u201cany substantial constitutional claims.\u201d <em>See Balogun v. Ashcroft, </em>270 F.3d 274, 278 n. 11 (5th Cir.2001). As such, before we can dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction, we must consider whether Berzosa\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel rises to the level of a \u201csubstantial constitutional violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">This court has previously found that ineffective assistance of counsel <em>\u201cmay </em>implicate the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due process guarantee if the \u2018representation afforded [the alien] ... was so deficient as to impinge upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Assaad, </em>378 F.3d at 475 (quoting <em>Paul v. I.N.S., </em>521 F.2d 194, 198 (5th Cir.1975)); <em>Goonsuwan, </em>252 F.3d at 385 n. 2 (noting that ineffective assistance of counsel offends due process when \u201cas a result, the alien suffered substantial prejudice\u201d). Berzosa contends that Moreno\u2019s representation was deficient in two respects, both of which are directly related to his application for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b(b)(1). First, Berzosa claims that Moreno failed to adequately prepare and present his case to the IJ, especially with respect to her purported inability to establish Berzosa\u2019s physical presence requirement under \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A). Second, Berzosa claims that the ineffective assistance of Moreno impaired his ability to establish the \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual\u201d hardship to his citizen daughters that would be necessary to secure discretionary relief under \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Because Berzosa\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim cannot be disentangled from his effort to secure discretionary relief, we find no deprivation of a protected liberty interest that would give rise to a due process violation. <em>Assaad, </em>378 F.3d at 475 (finding that a \u201cmotion to reopen does not allege a violation of [the petitioner\u2019s] Fifth Amendment right to due process because \u2018the failure to receive relief that is purely discretionary in nature does not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, </em>178 F.3d 1139, 1146 (11th Cir.1999)). Without question, the discretionary cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b is expressly subject to the \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) jurisdictional bar. <em>See Garcia-Melendez, </em>351 F.3d at 661. Therefore, Berzosa\u2019s effort to circumvent the jurisdictional defect in his petition for review through a motion to reopen for ineffective assistance of counsel is ultimately unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we hereby GRANT the Attorney General\u2019s motion to strike the new evidence submitted with Berzosa\u2019s brief and DISMISS Berzosa\u2019s petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

As of March 1, 2003, the INS\u2019s administrative, service, and enforcement functions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>transferred from the Department of Justice to the new Department of Homeland Security. <em>See </em>Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-296, \u00a7\u00a7 441, 451, 471, 116 Stat. 2135 (2002). The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Department of Homeland Security assumed the INS\u2019s detention, removal, enforcement, and investigative functions. <em>See Peters v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 302, 304 n. 1 (5th Cir.2004). Because the events in this case began before the reorganization, we will continue to refer to the INS in this opinion to avoid confusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\">. Section 1229b(b)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">The Attorney General may cancel removal of, and adjust to the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the United States if the alien\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">(A) has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years immediately preceding the date of such application;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-10\">(B) has been a person of good moral character during such period;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-11\">(C) has not been convicted of an offense under section 1182(a)(2), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(3) of this title (except in a case described in section 1227(a)(7) of this title where the Attorney General exercises discretion to grant a waiver); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6W\">(D) establishes that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b299-16\">. The IJ found the discrepancy between Berzosa\u2019s live testimony and the documentary evidence submitted to the court concerning the school enrollment of one of his non-citizen daughters, Blanca, to be particularly damaging to Berzosa's credibility. Although Berzosa maintained that he had been continually present in the United States beginning in 1989, the enrollment and medical records indicated that Blanca had not transferred to a school in the United States until December 12, 1991. If Berzosa did not arrive in the United States until 1991, he would not meet the requisite ten-year period of continuous presence under \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b300-6\">. The BIA cannot grant a motion to reopen proceedings unless it finds the additional evidence presented \"is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\" 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b300-11\">. On May 31, 2005, this court ordered that the motion be carried with the instant appeal. <em>Berzosa-Flores v. Gonzales, </em>No. No. 04-61168 (5th Cir. May 31, 2005) (unpublished order). Berzosa did not file a response to this motion or provide any justification for including the new evidence in his brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b301-8\">. Aside from a brief jurisdictional statement at the beginning of his brief, Berzosa does not address the initial question of this court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Before reaching the merits of his claim that he was deprived of due process as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel, we must first determine whether jurisdiction lies in this case. <em>See Nguyen v. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>400 F.3d 255, 260 (5th Cir.2005) (noting that \u201cthe question of a federal court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction may be properly raised at any stage in litigation, including for the first time on appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b302-7\">. Although we need not reach the issue, we note that the IJ's determinations with respect to Berzosa's claims of continuous presence and \"exceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d were supported by substantial evidence. The record amply demonstrates the gaps in documentary proof and questionable credibility of Berzosa\u2019s statements during the hearing. We afford \"great deference to an immigration judge\u2019s decisions concerning an alien\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Chun v. I.N.S., </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994)). Despite several opportunities to explain the discrepancies in his testimony, Berzosa failed to meet his burden of establishing continuous presence. This court has been \"emphatically clear\u201d that it \" 'will not review decisions turning purely on the immigration judge's assessment of the alien petitioner\u2019s credibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78 (citing <em>Mantell </em>v. <em>I.N.S., </em>798 F.2d 124, 127 (5th Cir. 1986)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
