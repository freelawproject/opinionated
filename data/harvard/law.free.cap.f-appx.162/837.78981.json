A \u201cresidential real estate-related transaction\u201d includes \u201c[t]he making or purchasing of loans\u201d \u201cfor purchasing, constructing, improving, repairing, or maintaining a dwelling[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3605(b)(1)(A). In a case such as the instant case, where the plaintiff relies on circumstantial \u2014 rather than direct \u2014 evidence of discrimination, we use the burden-shifting framework set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and <em>Texas Dep\u2019t ofCmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981), to evaluate the claim of discrimination under the FHA. <em>See Sec\u2019y, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Hous. and Urban Dev. v. Blackwell, </em>908 F.2d 864, 870 (11th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">\u201c[T]he elements of a prima facie case are flexible and should be tailored, on a case-by-case basis, to differing factual circumstances.\u201d <em>Fitzpatrick v. City of At</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number><em>lanta, </em>2 F.3d 1112, 1123 (11th Cir.1993) (quotation marks omitted). In the credit discrimination context, a plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of discrimination by offering evidence showing: (1) that the plaintiff is a member of a protected class; (2) that the plaintiff applied for and was qualified for a loan from the defendant; (3) that the loan was rejected despite the plaintiffs qualifications; and (4) that the defendant continued to approve loans for applicants outside of the plaintiffs protected class with similar qualifications. <em>See Cooley v. Sterling Bank, </em>No. 03-14727, manuscript op. at 12, 116 Fed.Appx. 242 (11th Cir. July 16, 2004); <em>see also Rowe v. Union Planters Bank, </em>289 F.3d 533, 535 (8th Cir.2002). \u201cIn order to meet the comparability requirement a plaintiff is required to show that [she] is similarly situated in all relevant aspects to the non-minority\u201d comparator. <em>Silvera v. Orange County Sch. Bd., </em>244 F.3d 1253, 1259 (11th Cir.2001) (discussing racial employment discrimination). Comparators must be \u201cnearly identical to prevent courts from second-guessing\u201d reasonable decisions and \u201cconfusing apples with oranges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted) (discussing the similarity of misconduct needed for a comparator in discrimination claim based on an adverse discipline decision). In \u201cthe credit discrimination context, the Plaintiff must present evidence that [she] was \u2018similarly situated in all relevant aspects\u2019 to the non-minority applicants who received loans from [the lender]. In other words, a comparator\u2019s credit qualifications and loan details must be \u2018nearly identical\u2019 to the Plaintiff\u2019s in order to prevent this court from second guessing the bank\u2019s business decision and confusing apples with oranges.\u201d <em>Cooley v. Sterling Bank, </em>280 F.Supp.2d 1331, 1340 (M.D.Ala.2003) (quotation marks omitted), <em>affd, </em>No. 03-14727, 116 Fed.Appx. 242 (11th Cir. July 16, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">If the plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the defendant to provide a \u201clegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.\u201d <em>Turlington v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., </em>135 F.3d 1428, 1432 (11th Cir.1998). If the defendant satisfies his burden, the plaintiff must establish that the employer\u2019s reason was a \u201cpretext to mask unlawful discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this final step, the plaintiff carries the \u201cultimate burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that a discriminatory intent motivated the [lender\u2019s] action.\u201d <em>Perryman v. Johnson Products Co., </em>698 F.2d 1138, 1142 (11th Cir.1983). \u201c[T]he plaintiff must then present concrete evidence in the form of specific facts which show that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason is mere pretext. Mere conclusory allegations and assertions will not suffice.\u201d <em>Earley v. Champion Int\u2019l Corp., </em>907 F.2d 1077, 1081 (11th Cir.1990). Federal courts do not sit as a court of appeals that reexamines a bank\u2019s business decisions. <em>See Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir.2000) (addressing age discrimination claim).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-8\">A plaintiff is not allowed to recast [a lender\u2019s] proffered nondiscriminatory reasons or substitute [her] business judgment for that of the [lender]. Provided that the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable [lender], [a loan applicant] must meet that reason head on and rebut it, and the [applicant] cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-9\"><em>Id. </em>Although \u201c[departures from normal procedures may be suggestive of discrimination,\u201d <em>Morrison v. Booth, </em>763 F.2d 1366, 1374 (11th Cir.1985), \u201cthe mere fact that [a bank] failed to follow its own internal procedures does not necessarily suggest that [the bank] was motivated by illegal discriminatory intent[,]\u201d <em>Randle v. City of Aurora, </em>69 F.3d 441, 454 (10th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>The district court applied the correct <em>prima facie </em>elements in granting the Bank summary judgment. While the elements of a <em>prima facie </em>case are not rigid and are applied on a case-by-case basis, requiring the plaintiff to demonstrate that other similarly situated non-minority applicants obtained loans from the defendant provides essential context to the defendant\u2019s decisions, and, absent direct evidence of discrimination, there is no basis for a trier of fact to assume that a decision to deny a loan was motivated by discriminatory animus unless the plaintiff makes a showing that a pattern of lending suggests the existence of discrimination. The bank\u2019s underwriting guidelines may be more stringent than the guidelines that generally \u201cqualify\u201d an applicant, and the mere denial of an application to a \u201cqualified\u201d minority applicant does not alone raise an inference of discrimination. Thus, one element of the <em>prima facie </em>case must be that the lender continued to approve loans to similarly situated non-minority applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Boykin failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination because she did not demonstrate that similarly situated applicants were treated differently. Boy-kin\u2019s evidence of similarly situated applicants included three white applicants whose loans were approved for property within the same geographic area as her property. However, the evidence provided no details regarding the relevant financial status of the applicants and showed that (1) two of the applicants applied for first mortgages, not refinancings, and (2) one of the applicants applied with a co-applicant. These comparators are not \u201cnearly identical\u201d to Boykin, as nothing is known about their relevant financial backgrounds or the costs or amounts of their loans. No other evidence in the record reveals any similarly situated applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Even if we were to assume that Boykin established a <em>prima facie </em>case, the Bank proffered a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its decision, and Boykin has not demonstrated that the reason was merely a pretext for discrimination. The Bank denied Boykin\u2019s loan because it determined that the loan was \u201chigh-cost\u201d under New York law and would be in violation of its written policy against such loans. Boykin contends that the reason was pretextual because (1) the \u201chigh-cost\u201d regulations did not apply to her property because it was not owner-occupied, and (2) the Bank failed to follow its internal procedures regarding \u201chigh-cost\u201d determinations early in the application process. These arguments are unavailing: (1) we do not reexamine the Bank\u2019s business decisions, and, because the \u201chigh-cost\u201d loan decision was one that would motivate a reasonable lender, Boykin cannot simply contest the wisdom of the decision, and (2) the Bank\u2019s failure to follow internal procedures alone is not evidence of pretext. Therefore, because Boykin failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination or show that the Bank\u2019s legitimate non-discriminatory reason was pretextual, the district court committed no error in granting the Bank summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-9\">. In determining whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment \u2014 because a material issue of fact remains to be litigated \u2014 we use the time-honored standard. That is, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant, here Boy-kin, and give her the benefit of all reasonable inferences that evidence yields.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
