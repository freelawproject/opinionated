Brazile argues on appeal that he properly filed his petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241, and the district court erred by denying his petition on the grounds that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause did not apply, instead of addressing the merits of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-15\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). However, under limited circumstances, a provision of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255. That provision, known as \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides that</p>\n<p id=\"b856-16\">[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-17\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Accordingly, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See id. </em>The burden of coming forward with evidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy rests with the movant. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9,10 (5th Cir.1979).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>When a prisoner has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive our authorization before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255. We have held that such restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, \u201cstanding alone, do not render that section \u2018inadequate or ineffective\u2019 within the meaning of the savings clause.\u201d <em>Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 945 (11th Cir.2005). Consequently, a petitioner who has filed a previous \u00a7 2255 motion, which has been denied, may not circumvent the successive-motion rule simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>Id. </em>We have established that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause only applies when (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that the petitioner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999). In order for a prisoner to avail himself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy under <em>Wofford, </em>all three criteria must be satisfied. A petitioner may <em>not argue </em>the merits of his claim until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by demonstrating that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause applies to his claim. <em>Id. at </em>1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Brazile is precluded from seeking relief under \u00a7 2241 because \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause does not apply. First, it appears that Brazile filed the present \u00a7 2241 petition in an effort to circumvent the rules limiting the scope of successive \u00a7 2255 motions. Second, Brazile cannot meet the initial prong of the test in <em>Wofford </em>because he has not demonstrated that his claims are based on any retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision, and, thus, we need not address the remaining prongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b856-18\">.
