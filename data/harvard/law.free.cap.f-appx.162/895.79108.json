The district court determined that Patton\u2019s claims were barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-24\"><em>Res judicata </em>is a legal determination that we review <em>de novo. Jang v. United Technologies Corp., </em>206 F.3d 1147, 1149 (11th Cir.2000). An action is barred by prior litigation if \u201call four of the following elements are present: (1) there is a final judgment on the merits; (2) the decision is rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) the parties, or those in privity with them, are identical in both suits; and (4) the same cause of action is involved in both cases.\u201d <em>Ragsdale v. Rubbermaid, Inc., </em>193 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-25\">Upon careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Patton previously pursued an action against the City of Hapeville and others in federal court, a court of competent jurisdiction. His claims arose out of the same nucleus of operative fact, and were decided on the merits. Patton\u2019s claims are thus barred by <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>At the beginning of his brief, Patton also argues that the district court improperly \u201cfailed to accept as true and view in the light more favorable to the appellant all facts alleged in appellant\u2019s complaint.\u201d We conclude from the record, however, that the district court properly held that the defendants\u2019 statement of undisputed facts filed with their motion for summary judgment were admitted when Patton failed to respond to the statement of facts in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Local Rules for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
