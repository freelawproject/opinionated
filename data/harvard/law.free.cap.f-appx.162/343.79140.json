Jones appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his pretrial motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Jones contends that the warrantless search of his vehicle, which revealed marijuana under the passenger\u2019s seat, was not based on probable cause and thus violated the Fourth Amendment. He argues that the firearm, which was discovered pursuant to a subsequent inventory search of the vehicle, should be suppressed as the fruit of the poisonous tree. The government responds that the search of the space under the passenger\u2019s seat was based on reasonable suspicion and was therefore not in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-15\">An area search of a vehicle is limited to seeking weapons and requires that the officer conducting the search \u201chave an articulable suspicion that the suspect is potentially dangerous.\u201d <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1052 n. 16, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983); see <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Whether reasonable suspicion exists is fact-intensive, and each case is examined in light of the totality of circumstances known to the agent conducting the search and his experience in evaluating such circumstances. <em>United States v. Villalobos, </em>161 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-16\">The testimony at the suppression hearing showed that officers detected a strong smell of deodorant when they were approaching Jones\u2019s vehicle after stopping it for traffic violations. In their experience, such a smell is used to mask other odors. The officers also saw the passenger bend over and reach under the seat, a space where weapons may be concealed and are easily accessible. Further, the passenger was angry and confrontational, and refused to leave the passenger\u2019s seat until one of the officers produced pepper spray.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-17\">Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, <em>see United States v. Laury, </em>985 F.2d 1293, 1314 (5th Cir.1993), we conclude that the government met its burden of showing that this warrantless search of the space under the passenger\u2019s seat was permissible. <em>See Long, </em>463 U.S. at 1050, 103 S.Ct. 3469; <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 455, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>United States v. Colin, </em>928 F.2d 676, 677 (5th Cir.1991). The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
