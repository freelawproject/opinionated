Four days later, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) issued a Notice to Appear, alleging that Petitioner was subject to removal pursuant to Section 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), as amended, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I). On February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>6, 2002, Petitioner filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal under the INA, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">An immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) heard Petitioner\u2019s application on June 20, 2003. After considering the evidence presented, the IJ issued an oral decision finding Petitioner removable as alleged and denying his application. Petitioner appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), which affirmed it without opinion. Petitioner now seeks review in this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). Here, because the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision as to the merits of the claims, we review the IJ\u2019s decision, <em>see Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. We review IJ\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test, and we will \u201caffirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). In order \u201c[t]o reverse the IJ\u2019s decision, we must conclude that the record not only supports [reversal], but <em>compels </em>it.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1202 (11th Cir.2005) (emphasis in original) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">An alien is entitled to asylum if he can establish, with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of religion or other statutorily listed factor; or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that his religion or other statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. \u201cAn alien seeking withholding of removal ... bears the burden of demonstrating that [he] more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon [his] return to the country in question,\u201d on account of, <em>inter alia, </em>his \u201cpolitical opinion.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cAn alien who has not shown past persecution, though, may still be entitled to withholding of removal if [he] can demonstrate a future threat to [his] life or freedom on a protected ground in [his] country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If an alien is unable to meet the \u201cwell founded fear\u201d standard for asylum, \u201che is generally precluded from qualifying for either asylum or withholding of [removal].\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">Because there is no evidence in this record that Petitioner had been physically injured by the Chinese government or that his illegal departure from China would cause him harm if he returned, we are not compelled to the conclusion that Petitioner met his burden of proving past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-8\">. Petitioner\u2019s brief does not challenge the denial of CAT relief. Hence, we do not consider the matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
