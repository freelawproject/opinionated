Estrada filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, which the district court denied. Estrada subsequently filed a \u201cMOTION FOR RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT AND TO REINSTATE PETITIONER\u2019S ORIGINAL CLAIMS PURSUANT TO FED. R. CIV. P. RULE 60(b)(2),\u201d in which he argued that under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights when it enhanced his sentence based on facts that were not admitted by him or found by a jury. The district court construed the motion as a second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion filed without this court\u2019s authorization and dismissed the motion for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-16\">On appeal, Estrada argues the merits of his <em>Blakely </em>claim. Liberally construed, Estrada\u2019s appellate briefs also assert that he intended to file his motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4), rather than Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(2), and they challenge the district court\u2019s construction of his motion as a second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion filed without this court\u2019s authorization. However, Estrada\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of his sentence is properly classified as an attempt to file a second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, regardless whether it was filed pursuant to Fed.R.CivP. 60(b)(2) or Fed.R.CivP. 60(b)(4). <em>See Fierro v. Johnson, </em>197 F.3d 147, 151 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Rich, </em>141 F.3d 550, 551-53 (5th Cir.1998). There is no indication in the record that Estrada requested this court\u2019s permission to file a second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion before filing his motion, and Estrada does not contend that he has done so. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>denying Estrada\u2019s motion. <em>See McCorvey v. Hill, </em>385 F.3d 846, 848 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">AFFIRMED; REQUEST FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
