Monoto was sentenced to 63 months in prison and three years of supervised release. Monoto\u2019s claims are not barred by his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-15\">For the first time on appeal, Monoto contends that his sentence should be vacated because it was imposed pursuant to an unconstitutional mandatory guidelines system, contrary to <em>Booker. </em>This is an alleged Fanfan-type error. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005). Our review is for plain error. <em>See id.; United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43,163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-20\">Although the application of a mandatory guidelines regime was error that was \u201cplain,\u201d Monoto cannot carry his burden of showing that the <em>Fanfan </em>error affected his sentence. <em>See Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d at 600. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the district court felt constrained by the mandatory guidelines in imposing Monoto\u2019s sentence. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 522; <em>see also United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317 n. 4 (5th Cir.) (minimum guideline sentence, without more, insufficient to carry third prong of plain-error test), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 264, 163 L.Ed.2d 238 (2005). We have rejected contentions like the one Monoto advances that the error was a \u201cstructural\u201d one that affected the entire \u201cframework\u201d of the proceeding against him, and that plain-error prejudice should be presumed. <em>See United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 561 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 194,163 L.Ed.2d 209 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-25\">Monoto\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Monoto contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such contentions on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Monoto properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Monoto\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
