They stopped the vehicle and identified the driver as Donald Wade McMillan. His eyes were bloodshot and glassy, and he smelled of alcohol. The deputies arrested McMillan after he failed a field sobriety test and brought him to the sheriffs office.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Once there, McMillan was read his \u201cAdvice of Rights\u201d under TA Section 16-205.1 and agreed to submit to the alcohol concentration test. The test technician, Corporal Sutton, marked a DR-15A form indicating that the testing procedure had been explained to McMillan and that he appeared to be in good health. According to McMillan, he attempted to blow into the Intoximeter seven times, but was not blowing either long or hard enough to produce a reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Sutton described McMillan\u2019s failed attempt to complete the test by writing on the DR-15A form: \u201cSubject refused to blow into the [IJntoximeter.\u201d Sutton did not mark the box labeled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>\u201cRefusal \u2014 Insufficient Breath\u201d but indicated additionally that McMillan \u201crefused to take a test to determine alcohol concentration when requested by the Police Officer.\u201d The deputies confiscated McMillan\u2019s license, ordered it suspended, and issued a temporary license.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">McMillan made a timely request under TA Section 16-205.1(f) for a hearing before an ALJ. McMillan explained at the hearing that he had not slept for two nights prior to the arrest and was pulled over on his way home from a concert where \u201cpeople were throwing pitchers of beer.\u201d He attributed his poor performance on the field sobriety test to his involvement in a motorcycle accident that \u201cmessed up both [of his] ankles.\u201d With regard to the Intoximeter test administered at the Sheriffs office, McMillan said that he had asked Sutton to demonstrate how to properly breathe into the mouthpiece and even offered to give a blood sample at a hospital, but Sutton refused. After the seventh unsuccessful attempt, Sutton told McMillan he would be written up as refusing the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The ALJ did not find McMillan\u2019s testimony credible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She reasoned that it is not difficult to blow into the machine when sober and following the directions of the technician. The ALJ also observed that McMillan appeared to be in good health and did not testify to any medical problems that might have affected him during the test. In the ALJ\u2019s eyes, the test technician\u2019s affirmation that McMillan \u201crefused to blow into the [I]ntoximeter\u201d was more credible than McMillan\u2019s denial. Thus, she found that McMillan refused to take the breath test and imposed the sentence mandated by the statute: a 120-day suspension of his driver\u2019s license and a one-year suspension of his commercial driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">McMillan filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Cecil County, which reversed the ALJ\u2019s judgment. Referencing <em>Borbon v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>345 Md. 267, 691 A.2d 1328 (1997), the court held that the Motor Vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d) failed to show evidence that McMillan refused the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">The MVA petitioned for <em>certiorari, </em>which we granted on July 21, 2010.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Motor Vehicle Admin. v. McMillan, </em>415 Md. 114, 999 A.2d 179 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">As we recently reiterated in <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Lipella, </em>in reviewing a decision of a state administrative agency, \u201cwe review the action of the agency directly, rather than the judgment of the intervening reviewing court.\u201d 427 Md. 455, 466, 48 A.3d 803 (2012) (filed June 25, 2012) (citing <em>Consumer Prot. Div. v. Morgan, </em>387 Md. 125, 160, 874 A.2d 919, 939 (2005)). Our role in analyzing the decision of an administrative agency is \u201climited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Weller, </em>390 Md. 115, 141, 887 A.2d 1042, 1057-58 (2005) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">The \u201csubstantial evidence test\u201d has been met if \u201ca reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, a \u201creviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record,\u201d and \u201cmust review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This is so because \u201cit is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence and to draw inferences from that evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">With this standard in mind, under the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, a reviewing court may \u201c(1) remand the case for further proceedings; (2) affirm the final decision; or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>(3) reverse or modify the decision.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Md.Code (1957, 2009 Repl. Vol.), State Gov\u2019t Art., \u00a7 10-222(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Section 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article of the Maryland Code allows the MVA to suspend a driver\u2019s license and disqualify a commercial driver\u2019s license based on a refusal to submit to a chemical test for intoxication. Md.Code (1977, 2009 Repl.Vol., 2011 Cum.Supp.), TA \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(i)(3) <em>&amp; </em>(in). A refusal may be found not only in instances when the driver outright refuses to take the test, but also when that conclusion is inferred from conduct. This may happen in situations where the driver first agrees to submit to testing but later deliberately frustrates the testing procedure by blowing improperly into the testing device. <em>Borbon, </em>345 Md. at 273, 691 A.2d at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The MVA, as a \u201cproponent\u201d of suspensions, has \u201cthe burden of establishing that there had been a refusal by conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280, 691 A.2d at 1334. Once the MVA offers some evidence to \u201csupport the conclusion of test refusal,\u201d the burden shifts to the driver to demonstrate that there is an innocent explanation for his or her failure to complete the test. <em>Id. </em>at 281, 691 A.2d at 1335. If the driver does not do that, the suspension is proper based on the MVA\u2019s documentary record showing that the driver refused to complete the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">A. The <em>Prima Facie </em>Evidence of Refusal</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Section 16-205.1 (f)(7)(ii) gives <em>prima facie </em>evidence effect to a \u201csworn statement of the police officer and of the test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>technician or analyst ... of a test refusal.\u201d TA \u00a7 16-205. l(f)(7)(ii). We have interpreted this section, however, as applying only to an express refusal to take the test, as opposed to \u201ca refusal based upon intentional frustration of a test during the administration of the test.\u201d <em>Borbon, </em>345 Md. at 278, 691 A.2d at 1333. In instances such as here, where the motorist first agrees to take the test but later fails to complete it, the MVA \u201cmust produce some evidence that the driver intentionally frustrated the test and thus, by conduct, refused it.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 273, 691 A.2d at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">We had an opportunity to analyze the MVA\u2019s burden of proof in <em>Borbon. </em>There, similarly to this case, the driver initially consented to the test but failed to complete it. As evidence of the driver\u2019s refusal to submit to the test, the MVA offered two types of documentary evidence. First, there was a machine-generated report stating that there was \u201cinsufficient breath\u201d for a reading.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 271, 691 A.2d at 1330. Second, the forms contained the word \u201crefusal\u201d in the blanks intended for test results.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Importantly, neither the statements of the arresting officer nor the test technician \u201cin-elude[d] any facts observed by them that tend to support the conclusion of a test refusal.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 281, 691 A.2d at 1335. Based on that evidence, we held that \u2014 without more informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>tion \u2014 it was impossible to know \u201cwhether Borbon was unwilling or unable to produce the required volume of deep lung air.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279-80, 691 A.2d at 1334.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">We reasoned, however, that the outcome could have been different if there had been <em>some </em>evidence indicating what led the test technician to conclude that Borbon intentionally frustrated the test: \u201cFor example, if Borbon had no apparent health problems, a statement to that effect might well have been enough to tip from equipoise and require Borbon to go forward with evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281, 691 A.2d at 1335. We explained that so long as the technician gave a basis for the conclusion that the driver refused the test, \u201cthe knowledge of facts explaining why insufficient breath was reported by the machine would have been wholly with the licensee. That posture of the case might well give rise to a presumption that the licensee was unwilling to cooperate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In this case, McMillan\u2019s license was confiscated after Corporal Sutton determined that McMillan refused to submit to the test. Specifically, Sutton described McMillan\u2019s failed attempt to complete the test by making two notations on the DR-15A form: by writing \u201cSubject refused to blow into the [IJntoximeter\u201d on the form, and by checking the pre-printed box to indicate that the driver \u201crefused to take a test to determine alcohol concentration when requested by the Police Officer.\u201d Unlike the documentary evidence in <em>Borbon </em>that provided no basis for the test technician\u2019s conclusion that Borbon\u2019s failure to complete the test resulted from his \u201cunwillingness,\u201d rather than physical \u201cinability,\u201d to submit to the test, <em>id. </em>at 279-80, 691 A.2d at 1334, in this case the DR 15-A form does contain such information.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Namely, in the Certification of Test Technician or Analyst section of the form, Sutton checked two boxes: (1) indicating that the testing procedure had been explained to McMillan, and (2) that he appeared to be in good health. Thus, in this case, there is no mystery as to why the test technician believed McMillan failed to complete the test. Other than the unwillingness to complete the test, little else can explain why a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>healthy individual, who had been explained the testing procedure, would not be able to blow properly into the Intoximeter to complete the test. As we observed in <em>Borbon, </em>\u201cover the universe of licensees tested on Intoximeter 3000 almost all should be able to produce a sufficient breath sample.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279, 691 A.2d at 1334.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We hold that the test technician\u2019s certification on the DR 15-A form that McMillan \u201crefused to blow into [IJntoximeter\u201d \u2014 coupled with the certifications that the procedure had been explained to McMillan and that he was in good health \u2014 is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of refusal under TA \u00a7 16-205.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">B. The Driver\u2019s Opportunity to Overcome the Presumption of Refusal</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">This <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a refusal provides a sufficient basis for suspending a driver\u2019s license and disqualifying the driver from driving a commercial motor vehicle under TA Section 16-205.1. Accordingly, if the driver does not challenge the suspension order issued by the police based on the certification of refusal, the MVA will suspend the driver\u2019s license and, if the driver is also licensed to operate a commercial motor vehicle, disqualify him or her from engaging in that activity. <em>See </em>TA \u00a7 16-205.1(f). The driver may, however, request an administrative hearing under TA Section 16-205.1(f), where he or she will have an opportunity \u201cto show cause why his driver\u2019s license or privilege should not be suspended for refusal to take an alcohol concentration test as requested.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Karwacki, </em>340 Md. 271, 276, 666 A.2d 511, 514 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">In license suspension cases under TA Section 16-205.1(f), the MVA often proceeds on \u201ca documentary record\u201d containing <em>prima facie </em>evidence on which the police officer issued the suspension order. <em>Borbon, </em>345 Md. at 283, 691 A.2d at 1336. \u201cBeing <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a test refusal, [this evidence], unless explained or contradicted, [is] sufficient to establish that the respondent refused to take an alcohol concentration test.\u201d <em>See Karwacki, </em>340 Md. at 283, 666 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>at 516. At the hearing before the ALJ, the driver may attempt to overcome the presumption of refusal \u201cby other evidence, whether documentary or testimonial, which rebuts or contradicts it.\u201d <em>Id., </em>666 A.2d at 517. In cases \u201cwhere the MVA\u2019s documentary case conflicts with the testimony of the licensee,\u201d the ALJ \u201cwill make credibility determinations.\u201d <em>Borbon, </em>345 Md. at 283, 691 A.2d at 1336. If the ALJ finds the driver\u2019s \u201ctestimony reliable,\u201d then the <em>prima facie </em>evidence produced by MVA would be \u201cundermined\u201d and \u201cno longer would [be] sufficient to establish the fact that the respondent refused the test.\u201d <em>Karwacki, </em>340 Md. at 284, 666 A.2d at 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In this case, McMillan did exercise his right under the statute and requested a show cause hearing. Because McMillan chose not to subpoena Corporal Sutton or the arresting officers,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the only evidence that the ALJ had before her was Corporal Sutton\u2019s sworn certification on Form DR-15A and McMillan\u2019s own testimony. McMillan attempted to contradict Corporal Sutton\u2019s certification of refusal by providing an explanation for his failure to complete the test and the appearance that he was intoxicated. He explained that his eyes were bloodshot because he had not slept in two days and that he smelled of alcohol because he had been sprayed with beer at a concert he attended earlier that night. Discussing the test, McMillan testified that he blew into the Intoximeter seven times but, although he did his best, each time he either did not blow long or hard enough for the machine to produce a reading. He also stated that he asked Sutton to show exactly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>how to blow into the mouthpiece and offered to pay for an extra set that Sutton could use, but that Sutton refused. Finally, McMillan testified that he volunteered to check himself into a hospital and get a blood test, which, he said, would have proven that he was not intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Recognizing that there was a conflict between Sutton\u2019s sworn certification and McMillan\u2019s testimony and acknowledging that it was her responsibility to resolve any inconsistencies based on the parties\u2019 credibility, the ALJ found McMillan\u2019s testimony not credible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">I don\u2019t find [McMillan\u2019s] testimony to be credible. It is not difficult to blow into the breathalyzer machine when you\u2019re not intoxicated and you\u2019re following the directions of the police officer. The police officer, according to your testimony, gave you seven tries to be able to blow into the machine and you were unable to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Stressing that McMillan \u201cappearfed] to be a healthy person,\u201d the ALJ further observed: \u201cYou haven\u2019t testified that there were any medical problems with you that night.\u201d Thus, the ALJ concluded, \u201cThe police officer said that you refused to blow into the intoxometer [sic] and I find that evidence is more credible than Mr. McMillan\u2019s denial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">It was the ALJ\u2019s responsibility to decide \u201cwhether evidence offered to rebut or contradict the <em>prima facie </em>evidence actually does so.\u201d <em>Karwacki, </em>340 Md. at 283, 666 A.2d at 517. What matters to us is that the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that McMillan refused the test is supported by substantial evidence in the record: namely, Corporal Sutton\u2019s certification that McMillan had been explained the procedure and was in good health, but refused to complete the test. Notwithstanding McMillan\u2019s testimony to the contrary, Corporal Sutton\u2019s certification on the DR15-A form \u201cprovides adequate support for the ALJ\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>See id., </em>340 Md. at 285, 666 A.2d at 518. Thus, we affirm the ALJ\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">A test technician\u2019s certification that the driver refused to take the test \u2014 accompanied by the certification that the driver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>had been explained the procedure and appeared to be in good health \u2014 is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of refusal under TA Section 16-205.1. Unless the driver convinces the ALJ that there is an innocent explanation for his or her failure to complete the test, the <em>prima facie </em>evidence gives a sufficient basis for the license suspension and disqualification from driving commercial vehicles. Here, there was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of refusal. McMillan offered testimony to rebut it, but the ALJ found his testimony not credible. Her finding that McMillan refused to complete the test was supported by substantial evidence. The Circuit Court erred in reversing the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CECIL COUNTY REVERSED.
