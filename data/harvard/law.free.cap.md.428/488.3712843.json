Unlike in earlier Maryland cases, the Maryland DNA Collection Act does not apply here because Petitioner Tonto Corbin was not arrested for any of the Act\u2019s predicate offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, Corbin was on probation for a drunken driving offense when his DNA was collected. The DNA was taken from saliva that Corbin left on a straw in the course of complying with an alcohol monitoring program mandated by the terms of his probation. Corbin challenges the use of that saliva in connection with a separate murder investigation that resulted in incriminating evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>The trial court denied Corbin\u2019s motion to suppress the DNA evidence on Fourth Amendment grounds. The State then introduced the DNA and lab report into evidence to prove his connection to the homicide, and he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Corbin appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. That court, in an unreported opinion, rejected his claim that the seizure of his DNA without a warrant violated the Fourth Amendment, ruling instead that Corbin did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in either the testing straw or the DNA on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We granted <em>certiorari </em>to address the following questions, as Corbin phrased them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">1. Does a DWI probationer, who had previously declined police requests to seize and test his DNA, voluntarily surrender his breath for DNA testing where State officers seize his DNA on the false pretense of seizing and testing only his blood alcohol?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">2. In an entirely circumstantial case, was the evidence of Petitioner\u2019s criminal agency legally insufficient because the State failed to establish that it was any stronger than evidence implicating two or three other suspects?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">We shall hold that Corbin\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were not violated when the State recovered his DNA from the straw utilized for this mandatory test. We shall also hold that the evidence was sufficient to sustain Corbin\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Statement of Facts and Legal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">In December 1995, Jacqueline Tilghman\u2019s body was discovered near a farm road in Somerset County. The investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>concluded that the cause of her death was homicide, committed where she was found. Semen was found on vaginal and anal swabs taken of the victim. DNA samples obtained from the swabs were turned over to the Maryland State Police crime laboratory for further testing and storage.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The investigation into her death continued into 2001, at which point Corbin was identified as an associate of the victim. Investigators asked Corbin to voluntarily submit a DNA sample, but he declined. Investigators discovered that Corbin was on probation for a DWI conviction and therefore subject to court-ordered breath tests for alcohol consumption. One testing method is a \u201cdeep lung\u201d test, requiring the probationer to blow into a straw. Upon learning that the straw would be discarded following the test, investigators arranged with Cor-bin\u2019s probation officer to secure the straw after he had completed this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Once obtained, the straw was sent to the crime lab for DNA analysis. The crime lab matched Corbin\u2019s DNA on the straw to DNA in the semen recovered from the vaginal and anal swabs of the victim taken earlier in the homicide investigation. Based on the match, police obtained a warrant for another DNA sample from Corbin, which confirmed the match. It was the second DNA sample that, ultimately, was admitted into evidence against Corbin over the defense objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">In 2004, Corbin was indicted for murder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Before trial, Corbin filed a motion to suppress the DNA evidence on the grounds that the seizure of his DNA by the State without a warrant violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment. The State argued that there was no Fourth Amendment violation because Corbin was on probation, the terms of which required him to submit to the breath test from which the DNA was extracted. Corbin\u2019s motion was denied by Judge Daniel M. Long of the Circuit Court for Somerset County, who explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>The touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and the reasonableness of a search is determined ... by assessing on the one hand the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual\u2019s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">With respect to those persons on probation, however, it has been held inherent in the very nature of probation ... that probationers do not enjoy the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">[A] case ... out of the Third Circuit, U.S. v[.] Sczubelek ... involved the taking of a DNA sample from a probationer. And although not directly on point there was mention that probationers do not enjoy the same liberties that ordinary citizens enjoy. The court noted in its opinion that probation officers have a special need to supervise probationers apart from a normal law enforcement need that justifies a departure from the normal warrant and probable cause requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">This Court therefore[,] in balancing the privacy rights of the defendant against legitimate interests of the state, is not persuaded that the DNA sample taken from the breath tube or breath straw obtained from the defendant through the efforts of his probation agent violates his Fourth Amendment rights under the constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">After Corbin waived his right to a trial by jury, the parties submitted the case to the Circuit Court on an agreed statement of facts, and Judge Long found Corbin guilty of involuntary manslaughter. The judge sentenced Corbin to ten years\u2019 imprisonment, with all but eight years suspended, and two years supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">The statement of facts was read into the record as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">The evidence in this case would show that, at approximately 7:20 a.m. on the morning of December 27th, 1995, the body of [the victim], a thirty-two-year-old black female, was found by Ronald and Elwood Hall while the Halls were checking their muskrat traps on their farm located on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Marumsco Road, one mile West of Cornstack Road in Marion, Somerset County, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">The victim was found [lying] on her back with her head tilted to the right. Her entire head and shoulder area were covered with blood. The front and left side of her head was severely injured. Her right arm was down to her left side. She had gloves on both hands. A blood-soaked white [sweatshirt] was on the upper body and was pushed up, exposing her breast. Her bra was also pushed up over her breast. A pair of white panties, white [sweatpants], and black jeans were all down around her ankle on the right leg. A large abrasion and bruise was obvious to the middle of the victim\u2019s chest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">The ground ... around the victim\u2019s head and upper body was saturated with blood. The surrounding tall grass vegetation was splattered with blood as far as eleven feet south of the victim and extending toward the ditch that parallels Marumsco Road. Blood spatter was also found from the body to the center of the dirt lane, in as high as six feet on tall grass vegetation surrounding the victim to approximately] eight inches in diameter. Blood soaked areas were on the ground and grass next to the east side of the lane by the victim. These facts indicate that the crime occurred at this location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">An autopsy was subsequently performed at the office of the medical examiner for the State of Maryland by Doctor Locke of that office. Doctor Locke would testify that the victim died of strangulation and blunt force injuries to the head. The pattern of injuries to the external and internal structures of the neck [was] most consistent with a manual-type strangulation. The pattern of blunt force injuries to the left side of the face and temple region were consistent with the deceased having received a minimum of five to six blows to that area by a hard, blunt object. The manner of death was homicide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">Evidence was collected from the victim at the scene and sent to the Maryland State Police crime lab for analysis. The results of that analysis would show that [Corbin\u2019s] DNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>profile was found on the vaginal and anal swabs of the victim. No other DNA profile other than the victim[\u2019s] was found on those swabs. Wesley Phillips\u2019[s] DNA profile was found in the underpants \u2014 the crotch of the underpants of the victim and in the crotch of the [sweatpants] of the victim. There was also possibly another partial DNA profile on the underpants. That profile was not identified, but [Corbin] was excluded [as] a source of that profile. There was an unidentified source on the crotch of the victim\u2019s jeans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">Witnesses would testify that the victim was with Wesley Phillips earlier in the evening on December 27th of 1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">The State would present two expert witnesses in the case: Argi Magers, who is a forensic chemist for the Maryland State Police crime lab, as well as Dr. Locke, who is a medical examiner for the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">The State would seek testimony from those witnesses that the victim never stood up after intercourse because there was no evidence that [Corbin\u2019s] semen had drained on to any of the victim\u2019s clothing. The State\u2019s experts would testify that the absence of [Corbin\u2019s] semen on the victim\u2019s clothing was consistent with the victim not standing up after intercourse. And they would testify that the underwear and clothing would be a likely place to look for drainage of semen. However, the defense would offer two experts also: Elizabeth Johnson, who is a forensic biologist and evidence analyst, as well as Doctor Gill, who is a medical examiner. And they would testify, and the State\u2019s experts would agree, that this drainage theory could not be supported by an opinion of reasonable medical or scientific certainty because of other variables that could enter into the drainage possibilities. Additionally, Doctor Locke would testify that the sex and the death could not be forensically linked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">During this investigation, [Corbin] was contacted in 1998 by Corporal McQueeny of the Maryland State Police. At that time, [Corbin] denied having any sexual contact with the victim for years prior to her death. [Corbin] was again contacted by Sergeant McCauley of the Maryland State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Police in 2000. [Corbin] again denied having any contact with the victim for years prior to her death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\">Approximately one hundred witnesses were interviewed during this investigation. And although an exact [timeline] could not be established, the evidence would show that the last witness to see the victim alive saw the victim at approximately 1:30 a.m. on the 27th, wearing the same clothing that she was found in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">Gladys Johnson, who is [Corbin\u2019s] aunt, would testify that [Corbin] told her that he had had sex with the victim between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. on December 27th of 1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">These events occurred in Somerset County, Maryland. And [Corbin] is the defendant seated at defense table next to defense counsel in an orange jumpsuit. (Punctuation added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Corbin appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, challenging the denial of his motion to suppress the DNA results, and claiming that the evidence was legally insufficient to support his conviction. In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court rejected his Fourth Amendment claim, relying on our decision in <em>Williamson v. State, </em>413 Md. 521, 538, 993 A.2d 626, 636 (2010), to hold that Corbin did not have an expectation of privacy in either the straw or the DNA obtained from it. The court also held that a rational trier of fact could conclude that Corbin was guilty of involuntary manslaughter beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">We granted <em>certiorari </em>on both issues, <em>see Corbin v. State, </em>420 Md. 463, 23 A.3d 895 (2011), and shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">\n<em>I. DNA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">As we said in <em>Williamson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">When we review a trial court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to suppress evidence alleged to have been seized in contravention of the Fourth Amendment, we view the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing, and the inferences fairly deducible therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>that prevailed on the motion. We defer to the trial court\u2019s fact-finding at the suppression hearing, unless the trial court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. Nevertheless, we review the ultimate question of constitutionality de novo and must \u201cmake our own independent constitutional appraisal by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-5\"><em>Williamson, </em>413 Md. at 531-32, 993 A.2d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The parties have devoted much of their argument to abandonment. The State\u2019s argument on this ground is that Corbin abandoned the straw because he \u201cmade no effort to gain possession of the straw after the test was administered.\u201d If Corbin is deemed to have abandoned the DNA on the straw, then the Fourth Amendment would not apply. As we said in <em>Stanberry v. State,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">Fourth Amendment protection ... does not extend to property that is abandoned. By abandoning property, the owner relinquishes the legitimate expectation of privacy that triggers Fourth Amendment protection. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQN\"><em>Stanberry v. State, </em>343 Md. 720, 731, 684 A.2d 823, 828-29 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">In <em>Williamson, </em>a suspect was arrested and, while he was in jail, investigators brought him a meal from McDonald\u2019s; the DNA from his discarded McDonald\u2019s cup was ultimately used to convict him on another matter. <em>See Williamson, </em>413 Md. at 524, 527-28, 993 A.2d at 628, 630. In that case, the suspect had accepted the investigators\u2019 offer of food and thrown the wrappers and cup on the floor of his jail cell. <em>Id. </em>at 536, 993 A.2d at 635. By doing so, we held, he abandoned the refuse, and the seizure of DNA was constitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 533-37, 993 A.2d at 633-635.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">We reaffirm the holding in <em>Williamson, </em>but we conclude that the abandonment theory utilized there is not applicable here. Realistically, Corbin had no option to retain the straw as his own or protect his DNA from being taken. While in <em>Williamson, </em>the suspect was offered McDonald\u2019s food and voluntarily accepted, Corbin here was taking an alcohol monitoring test, mandated by his probation officer while on proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>tion for a drunk driving offense. We do not subscribe to the notion that the Fourth Amendment is not applicable because Corbin <em>voluntarily </em>ceded a privacy interest in his saliva and the straw by failing to make an effort to \u201cgain possession\u201d of the State-owned and State-administered testing apparatus, from which his DNA was extracted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Instead, the Fourth Amendment applies and governs this case. The Fourth Amendment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">U.S. Const. amend. IV. The Fourth Amendment applies to Maryland through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 655, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1691, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961); <em>Owens v. State, </em>322 Md. 616, 622, 589 A.2d 59, 61 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Under the Fourth Amendment, Corbin has the burden of demonstrating that he has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the material to be seized. Case law requires that a \u201cperson claiming protection under the Fourth Amendment demonstrate an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy in the item or place searched, as well as prove that the expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Williamson, </em>413 Md. at 534, 993 A.2d. at 634.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Undoubtedly, the collection of blood for DNA profiling constitutes a search for Fourth Amendment purposes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number><em>Skinner v. Ry. Labor Executives\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>489 U.S. 602, 616, 109 S.Ct. 1402, 1412, 103 L.Ed.2d 639 (1989) (\u201cObtaining and examining the evidence may also be a search, if doing so infringes an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable[.]\u201d (citations omitted)). Collection of a person\u2019s DNA by use of a buccal swab is also subject to Fourth Amendment standards, but is less intrusive than a blood test. <em>See King, </em>425 Md. at 555-56, 42 A.3d at 552-53 (observing that swabbing the inside of a suspect\u2019s mouth is a search); <em>State v. Raines, </em>383 Md. 1, 17-19, 857 A.2d 19, 29 (2004) (describing the invasion of a buccal swab to be \u201cminimal at most\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Corbin\u2019s claim is subject to the two-part rubric articulated in <em>Williamson: </em>Did he have an actual expectation of privacy in his DNA, and if so, is society prepared to recognize that expectation as reasonable? We assume his actual or subjective expectation of privacy without discussion, and proceed to the question of whether, as a probationer subject to mandatory alcohol testing, Corbin had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his DNA left on the straw after such a test. The Supreme Court, in <em>United States v. Knights, </em>534 U.S. 112, 118-19, 122 S.Ct. 587, 591, 151 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001), provides the framework for evaluating a probationer\u2019s privacy expectations in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Knights was sentenced to probation for a drug offense. \u201cThe probation order included the following condition: that Knights would submit his ... person, property, place of residence, vehicle, personal effects, to search at anytime, with or without a search warrant, warrant of arrest or reasonable cause by any probation officer or law enforcement officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114, 122 S.Ct. at 589 (quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Knights agreed to the terms of the probation order. <em>Id. </em>Three days later, a public utility telecommunications vault was pried open and set on fire \u2014 the latest of a series of thirty acts of vandalism against the public utility. <em>Id. </em>Shortly before the incidents, the company had filed a \u201ctheft-of-services complaint\u201d against Knights for failure to pay his utility bill and discontinued his utility service. <em>Id. </em>at 114-15, 122 S.Ct. at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">The police, in a surveillance operation, observed a friend of Knights leave Knights\u2019s apartment at 3:10 a.m., with cylindrical items that looked like \u201cpipe bombs,\u201d and walk to a nearby river, where he dumped them in the water. <em>Id. </em>at 115, 122 S.Ct. at 589. Police then observed a number of suspicious objects in this friend\u2019s truck: a Molotov cocktail and explosive materials, a gasoline can, and two brass padlocks that fit the description of those removed from the PG &amp; E transformer vault. <em>Id. </em>Based on these facts and knowing that Knights was on probation, police entered and searched Knights\u2019s apartment without a warrant. <em>Id. </em>Inside, they found extensive items incriminating Knights, which later became the subject of a suppression hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 115-16, 122 S.Ct. at 589-90. The District Court granted the motion to suppress on the ground that the search was for \u201cinvestigatory\u201d rather than \u201cprobationary\u201d purposes, a decision that was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The Supreme Court considered Knights\u2019s probation and also confronted the question of whether the search must relate to the person\u2019s probationary status:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">Certainly nothing in the condition of probation suggests that it was confined to searches bearing upon probationary status and nothing more. The search condition provides that Knights will submit to a search \u201cby any probation officer or law enforcement officer\u201d and does not mention anything about purpose. The question then is whether the Fourth Amendment limits searches pursuant to this probation condition to those with a \u201cprobationary\u201d purpose. (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 116, 122 S.Ct. at 590. The Court impliedly answered this question in the negative by concluding that, when there was reasonable suspicion that a probationer committed a crime, even though unrelated to his probation, police could search the probationer\u2019s home, despite the absence of probable cause or a search warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 117-20, 122 S.Ct. at 590-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The Supreme Court concluded that probationers have diminished expectations of privacy, discussing at length the inherent policy concerns in such cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">The touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and the reasonableness of a search is determined by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual\u2019s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests. Knights\u2019s status as a probationer subject to a search condition informs both sides of that balance. Probation, like incarceration, is a form of criminal sanction imposed by a court upon an offender after verdict, finding, or plea of guilty. Probation is one point ... on a continuum of possible punishments ranging from solitary confinement in a maximum-security facility to a few hours of mandatory community service. Inherent in the very nature of probation is that probationers do not enjoy the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled. Just as other punishments for criminal convictions curtail an offender\u2019s freedoms, a court granting probation may impose reasonable conditions that deprive the offender of some freedoms enjoyed by law-abiding citizens. (Citations and quotation marks omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7Z\"><em>Id. </em>at 119, 122 S.Ct. at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The Court declined to adopt the government\u2019s theory that when Knights agreed to such searches as an explicit condition of his probation, he had waived his Fourth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 118, 122 S.Ct. at 591. Instead, the Court preferred a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>In the Government\u2019s view, Knights\u2019s acceptance of the search condition was voluntary because he had the option of rejecting probation and going to prison instead, which the Government argues is analogous to the voluntary decision defendants often make to waive their right to a trial and accept a plea bargain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">We need not decide whether Knights\u2019s acceptance of the search condition constituted consent in the ... sense of a complete waiver of his Fourth Amendment rights, however, because we conclude that the search of Knights was reasonable under our general Fourth Amendment approach of \u201cexamining the totality of the circumstances,\u201d <em>Ohio v. Robinette, </em>519 U.S. 33, 39, 117 S.Ct. 417, 136 L.Ed.2d 347 (1996), with the probation search condition being a salient circumstance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The Court emphasized the government\u2019s legitimate concerns about the conduct of probationers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">In assessing the governmental interest ... it must be remembered that the very assumption of the institution of probation is that the probationer is more likely than the ordinary citizen to violate the law. The recidivism rate of probationers is significantly higher than the general crime rate. And probationers have even more of an incentive to conceal their criminal activities and quickly dispose of incriminating evidence than the ordinary criminal because probationers are aware that they may be subject to supervision and face revocation of probation, and possible incarceration, in proceedings in which the trial rights of a jury and proof beyond a reasonable doubt, among other things, do not apply[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">(Citations and quotation marks omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 120, 122 S.Ct. at 592. In the Court\u2019s view, we must be dual-minded when assessing probationers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">The State has a dual concern with a probationer. On the one hand is the hope that he will successfully complete probation and be integrated back into the community. On the other is the concern, quite justified, that he will be more likely to engage in criminal conduct than an ordinary member of the community. [The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals] in this case would require the State to shut its eyes to the latter concern and concentrate only on the former. But we hold that the Fourth Amendment does not put the State to such a choice. Its interest in apprehending violators of the criminal law, thereby protecting potential victims of criminal enterprise, may therefore justifiably focus on probationers in a way that it does not on the ordinary citizen.

We acknowledged this limitation in <em>King, </em>our most recent case involving police collection of DNA. <em>See generally King, 425 </em>Md. at 563-65, 42 A.3d at 557-58. There, we examined DNA collected via a buccal swab of a person who had been arrested, but not convicted, and who was not on probation. <em>Id. </em>at 593-94, 42 A.3d at 575-76. We held that such collection was a violation of the person\u2019s Fourth Amendment constitutional rights because he was a \u201cmere arrestee,\u201d as compared to a convicted felon. <em>Id. </em>at 594, 42 A.3d at 576 (\u201cAs we held in <em>Raines, </em>once a person has been adjudicated lawfully to be a felon, his or her expectation of privacy is \u2018severely reduced\u2019 and the State\u2019s interest prevails in monitoring, identifying, reintegrating, and preventing recidivism by the felon.\u201d).

First, how should the principles of <em>Knights </em>be applied when the defendant is on restricted release from a misdemeanor, rather than from a felony, as in both <em>Knights </em>and Samson? Second, how much weight should we give to the fact that Corbin\u2019s DNA was <em>collected </em>pursuant to a probation order requiring submission to drug or alcohol monitoring, when we consider Corbin\u2019s Fourth Amendment privacy interests with regard to the <em>retention and use </em>of his DNA to investigate other crimes? We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>need not decide these questions in a vacuum. Rather, we shall consider them in the context of applying the <em>Knights </em>totality of the circumstances test to determine whether the search conducted in this case was reasonable. <em>See Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 118, 122 S.Ct. at 591.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We first consider the interests of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">A. Interests of the State</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">We start with the recognition, favorable to the State, that this was not a suspicionless search like the one the Supreme Court considered in <em>Samson. </em>In 2000, Sgt. McCauley was assigned to take over the homicide investigation respecting the 1995 death of Jacqueline Tilghman. At that point, although extensive investigation had been done, no arrest had been made. McCauley testified at the suppression hearing that he began his investigation by reading the reports written by the original investigator. By doing so, he learned the names of several people who \u201chad contact with the victim during that period of time[.]\u201d The victim had engaged in prostitution, and in some cases the phrase \u201chad contact\u201d clearly referred to having sexual relations with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">McCauley decided that he would seek DNA samples from these people, to compare against semen found on the victim and in her clothing. After securing consent and receiving test results from all except Corbin, he learned that none of their DNA matched the DNA from the semen found on the victim. With Corbin still on his list of potential suspects, McCauley next did a background check and learned that Corbin was on probation for a DWI offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">In a nutshell, we know that before McCauley approached Corbin\u2019s probation officer in February 2001, he had information to suggest that Corbin knew the victim. Furthermore, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>the people identified as associates of the victim,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Corbin was the only one whose DNA had not been tested. McCauley had other suspicious information about Corbin as well. McCauley testified at the suppression hearing that the first thing he did upon taking over the investigation was to read the entire investigation file, covering police work done over approximately five years. Information gleaned from that file included a report from a third party that the victim \u201cdid not get along with Tonto Corbin, because she refused to get involved with him;\u201d that Corbin had been seen with the victim and another person on the day of her death; and that Corbin, when arrested on an unrelated crime, \u201creluctantly stated he had intimate contact\u201d with the victim but that \u201cit was a mistake that occurred a long time ago\u201d and that he had not \u201chad any intimate contact with the victim for years preceding her death.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">We conclude that all of these facts, taken together, are sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion, as required in <em>Knights. See also United States v. Midgette, </em>478 F.3d 616, 625 (4th Cir.2007) (\u201cReasonable suspicion may be based simply upon a tip that has \u2018some particular indicia of reliability.\u2019 ... [In another case,] a tip received by a detective that \u2018there were or might be guns in [the probationer\u2019s] apartment\u2019 provided the probation officer with reasonable suspicion.\u201d (citing <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>363 F.3d 317, 324-26 (4th Cir.2004); <em>Griffin v. Wisconsin, </em>483 U.S. 868, 871, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 3167, 97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987))); <em>United States v. Hagenow, </em>423 F.3d 638, 642-43 (7th Cir.2005) (holding that police had reasonable suspicion when they received tip from a confidential informant that a probationer had guns in his home); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>United States v. Keith, </em>375 F.3d 346, 350-51 (5th Cir.2004) (applying <em>Knights </em>to hold that probationer could be searched based on reasonable suspicion, even though no condition of probation existed that expressly allowed search); <em>State v. Anderson, </em>733 N.W.2d 128 (Minn.2007) (upholding the search of probationer\u2019s home based on double hearsay information given by telephone to a police officer from a person the officer did not know, who said that her daughter knew probationer and that he had guns; holding it is \u201c \u2018reasonable to permit information provided by a police officer, whether or not on the basis of firsthand knowledge, to support a probationer search\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Griffin, </em>483 U.S. at 879-80, 107 S.Ct. at 3171-72)).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The trial court considered Corbin\u2019s status as a probationer to be significant to the balance between Corbin\u2019s rights and the State\u2019s interests, and we agree. As the Supreme Court has established, the State has a heightened interest in probationers with regard to \u201crecidivism, public safety, and reintegration[.]\u201d <em>Samson, </em>547 U.S. at 855 n. 4, 126 S.Ct. at 2201 n. 4. The Supreme Court said in <em>Knights </em>that \u201c \u2018the very assumption of the institution of probation\u2019 is that the probationer \u2018is more likely than the ordinary citizen to violate the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 120, 122 S.Ct. at 592 (quoting <em>Griffin, </em>483 U.S. at 880, 107 S.Ct. at 3172).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">As we indicated above, both <em>Knights </em>and <em>Samson </em>involved defendants on probation from felony offenses, and it was clear that the Supreme Court and this Court focused only on felony probationers. Although the record does not contain the verdict against Corbin for the DWI, we assume that Corbin was convicted of a misdemeanor. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1977, 2009 Repl. Vol., 2011 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 27-101(a) of the Transportation Article (\u201cIt is a misdemeanor for any person to violate any of the provisions of the Maryland Vehicle Law unless the violation: (1) Is declared to be a felony by the Maryland Vehicle Law or by any other law of this State; or (2) Is punishable by a civil penalty under the applicable provision of the Maryland Vehicle Law.\u201d). We have no information to suggest that Corbin\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>underlying DWI offense was a felony or was punishable only by a civil penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Yet this misdemeanor offense, unlike many misdemeanors, carries the potential for significant jail time. Drunken driving carries the allowable penalty of imprisonment for up to one year (first offense), two years (second offense) or three years (third offense). <em>See generally </em>\u00a7 27-101(k)(1) of the Transportation Article. Moreover, we consider the serious nature of a drunk driving offense. According to the Maryland Task Force to Combat Driving under the Influence of Drugs and Alcohol (\u201cTask Force\u201d), \u201can average of 220 people died annually as a result of impaired-driving-related crashes on Maryland roads between 2004 and 2007.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Task Force to Combat Driving under the Influence of Drugs and Alcohol, <em>Findings and Recommendations </em>1-2 (October 2008). This equates to eighteen deaths each month, or a death every 40 hours, and such impaired-driving-related crashes make up approximately 40 percent of all traffic crashes in Maryland. <em>See id. As </em>the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration explains, \u201cimpaired driving can be defined as a reduction in the performance of critical driving tasks due to the effects of alcohol or other drugs. It is a serious crime that kills [nationally] every 30 minutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Drunken driving also has a high rate of recidivism. <em>See id. </em>at 3-44 (\u201cAn increasing number of [DWI] arrests are repeat offenders. It is important that repeat offenders be effectively identified so that appropriate sanctions, assessment, and treatment can be provided to reduce [the] risk of repeated offenses.\u201d); <em>cf. </em>Section 27-101(k)(1) of the Transportation Article (providing increased penalties for repeat offenders). Although a chronic DWI offender may not intend to commit injury when he undertakes to drive while impaired, injuries and fatalities still occur, and the State\u2019s interest in monitoring such conduct is as great as if the injuries were intended. Thus, it is fair to say that the Supreme Court\u2019s rationale for increased control over probationers applies here as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>For these reasons, we hold that a person on probation from a drunken driving offense has, like the probationer in <em>Knights, </em>a significantly diminished expectation of privacy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, a probationer\u2019s expectation of privacy is diminished even when the new crime under investigation is not related to the crime that led to the probation sentence. <em>See Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 117-18, 122 S.Ct. at 590-91. Accordingly, that Corbin\u2019s probation stems from a drunken driving offense does not proscribe applying the <em>Knights </em>\u201cdiminished expectation\u201d rationale to a murder investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">B. Corbin\u2019s Privacy Interests</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">We now shift our focus to examine Corbin\u2019s rights and legitimate expectations. First, we consider the distinction Corbin suggests between the breath test ordinarily used to detect alcohol and the test used in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">The breath test ordinarily used to detect alcohol would have required Mr. Corbin to only blow into a cup-like device placed over his mouth. The \u201cdeep-lung\u201d test required Mr. Corbin to place a straw in his mouth, create a tight seal around it with his lips, and blow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">We are not persuaded that this difference is material. Corbin did not object to parting with his saliva. As far as he was aware, the purported invasion of privacy was no different than what he endured every month as required by the terms of his probation. We see no greater invasion of privacy just because one must exert his facial muscles a little extra to perform the \u201cdeep-lung\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">We do not ignore the more profound notion that Corbin\u2019s privacy is implicated not only by submission to the breathalyzer, but also by the entry of the profile into CODIS, the national DNA database. <em>See Skinner, </em>489 U.S. at 616, 109 S.Ct. at 1413 (\u201cThe ensuing chemical analysis of the sample to obtain physiological data is a further invasion of the tested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>employee\u2019s privacy interests.\u201d). In his brief, Corbin eloquently narrates the potential for seismic changes in an individual\u2019s relationship with government and loss of privacy that may arise as police take advantage of scientific advances in the field of cellular biology.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We share concerns about these unsettling scenarios posited by Corbin. Even so, we must balance our concerns for individual privacy with the legitimate needs of the State, and we must draw lines, an often exacting chore, reaching imperfect results.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">C. Balancing</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Based on the Supreme Court holdings in <em>Knights </em>and <em>Samson, </em>and our own precedent, we conclude that the circumstances presented here fall on the State\u2019s side of the balance. It is a key factor that Corbin\u2019s DNA was collected during his regular, probation-mandated testing for alcohol abuse. The reasonable suspicions generated by the police\u2019s investigation of the murder further tilt this factor in the State\u2019s favor. Unlike the Petitioner in <em>King, </em>Corbin forfeited much of his right to privacy, if only for a limited time, by accepting probation for his earlier crime. Even if we were to consider the entry of Corbin\u2019s legally obtained DNA into CODIS as a second search, the larger concerns for privacy presented in Corbin\u2019s brief are not manifested in this case because such entry occurred, and the match was found, while he was still on probation. We see nothing in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence that allots a probationer a privacy interest that would prevent law enforcement, <em>during </em>the period of probation, from testing his legally collected DNA against the CODIS. <em>Compare generally United States v. Davis, </em>657 F.Supp.2d 630 (D.Md.2009) (police legally obtained DNA from defendant\u2019s hospital visit, but violated the Fourth Amendment by retaining the DNA profile in a database for use years later).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Other privacy questions will remain for another day. We do not decide, for example, how long Corbin\u2019s DNA may remain in CODIS, especially if State law is modified to allow use of DNA for purposes other than merely creating an identifying profile, or if scientific advances make it feasible to extract predictive genetic information from the \u201cjunk\u201d DNA already gathered. <em>See, e.g., King, </em>425 Md. at 568 n. 17, 42 A.3d at 560 n. 17 (\u201cThere is ... considerable current debate as to whether these \u2018non-coding\u2019 or \u2018junk\u2019 DNA provide no predictive genetic information.\u201d) (citing Simon A. Cole, <em>Is the \u2018Junk\u2019 DNA Designation Bunk?, </em>102 Nw. U.L.Rev. 54, 54 (2007)); <em>United States v. Weikert, </em>504 F.3d 1, 12-13 (1st Cir.2007) (\u201c[W]e agree that, should the uses to which \u2018junk DNA\u2019 can be put be shown in the future to be significantly greater than the record before us today suggests, a reconsideration of the reasonableness balance struck would be necessary. However, on the record before us, the possibility that junk DNA may not be junk DNA some day also does not significantly augment [the] privacy interest in the present case.\u201d (citation and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In sum, Corbin expected to submit to a breath test, and he did so at the ordinary time and place called for by his probation schedule. McCauley waited approximately a month for Corbin to come in for customary alcohol monitoring by his probation agent. We reject out of hand Corbin\u2019s argument that \u201cthe only governmental interest assert[ed] was to evade judicial scrutiny.\u201d He rests this theory on McCauley\u2019s testimony that he surreptitiously collected Corbin\u2019s DNA because he did not want to \u201ctip [his] hand\u201d by obtaining a search warrant. That the State has a heightened interest in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>probationer has been firmly established by the Supreme Court in <em>Knights </em>and <em>Samson, </em>and nothing McCauley said or failed to say in answer to that particular question detracts from that interest. Indeed, the Supreme Court in <em>Knights </em>found legitimate a warrantless surprise search of a probationer\u2019s home. Surely, Knights\u2019s expectation of privacy in his home was greater than Corbin\u2019s expectation of privacy in a straw that the State supplied for use in its fully legitimate monitoring of Corbin\u2019s alcohol consumption, and that was never in Corbin\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Accordingly, Corbin cannot meet the two-part test for a legitimate privacy interest outlined in <em>Williamson </em>and our other cases. <em>See Williamson, </em>413 Md. at 534, 993 A.2d at 634; <em>Venner v. State, </em>279 Md. 47, 51-52, 367 A.2d 949, 952 (1977). Corbin\u2019s claim fails, and we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the DNA evidence connecting him to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\n<em>II. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Corbin also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence against him. The trial court convicted Corbin of involuntary manslaughter, and the conclusion that Corbin \u201cwas present at the time of the death of the victim\u201d was a foundation of the conviction. Corbin attacks this portion of the trial court\u2019s conclusion, arguing that it \u201clacks reasonable support in the statement of facts.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>\u201cThe critical inquiry on review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction ... is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>415 Md. 174, 184, 999 A.2d 986, 991 (2010). As we explained, this standard applies when circumstantial evidence is the basis for a conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">Circumstantial evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction, but not if that evidence amounts only to strong suspicion or mere probability. Although circumstantial evidence alone is sufficient to sustain a conviction, the inferences made from circumstantial evidence must rest upon more than mere speculation or conjecture. (Citations and quotation marks omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 185, 999 A.2d at 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Corbin directs us to the physical evidence \u2014 semen from multiple men was found on the victim\u2019s clothing. Corbin thus argues that the victim had sex with multiple partners in an indeterminable order on the night she was killed. From there, he claims it is impossible to determine who was present when the victim was killed, which creates reasonable doubt of Corbin\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The State counters that the evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that Corbin is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Corbin\u2019s semen was found in the victim\u2019s vagina and anus, but not on her clothing \u2014 according to the facts read into the record at the Circuit Court \u2014 and the State says this indicates the victim did not stand up after having sexual intercourse with Corbin. According to the State, the victim\u2019s failure to stand up after intercourse, combined with the. circumstances in which her body was found \u2014 partially naked in a field on a below-freezing night \u2014 demonstrates that Corbin inflicted the fatal blows.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Indeed, the following relevant facts were stipulated: the victim was found lying on her back; Corbin\u2019s semen was found in the victim\u2019s body, but none of it was found in her underwear; and semen from another man was found in the crotch area of her panties, which were found around the ankle of her right leg. From those facts, fair and rational inferences could be drawn that the panties had been moved from her waist area after another man had sex with her and before Corbin ejaculated; Corbin was the last one to have sex with her; the victim remained in a supine position after Corbin ejaculated; and thus Corbin was the one who killed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Tellingly, the record also indicates Corbin lied to the police twice about his sexual history with the victim before admitting he had sexual intercourse with her near the time she died. As the Court of Special Appeals described:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">Among the undisputed facts are that Ms. Tilghman was seen alive at approximately 1:30 a.m. on the day she was killed, wearing the same clothes that were found with her body at 7:30 a.m. that day and that Corbin admitted having had sex with the victim as late as 3:00 a.m. on that day. Thus, Ms. Tilghman, after 1:30 a.m., would have to have changed clothes, encountered Corbin, engaged in consensual sex with him (presumably in a warm place), changed back into the same clothes she had worn earlier, gone out from that place, and encountered the murderer. Or, after 1:30 a.m., she would have to have encountered Corbin, engaged in sex with him (presumably in a warm place), put back on the same clothes she was wearing earlier, gone out from that place, and encountered the murderer. Under either scenario, the finder of fact, in order to conjure a reasonable hypothesis of innocence, would have to conclude that the actual murderer transported Ms. Tilghman from the place of their encounter [to where she was found] without a detectable and identifiable trace of Corbin\u2019s semen getting on her panties. Further, the fact finder would have to conclude that, once in the [field], the actual murderer beat the victim, took down her clothing, and strangled her, but never raped her, or raped her \"without leaving any semen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>and without disturbing, from any orifice, the residuals of semen deposits made by Corbin at 3:00 a.m.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Viewing these facts in the light most favorable to the prosecution, in concert with the State\u2019s theory of the timing of the events on the night of the slaying, we believe a rational trier of fact could conclude that Corbin was present at the time of the victim\u2019s death. A rational trier of fact could further conclude that involuntary manslaughter was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. We therefore hold that sufficient evidence exists to sustain Corbin\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the Circuit Court for Somerset County\u2019s denial of Corbin\u2019s motion to suppress the DNA evidence from the straw. We also affirm the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 judgment that the evidence was legally sufficient to convict Corbin.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

State, </em>413 Md. 521, 993 A.2d 626 (2010), but also because I believe that the majority inappropriately extends an already unfounded legal analysis expounded in <em>King v. State, </em>425 Md. 550, 42 A.3d 549 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">I. Abandonment</p>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">In <em>Williamson v. State, </em>413 Md. at 536-42, 993 A.2d at 635-38, Kelroy Williamson, who had been convicted of rape as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>as other charges, argued that DNA evidence recovered from a cup that he discarded after eating a meal, while being detained on charges related to an open arrest warrant, not the subject of the DNA analysis, should have been suppressed, because of an alleged privacy interest in the cup. We held that Williamson</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">unequivocally abandoned the McDonald\u2019s cup after he had been offered a meal, accepted it, and then threw the debris from the meal on the floor. He certainly did not retain the cup as his own and clearly, while in the premises of the prison, could not reasonably expect that the police would not collect, and potentially investigate, the trash he discarded in his cell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-5\"><em>Williamson, </em>413 Md. at 536-37, 993 A.2d at 635. In holding that the motion to suppress the DNA evidence obtained was properly denied by the trial court, because Williamson had abandoned the cup, we relied on <em>Venner v. State, </em>279 Md. 47, 367 A.2d 949 (1977), as well as <em>United States v. Cox, </em>428 F.2d 683 (7th Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In <em>Venner, </em>Charles Venner, who had been convicted of drug charges, argued that the evidence obtained from seizing balloons containing hashish oil from his stools, deposited in a hospital bedpan, should have been suppressed because officers did not secure a search warrant. <em>Venner, </em>279 Md. at 48-49, 367 A.2d at 950-51. We held that Venner\u2019s motion to suppress this evidence was properly denied because the stools were abandoned property and not subject to the protections of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">In <em>Cox, </em>the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit considered whether DNA evidence obtained from the warrant-less seizure of hair clippings taken from a prisoner was subject to suppression. Cox was in State police custody as a suspect in a robbery when FBI agents arranged for prison officials to give Cox a routine haircut. After the haircut, the clippings were retained by the prison officials and DNA extracted from them was used as evidence. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit noted that \u201cthe \u2018seizure\u2019 did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>not occur when the hair was cut, but when the government preserved and appropriated the clippings which the defendant had voluntarily abandoned.\u201d <em>Cox, </em>428 F.2d at 687. Additionally, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, akin to our analysis in <em>Venner, </em>stated that \u201cCox, however, never indicated any desire or intention to retain possession of the hair after it had been scissored from his head. Clippings such as those preserved in the instant case are ordinarily abandoned after being cut. Cox in fact left his hair and never claimed otherwise.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Under <em>Williamson, </em>the threshold inquiry was whether the property upon which the DNA was deposited had been abandoned \u2014 whether the depositor had ever indicated any desire to retain the item within which the DNA was contained or upon which it was deposited. <em>See Stanberry v. State, </em>343 Md. 720, 731, 737, 684 A.2d 823, 829, 831 (1996) (\u201cIntent to abandon must ordinarily be assessed based on external manifestations such as the owners words and actions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Lest from the majority one think that abandonment does not have any contemporary \u201cfeet,\u201d I need only refer to <em>People v. Thomas, </em>200 Cal.App.4th 338, 132 Cal.Rptr.3d 714 (2011), discussing facts remarkably similar to the case at bar, in which Thomas had been driving his car when police pulled him over for traffic violations and gave him an alcohol breath test. He passed the test and was allowed to leave, but police retained the plastic cap upon which he placed his mouth when taking the breath test. DNA was recovered from the straw linking Thomas to a rash of burglaries, for which he was convicted. In rejecting Thomas\u2019s argument that his DNA was collected in violation of the Fourth Amendment, the California intermediate appellate court held that Thomas \u201cabandoned any expectation of privacy in the saliva he deposited on the device when he failed to wipe it off.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342, 132 Cal.Rptr.3d 714. The court reasoned that, because Thomas had implicitly consented to the alcohol testing under the California vehicle code as a result of his licensure, he could not contest the validity of the acquisition of his saliva, and, because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>abandoned his saliva, he could not contest its later testing for DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Abandonment, thus, provides a viable analytical framework in this case, based on our jurisprudence and especially that of the Seventh Circuit in <em>Cox, </em>which addressed abandonment of <em>hair clippings </em>that were collected by authorities. Certainly, if the minutiae of hair clippings can be abandoned, so clearly can saliva on a straw be.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The majority, however, does not even mention, let alone distinguish, <em>Cox </em>and <em>Venner, </em>although relied upon by the State, nor attempts to explain why the rationale of abandonment is not viable. Rather, the majority simply states that, \u201c[w]e do not subscribe to the notion that the Fourth Amendment is not applicable because Corbin <em>voluntarily </em>ceded a privacy interest in his saliva and the straw by failing to make an effort to \u2018gain possession\u2019 of the State-owned and State-administered testing apparatus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">This notion of voluntariness pervades Corbin\u2019s assertions but in the context of a situation in which he was forced to blow into the straw, thus involuntarily depositing his DNA. The issue is not whether he was forced to use a straw, but, rather, whether he abandoned the straw onto which he deposited his DNA, just as in <em>Cox, </em>428 F.2d 683 (7th Cir.1970), in which Cox was required to submit to a haircut, but was found to have voluntarily abandoned his hair clippings, because \u201cCox ... never indicated any desire or intention to retain possession of the hair after it had been scissored from his head____Having voluntarily abandoned his property, in this case his hair, Cox may not object to its appropriation by the Government.\u201d <em>Cox, </em>428 F.2d at 687-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Whether or not Corbin earlier refused to provide a DNA sample also is not relevant to the analysis of abandonment of the straw, as the Massachusetts and New York Courts have recognized. In <em>Commonwealth v. Bly, </em>448 Mass. 473, 862 N.E.2d 341 (2007), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts considered whether it was proper for a trial court to admit DNA evidence obtained from cigarettes and a water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>bottle left behind by the defendant after a police interrogation. Bly had been incarcerated in the Massachusetts Correctional Institutional at Norfolk for an unrelated matter when police visited him to ask for a blood sample to use in a murder investigation. Bly refused to give a blood sample, but he smoked three cigarettes from a pack provided by police and drank from a water bottle they also had provided him. After the meeting between Bly and the police was over, detectives collected the cigarette butts and water bottle for DNA analysis. <em>Bly, </em>862 N.E.2d at 349 n. 3. Bly sought to suppress the DNA match between his DNA left on the items at the jail and the DNA evidence, claiming his Fourth Amendment rights were violated. In affirming the denial of the motion to suppress the DNA evidence, the court held that Bly did not manifest a subjective expectation of privacy in DNA left on the discarded cigarette butts and water bottle, despite his earlier refusal to provide a DNA sample, because he made no effort to reclaim the items or take them with him after his interview with police. <em>Id. </em>at 356-57. Moreover, the court did not find compelling Ely\u2019s contention that because the institutional rules prevented him from leaving with items with which he did not arrive, he did not freely abandon his property. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In <em>People v. Sterling, </em>57 A.D.3d 1110, 869 N.Y.S.2d 288 (2008), the New York intermediate appellate court considered whether DNA evidence that was obtained from a milk carton left over from lunch was properly admitted against Sterling, who had been convicted on charges of rape, sodomy, and burglary. <em>Id. </em>at 289. Sterling was incarcerated in the Tioga County Jail for an unrelated offense when police arranged a meeting with him to ask for a DNA sample in connection with the crimes for which he was ultimately convicted. After he refused to give the sample, a correctional officer was ordered to retain whatever remained from Sterling\u2019s lunch tray for DNA analysis. Sterling unsuccessfully sought to suppress the DNA evidence obtained from the milk carton from his lunch, arguing that it was the product of an illegal search, but, as in <em>Bly, </em>the appellate court in <em>Sterling </em>did not accept Sterling\u2019s contention that his previous refusal to give a DNA sample was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>sufficient to manifest an expectation of privacy in his DNA on the discarded milk carton.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Thus, unlike what the majority in this case rejects, abandonment is a basis for the retrieval of Corbin\u2019s DNA from the straw.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">II. King</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>King v. State, </em>425 Md. 550, 42 A.3d 549 (2012), also is misplaced and cannot be reconciled with the rationale utilized by the <em>King </em>majority. The muddle is partly a result of the confusion created by the majority opinion in <em>King, </em>which was decided subsequent to <em>Williamson </em>and which, <em>sub silentio, </em>eviscerates one of its underpinnings. The <em>Corbin </em>majority also further jumbles <em>King </em>by providing for DNA collection when DNA could not have been collected under the statute interpreted in <em>King.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">In <em>King, </em>the Court considered the validity, also under the Fourth Amendment, of additions, in 2008, to the Maryland DNA Collection Act, Section 2-501 <em>et. seq. </em>of the Public Safety Article, Maryland Code (2003, 2011 Repl.Vol.). Specifically at issue was Section 2-504(3), which provided for the collection of DNA samples for individuals who were arrested and charged, but not yet convicted,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of either a crime of violence or burglary, or an attempt thereof.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>King had been arrested for first and second degree assault. After he was transported to Central Booking following his arrest, King\u2019s DNA was collected pursuant to Section 2-504(3) of the DNA Collection Act, because he was arrested and charged with a crime of violence. After processing his DNA sample and uploading his DNA profile onto the Maryland DNA database, police received a hit that King\u2019s DNA matched evidence recovered from an unsolved rape. The. rape happened approximately six years before King\u2019s DNA was collected and involved a man wearing a scarf over his face and a hat, armed with a handgun, breaking into a woman\u2019s home. The victim was unable to identify her assailant at the time the crime occurred, and police did not make any arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">After being notified of the match, police presented the evidence to a grand jury, which returned an indictment against King for numerous crimes, including first degree rape. The police also obtained a search warrant to collect a second DNA sample from King. In an effort to suppress the DNA samples collected from him, King argued that the DNA Collection Act was unconstitutional, such that his DNA was impermissibly collected after his arrest for assault and, \u201ctherefore King\u2019s arrest was invalid.\u201d <em>King v. State, </em>425 Md. at 559, 42 A.3d at 554. The trial judge disagreed, relying on the principles in our opinion in <em>State v. Raines </em>to uphold the constitutionality of the DNA Collection Act as applied to arrestees, and King was ultimately convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Before us, King argued that, because he was a mere arrestee and not a convict, he was \u201ccloaked with the assumption of innocence until proven guilty,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 562, 42 A.3d at 556, such that the warrantless and suspicionless collection of his DNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>was a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The State countered that the DNA Act limits the use of lawfully acquired DNA to only identification, and that the government has a compelling interest in correctly identifying arrestees, while \u201carrestees have no expectation of privacy in their identity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, the <em>King </em>majority held the DNA collected from King should have been suppressed, because of its assessment that collecting King\u2019s DNA under the Act was an unconstitutional violation of his privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In reaching its holding suppressing the DNA results, the majority employed the totality of the circumstances test enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Knights, </em>534 U.S. 112, 122 S.Ct. 587, 151 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001). Under that test, a court must evaluate the reasonableness of a warrantless search or seizure \u201cby assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual\u2019s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate government interests.\u201d <em>King, </em>425 Md. at 563, 42 A.3d at 557, quoting <em>Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 118\u2014119, 122 S.Ct. at 591, 151 L.Ed.2d at 505 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The <em>King </em>majority opined that King had \u201can expectation of privacy to be free from warrantless searches of his biological material and all of the information contained within that material.\u201d <em>King, </em>425 Md. at 595, 42 A.3d at 576. The Court directly rejected the analogy between fingerprints and DNA, an analogy we explicitly sanctioned two years before in <em>Williamson v. State, </em>413 Md. 521, 542, 993 A.2d 626, 639 (2010), juxtaposing the theories that, \u201c[t]he information derived from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>a fingerprint is related only to physical characteristics and can be used to identify a person, but no more,\u201d while a \u201cDNA sample, obtained through a buccal swab, contains within it unarguably much more than a person\u2019s identity.\u201d <em>King, </em>425 Md. at 595-96, 42 A.3d at 576-77. The majority was unable to \u201cturn a blind eye to the vast genetic treasure map that remains in the DNA sample retained by the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596, 42 A.3d at 577. Balanced against this vast \u201ctreasure map\u201d of genetic markers, as yet undiscovered and undocumented, the government\u2019s interests in including and excluding perpetrators of serious crimes fell short.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">This vast treasure trove analysis remains, however, the stuff of conjecture, because, as we recognized in <em>Williamson v. State, </em>413 Md. 521, 993 A.2d 626 (2010), the DNA Collection Act limits the use of DNA collected to identification only, both to include and exclude suspects, such that the use of DNA profiles is \u201cakin to that of a fingerprint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542, 993 A.2d at 639. Importantly, in <em>Williamson, </em>we recognized that the argument that a DNA sample under the Act could be used for much more than identification as nothing more than a \u201cparade of horribles\u201d that had not been shown to have occurred, stating that \u201c[w]hile there may be debate regarding privacy concerns should technological advances permit testing of DNA to glean more information from acquired DNA than mere identification, that debate does not have \u2018feet\u2019 in the present case.\u201d <em>Williamson, </em>413 Md. at 543, 993 A.2d at 639. The debate did not have any more foundation in <em>King, </em>decided two years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The <em>King </em>holding, as it eviscerated <em>Williamson, </em>is now itself undercut by the majority in this case, because, under Section 2-504(a)(1) of the DNA Collection Act, DNA can be collected only from people convicted of \u201ca felony or a violation of [Section] 6-205 or [Section] 6-206 of the Criminal Law Article,\u201d penalizing burglary in the fourth degree and the possession of burglar\u2019s tools with the intent to break into a motor vehicle, as well as being present in a motor vehicle with the intent to commit a theft of the vehicle or property therein, respectively. Thus, unless an individual is convicted of one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>those offenses or consents<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> absent a warrant, DNA cannot be collected. In the present case, Corbin was convicted of driving under the influence, a misdemeanor,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which is <em>not </em>among the offenses for which one is convicted, where DNA collection is authorized under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">As a result of the present case interpreting the Fourth Amendment, a probationer convicted of a crime for which DNA could not be collected under the DNA Collection Act, will have his DNA collected without his consent and without a warrant, although our Legislature clearly did not provide for such in the Act. Although the instant majority would have the distinction hinge on the fact that the present case does not involve statutory interpretation, as in <em>King, </em>both this case and <em>King </em>involve a Fourth Amendment analysis. Reconciliation can only be that those on probation, even for petty offenses, have no expectation of privacy in the \u201ctreasure trove\u201d of their genetics, while arrestees for felonies, even with serious records, do in their identification. Conversely, then the State, according to the majority, has a greater interest in collecting DNA from someone convicted of driving under the influence than it does in collecting DNA from an individual arrested on probable cause for a crime of violence. The equation is all wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Because I believe Corbin abandoned the straw, I would affirm his conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-9\">. Previously, in <em>State v. Raines, </em>383 Md. 1, 857 A.2d 19 (2004), we upheld the validity of the DNA collection statute with respect to those convicted of a qualifying crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b549-10\">.

Through further investigation, the police learned that Corbin was on probation for a DWI offense and was required \u201cto submit to breath tests for alcohol consumption^]\u201d Sgt. McCauley arranged for Corbin\u2019s probation officer to administer to Corbin a \u201cdeep lung test\u201d in March 2001. This test, unlike the passive breath test that is ordinarily administered to probationers, requires the person taking the test to use a straw to give a breath sample. The person taking the test places his or her \u201clips around the end of the straw and [is asked to] exhale[ ] as deep a breath as possible from the lung capacity.\u201d At the investigator\u2019s request, the probation officer prearranged, without Corbin\u2019s knowledge or consent, to \u201cretain custody of the straw so that the saliva on it could be tested for DNA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Corbin\u2019s DNA from the straw was collected and tested and determined to be a match to that found on swabs taken from the victim. On the basis of this information, the police obtained a search warrant for another DNA sample from Corbin. After losing on his motion to suppress the DNA evidence collected and tested, Corbin proceeded to trial in the Circuit Court for Somerset County, on an agreed statement of facts. The trial judge found Corbin guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the death of Ms. Tilghman and sentenced him to ten years\u2019 incarceration, with all but eight years suspended, and two years of supervised probation. Following the appeal of his conviction to the Court of Special Appeals, Corbin requested <em>certiorari </em>in this Court, and we granted his petition. In this Court, as in the proceedings in the Circuit Court and in the Court of Special Appeals, Corbin maintains that his Constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment has been violated. Specifically, in this Court, Corbin asserts that the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that he had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the breath test straw or in the saliva <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>thereon. In addition, he argues that this Court should \u201creject the seriously flawed analogy between a DNA profile and a fingerprint\u201d that was drawn by this Court in <em>Williamson v. State, </em>418 Md. 521, 993 A.2d 626 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Primarily for the reasons expressed in Chief Judge Bell\u2019s well-written and comprehensive dissenting opinion in <em>Williamson </em>\u2014 namely, the principle that DNA testing and analysis is a separate search subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny \u2014 I would reverse Corbin\u2019s conviction and remand the case to the Circuit Court for Somerset County for a new trial. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures .... \u201d U.S. Const. amend. IV. The United States Supreme Court has explained that \u201cthe reasonableness of a search is determined by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which it intrudes upon an individual\u2019s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\u201d <em>United States v. Knights, </em>534 U.S. 112, 118-19, 122 S.Ct. 587, 591, 151 L.Ed.2d 497, 505 (2001) (internal quotation omitted). Even though the breathalyzer test administered to Corbin was reasonable, the DNA testing and analysis performed on Cor-bin\u2019s saliva, left on the straw, was a separate search that also needed to satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. Thus, so long as Corbin possessed a reasonable expectation of privacy in his DNA, the DNA evidence gathered, analyzed, and used for investigative purposes, without a warrant and without Corbin\u2019s consent, was obtained in violation of his Constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">It is well settled that probationers \u201cdo not enjoy the absolute liberty to which every citizen is entitled, but only ... conditional liberty properly dependent on observance of special [probation] restrictions.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Wisconsin, </em>483 U.S. 868, 874, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 3169, 97 L.Ed.2d 709, 718 (1987) (internal quotation omitted). Courts have also recognized, however, that a probationer\u2019s expectation of privacy is not extinguished by his probationary status. <em>See Griffin, </em>483 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>at 875, 107 S.Ct. at 3169, 97 L.Ed.2d at 718 (noting that probationary status \u201cpermit[s] a degree of impingement upon privacy that would not be constitutional if applied to the public at large. That permissible degree is not unlimited, however ... \u201d); <em>United States v. Amerson, </em>483 F.3d 73, 84 (2d Cir.2007) (declaring that \u201c[probationers ... have diminished \u2014 but far from extinguished \u2014 reasonable expectations of privacy\u201d). Instead, probation is \u201cone point ... on a continuum of possible punishments ranging from solitary confinement in a maximum-security facility to a few hours of mandatory community service.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>483 U.S. at 874, 107 S.Ct. at 3169, 97 L.Ed.2d at 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">In the present case, Corbin\u2019s status as a probationer, coupled with the condition that he submit to periodic alcohol testing, clearly diminished his expectation of privacy; however, his probationary status and his conditions of probation did not eliminate his reasonable expectation of privacy in his own DNA. <em>See Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 119-20, 120 n. 6, 122 S.Ct. at 591-92, 592 n. 6, 151 L.Ed.2d at 505-06, 505 n. 6. Rather, not unlike the petitioner in <em>Williamson, </em>Corbin possessed a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information contained in his DNA, which triggered Fourth Amendment protection. Therefore, the detectives investigating the murder were required to comply with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment before gathering and analyzing Corbin\u2019s DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Importantly, in my view, a probationer\u2019s diminished expectation of privacy is not limitless in its scope. <em>See State v. Raines, </em>383 Md. 1, 65, 857 A.2d 19, 57-58 (2004) (Bell, C.J., dissenting) (expressing concern that there were no limitations placed on the respondent\u2019s diminished expectation of privacy as a result of his status as a convicted felon). I disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that a search performed while an individual is on probation need not relate to the conditions of probation or the underlying offense(s). <em>See Corbin v. State, </em>428 Md. 488, 501-02, 52 A.3d 946, 954, 2012 WL 3588705 (2012). The majority discusses the various problems associated with the serious offense of drunken driving. <em>See Corbin, </em>428 Md. at 509-10, 52 A.3d at 958. Accordingly, the conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>of probation imposed upon an individual convicted of an alcohol-related offense, and police action in connection therewith, should be aimed at decreasing or deterring problems associated with the underlying offense. The breathalyzer testing that Corbin agreed to submit to periodically was reasonably related to the offense for which he was convicted and placed on probation. DNA testing and analysis of saliva left on an alcohol monitoring instrument, to be used in connection with an unrelated homicide investigation, however, has no relation to decreasing or deterring the occurrence of alcohol-related offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In general, restrictions placed on a probationer during the probation period \u201care meant to assure that the probation serves as a period of genuine rehabilitation and that the community is not harmed by the probationer\u2019s being at large.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>483 U.S. at 875, 107 S.Ct. at 3169, 97 L.Ed.2d at 718; <em>see Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 119, 122 S.Ct. at 591, 151 L.Ed.2d at 505 (noting that \u201cthe two primary goals of probation [are] rehabilitation and protecting society from future criminal violations\u201d). In addition, the State has an interest in \u201creducing recidivism and thereby promoting reintegration and positive citizenship among probationers and parolees[.]\u201d <em>Samson v. California, </em>547 U.S. 843, 853, 126 S.Ct. 2193, 2200, 165 L.Ed.2d 250, 260 (2006). DNA testing of Corbin\u2019s saliva, obtained from the instrument used to conduct the deep lung breath test, did not directly serve any of the enumerated purposes of probation. Reducing recidivism rates is geared toward combating the occurrence of future, not past, crimes. The murder allegedly committed by Corbin had occurred years prior to his conviction for the DWI offense; the collection and testing of Corbin\u2019s DNA, obtained to aid in finding and convicting the perpetrator of the murder, therefore, had nothing to do with deterring Corbin from re-offending. In addition, to the extent that the periodic breath tests were aimed at rehabilitating Corbin or protecting society from the possibility of Corbin committing DWI offenses in the future, DNA testing of Corbin\u2019s saliva in relation to an ongoing murder investigation did not serve those purposes. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>fore, if Corbin had a diminished expectation of privacy, stemming from his probationary status, that diminished expectation should not have extended to searches that had no relation to the underlying crime, to the conditions of probation, or to the purposes of probation in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The majority employs a totality of the circumstances analysis in determining whether the officers\u2019 actions violated the unreasonable search prohibition of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Corbin, </em>428 Md. at 502-03, 52 A.3d at 954-55. Relying on <em>United States v. Knights, </em>534 U.S. 112, 122 S.Ct. 587, 151 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001), the majority concludes that the search was reasonable, in light of Corbin\u2019s diminished expectation of privacy as a probationer. <em>Corbin, </em>428 Md. at 510, 52 A.3d at 958. I agree with the majority that the breathalyzer test was reasonable, considering Corbin\u2019s probation status and the inclusion of alcohol monitoring in his probation order, which Corbin apparently agreed to comply with as a condition of probation. The subsequent DNA testing and analysis performed on Corbin\u2019s saliva, however, was a separate and distinct search, and the record does not support the conclusion that Corbin consented to or agreed to the search as one of the conditions of his probation. Therefore, the case <em>sub judice </em>is distinguishable from the facts and analysis in <em>Knights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In that case, Knights was on probation for a drug offense. <em>Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 114, 122 S.Ct. at 589, 151 L.Ed.2d at 502. His probation order included the following condition: \u201cthat Knights would \u2018[sjubmit his ... person, property, place of residence, vehicle, personal effects, to search at any time, with or without a search warrant, warrant of arrest or reasonable cause by any probation officer or law enforcement officer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Knights signed the probation order, indicating he had read and understood its terms. <em>Id. </em>During the period of Knights\u2019s probation, police conducted a warrantless search of his home that produced contraband. <em>Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 115, 122 S.Ct. at 589, 151 L.Ed.2d at 503. Knights moved to suppress the evidence at trial, and the trial judge granted the motion on the ground that the search was for investigatory, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>probationary, purposes. <em>Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 116, 122 S.Ct. at 590, 151 L.Ed.2d at 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">On review, the Supreme Court addressed whether the search had violated Knights\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. <em>Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 116, 122 S.Ct. at 590, 151 L.Ed.2d at 503. The Supreme Court examined the reasonableness of the search at issue by conducting a totality of the circumstances analysis. <em>Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 118, 122 S.Ct. at 591, 151 L.Ed.2d at 505. Highlighting the conditions present in the probation order and the fact that Knights was unambiguously informed of them, the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he probation condition thus significantly diminished Knights\u2019[s] reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 119-20, 122 S.Ct. at 591-92, 151 L.Ed.2d at 505. The Supreme Court balanced Knights\u2019s diminished expectation of privacy against the State\u2019s interests and concluded, \u201cWhen an officer has reasonable suspicion that a probationer subject to a search condition is engaged in criminal activity, there is enough likelihood that criminal conduct is occurring that an intrusion on the probationer\u2019s significantly diminished privacy interests is reasonable.\u201d <em>Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 121, 122 S.Ct. at 592-93, 151 L.Ed.2d at 506-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In <em>Samson v. California, </em>547 U.S. 843, 847, 126 S.Ct. 2193, 2196, 165 L.Ed.2d 250, 256 (2006), the United States Supreme Court relied on its opinion in <em>Knights </em>in confronting the issue of \u201cwhether a condition of release can so diminish or eliminate a released prisoner\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy that a suspicionless search by a law enforcement officer would not offend the Fourth Amendment.\u201d In reviewing its analysis in <em>Knights, </em>the Supreme Court commented that it had found Knights\u2019s probation status and the conditions set out in the probation order, as well as the fact that Knights was unambiguously aware of the conditions, important factors in its totality of the circumstances analysis. <em>Samson, </em>547 U.S. at 848-49, 126 S.Ct. at 2197, 165 L.Ed.2d at 257. The Supreme Court emphasized in <em>Samson </em>that \u201cthe search at issue in <em>Knights </em>was predicated on <em>both </em>the probation search condition <em>and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>reasonable suspicion[.]\u201d <em>Samson, 547 U.S. </em>at 850, 126 S.Ct. at 2198, 165 L.Ed.2d at 258 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Unlike the respondent in <em>Knights, </em>the challenged search in the instant case was not included as a condition in Corbin\u2019s probation order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While alcohol monitoring, in the form of periodic breath tests, was listed as a condition of probation, to which Corbin apparently agreed, the record does not support the conclusion that the DNA testing and analysis stemming from the breath tests were included in the order. The Supreme Court made clear in <em>Knights, </em>and later affirmed in <em>Samson, </em>that Knights\u2019s expectation of privacy was diminished by his status as a probationer <em>as well as </em>the specific probation condition that informed him of the warrantless searches to which he could be subjected. The Supreme Court considered the probation search condition a \u201csalient circumstance.\u201d <em>Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 118, 122 S.Ct. at 591, 151 L.Ed.2d at 505. Corbin was never made aware of, nor did he agree to, a diminished expectation of privacy with regard to the personal information contained in his DNA. Corbin\u2019s agreement to submit to periodic alcohol testing did not logically include consent to test any DNA material that may have been left on the breath test instrument. The absence of a probation condition relating to the search of Corbin\u2019s DNA that was performed distinguishes the facts of the instant case from those in <em>Knights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Furthermore, as the majority notes, the defendants in <em>Knights </em>and <em>Samson </em>were on probation for felony offenses; in contrast, Corbin\u2019s probation stemmed from his conviction for a misdemeanor. <em>Corbin, </em>428 Md. at 508-09, 52 A.3d at 957-58. The majority attempts to distinguish Corbin\u2019s DWI conviction from other misdemeanors by stating that \u201cthis misdemeanor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>offense, unlike many misdemeanors, carries the potential for significant jail time.\u201d <em>Corbin, </em>428 Md. at 509, 52 A.3d at 958. In addition, according to the majority, drunken driving is a serious offense with a high recidivism rate. <em>Corbin, </em>428 Md. at 509, 52 A.3d at 958. Therefore, in the majority\u2019s view, \u201ca person on probation from a drunken driving offense has, like the probationer in <em>Knights, </em>a significantly diminished expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Corbin, </em>428 Md. at 510, 52 A.3d at 958. The majority, however, gives no clear, principled reason for distinguishing DWI convictions from all other \u201clesser misdemean- or[s.]\u201d <em>See Corbin, </em>428 Md. at 510 n. 11, 52 A.3d at 958 n. 11. Surely, the fact that the defendants in <em>Knights </em>and <em>Samson </em>were convicted of felony offenses influenced the Supreme Court\u2019s determination with regard to their respective diminished expectations of privacy. Corbin does not, as a result of his misdemeanor DWI conviction, pose a similar threat to society. To the extent that there was a concern that Corbin would commit another alcohol-related offense, the mandatory alcohol monitoring included in Corbin\u2019s probation order was sufficient to alleviate that concern. To extend a diminished expectation of privacy to every aspect of Corbin\u2019s life, specifically his privacy interest in the information contained in his DNA, was not reasonable in light of his probation status for a misdemeanor offense and the subsequent use of incriminating evidence in a completely unrelated homicide investigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>I also disagree with the notion, espoused by a majority of this Court, that DNA profiling is analogous to fingerprinting. As explained in Chief Judge Bell\u2019s dissent in <em>Williamson, </em>\u201c[a] fingerprint is an impression left by the depositing of oil upon contact between a surface and the friction ridges of fingers.\u201d <em>Williamson, </em>413 Md. at 551 n. 3, 993 A.2d at 644 n. 3 (Bell, C.J., dissenting) (internal quotation omitted). The collection of a person\u2019s DNA, however, \u201crequires production of evidence below the body surface which is not subject to public view[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>652 F.3d 387, 425 (3d Cir.2011) (Rendell, J., dissenting) (quotation omitted). DNA analysis is more technologically sophisticated than fingerprint analysis in that the DNA is broken down and analyzed \u201cto create a DNA record, a profile, capable of, and for, comparison with other profiles.\u201d <em>Williamson, </em>413 Md. at 562, 993 A.2d at 650 (Bell, C.J., dissenting). Therefore, the nonconsensual testing and analysis of substances that may be used for DNA profiling are subject to scrutiny under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs. Ass\u2019n, </em>489 U.S. 602, 616, 109 S.Ct. 1402, 1413, 103 L.Ed.2d 639, 659 (1989); <em>Schmerber v.

Martin, </em>184 Vt. 23, 955 A.2d 1144, 1168-69 (2008) (noting that \u201cDNA profiling involves a significantly greater intrusion of privacy than fingerprinting\u201d because DNA samples must be analyzed and in the process \u201cintimate details of one\u2019s genetic make-up are revealed ...\u201d (Johnson, J., dissenting)). Cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>tainly, Corbin had a reasonable expectation of privacy in this sensitive information.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">With regard to breath tests specifically, the Supreme Court has stated, \u201cSubjecting a person to a breathalyzer test, which generally requires the production of alveolar or \u2018deep lung\u2019 breath for chemical analysis implicates ... concerns about bodily integrity and, like the blood-alcohol test we considered in <em>Schmerber, </em>should ... be deemed a search.\u201d <em>Skinner, </em>489 U.S. at 616-17, 109 S.Ct. at 1413, 103 L.Ed.2d at 659 (citations omitted). Thus, although the deep lung test itself may not have been an invasive method of obtaining Corbin\u2019s DNA, the information gleaned as a result of testing and analyzing the sensitive and private information contained in the DNA was certainly an invasion of Corbin\u2019s privacy. The Supreme Court noted in <em>Skinner </em>that \u201cbreath tests reveal the level of alcohol in [an individual\u2019s] bloodstream and nothing more.\u201d <em>Skinner, </em>489 U.S. at 625, 109 S.Ct. at 1418, 103 L.Ed.2d at 665. When, however, saliva left on a breath test instrument is subjected to DNA testing, as in the instant case, the nature and extent of the information revealed drastically changes. Thus, the search performed on Corbin\u2019s DNA revealed different, and substantially more, information than Corbin could have expected based on the conditions of probation and the deep lung test he agreed to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The purpose of the warrant requirement is \u201cto protect privacy interests by assuring citizens subject to a search or seizure that such intrusions are not the random or arbitrary acts of government agents.\u201d <em>Skinner, </em>489 U.S. at 621-22, 109 S.Ct. at 1415-16, 103 L.Ed.2d at 663. Furthermore, \u201c[a] warrant assures the citizen that the intrusion is authorized by law, and that it is narrowly limited in its objectives and scope.\u201d <em>Skinner, </em>489 U.S. at 622, 109 S.Ct. at 1416, 103 L.Ed.2d at 663 (citations omitted). As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Schmerber, </em>\u201c[t]he importance of informed, detached and deliberate determinations of the issue whether or not to invade another\u2019s body in search of evidence of guilt is indisputable and great.\u201d <em>Schmerber, </em>384 U.S. at 770, 86 S.Ct. at 1835, 16 L.Ed.2d at 919. Sensitive information contained in genetic material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>should be subject to the warrant requirement. DNA testing and analysis, particularly the analysis performed on Corbin\u2019s DNA in the case at bar, are clearly used for investigatory purposes to be presented as evidence against the accused at trial. <em>See Raines, </em>383 Md. at 50-51, 857 A.2d at 49 (opining that \u201c[i]t is true, of course, that the DNA sample [collected] will be used to establish identity, but the principal purpose of establishing identity will be to provide evidence of criminality, evidence that will allow the police to establish probable cause to collect precisely the same evidence for use in court\u201d (Wilner, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Griffin </em>posited that, in a situation involving a search of a probationer, \u201cthe delay inherent in obtaining a warrant would make it more difficult for probation officials to respond quickly to evidence of misconduct, and would reduce the deterrent effect that the possibility of expeditious searches would otherwise create.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>483 U.S. at 876, 107 S.Ct. at 3170, 97 L.Ed.2d at 719 (internal citations omitted). That rationale is not applicable to the circumstances surrounding collection and analysis of Corbin\u2019s DNA. The crime for which Corbin\u2019s DNA was obtained, for comparison purposes, was committed years prior to police efforts to obtain a DNA sample. Police had the ability, subject to the requirements of the Fourth Amendment, to gather this evidence at any time. There was no danger, as eluded to in <em>Griffin, </em>of Corbin destroying the evidence sought by police in connection with the murder. Similarly, there was no apparent need for police to act expeditiously, necessitating avoidance of the warrant requirement. The detectives investigating the case were capable of, and in fact required to, submit a statement of probable cause to a neutral and detached magistrate and obtain a search warrant for Corbin\u2019s DNA. In addition, Cor-bin\u2019s DNA was not subject to a search as one of the conditions of his probation. Thus, the police acted without any authorization to collect and analyze Corbin\u2019s DNA. Moreover, the police conducted the search without any individualized suspicion that Corbin was involved in criminal activity occurring while he was on probation. <em>See Raines, </em>383 Md. at 74, 857 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>A.2d at 63 (concluding that the search at issue violated the prisoner\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights because \u201cthe State [did] not sufficiently establish[ ] that there [was] any individualized basis for the search, probable cause or some appropriate level of suspicion, that would justify any intrusion upon the [prisoner\u2019s] constitutionally-protected privacy interest in his own body\u201d (Bell, C.J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">The DNA evidence collected, analyzed, and used for investigative purposes, with regard to Corbin, constituted a search subject to Fourth Amendment scrutiny. Therefore, as a result of the search, the burden rested with the State to establish that a recognized exception to the warrant requirement applied in order to justify the intrusion. Having failed to establish an exception to the warrant requirement, the DNA evidence and the results flowing from the comparisons of that evidence should have been suppressed. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Chief Judge Bell has authorized me to state that he joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\">. While the probation order itself was not included in the record of the case at bar, neither party has contended, in this Court, that analysis of Corbin\u2019s DNA or entry of his DNA profile into CODIS was part of the probation order. Therefore, I proceed on the assumption that DNA testing and analysis was not a condition of probation. In addition, as noted by the majority, the DNA testing and analysis performed on Corbin\u2019s saliva was not covered by the DNA Collection Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b561-5\">. Similarly, in her analysis, Judge Battaglia highlights the flaws in the majority\u2019s reasoning on this point. This Court recently issued an opinion in <em>King </em>v. <em>State, </em>425 Md. 550, 597-98, 42 A.3d 549, 578 (2012), wherein we held that it was a violation of King's Fourth Amendment rights to collect his DNA without a warrant, pursuant to the DNA Collection Act, following his arrest for an offense enumerated under the Act. In the instant case, Judge Battaglia explains the absurd result reached by the majority's analysis, when read in conjunction with the rationale and holding in <em>King: </em>\"[Tjhose on probation, even for petty offenses, have no expectation of privacy in the \u2018treasure trove\u2019 of their genetics, while arrestees for felonies, even with serious records, do in their identification.\u201d <em>Corbin, </em>428 Md. at 525, 52 A.3d at 967 (Battaglia, J., concurring). I agree that, in light of this Court\u2019s opinions addressing Fourth Amendment protection in the context of DNA collection and analysis, such an outcome is illogical.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
