Alston. The Commission alleges several violations of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (MLRPC) in connection with Respondent\u2019s representation of a client and improper maintenance of Respondent\u2019s attorney trust account. Respondent previously acknowledged these violations in a Conditional Diversion Agreement (CDA). The Commission further alleges that Respondent failed to comply with the conditions of the CDA, which led to revocation of the CDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Pursuant to Maryland Rules 16-752(a) and 16-757(c), we designated the Honorable Alfred W. Northrop to conduct an evidentiary hearing and file written findings of fact and conclusions of law in this matter. Respondent\u2019s failure to respond timely to the Petition for Disciplinary Action prompted Bar Counsel to request, and Judge Northrop to grant, an Order of Default. The Order of Default set in the matter for an evidentiary hearing on November 17, 2011. Respondent was notified of the Order of Default, the scheduled hearing date, and her right to file a motion to vacate the default within 30 days of its entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">Respondent did not file timely a motion to vacate the Order of Default. Instead, on the morning of the hearing, she apparently brought to the Circuit Court a Motion to Vacate the Order of Default <em>Nunc Pro Tunc. </em>An unsigned version of the motion was presented to Judge Northrop (whether by Respondent or someone else) and, evidently, the motion had not been filed formally with the Clerk\u2019s Office. Presumably at Respondent\u2019s request, Judge Northrop granted her on that morning leave to be held harmless from appearing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>courtroom until 9:30 a.m. Respondent, however, did not appear in court until more than 40 minutes later, after the case had been called; the judge denied Respondent\u2019s written motion to vacate; and the hearing, which proceeded ex parte with Bar Counsel, had concluded. Upon her tardy arrival in the courtroom, Respondent requested, and the court denied, a reopening of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">On December 17, 2011, Judge Northrop issued an Opinion and Order setting forth his findings of fact and conclusions of law. Respondent has filed several exceptions relating to process and procedure, rather than the substance of the hearing judge\u2019s findings and conclusions. For the following reasons, we overrule the exceptions and direct that Respondent be suspended indefinitely from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The procedural facts we summarize here are drawn from Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 1, admitted at the November 17, 2011 hearing before Judge Northrop. Attached to that exhibit are 19 documents, including the CDA and subsequent correspondence between Bar Counsel and Respondent concerning her failure to comply with the terms of the CDA. As we shall see, the CDA in this matter was revoked eventually by the Commission upon its determination that Respondent was in material default of it. In that situation, the terms of the CDA, once confidential, are no longer so, and the contents of the CDA \u201cmay be disclosed in a subsequent proceeding against the attorney when relevant to a subsequent complaint based on similar misconduct.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Rule 16-736(h)(4), (5). We include the facts pertaining to the CDA and revocation of it as necessary to an understanding of both the procedural posture of this matter and the basis for one of the formal exceptions Respondent places before us for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">\n<em>The CDA and its Aftermath</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Dr. Walesia Robinson, a client of Respondent, filed a complaint with the Commission, precipitating Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation and the parties\u2019 entry into a CDA, which the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>si'on approved on July 21, 2010. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 16-736(a), (d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The CDA stayed related disciplinary and remedial proceedings pending Respondent\u2019s satisfactory fulfillment of its terms. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 16-736(e)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Paragraph 5 of the CDA spelled out several conditions to which Respondent agreed she would comply. Among those conditions were the following, set forth in sub-paragraphs C, D, E, and F: (1) Respondent was to continue in the care of the mental health therapist treating her at that time \u201cfor at least one year following approval of this agreement\u201d and, \u201c[d]uring that time, Respondent shall be responsible for obtaining quarterly status reports from [the mental health therapist] and shall provide such quarterly reports to Bar Counsel\u201d (sub-paragraph 5C); (2) \u201c[w]ithin sixty (60) days from the date this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>agreement is approved, Respondent shall issue a written apology to Dr. Walesia Robinson and shall refund the sum of $5,000.00 to Dr. Robinson, representing one-half of the total amount paid by Dr. Robinson\u201d (sub-paragraph 5D); and (3) Respondent would attend two Continuing Legal Education (CLE) programs specified in the CDA and promptly thereafter submit to Bar Counsel certification of her attendance at each program (sub-paragraphs 5E and 5F).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Several months later, after repeated efforts to secure Respondent\u2019s compliance with the terms of the CDA, Bar Counsel, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-736(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> notified Respondent, by letter dated December 21, 2010, of Bar Counsel\u2019s \u201cintention to declare a proposed default on the [CDA].\u201d Bar Counsel explained: \u201cIt is Bar Counsel\u2019s position that you have failed in a material way to comply with the Agreement, including sub-paragraphs C, D (specifically, the $5,000.00 refund to Dr. Robinson), E and F.\u201d In that same December 21 letter, as required by Rule 16-736(f)(1)(C), Bar Counsel informed Respondent that she had the opportunity to submit in writing, by January 5, 2011, a response \u201cto refute Bar Counsel\u2019s determination and/or to offer an explanation or proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>remedy satisfactory to Bar Counsel.\u201d Respondent did not respond in any fashion to the December 21 notice-of-intent letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">On January 18, 2011, Bar Counsel filed with the Commission a Petition to Revoke Conditional Diversion Agreement, based on Respondent\u2019s failure to comply with the above-listed conditions of the CDA as well as the condition set forth in sub-paragraph 5B of the CDA. That condition directed that Respondent, with a monitor\u2019s assistance, \u201cshall implement new accounting procedures for her law practice,\u201d including \u201cmeasures that bring Respondent into compliance with the attorney trust account record-keeping requirements set forth in Maryland Rule 16-606.1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Also on January 18, 2011, Bar Counsel mailed to Respondent a copy of the petition to revoke the CDA, accompanied by a certified letter informing Respondent that, \u201c[p]ursuant to Maryland Rule 16\u2014736(f)(2), you may file a written response with the Attorney Grievance Commission within fifteen (15) days after service of the enclosed petition.\u201d The Commission also wrote to Respondent by letter dated January 20, 2011, advising Respondent of the filing of the petition to revoke the CDA and her right to file a written response within 15 days of service of the petition. Respondent was further informed in the January 20 letter that, \u201c[i]f the Commission concludes that you are in material default of the Agreement, it shall revoke the Agreement, revoke the stay of the disciplinary or remedial proceeding, and direct Bar Counsel to proceed in accordance with Rule 16-751,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or as otherwise authorized by the Rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Respondent was served with the petition to revoke the CDA on January 25, 2011. Pursuant to Rule 16\u2014736(f)(2), Respondent had until February 9, 2011 to file a response. Sometime on or before February 8, 2011, Respondent requested an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>extension of time within which to respond to the petition to revoke. The record does not reflect either the manner (written or oral) in which Respondent made that request, the grounds she put forth in support of it, or the additional amount of time she requested within which to respond to the petition. By letter dated February 8, 2011, Respondent was advised that the Commission had granted the request, allowing her until February 15, 2011 to respond to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Respondent did not file a response to the petition to revoke the CDA by February 15, or thereafter, nor did she seek a further extension of time before the granted extension expired. Accordingly, in the absence of any response from Respondent, the Commission, by letter dated February 24, 2011, informed Bar Counsel that the Commission \u201chas concluded that the Respondent is in material default of the Agreement and hereby revokes the Agreement,\u201d thereby lifting the stay of disciplinary proceedings. The Commission copied Respondent on that written notice of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Noteworthy for present purposes, Respondent, a first-time member of the General Assembly beginning with the 2011 legislative session, represented herself in connection with this matter. At no time prior to the Commission\u2019s revocation of the CDA did Respondent assert, for the record, that she was entitled to a continuance of the matter, pursuant to Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 6-402 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ), until after the close of the 2011 legislative session. CJ \u00a7 6-402 provides in pertinent part: \u201c[I]f a member or desk officer of the General Assembly is an attorney of record in a proceeding, the proceeding shall be continued from 5 days before the legislative session convenes until at least 10 days after it is adjourned.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Rule 2-508(d) (\u201cUpon request of an attorney of record who is a member or desk officer of the General Assembly, a proceeding that is scheduled during the period of time commencing five days before the legislative session convenes and ending ten days after its adjournment shall be continued.\u201d). The 2011 session of the General Assembly commenced on January 12, 2011 and concluded on April 11, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">By letter dated February 28, 2011, four days after the Commission revoked the CDA, Respondent asked the Commission to \u201creconsider the decision to revoke the [CDA] and stay any decision on this matter until the legislative session has concluded.\u201d Citing Rule 2-508(d), Respondent argued that the Commission\u2019s revocation of the CDA was \u201cpremature,\u201d as she \u201cha[d] requested a continuance of my time to respond to the [Attorney Grievance Commission request to revoke the conditional diversion agreement.\u201d Although the wording of her letter could be read as suggesting that Respondent \u201cha[d]\u201d requested a legislative continuance of the matter at some point <em>before </em>the Commission\u2019s decision to revoke the CDA, Respondent did not indicate in her February 28, 2011 letter \u2014 or in any document filed before or since \u2014 when such a request \u201chad\u201d been made. Insofar as the record of proceedings before and since the Commission\u2019s action discloses, Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>spondent\u2019s letter of February 28, 2011 to the Commission marks the first time Respondent asked for a legislative continuance, doing so only in connection with her request of the Commission to reconsider and stay its revocation of the CDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The Commission, by letter of March 18, 2011, notified Respondent that, at its meeting on March 16, her request to reconsider revocation of the CDA was denied. That same letter reaffirmed that Bar Counsel was directed to initiate formal charges. <em>See </em>Md. Rules 16\u2014736(f)(3), 16-751.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">\n<em>The Filing of Formal Charges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">On May 24, 2011, Bar Counsel filed with this Court a Petition for Disciplinary Action charging Respondent with violations of MLRPC 1.3 (diligence); 1.4(a)(2) (communication); 1.15(a) (safekeeping property); 1.16(d) (declining or terminating representation); 8. 1(b) (bar admission and disciplinary matters); and 8.4(a) and (d) (misconduct). By order of this Court, the charges were transmitted to be heard and determined by Judge Northrop. On July 13, 2011, Respondent was served with the petition and summons to file a written response to the petition within 15 days of service. The summons informed Respondent that \u201c[flailure to file a response within the time allowed may result in a judgment by default or the granting of the relief sought against you.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Rule 16-754.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Respondent did not file an answer to the petition. Consequently, on August 18, 2011, Bar Counsel filed, pursuant to Maryland Rules 16-754(c)and 2-613(b),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a Request for Order of Default. The Circuit Court granted the request by order docketed September 22, 2011. The Order of Default also ordered that the evidentiary hearing be scheduled for the matter to proceed on November 17, 2011. The record reflects that a notice was sent to Respondent\u2019s address informing her that the Order of Default had been entered against her and she had 30 days from the date of entry within which to move to vacate the Order. Respondent acknowledged during oral argument before this Court that she knew of the Order of Default and scheduled hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Respondent did not file a timely motion to vacate the Order of Default, and the hearing proceeded on the date scheduled, November 17, 2011. The hearing was scheduled for 9:00 a.m. that morning. On that morning Respondent made a presumably in-person, off-the-record request of Judge Northrop, and she was granted explicit dispensation to be held harmless from appearing in the courtroom until 9:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Shortly before 10:00 a.m., Judge Northrop called the case. Respondent was not present in the courtroom. Bar Counsel advised Judge Northrop that \u201ca short while ago\u201d Respondent had advised counsel that she \u201cwas going to find a Rule book, I think, in the library, so I don\u2019t know where she is at this particular moment.\u201d Bar Counsel, on his initiative, looked for Respondent in the hallway outside the courtroom and reported to Judge Northrop that Respondent had not been seen there. At 10:06 a.m. Judge Northrop, announcing that he had \u201cwaited long enough,\u201d told Bar Counsel to proceed with the ex parte proof of the charged MLRPC violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Before Bar Counsel proceeded, Judge Northrop noted that there was \u201can unsigned pleading attached to the front of the file.\u201d Judge Northrop was referring to Respondent\u2019s Motion to Reconsider and Request to Vacate Order of Default <em>Nunc Pro Tunc </em>submitted, but evidently not filed, earlier that morning. In that motion, Respondent asserted, among other things, that her delay in responding to the Petition for Disciplinary Action was the result of her having focused her energy on securing counsel to represent her in an unrelated criminal matter. Respondent further argued in the motion that default proceedings are not intended to punish a party for failing to comply with procedure and that a determination on the merits is preferred. Moreover, Respondent disagreed \u201cthat there was a material breach of the [CDA]\u201d or that she had violated the MLRPC. Respondent also asserted that the Commission \u201cviolated her substantive due process rights by not allowing her to respond [to] the allegations of breach prior to the filing of public charges ... wherein the Commission refused to afford her a Legislative Continuance[ ] as required and mandated pursuant to [CJ] [\u00a7] 6-402.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Some six minutes later, after discussing with Bar Counsel where Respondent might be found, Judge Northrop, noting for the record that the motion to reconsider was \u201cunsigned\u201d and \u201cnot properly docketed, not properly filed, and only submitted today,\u201d denied the motion, \u201cthe respondent having failed to appear.\u201d In proceeding with the ex parte hearing, Judge Northrop admitted into evidence Bar Counsel\u2019s sole exhibit consisting of a Request for Admission of Facts and Genuineness of Documents with nineteen documents attached, including, relevant here, the correspondence between and among Bar Counsel, the Commission, and Respondent, discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Respondent returned to the courtroom at 10:12 a.m. By that time, Judge Northrop had concluded the hearing. The judge informed Respondent of that fact and, after denying Respondent\u2019s oral request to re-open the hearing, excused the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>On December 17, 2011, Judge Northrop issued his written findings of fact and conclusions of law in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">\n<em>Factual Findings and Conclusions of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Judge Northrop\u2019s Opinion and Order reflects the following findings of fact. On July 21, 2010, the Attorney Grievance Commission approved a CDA between Bar Counsel and Respondent, entered into pursuant to Rule 16-736. Respondent voluntarily entered into the CDA, which related to two separate matters, and therein acknowledged several violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">As described in the CDA, the first matter arose from a complaint filed by Dr. Walesia L. Robinson concerning Respondent\u2019s conduct in connection with her representation of Dr. Robinson. Respondent acknowledged that she had failed to act with reasonable diligence in representing Dr. Robinson, failed to keep Dr. Robinson reasonably informed, and, after being discharged by Dr. Robinson, failed to respond promptly to requests made by Dr. Robinson and her new counsel for Dr. Robinson\u2019s file and an accounting of Dr. Robinson\u2019s retainer fee payments. These failures, as Respondent acknowledged in the CDA, amounted to violations of MLRPC 1.3, 1.4(a)(2), and 1.16(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">The second matter to which the CDA referred was initiated by Bar Counsel and concerned Respondent\u2019s not properly maintaining a trust account.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the CDA, Respondent had acknowledged her failure to comply with the trust account requirements pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-606.1.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> She fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>ther \u201cacknowledge[d] that she knowingly failed to respond to lawful demands for information from a disciplinary authority, in violation of [MLRPC] 8.1(b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">The CDA provided that \u201cRespondent consented to have her law practice monitored by another attorney.\u201d Judge Northrop found that Respondent failed to satisfy that monitoring condition by \u201cfailing] to provide the law practice monitor designated to report to Bar Counsel with access to information he needed to fulfill his reporting obligations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Based on the foregoing findings of fact, Judge Northrop made the following conclusions of law. With respect to Dr. Robinson\u2019s complaint, Respondent violated MLRPC 1.3<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (diligence), 1.4(a)(2)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (communication), and 1.16(d)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (declining or terminating representation), based on her signed acknowledgment in the CDA. In addition, with respect to the trust account irregularities, Respondent violated MLRPC 1.15(a)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>(safekeeping property) and MLRPC 8.1(b)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (bar admission and disciplinary matters), also based on her signed acknowledgment in the CDA. Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(a)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (misconduct) by violating the previously mentioned rules. Finally, Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(d) (misconduct) by failing to comply with the conditions of the CDA, including her failure to provide the law practice monitor with access to information needed for his reports, which constituted conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. Based on Respondent\u2019s repeated instances of uncooperative behavior and tardiness, Judge Northrop did not find any mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">This Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings. \u201c[W]e accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact as prima facie correct unless shown to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Nelson, </em>425 Md. 344, 358, 40 A.3d 1039, 1047 (2012) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Stern, </em>419 Md. 525, 556, 19 A.3d 904, 925 (2011)). As neither the Commission nor Respondent has excepted to the hearing judge\u2019s finding of facts, which are not clearly erroneous, the factual findings are \u201cestablished for the purpose of determining appropriate sanctions.\u201d Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">A. Respondent\u2019s Exceptions</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Respondent has not filed any exceptions that pertain directly to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law, but she has filed exceptions alleging procedural errors committed by the Commission and the hearing judge. We shall consider each exception, in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">\n<em>i. Legislative Continuance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Respondent first argues that, as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates representing herself in this matter, she was entitled to, but was denied, a legislative continuance, pursuant to CJ \u00a7 6-402 and Rule 2-508(d). Respondent asserts in particular that the Commission violated the \u201csubstantive and procedural due process rights of Ms. Alston that are outlined in Rule 16\u2014736(f)(2),\u201d <em>see supra </em>note 2, by denying her request for a legislative continuance to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s request to revoke the conditional diversion agreement and \u201cbe heard on the underlying facts regarding the alleged violation of the diversion agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>In addressing the exception, we have assumed without deciding, solely for the purposes of resolving the exception, that Respondent would have been entitled to a legislative continuance in order to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s petition to revoke the CDA had it been requested timely and expressly. The record, however, shows that Respondent\u2019s invocation of the exception was tardy (a consistent qualifier of much of Respondent\u2019s conduct here).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The legislative continuance provided by CJ \u00a7 6-402 is not self-executing. Subsection 6-402(f) states: \u201cThe attorney may exercise any right under this section <em>after filing a motion or letter with the appropriate court or administrative agency </em>without the attorney personally appearing.\u201d (Emphasis added). And subsection (e) provides: \u201cThe attorney may waive the benefit of this section.\u201d <em>See also </em>Md. Rule 2-508(d) <em>(\u201cUpon request </em>of an attorney of record who is a member or desk officer of the General Assembly, a proceeding ... shall be continued.\u201d (Emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Bar Counsel filed the petition to revoke the CDA on January 18, 2011, six days after commencement of the 2011 session of the General Assembly. The record shows, and Respondent does not deny, that she timely was made aware of the petition, her right to respond to it, and the time within which to respond, i.e., on or before February 9, 2011. Indeed, Respondent timely sought a continuance from the Commission sometime on or before February 8, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Important for present purposes, the record does not contain Respondent\u2019s request for continuance, and, even now, Respondent does not assert that she filed the continuance request in writing, as CJ \u00a7 6-402 requires, or even that she relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>expressly on CJ \u00a7 6-402 or Rule 2-508(d) in making an oral request. Without a record of how she made the request, we also have no way of knowing if, in doing so, Respondent alerted the Commission that she sought the continuance pursuant to CJ \u00a7 6-402 and/or Rule 2-508(d). All we do know is that the Commission made no mention of the statute or rule in the February 8, 2011 letter informing Respondent of the grant of a one-week continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Respondent does not deny receipt of the February 8 letter, and nothing in the record suggests that upon receipt she formally (or even informally) objected that the continuance was insufficient and that she was entitled to a continuance until April 21, 2011 (ten days after adjournment of the 2011 session, as provided by CJ \u00a7 6-402 and/or Rule 2-508(d)). Instead, Respondent let the date for response come and go without responding to the petition to revoke the CDA. Moreover, she sought no further continuance of the time within which to respond \u2014 notwithstanding she was on notice that the Commission may well, as ultimately it did, revoke the petition. Given all that we know about what Respondent did, and more important, did not do in a timely fashion, it is impossible for us to find that she properly sought and was denied a legislative continuance to respond to the petition to revoke the CDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">For much the same reasons, there is no merit to Respondent\u2019s claim that she was denied \u201ca full and fair opportunity to be heard on the underlying facts regarding the alleged violation of the diversion agreement.\u201d We have said that a respondent is not denied due process as long as she \u201cis given notice and an opportunity to defend in a full and fair hearing following the institution of disciplinary proceedings in this Court.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Harris, </em>310 Md. 197, 202, 528 A.2d 895, 897 (1987).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Respondent was given ample notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>and full opportunity to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s December 21, 2010 letter informing her of Bar Counsel\u2019s intention to declare a proposed default on the CDA. That letter set forth precisely the ways in which, in Bar Counsel\u2019s view, Respondent was in material default of the CDA. In the same letter, Bar Counsel informed Respondent that she was entitled to submit in writing, by January 5, 2011, a response \u201cto refute Bar Counsel\u2019s determination and/or to offer an explanation or proposed remedy satisfactory to Bar Counsel.\u201d Respondent did not respond to the notice-of-intent letter. Nor did Respondent respond to the subsequently-filed Petition to Revoke the CDA, although she was informed of her right to do so. When Respondent received from the Commission additional time within which to respond, even then she did not act timely, either by submitting a response or, at the least, seeking still more time to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Our conclusion that Respondent was not denied due process is unchanged by the fact that Respondent wrote to the Commission <em>after </em>the Commission revoked the CDA and, in seeking reconsideration and a stay of the Commission\u2019s revocation decision, formally invoked at that juncture her entitlement to a legislative continuance. Respondent offers no reason, much less authority, to support her entitlement to a post hoc invocation of a legislative continuance in order to mount an after-the-fact defense to Bar Counsel\u2019s assertions that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>was in material default of the CDA. Certainly we are aware of none.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">The most process due Respondent at that late juncture was review by the Commission of her request for reconsideration and stay of the Commission\u2019s decision to revoke the CDA. The Commission considered Respondent\u2019s request and denied it. In doing so, the Commission did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Rule 16\u2014736(f)(3) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">If the Commission concludes that the attorney is in material default of the [Conditional Diversion] Agreement, it <em>shall </em>revoke the Agreement, revoke the stay of the disciplinary or remedial proceeding, and direct Bar Counsel to proceed in accordance with Rule 16-751, or as otherwise authorized by the Rules in this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">(Emphasis added). By its plain language, the rule would seem to <em>require </em>the Commission, on a finding of material default, to revoke a CDA so long as the attorney is given notice and an opportunity to defend. Respondent was given notice and the opportunity to defend against the assertion of Bar Counsel that she was in material default of the CDA, but, for reasons known only to her, she did not offer a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">Even if Rule 16-736 allows for exercise of discretion on the part of the Commission to reconsider revocation of a CDA, the present case does not suggest an abuse of discretion. We use as our guidepost the standard by which we review motions for a new trial or to reopen proceedings, whether in a civil or criminal matter. The decision to deny such motions lay within the sound discretion of the court deciding the motion, and such decision is not disturbed by the reviewing court, absent a showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Washington v. State, </em>424 Md. 632, 667-68, 37 A.3d 932, 952-53 (2012); <em>Gray v. State, </em>388 Md. 366, 382-83, 879 A.2d 1064, 1073 (2005); <em>I.O.A. Leasing v. Merle Thomas Corp., </em>260 Md. 243, 249, 272 A.2d 1, 4 (1971). Abuse of discretion is the exercise of discretion that is \u201cmanifestly unreasonable, or exercised on untenable grounds, or for untenable reasons.\u201d <em>Touzeau v. Deffinbaugh, </em>394 Md. 654, 669, 907 A.2d 807, 816 (2006) (quoting <em>Jenkins v. City of College Park, </em>379 Md. 142, 165, 840 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>A.2d 139, 153 (2003)); <em>see also Gray, </em>388 Md. at 383, 879 A.2d at 1073 (stating that a decision to reopen a post-conviction proceeding is discretionary, and an appellate court is not to disturb the decision unless it is \u201cwell removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable\u201d) (quoting <em>Dehn v. Edgecombe, </em>384 Md. 606, 628, 865 A.2d 603, 616 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Given Respondent\u2019s dilatory conduct in connection with the petition to revoke, and her arguments in support of reconsideration-limited to (1) a belated assertion of the right to a legislative continuance and (2) a meritless allegation of lack of due process \u2014 the Commission did not abuse its discretion in denying her request for reconsideration of its revocation decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">\n<em>ii. Jurisdiction of the Hearing Judge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Respondent\u2019s second exception challenges Judge Northrop\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the disciplinary action. Respondent asserts that, because the hearing was held beyond the 120-day period after service of this Court\u2019s order designating the hearing judge, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 16-757(a),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the judge was not authorized to hear the case and make findings of fact and conclusions of law. Respondent suggests that, because both Judge Northrop and Bar Counsel knew of this defect, the hearing should have been postponed until the judge acquired jurisdiction through an order from this Court extending the period within which to conduct the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">The Commission counters simply that this Court already decided this issue when, by order dated December 5, 2011, this Court granted, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>the Commission\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>to extend the time. We agree. As Respondent has acknowledged, an order of this Court extending the period within which to hear the matter would, and in this case did, eliminate any procedural or jurisdictional defect based on non-compliance with Maryland Rule 16-757(a). Therefore, this exception is overruled as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">\n<em>in. Denial of Respondent\u2019s Motion to Vacate Order of Default</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Respondent\u2019s third and final exception alleges that Judge Northrop abused his discretion when he refused to vacate the Order of Default and reopen the matter when Respondent arrived 42 minutes late for the hearing on November 17, 2011. The Commission, not surprisingly, disagrees and asserts that Judge Northrop acted well within his discretion in denying the motion to vacate, based on \u201cRespondent\u2019s history of \u2018lateness, non-responsiveness, and dilatory practice.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting the hearing judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">We agree with the Commission. Trial courts have broad discretion \u201cto determine whether to grant or deny a motion to vacate an order of default.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Ward, </em>394 Md. 1, 20, 904 A.2d 477, 489 (2006). As Judge Northrop noted in his findings, Respondent\u2019s motion was untimely as it was \u201cfiled\u201d nearly one month after the 30-day period within which, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-613(d),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> a defendant may move to vacate an order of default. Moreover, the judge noted that Respondent failed to appear when the matter was called and the judge ruled on the Motion to Vacate. We see no abuse of discretion in the hearing judge\u2019s denial of Respondent\u2019s untimely motion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Accordingly, we overrule Respondent\u2019s third and final exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>B. The MLRPC Violations</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">We review next Judge Northrop\u2019s conclusions of law, to which, unlike factual findings, we owe no deference. <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Brown, 426 </em>Md. 298, 315, 44 A.3d 344, 354 (2012). For the reasons that follow, we agree with Judge Northrop\u2019s conclusions that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.3, 1.4(a)(2), 1.15(a), 1.16(d), 8.1(b), and 8.4(a) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">MLRPC 1.3 provides that a lawyer must act with reasonable diligence and promptness when representing a client. Respondent acknowledged in the CDA that she did not act with reasonable diligence while representing Dr. Robinson because she failed to keep Dr. Robinson informed and failed to answer Dr. Robinson\u2019s requests for information. Her admitted failure violates MLRPC 1.3. <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Agiliga, 422 </em>Md. 613, 617, 623, 31 A.3d 103, 105, 109 (2011) (concluding that an attorney violated MLRPC 1.3 when he failed to disburse settlement funds, failed to pay health care providers, and did not respond to health care providers\u2019 inquiries).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">MLRPC 1.4(a)(2) requires an attorney to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter. Respondent again acknowledged in the CDA that she violated this rule when she failed to keep Dr. Robinson informed about Respondent\u2019s ongoing representation of her. <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Camus, </em>425 Md. 417, 429, 42 A.3d 1, 8 (2012) (concluding that an attorney violated MLRPC 1.4(a)(2) when she did not comply promptly with requests for information from her client).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>MLRPC 1.15(a) requires an attorney to maintain client funds in a trust account, separate from the attorney\u2019s personal and operating funds. Respondent admitted in the CDA that she failed to comply, in material respects, with the attorney trust account record-keeping requirements set out in Maryland Rule 16-606.1. Respondent, therefore, violated MLRPC 1.15(a). <em>See, e.g., Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. 341, 371-72, 872 A.2d 693, 711-12 (2005) (concluding that an attorney\u2019s failure properly to handle settlement funds violated MLRPC 1.15(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">MLRPC 1.16(d) provides that, after services are terminated, an attorney shall take reasonable steps to protect a client\u2019s interests, including surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled. In the CDA, Respondent admitted that she violated this rule by failing to provide Dr. Robinson\u2019s file to either Dr. Robinson or her new counsel. Such a failure indeed violates the clear mandates of the rule. <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. De La Paz, </em>418 Md. 534, 555, 16 A.3d 181, 193-94 (2011) (holding that an attorney who did not protect his client\u2019s interests, in part, by failing to return the client\u2019s file, violated MLRPC 1.16(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">MLRPC 8.1(b) provides that a knowing failure to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority is a violation of the MLRPC. Judge Northrop found that Respondent failed to provide information that Bar Counsel requested, including, pursuant to the CDA, sufficient information for the attorney monitor to oversee Respondent\u2019s legal practice. This conduct violated the plain language of MLRPC 8.1(b). <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Van Nelson, </em>425 Md. 344, 362, 40 A.3d 1039, 1049 (2012) (concluding that an attorney who never responded to Bar Counsel\u2019s letters during the initial investigation or to an interview request violated MLRPC 8.1(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">MLRPC 8.4(a) provides that it is professional misconduct to violate any rule. By having violated the previously mentioned rules, Respondent also violated MLRPC 8.4(a). <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. McGlade, </em>425 Md. 524, 538, 545, 42 A.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>534, 543, 547 (2012) (holding that because an attorney violated other provisions of the MLRPC, he necessarily violated MLRPC 8.4(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Lastly, MLRPC 8.4(d) provides that conduct \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d is professional misconduct. Failing to comply with the CDA was prejudicial to the administration of justice because it reflected adversely on Respondent\u2019s fitness as a lawyer and impeded the Commission\u2019s ability to ensure that Respondent\u2019s activities presented no continuing harm to the public. Moreover, Respondent\u2019s disregard of the requirements of the CDA, particularly without any attempt at explanation, demonstrated a lack of trustworthiness. Respondent, therefore, violated MLRPC 8.4(d). <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Potter, </em>380 Md. 128, 152, 844 A.2d 367, 381 (2004) (holding that conduct that \u201creflects] adversely on [Respondent\u2019s] ... trustworthiness, and fitness as a lawyer .,. [is] conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Our remaining task is to determine the appropriate sanction. The Commission recommends indefinite suspension and, in support of that sanction, directs us to <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Khandpur, </em>421 Md. 1, 25 A.3d 165 (2011). Khandpur was indefinitely suspended, <em>id. </em>at 26, 25 A.3d at 180, after the revocation of a CDA, for safekeeping property violations, mismanagement of a trust account, lack of diligence, and failure to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests, <em>id. </em>at 7-8, 25 A.3d at 168-69. The Commission also recommends that, should we permit Respondent to be eligible for reinstatement, we should impose at least a one-year period from the effective date of the suspension before Respondent could seek reinstatement. Respondent recommends that this Court should issue a reprimand because she has no previous ethical violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">When sanctioning an attorney for a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, we have stated that the purpose of imposing sanctions is to protect the public. <em>Id. </em>at 17-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>18, 25 A.3d at 175. Sanctions depend on the particular facts and circumstances of each case. <em>E.g., Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Steinberg, </em>385 Md. 696, 704, 870 A.2d 603, 607 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">We agree with the Commission that indefinite suspension is the appropriate sanction for Respondent. Respondent, by agreeing to the CDA, acknowledged that her conduct constituted multiple ethical violations, and we have so concluded. The hearing judge found no mitigating factors. Rather, he noted the aggravating consideration of Respondent\u2019s \u201crepeated instances of lack of cooperation and the continual habit of lateness, non-responsiveness, and dilatory practices.\u201d Respondent, after being notified of her breaches and the Commission\u2019s intent to file a petition to revoke the agreement, consistently chose not to participate in these proceedings and belatedly, past the \u201celeventh hour,\u201d sought to delay them. Indefinite suspension is appropriate given such disregard for these proceedings. Prior attorney grievance matters in this Court support our conclusion that indefinite suspension is the appropriate sanction for Respondent\u2019s violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Kovacic, </em>389 Md. 233, 884 A.2d 673 (2005), Kovacic abandoned representation of a client, failed to complete work, failed to communicate with a client, failed to respond to inquiries from Bar Counsel, and never responded to the disciplinary petition or moved to vacate the default order entered. <em>Id. </em>at 235-36, 884 A.2d at 674. Ultimately, we agreed with the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that Kovacic violated MLRPC 1.3, 1.4, and 8.1. <em>Id. </em>at 236, 884 A.2d at 675. After noting that Kovacic had been absent before the hearing judge and no mitigating factors had been found, we held that indefinite suspension was the appropriate sanction because it \u201cwill protect the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239-40, 884 A.2d at 676-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Similarly in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Lee, </em>393 Md. 546, 903 A.2d 895 (2006), Lee failed to act diligently, to communicate with his client, to return the client\u2019s file, and to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiries. <em>Id. </em>at 555-57, 563, 903 A.2d at 901-02, 905. We concluded that Lee\u2019s actions violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>MLRPC 1.8, 1.4, 1.16, 3.2, 8.1(b), and 8.4(d). <em>Id. </em>at 563, 903 A.2d at 905. Relying on <em>Kovacic, </em>we determined that the proper sanction for Lee, as well, was indefinite suspension. <em>See id. </em>at 566, 903 A.2d at 907 (holding that the violations were similar to those in <em>Kovacic </em>and, because Lee violated more ethical rules than Kovacic, there being no mitigating factors found, indefinite suspension was the proper sanction).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Finally, in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Rose, 383 </em>Md. 385, 859 A.2d 659 (2004), we sanctioned an attorney who had overdrawn his trust account. <em>Id. </em>at 389-90, 859 A.2d at 661-62. We agreed with the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that Rose had violated MLRPC 1.15(a), 8.1(b), and 8.4(d), based on his improper maintenance of his trust account as well as his additional failure to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests. <em>Id. </em>at 391-92, 859 A.2d at 662-63. We then determined that the appropriate sanction in that case, too, was indefinite suspension, with a right to apply for reinstatement after six months, because there was \u201cno allegation of dishonesty or misappropriation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392, 859 A.2d at 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Similar to the cases we have discussed, Respondent violated multiple provisions of the MLRPC. Indeed, Respondent has violated many of the same provisions as did the attorneys in <em>Kovacic, Lee, </em>and <em>Rose. </em>Therefore, indefinite suspension is the appropriate sanction, and we order that sanction, accordingly.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST RESPONDENT, TIFFANY T.

This Court granted Respondent leave to submit the advice letter within one week of oral argument, that is, by June 14, 2012. Respondent timely submitted the letter, which was dated March 24, 2011.

Respondent asserted in her motion that, around the same time as the court entered the Order of Default, Respondent learned she was the subject of a criminal investigation unrelated to the present case, was attempting to secure counsel for that, and was subsequently indicted for unrelated charges.
