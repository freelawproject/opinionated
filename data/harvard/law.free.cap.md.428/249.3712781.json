More specifically, the issue is whether the Court of Special Appeals erred when it vacated the award, overturned the arbitrator\u2019s denial of an easement, and directed that an easement by necessity be located over the petitioners\u2019 land.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The conflict currently before this Court relates to an arbitration award dated December 22, 2008. The petitioners, Barry and Rhonda Downey, filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Howard County to confirm the arbitration award, and the respondent, Nicholas Sharp, filed a motion to vacate the same.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The arbitration award rejected Sharp\u2019s claim of an express easement over the adjacent property of the Downeys. Sharp further contended that, even in the absence of an express easement, he was entitled to an implied easement by necessity over the Downeys\u2019 property because, without such an easement, his property would be landlocked and inaccessible. The arbitration award also rejected Sharp\u2019s claim of an implied easement by necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The evidence, submissions, arguments of counsel, etc., at the hearing before the arbitrator are not contained in the record because the parties agreed not to have the arbitration proceedings transcribed. In addition, the record does not include all of the exhibits submitted to the arbitrator. The arbitration proceedings record before this Court contains only the arbitration award, including amendments to the award, and some documentary evidence, such as copies of the original deeds and easements. The thirteen-page arbitration award addresses several of the disputes between the Downeys and Sharp relating to the existence of an express easement. The principal issue debated by the parties before this Court, however, involves a one-paragraph portion of the arbitration award, entitled \u201cImplied Easement,\u201d which purports to discuss Sharp\u2019s entitlement to an implied easement by necessity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>In the arbitration award, the arbitrator briefly outlined the history of the two lots, explaining that the original owner, Ryan, had attempted to improve the \u201cjeep trails\u201d on the property, \u201cwithout the necessary government permits,\u201d prior to dividing the property into two lots: lot 1, which we shall call the Downey lot, and lot 2, which we shall call the Sharp lot. It seems that the Jeep Trails Easement<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was the only viable route to gain access to the Sharp lot.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The arbitrator recognized three issues related to Sharp\u2019s use of the Jeep Trails Easement, namely</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">\u201cwhether the easement extended to Morgan Station Road,[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] whether the easement extended to Lot 2 [the Sharp Lot], and whether the driveway as it now exists [over the Downeys\u2019 property] is the easement created by the Jeep Trails Easement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The arbitrator concluded on the first issue that \u201cthe easement created by the Jeep Trails Easement does not extend to Morgan Station] Road.\u201d He also found, with regard to the second issue, that the Jeep Trails \u201ceasement stops at [the] division line of Lot 1 and 2 and does not enter Lot 2 [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Sharp lot].\u201d He further found that the Jeep Trails Easement is \u201climit[ed] ... to the \u2018existing jeep trails located on Lot 1 [the Downey lot]\u2019 of which none give access to Lot 2 [the Sharp lot] ... [or] to Morgan Station Road.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With respect to the third issue, regarding an existing driveway over portions of both lots 1 and 2, the arbitrator decided that \u201csubstantial parts of the driveway were not built within the easement designations\u201d and that the Downeys were entitled \u201c \u2018to remove the existing driveway on those areas not approved\u2019 \u201d by proper permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">In short, it seems that the arbitration award determined that the \u201cJeep Trails Easement\u201d functioned as a line that failed to connect to either of its two endpoints. According to the arbitrator, the \u201cJeep Trails Easement\u201d did not connect to the Sharp lot or to Morgan Station Road. Furthermore, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>existing driveway over parts of the Downeys\u2019 property was found to be not \u201cwithin the easement designations.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AWs\">The arbitrator then indicated that he was turning to Sharp\u2019s argument that, in the absence of an express easement, Sharp was nonetheless entitled to an implied easement by necessity. The final paragraph of the award, and the only portion of the award purportedly addressing the claimed easement by necessity, reads as follows (references to exhibits deleted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\">\u201cImplied Easement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">\u201cSharp contends that since he is landlocked, he has an implied easement by necessity. When Ryan [the original owner of both properties] created Lot 1 and 2, he immediately sold Lot 1 to Jekel [the Downeys\u2019 predecessor], created with Jekel the Riverfront Easement, then the existing Jeep Trail Easement. All of the above instruments were executed on the same day and recorded among the Land Records of Howard County. The Riverfront Easement gives almost exclusive use of Lot 2 to Jekel. The existing Jeep Trail Easement gave an easement through Lot 1 to Ryan, but it did not extend into Lot 2, the Riverfront Easement, or Morgan Station Road. Obviously, Jekel did not want any intrusion into her Riverfront Easement. Ordinarily, subsequent instruments should not be considered. Here, however, the existing Jeep Trail Easement was substituted by the Jeep Trail Easement by the same parties and concerned the same property and that also was recorded. This easement did not extend into Lot 2 to cross into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the Riverfront Easement nor to Morgan Station Road. This is the operative easement and, once again, it is apparent that Jekel did not want her easement rights disturbed. Ryan, now Sharp, does not have an implied easement by necessity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">In a letter to counsel dated shortly after the award was issued, the arbitrator informed the parties that the final sentence of the award should be amended to \u201cread, \u2018Ryan, now Sharp, does not have an implied easement by necessity, he does not need one.\u2019 \u201d The amendment added the language \u201che does not need one\u201d to the final sentence of the paragraph titled \u201cImplied Easement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">After receiving this amendment, Sharp filed with the arbitrator a \u201cMotion to Reconsider, Modify And/Or Correct Arbitration Award,\u201d pointing out that \u201cthe Award is inconsistent on its face.\u201d He stated that, by adding the words \u201che does not need one\u201d to the Award, the \u201conly implication one could draw ... is that an implied easement was not needed because an express easement already existed.\u201d As previously pointed out, however, the arbitration award contained the finding that Sharp did not have a valid express easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">In denying Sharp\u2019s motion to reconsider the Award, the arbitrator did not acknowledge any inconsistency in the arbitration award. The arbitrator\u2019s denial stated as follows: \u201cSince the owner of Lot 2, presently Sharp, cannot traverse or cross Lot 1, Sharp has no access to Morgan Station Road. Lot 2 is landlocked.\u201d The arbitrator did not further discuss the apparent inconsistencies among his finding that Lot 2 was landlocked, his finding that Sharp has no express easement, and his finding that Sharp does not need an easement by necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">The Downeys filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Howard County to confirm the arbitration award, and Sharp filed a motion to vacate it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Circuit Court \u201cconfirm[ed] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>the arbitration award in [its] entirety,\u201d relying upon the Uniform Arbitration Act, Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3-224 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Section 3-224(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">\u201c(b) <em>Grounds. </em>\u2014 The court shall vacate an award if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">(1) An award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">(2) There was evident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral, corruption in any arbitrator, or misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">(3) The arbitrators exceeded their powers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">(4) The arbitrators refused to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown for the postponement, refused to hear evidence material to the controversy, or otherwise so conducted the hearing, contrary to the provisions of \u00a7 3-213 of this subtitle, as to prejudice substantially the rights of a party; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-10\">(5) There was no arbitration agreement as described in \u00a7 3-206 of this subtitle, the issue was not adversely determined in proceedings under \u00a7 3-208 of this subtitle, and the party did not participate in the arbitration hearing without raising the objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">Section 3-224 further provides in subsection (c) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-12\">\u201c(c) <em>When award not to he vacated.</em>\u2014The court shall not vacate the award or refuse to confirm the award on the ground that a court of law or equity could not or would not grant the same relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">In the Circuit Court, Sharp argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the arbitrator \u201cexceeded his powers\u201d and that the award was \u201cirrational\u201d because, without an easement over the Downeys\u2019 land, Sharp\u2019s land would be landlocked. The Circuit Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>rejecting this argument, stated that \u201can easement by necessity is not created simply because a parcel is landlocked.\u201d The court continued: \u201c[a]n owner may freely cut off access to his land,\u201d citing <em>Shpak v. Oletsky, </em>280 Md. 355, 371, 373 A.2d 1234, 1243 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Sharp noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals which, in a reported opinion, reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court, remanded the case with instructions to vacate several findings of the arbitration award,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and with further instructions, for \u201ca determination (whether by court or an arbitrator) of the precise location of the implied easement by necessity.\u201d <em>Sharp v. Downey, </em>197 Md.App. 123, 177-178, 13 A.3d 1, 33 (2010). The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion reviewed the applicable provisions of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act, \u00a7\u00a7 3-201 <em>et seq. </em>of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the \u201cArbitration Act\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d) and acknowledged that \u201cthe Act contemplates an extremely limited role for the courts in reviewing or countermanding an arbitrator\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Sharp, </em>197 Md.App. at 149, 13 A.3d at 16. While recognizing the Arbitration Act\u2019s limitations on the authority of the courts to overturn arbitration awards, the Court of Special Appeals proceeded to examine standards, not expressly mentioned in the Arbitration Act, which that court has used in the past to overturn arbitration awards under the Act. The Court of Special Appeals pointed out that arbitration awards which were \u201ccompletely irrational,\u201d or which demonstrated \u201cmanifest disregard of the law,\u201d or which were contrary to the State\u2019s public policy, had been overturned by previous Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Citing <em>O-S Corp. v. Kroll, </em>29 Md.App. 406, 409, 348 A.2d 870, 872 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>277 Md. 740 (1976), as a \u201ctouchstone case,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals noted that its <em>Kroll </em>opinion recognize[d] the \u201cvery limited extension of the reviewing court\u2019s scope of review to include authority to vacate an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>award that is \u2018completely irrational.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sharp, </em>197 Md.App. at 150, 13 A.3d at 17, quoting <em>Kroll, </em>29 Md.App. at 409, 348 A.2d at 872 (some internal quote marks omitted). The <em>Kroll </em>opinion had earlier explained (29 Md.App. at 409, 348 A.2d at 872, footnote omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">\u201cStatutory support for this [completely irrational standard] is found not only in the fact that arbitrators \u2018exceeded their powers\u2019 when they reached a completely irrational result, but also in the connotation of the words \u2018undue means\u2019 in Sec. 3-224(b)(1). An award that is \u2018completely irrational\u2019 is inferentially opprobrious ... causing it to be suspect in its conception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">While pointing out that the Court of Appeals has never adopted <em>Kroll\u2019s </em>\u201ccompletely irrational\u201d standard of review for arbitration awards under the Uniform Arbitration Act, the Court of Special Appeals stated that the Court of Appeals has \u201cnever rejected that standard\u201d either. <em>Sharp, </em>197 Md.App. at 151 n. 16, 13 A.3d at 17-18 n. 6, citing <em>MCR v. Greene, </em>148 Md.App. 91, 811 A.2d 331 (2002). The Court of Special Appeals has taken the position that, until the Court of Appeals rejects the \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d standard, \u201cwe shall assume its continued vitality in Maryland.\u201d <em>MCR v. Greene, supra, </em>148 Md.App. at 106 n. 8, 811 A.2d at 339 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The Court of Special Appeals next examined its use of the \u201cmanifest disregard of the law\u201d standard in vacating arbitration awards under the Uniform Arbitration Act. The intermediate appellate court commented that the Court of Appeals has also never adopted or rejected this standard in cases subject to the Uniform Arbitration Act. The Court of Special Appeals noted that some other jurisdictions viewed the \u201cmanifest disregard of the law\u201d standard as a judicially created ground, whereas \u201c[i]n contrast, our decisions have understood the \u2018manifest disregard\u2019 standard as inherent in the statutory grounds of \u2018undue means\u2019 and exceeding arbitral authority.\u201d 197 Md.App. at 158 n. 21, 13 A.3d at 22 n. 21. The Court of Special Appeals \u201cconclud[ed] that the arbitrator erred in rejecting an easement by necessity, and that his error rises to the level of manifest disregard of the law.\u201d 197 Md.App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>166, 13 A.3d at 26. The Court of Special Appeals also characterized Maryland law as having a \u201cstrong public policy underpinning the doctrine of implied easements by necessity,\u201d because \u201clandlocking a parcel renders the land unuseable for virtually any future purpose.\u201d 197 Md.App. at 167 and n. 25, 13 A.3d at 27 and n. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The Court of Special Appeals reviewed Maryland case law relating to implied easements by necessity and found that, of the essential elements to prove the existence of an easement by necessity, Sharp had proven each element to the arbitrator. The intermediate appellate court stated (197 Md.App. at 171, 13 A.3d at 29-30):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">\u201cHere, it was plain that Lot 1 and Lot 2 satisfied the first two elements to show an implied easement by necessity: \u2018(1) initial unity of title of the parcels of real property in question; (2) severance of the unity of title by conveyance of one of the parcels.\u2019 <em>Stansbury [v. MDR], supra., </em>390 Md. [476] at 489, 889 A.2d 403 [2006]. In that context, the arbitrator\u2019s statements that \u2018Sharp has no access to Morgan Station Road\u2019 and that \u2018Lot 2 is landlocked\u2019 are fundamentally irreconcilable with his statement that \u2018Ryan, now Sharp, does not have an implied easement by necessity, he does not need one.\u2019 As the Court in <em>Stansbury </em>explained, \u2018an easement by necessity exists by reason of the facts and circumstances present in a situation,\u2019 390 Md. at 485 n. 5, 889 A.2d 403. Given the arbitrator\u2019s finding that Lot 2 was landlocked, the necessity was present, and it was \u2018completely irrational,\u2019 <em>Kroll, </em>29 Md.App. at 409, 348 A.2d 870, for the arbitrator [to] conclude that appellant \u2018does not need\u2019 an easement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The Court of Special Appeals also found that \u201cit is quite clear that Ryan never intended to landlock Lot 2. To the contrary, both Ryan and Jekel [lot l\u2019s previous owner] unequivocally intended to create an easement, for the express purpose of ingress and egress to Lot 2.\u201d 197 Md.App. at 174, 13 A.3d at 31. The arbitrator, however, had inferred a different intention from the evidence. The arbitration award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>stated: \u201cit is apparent that [lot l\u2019s owners] did not want [their] easement rights disturbed\u201d by lot 2\u2019s owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">The Court of Special Appeals summarized its holdings as follows: (197 Md.App. at 176-177, 13 A.3d at 33, footnotes omitted, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">\u201cIn sum, here the arbitrator ruled that there was no implied easement by necessity because it was \u2018not needed,\u2019 although the Award, on its face, found the existence of all of the predicates of an implied easement by necessity. This error is central to the dispute at hand. It works a \u201c \u2018manifest injustice\u2019 \u201d to [Sharp] and any successor to his title ... and produced an <em>Award that violated dear public policy that disfavors rendering land inaccessible. </em>Therefore, we conclude that the error goes beyond mere legal error and constitutes <em>manifest disregard of the law.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The Downeys filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision. When the motion was denied, they petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which was granted. <em>Downey v. Sharp, </em>419 Md. 646, 20 A.3d 115 (2011). The respondent, Nicholas Sharp, did not file a cross-petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The Downeys, in their certiorari petition and briefs, maintain that the grounds set forth in \u00a7 3-224(b), for vacating an arbitration award under the Uniform Arbitration Act, are exclusive and do not include either an award which, in the reviewing court\u2019s judgment, is \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d or an award which demonstrates \u201cmanifest disregard of the law.\u201d Alternatively, the Downeys argue that, even if awards under the Act are reviewable for \u201ccomplete irrationality\u201d or \u201cmanifest disregard of the law,\u201d the award in the present case was neither irrational nor in manifest disregard of the law. The Downeys also challenge the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 reversal of \u201can arbitration award denying an easement by necessity based upon factual findings ... made by [the] reviewing court.\u201d (Certiorari petition at 4). Finally, the Downeys pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ent the broad question of whether \u201cthe Court of Special Appeals err[ed] when it vacated the arbitrator\u2019s finding that Respondent was not entitled to an easement by necessity across Petitioners\u2019 property.\u201d <em>(Ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The respondent Sharp argues in favor of reviewing Uniform Arbitration Act awards under both the \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d and the \u201cmanifest disregard of the law\u201d standards. Sharp contends that the Court of Special Appeals did not err in ordering that the award be vacated under either of these standards and ordering that the location of an easement by necessity over lot 1 should be determined by either the trial judge or an arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In \u00a7 3-224(b) and (c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, quoted earlier, the Uniform Arbitration Act enumerates the grounds upon which a \u201ccourt shall vacate\u201d an arbitration award. The grounds are: (1) if the \u201caward was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means;\u201d (2) if there was \u201cpartiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral, corruption in any arbitrator, or misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party;\u201d (3) if the \u201carbitrators exceeded their powers;\u201d (4) if the arbitrators committed certain procedural errors in the conduct of the hearing, \u201cas to prejudice substantially the rights of a party,\u201d (5) if there was no agreement to arbitrate. Subsection (c) provides that a court shall not vacate or refuse to confirm an award on the ground that a court would not grant the same relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">As previously pointed out, the grounds for vacating awards under the Act do not expressly include the two additional grounds for vacating awards utilized by the Court of Special Appeals, namely awards which were \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d and awards which demonstrated \u201cmanifest disregard of the law.\u201d Moreover, we disagree with the Court of Special Appeals that these two grounds are encompassed by the statutory grounds of an award that was \u201cprocured by ... undue means,\u201d \u00a7 3\u2014224(b)(1), or an award which exceeded the arbitrators\u2019 \u201cpowers,\u201d \u00a7 3-224(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>The statutory phrase \u201cundue means\u201d of \u201cprocur[ing]\u201d an award refers to how the award came about or what means were used to obtain an award. An \u201cirrational\u201d award or an award demonstrating a \u201cmanifest disregard of the law,\u201d however, refers to the final product, the final award itself. There is a distinction between the process, the \u201cundue means,\u201d and the product, the rational or \u201cirrational\u201d award. An award may have been \u201cprocured by ... undue means,\u201d but the award itself could be quite rational and legally correct in the view of a reviewing court. On the other hand, an award may have been properly procured, but it could be highly irrational and contrary to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 reliance on \u00a7 3-224(b)(3), i.e., the statutory ground of an award which exceeds the arbitrator\u2019s powers, is similarly misplaced. Thus, an issue or matter resolved by an award may be rational and legally correct but the arbitrator, under the arbitration agreement, may have had no power or authority to resolve the particular issue. On the other hand, an issue may have clearly been within the arbitrator\u2019s powers, but the arbitrator\u2019s resolution of the issue may have been irrational or manifestly erroneous as a matter of law. <em>See Messersmith, Inc. v. Barclay Townhouse, </em>313 Md. 652, 659-661, 547 A.2d 1048 (1988), where Judge Cole for the Court drew a sharp distinction between reviewing an award under the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d standard and applying the Act\u2019s \u201cexceeding the arbitrator\u2019s powers\u201d standard. This Court also pointed out in <em>Messersmith </em>that the \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d standard \u201chas never been approved by this Court.\u201d Vacating an award because it is \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d or \u201cmanifestly in disregard of the law\u201d is clearly different from vacating an award for one of the reasons delineated in \u00a7 3-224(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Consequently, judicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s award on the basis of \u201cirrationality\u201d or \u201cmanifest error of law\u201d does not fall within any of the grounds contained in \u00a7 3-224(b) of the Uniform Arbitration Act. The question is whether an arbitration award subject to \u00a7 3-224 of the Uniform Arbitration Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>should be vacated by a reviewing court if the court finds that the award is \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d or demonstrates a \u201cmanifest disregard of the law,\u201d even though those grounds are not included in \u00a7 3-224. In other jurisdictions, cases under the Uniform Arbitration Act, as well as cases under the similarly worded Federal Arbitration Act or under other similarly worded statutes, are divided on this question. <em>See Board of Education v. Prince George\u2019s Co. Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>309 Md. 85, 102-105, 522 A.2d 931, 939-941 (1987), collecting the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In <em>Board of Education v. Prince George\u2019s Co. Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>involving an arbitration agreement between an employer and its employees, both courts below and the parties took the position that the arbitration agreement was subject to the Uniform Arbitration Act, and that the Act\u2019s grounds for vacating the arbitration award were applicable. The Court of Special Appeals, relying on its earlier opinion in <em>O-S Corp. v. Kroll, supra, </em>29 Md.App. 406, 348 A.2d 870, held that the award was \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d and should be vacated on this ground. This Court granted a petition for a writ of certiorari to decide whether arbitration awards under the Uniform Act could be vacated on grounds not set forth in \u00a7 3-224(b) of the Act, <em>ie., </em>awards which are \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d or in \u201cmanifest disregard of the law.\u201d We did not reach this issue, however, as the parties and the courts below had overlooked \u00a7 3-206(b) of the Uniform Arbitration Act which provides that the Act</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">\u201cdoes not apply to an arbitration agreement between employers and employees or between their respective representatives unless it is expressly provided in the agreement that this subtitle shall apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Specifically with regard to the \u201cmanifest disregard of the law\u201d standard, the Court stated (309 Md. at 105, 522 A.2d at 941):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK9\">\u201cSince ... the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act is not applicable to the instant arbitration award, we need not and do not decide whether an arbitration award subject to the Uniform Act may be vacated for an error apparent on the face of the award or for a \u2018mistake so gross as to work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>manifest injustice\u2019 or for \u2018manifest disregard\u2019 of the law. Resolution of that issue by this Court must await an appropriate case where the question is presented. Under Maryland common law standards for reviewing arbitration awards, however, we hold that an award is subject to being vacated for a \u2018palpable mistake of law or fact ... apparent on the face of the award\u2019 or for a \u2018mistake so gross as to work manifest injustice.\u2019 As the award in this case is not governed by statutory review criteria, it is subject to these common law standards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><em>See also American Baptists v.

Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>and subsequent cases, we shall not in the present case reach the issue of whether an award subject to \u00a7 3-224 of the Uniform Arbitration Act may properly be vacated by a reviewing court on the grounds that it is \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d or demonstrates a \u201cmanifest disregard of the law.\u201d As we shall explain below, that issue is not presented by the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The Court of Special Appeals recognized that \u201cthe arbitrator\u2019s statements that \u2018Sharp has no access to Morgan Station Road\u2019 and that \u2018Lot 2 is landlocked\u2019 are fundamentally irreconcilable with his statement that \u2018Ryan, now Sharp, does not have an implied easement by necessity, he does not need one.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sharp, </em>197 Md.App. at 171, 13 A.3d at 29-30. The Court of Special Appeals, however, resolved this inconsistency by crediting the arbitrator\u2019s findings that Sharp has no access to Morgan Station Road and that lot 2 is landlocked, and by rejecting the arbitrator\u2019s finding that Sharp does not need an easement by necessity. The Court of Special Appeals also rejected the arbitrator\u2019s finding that lot l\u2019s owners \u201cdid not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>want [their] easement rights disturbed\u201d by lot 2\u2019s owner, and the appellate court substituted its own findings that \u201cit is quite clear that Ryan never intended to landlock Lot 2\u201d and that \u201cboth Ryan and Jekel unequivocally intended to create an easement.\u201d (197 Md.App. at 174, 13 A.3d at 31).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">This Court, on several occasions, has pointed out that, under Maryland law, reviewing \u201ccourts generally defer[] to the arbitrator\u2019s findings of fact and applications of law. * * * [M]ere errors of law and fact [do] not ordinarily furnish grounds for a court to vacate or refuse enforcement of an arbitration award.\u201d <em>Board of Education v. Prince George\u2019s Co. Educators\u2019 Assn., supra, </em>309 Md. at 98-99, 522 A.2d at 937. <em>See, e.g., American Baptists v. Trustees, supra, </em>335 Md. at 571, 644 A.2d at 1066; <em>Baltimore County v. City of Baltimore, supra, </em>329 Md. at 701, 621 A.2d at 868; <em>Amalgamated Transit Union, Div. 1300 v.

Morrow, </em>130 Md. 255, 260, 100 A. 292, 293 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In the case at bar, not only did the Court of Special Appeals refuse to defer to the arbitrator\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, but the intermediate appellate court rendered its own findings of fact and conclusions, which were contrary to those of the arbitrator. Moreover, the Court of Special Appeals did so in a case where there was no transcript of the proceedings before the arbitrator and where exhibits submitted at the arbitration proceedings were not included in the record. A transcript of the hearing before the arbitrator, if there had been one, and the exhibits, might have shed some light upon the arbitrator\u2019s apparent conflicting findings of fact. There might have been testimony, documentary evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>concessions, statements of counsel, etc., which might have explained the arbitrator\u2019s findings in the first amendment to the arbitration award which stated that Sharp \u201cdoes not have an implied easement by necessity, <em>he does not need one.\u201d </em>(Italicized language added by the amendment).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A transcript of the hearing before the arbitrator and the exhibits might have helped to explain some of the other inconsistences or ambiguities in the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">If we were to assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that an award under the Act should be vacated upon a judicial determination that the award was \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d or that it demonstrated \u201cmanifest disregard of the law,\u201d we would not be able, upon this record, to conclude that the award was \u201ccompletely irrational\u201d or in \u201cmanifest disregard of the law.\u201d Such conclusion, without any knowledge of what was said or submitted at the arbitration hearing, might itself be deemed \u201cirrational.\u201d The arbitrator\u2019s final statement in denying Sharp\u2019s motion to reconsider, namely that \u201cLot 2 is landlocked,\u201d would not compel the result reached by the Court of Special Appeals. It is entitled to no more weight than the earlier statement in the first amendment to the award, that Sharp \u201cdoes not need\u201d an easement by necessity. Moreover, an easement by necessity does not automatically flow from every situation of landlocked property. <em>See Shpak v. Oletsky, supra, </em>280 Md. at 364-365, 373 A.2d at 1240 (\u201c[T]he law does not prohibit one from cutting himself off from all access to his land\u201d), and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Although we disagree with the grounds upon which the Court of Special Appeals ordered that the award be vacated, as well as that court\u2019s direction that an easement over the Downeys\u2019 property be located, it is clear that the arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>award, in part, was contradictory. There is a statutory provision which appears to be relevant to this circumstance, namely \u00a7 3-225(a) of the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act. Section 3-225 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">\u201c\u00a7 3-225. Rehearing before arbitrators.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">(a) <em>New arbitrators.</em>\u2014If any award is vacated on grounds other than those stated in \u00a7 3\u2014224(b)(5) of this subtitle, the court may order a rehearing before new arbitrators selected by the parties as provided by the agreement, or by the court in absence of an agreement as provided in \u00a7 3-211 of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">(b) <em>Same arbitrators.</em>\u2014If the award is vacated on grounds set forth in \u00a7 3-224(b)(3) and (4) of this subtitle, the court may order a rehearing before the arbitrators who made the award or their successors appointed in accordance with \u00a7 3-211 of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">(c) <em>Time.</em>\u2014The time within which the agreement requires the award to be made is applicable to the rehearing and commences from the date of the order or at a time specified by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Although this Court has not previously dealt with \u00a7 3-225, courts elsewhere have held that \u00a7 3-225(a) or a similar statute authorizes a court to vacate an award and order a rehearing before arbitrators when the award is contradictory, uncertain, or requires clarification. Some cases reach this result even in the absence of a statutory provision. In a leading opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in a commercial arbitration case, stated <em>(Americas Ins. Co. v. Seagull Compania Naviera, S.A., </em>774 F.2d 64, 67 (2d Cir. 1985)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">\u201cAlthough judicial review of an arbitration award is very narrowly limited, <em>Diapulse Corporation of America v. Carba, Ltd., </em>626 F.2d 1108, 1110 (2d Cir.1980), a court should not attempt to enforce an award that is ambiguous or indefinite, <em>id. </em>at 1111; <em>Bell Aerospace Co. v. Local 516, UAW, </em>500 F.2d 921, 923 (2d Cir.1974). An ambiguous award should be remanded to the arbitrators so that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>court will know exactly what it is being asked to enforce. <em>Cleveland Paper Handlers and Sheet Straighteners Union No. 11 v. E.W. Scripps Co., </em>681 F.2d 457, 460 (6th Cir. 1982)(per curiam); <em>Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers International Union, Local 4-367 v. Rohm and Haas, Texas, Inc., </em>677 F.2d 492, 495 (5th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (Appendix). We believe there is sufficient ambiguity to require a remand in the instant case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\"><em>See also, e.g., Bell Aerospace Company v. Local 516, </em>500 F.2d 921, 922, 928 (2d Cir.1974)(\u201cThe employer ... appeals on the ground that the award was ambiguous and contradictory and should have been remanded for clarification. We find this claim justified and to that extent we reverse and remand. * * * Courts will not enforce an award that is incomplete, ambiguous, or contradictory\u201d), and cases there cited; <em>Zaninovich v. Teamster Farmworker Local Union 946, </em>86 Cal.App.3d 410, 150 Cal.Rptr. 233 (1978)(Case remanded to trial court with directions to vacate an \u201cuncertain\u201d award and order a rehearing by arbitrators); <em>Federal Signal Corp. v. SLC Technologies, </em>318 Ill.App.3d 1101, 1113, 252 Ill.Dec. 910, 743 N.E.2d 1066, 1075 (\u201c[T]he Act specifically gives the court the power to remand an award for clarification\u201d), <em>appeal denied, </em>195 Ill.2d 551, 257 Ill.Dec. 890, 754 N.E.2d 1285 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Section 3-225(a), by its language, is not limited to awards which are vacated for the reasons set forth in \u00a7 3-224(b). Moreover, when a court orders a rehearing before an arbitrator pursuant to \u00a7 3-225(a), because an award is contradictory, the court is not substituting its view of the law or the facts for that of the arbitrator. Rather, the decision of the arbitrator after rehearing will be the final award, subject to the very limited judicial review applicable to arbitration awards generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO VACATE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS PURSU<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ANT TO \u00a7 3-225(a) OF THE COURTS AND JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS ARTICLE.

Arbitration in this case occurred after protracted litigation involving several different properties and their owners. Pursuant to an agreement between the Downeys and Sharp that all remaining claims would be submitted to arbitration, the Circuit Court dismissed all pending claims and closed the case. Because the case now before the Court concerns only the arbitration award, we shall focus solely on the facts related to that award, and we shall not address the earlier litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\">. The arbitrator also heard arguments relating to the parties\u2019 disputes over various documents. These documents included the \"Riverfront <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Easement,\u201d two versions of a \"Jeep Trails Easement,\u201d and an alleged amendment to the Jeep Trails Easement, called the \"Ryan Amendment.\" Because the \"Riverfront Easement\u201d and the \"Ryan Amendment\u201d do not impact our decision with respect to an implied easement by necessity, we shall not discuss these portions of the arbitration award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b281-8\">. A portion of the arbitrator's decision dealt with two rival versions of the Jeep Trails Easement. Since neither party challenges the arbitrator\u2019s decision that the Second Jeep Trails Easement is the \"operative\u201d easement, all references in this opinion to the Jeep Trails Easement relate to the Second Jeep Trails Easement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b281-9\">. Due to the lack of transcribed proceedings and a limited record in this case, it is difficult to discern precisely how and why Sharp\u2019s property is or may be landlocked. As later discussed, the arbitration award also is confusing with regard to this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\">. It appears that Sharp needs to reach Morgan Station Road in order to have access to other roads. As Sharp\u2019s brief before the Court of Special Appeals explained, \u201cthere is no practical access from Lot 2 to Morgan Station Road over the entirety of Lot 2, and the only practical access is over Lot 1.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b282-5\">. This Court has defined an \u201ceasement\u201d in several opinions. Thus, in <em>Rogers v. P-M Hunter\u2019s Ridge, </em>407 Md. 712, 715-716 n. 1, 967 A.2d 807, 810 n. 1 (2009), Judge Battaglia for the Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">\"[a] dominant tenant is the owner of '[a]n estate that benefits from an easement'; a servient tenant is the owner of '[a]n estate burdened by an easement.\u2019 <em>See </em>Blacks Law Dictionary 589 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \u2018dominant estate' and 'servient estate\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The opinion later continued (407 Md. at 730-731, 967 A.2d at 819):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">\" \u2018In every instance of a private easement \u2014 that is, an easement not enjoyed by the public \u2014 there exists the characteristic feature of two distinct tenements \u2014 one dominant and the other servient.' <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs of Garrett County </em>v. <em>Bell Atlantic-Md., Inc., </em>346 Md. 160, 175, 695 A.2d 171, 179 (1997), quoting <em>Consol.

Also, if the \"easement\u201d extends to the boundary line between lots 1 and 2, as the arbitrator seemed to have found, it is unclear why it does not give access to lot 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b283-6\">.
