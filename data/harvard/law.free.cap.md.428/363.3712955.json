Petitioner Gregory Marshall was approaching trial in the Circuit Court for Allegany County on charges stemming from a prison incident. On the morning before trial, several preliminary matters were considered. Upon their conclusion, the venire panel was summoned to the courtroom so that voir dire could begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>The trial judge began to address the venire panel, but was interrupted almost immediately by Petitioner saying, \u201cYour honor, I\u2019d like to represent myself.\u201d The judge deferred consideration of this request until after roll call of the jury was taken, at which point he excused the venire panel and heard Petitioner\u2019s request to discharge counsel. The trial judge, applying Maryland Rule 4\u2014215(e), ultimately allowed Petitioner to discharge counsel and proceed pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">After being tried and convicted, Petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the judge did not follow Rule 4-215(e)\u2019s mandatory procedures for a discharge of counsel. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed, holding that Rule 4-215(e) did not apply because meaningful trial proceedings had begun when Petitioner made his request. Thus, the Court of Special Appeals reviewed the trial judge\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion, finding none.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">We granted <em>certiorari, </em>and Petitioner presented the following question for our review, which we have summarized and restated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that, because meaningful trial proceedings had begun, Rule 4-215(e) did not apply to Petitioner\u2019s request to discharge counsel?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">We shall hold that the Court of Special Appeals correctly held that meaningful trial proceedings had begun and that Rule 4-215(e) did not apply to Petitioner\u2019s request to discharge his counsel. Therefore, the Court of Special Appeals properly reviewed whether the trial judge had abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Statement of Facts and Legal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Beginning September 30, 2009, Petitioner was tried in the Circuit Court for Allegany County on assault charges,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stemming from an incident in which he threw feces onto three correctional officers at the Western Correctional Institute in Cresaptown. That morning, before the venire panel was called to the courtroom, the court dealt with several preliminary matters, including: a motion to sequester witnesses; Petitioner\u2019s withdrawal of a not criminally responsible plea; whether Petitioner was competent to stand trial; Petitioner\u2019s rights and responsibilities during trial; and Petitioner\u2019s decision to wear prison clothing instead of a jacket and tie.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Afterward, the venire panel was summoned to the courtroom. The trial judge began to address the venire panel but was interrupted, as indicated by the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">THE COURT: ... All right. Good morning ah, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. My name is ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">MARSHALL: Your Honor I\u2019d like to represent myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">THE COURT: All right. Would you let me finish talking with the jury and then we\u2019ll discuss that with you[,] Mr. Marshall. Is that acceptable to you? Please be seated and we\u2019ll see if that is acceptable to you. Please be seated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">The judge then addressed the venire panel:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">Good morning, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. This is a criminal case that we are going to be involved with selection today. This is the case of the State of Maryland vs. Gregory Marshall. The first thing I\u2019m going to do is go through what\u2019s called voir dire, questions of you to assist the defendant and the State and the Court in selecting a fair and impartial jury. There might well be preliminary matters that I\u2019ll then deal with afterwards, Mr. Marshall\u2019s request, State\u2019s request. We\u2019re going to do those in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>sequence and in an order. So at this juncture what I\u2019d like you to do is the Clerk\u2019s going to take the roll. She\u2019s going to call your number and when you hear your number if you\u2019d simply say here and raise your hand, that\u2019ll be appreciated. Then the Clerk will swear you to your voir dire. You\u2019ll be asked to stand and accept an oath to answer the questions that I\u2019ll pose to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The clerk took roll of the venire panel and swore them in.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The trial judge then had them leave the courtroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">THE COURT: ... [A]t this point in time ladies and gentlemen ah, again, welcome and thank you for being here. Ah, at this point in time I need to hear from the defendant on a request that he wishes to make. It occurs to me that it\u2019s appropriate that such be heard out of your presence. So ah, at this juncture I\u2019m going to, with apologies, ask you to return upstairs until I can hear and deal with whatever preliminary matters might now exist and then we\u2019ll bring you back to the courtroom ah, as quickly as we can. Now that you\u2019ve been sworn to voir dire, that\u2019s the phase which we\u2019ll pick up at that point in time. So Mr. Bailiff if you\u2019ll now take the jury back upstairs, I\u2019ll appreciate that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Once the panel had departed, the judge recognized what Petitioner had said about firing his attorney and read to him Maryland Rule 4-215(e), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">Discharge of Counsel \u2014 Waiver. If a defendant requests permission to discharge an attorney whose appearance has been entered, the court shall permit the defendant to explain the reasons for the request. If the court finds that there is a meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court shall permit the discharge of counsel; continue the action if necessary; and advise the defendant that if new counsel does not enter an appearance by the next scheduled trial date, the action will proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel. If the court finds no meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court may not permit the discharge of counsel without first informing the defendant that the trial will proceed as scheduled with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>defendant unrepresented by counsel if the defendant discharges counsel and does not have new counsel. If the court permits the defendant to discharge counsel, it shall comply with subsections (a)(1)-(4) of this Rule if the docket or file does not reflect prior compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Maryland Rule 4-215(e). The judge explained that subsections (a)(1)-(4) of that rule relate \u201cto reviewing the docket to make sure [Petitioner was] formally and properly advised of [his] rights to counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Having read the rule, the judge asked Petitioner to clarify his request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">THE COURT: That is the operative rule under which I function[,] Mr. Marshall. If now you want to indicate whether or not you are asking that your attorney be discharged and if so, I now give you the opportunity to ah, give whatever reason or rationale as you wish or not. I couldn\u2019t really tell from what you were saying with the jury what your intentions were. So with that in mind, what do you want to tell me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">MARSHALL: I want to represent myself[,] Your Honor. I\u2019m not being represented and I want to represent myself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Petitioner said he thought his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient for several reasons. He claimed his attorney failed to talk to any favorable witnesses and had not made any attempt to dismiss the case for lack of physical evidence against him. Petitioner insisted that any statements he made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>should have been suppressed, that he was not properly booked after the incident, and that his attorney wanted him to have a jury trial despite his wishes. He also argued that the incident with the correctional officers was racially motivated and that his attorney did not consider that with him. Petitioner concluded by saying his attorney did not have any of Petitioner\u2019s \u201cviewpoints\u201d on how Petitioner wanted to proceed with the case, and Petitioner affirmed his desire to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The judge then advised Marshall of the charges he faced and the maximum penalties, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">THE COURT: [M]y job and function among other things is to advise you of those maximum penalties that you are facing in this ease. Ah, does that information in any fashion change your desire that you\u2019re expressing to me at this point or not? I just need to make certain that you\u2019re aware of the maximum penalties!?]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Petitioner stated that he would not change his mind. The judge heard from Petitioner\u2019s attorney and the prosecutor about the request. His attorney said Petitioner had been generally uncooperative and uncommunicative before trial. The prosecutor indicated Petitioner\u2019s attorney was responsive and had filed appropriate motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The trial judge deemed Rule 4-215 applicable and discussed the actions of Petitioner\u2019s attorney. The judge mentioned that Petitioner\u2019s attorney had: filed appropriate discovery requests; raised the issue of Petitioner\u2019s competency to stand trial; secured an independent evaluation of Petitioner\u2019s competency; proposed jury instructions and voir dire questions; and arranged for Petitioner to wear civilian clothes at trial\u2014 which Petitioner ultimately did not do. The judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">THE COURT: [B]efore I cross one direction or another I want to let you know this, what I have tried to do is set forth on the record and set forth for everyone\u2019s understanding why I believe your motion to discharge your attorney today, the morning of trial, is not meritorious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>As I read the rule to you earlier, having reached that conclusion, if you determine to desire to persist in your desire to discharge your attorney, then as I understand the rule I have no latitude other than to say okay that is being done, but without meritorious reason. So I will now again repeat to you, if the court finds no meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court may not permit the discharge of counsel without first informing the defendant that the trial will proceed as scheduled with the defendant unrepresented by counsel if the defendant discharges counsel and does not have new counsel. You do not have new counsel here today. I do not intend necessarily to continue this matter. So I\u2019m advising you sir, if you now tell me after I\u2019ve made these various findings it is still my desire to discharge my attorney knowing that we will proceed to trial, knowing that you will proceed without the aid of an experienced attorney on very serious charges with substantial sentences, then that will be accorded you. The attorney will leave with my appreciation for his patience and efforts and we will conduct a trial here today. You will still have a fair trial as best we can perform it for you, but you will not have the aid of your attorney. With all that in mind, simple statement, is it your desire, does it remain your desire to discharge your attorney at this point in time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">MARSHALL: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">THE COURT: Thank you very much. Mr. Harvey, your appearance is noted as having been stricken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">With the judge\u2019s permission, when defense counsel exited the courtroom, he left his trial notebook, a notepad, and a pen for Petitioner to use.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The trial proceeded, and Petitioner was eventually convicted of three counts of maliciously causing an employee of a State correctional facility to come into contact with bodily substances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioner timely appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the trial court did not properly comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>with Rule 4-215 when it permitted him to discharge his counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Petitioner argued that the trial court failed to ascertain that he had received a copy of the charging document; failed to inform him of the importance of the assistance of counsel; and failed to determine whether his decision to represent himself was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The intermediate appellate court held that Rule 4-215 did not apply to Petitioner because \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d had begun when Petitioner stated his intention to represent himself. Because Rule 4-215 did not apply, the Court of Special Appeals looked to <em>State v. Brown, </em>342 Md. 404, 676 A.2d 513 (1996) and held that the trial judge was \u201conly required to allow Marshall an opportunity to give his reasons for wanting to discharge counsel and to rule on that request.\u201d The intermediate appellate court cited <em>Brown </em>for the following criteria, which guide a trial court in deciding whether to allow a defendant to dismiss counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">(1) the merit of the reason for discharge; (2) the quality of counsel\u2019s representation prior to the request; (3) the disruptive effect, if any, that discharge would have on the proceedings; (4) the timing of the request; (5) the complexity and stage of the proceedings; and (6) any prior requests by the defendant to discharge counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\"><em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 428, 676 A.2d at 525. From there, the Court of Special Appeals considered the first two factors relevant, disregarded the others as irrelevant, and concluded that the trial court had not abused its discretion in granting Petitioner\u2019s request to discharge counsel and allowing him to proceed pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Petitioner appealed to this Court, and we granted <em>ceriiorari </em>on December 16, 2011. <em>See Marshall v. State, 424 </em>Md. 54, 33 A.3d 981 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">In holding that \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d had begun, the Court of Special Appeals relied on our decision in <em>State v. Hardy, </em>415 Md. 612, 4 A.3d 908 (2010). In that case, we had occasion to explain the application of Rule 4-215(e):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">When applicable, Rule 4-215(e) demands strict compliance. \u201cThe provisions of the rule are mandatory\u201d and a trial court\u2019s departure from them constitutes reversible error. Where a motion to discharge counsel is made during trial, however, Rule 4-215(e) does not apply, and we evaluate the trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to discharge counsel under the far more lenient abuse of discretion standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEj\"><em>Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 621, 4 A.3d at 913 (citations omitted). <em>Hardy </em>also cited <em>Brown, </em>in which we made clear that Rule 4-215 does not apply after \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d have begun. <em>See Brown, </em>342 Md. at 426, 676 A.2d at 524 (\u201cAfter meaningful trial proceedings have commenced, the decision to permit the defendant to exercise either right must be committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. Once trial begins, therefore, Rule 4-215 no longer governs, although the court must still adhere to constitutional standards.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In <em>Brown, </em>the trial had begun, and the defendant did not attempt to discharge his counsel until the State called its first witness. <em>Id. </em>at 410, 676 A.2d at 516. In <em>Hardy, </em>we clarified that \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d can occur before the trial itself begins. <em>See Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 627, 4 A.3d at 916 (\u201c[T]he proper resolution of this issue is that \u2018meaningful trial proceedings\u2019 <em>have </em>begun when a request to discharge counsel is made during voir dire.\u201d). We analyzed the term \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings,\u201d beginning with its plain meaning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">First, voir dire is a \u201cmeaningful trial proceeding\u201d under the plain meaning of the phrase. There can be no trial without a trier of fact, and there can be no trier of fact in a jury trial without the jury selection process of voir dire. As such, the voir dire process represents a necessary step in any jury trial, and, therefore, with the beginning of voir dire, meaningful trial proceedings must have begun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>Id., </em>4 A.3d at 916-17. Judge Harrell, writing for the Court, used a functional analysis to draw the line marking the beginning of meaningful trial proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">Second, voir dire is a \u201cmeaningful trial proceeding\u201d under the functional definition of the phrase. In situations where Rule 4\u2014215(e) applies, it permits essentially a criminal defendant to discharge defense counsel almost at will. When the process of jury selection begins, however, the soon-to-be members of the jury share the courtroom with the defendant and defense counsel. From this point on, allowing the defendant to change at will his or her representation, as Rule 4-215(e) permits, would risk confusing the prospective jurors, one of the concerns against which <em>Brown </em>warns. For example, jurors simply may become confused by seeing the defendant appear with an attorney one moment and without one the next, or, because defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy may affect the questions and challenges posed during voir dire, jurors may be confused when a defendant\u2019s motion to discharge counsel is granted and defendant embarks on [an] abrupt and apparent change to that strategy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj0\"><em>Id., 4 </em>A.3d at 917. Court administration was relevant to our holding as well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">In addition, allowing such a change to defense counsel after the entire venire panel is summoned to the courtroom poses a considerable risk of disruption to the trial proceedings in that courtroom, to the court\u2019s jury assignment system (as it is compelled to work around the court\u2019s consideration of the defendant\u2019s request), and to the court\u2019s administration as a whole.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asn\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">These dual considerations \u2014 to honor the Rule\u2019s text, and to avoid the dangers of disruption and jury confusion \u2014 led us to our ultimate conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>[W]e hold that \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d have begun after a trial court has begun the voir dire process in a criminal trial. As such, Rule 4-215(e) does not apply literally here to the court\u2019s consideration of Hardy\u2019s motion to dismiss his trial counsel, which was brought after several voir dire questions had been asked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 628, 4 A.3d at 917. The question now presented is: When does voir dire begin?</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The Court of Special Appeals explained where Marshall\u2019s request fit in the timeline of events that transpired as the venire panel was brought to the courtroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">On the first day of trial in this case, as the jury entered the courtroom, the court acknowledged their presence and said good morning. [Petitioner] addressed the court and said, \u2018Tour Honor, I\u2019d like to represent myself.\u201d The court did not immediately address his request and allowed the clerk to take attendance. The court then allowed the clerk to swear in the venire. After excusing the jury, the court addressed [Petitioner.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The Court of Special Appeals then quoted the trial court\u2019s reading and explanation of Rule 4-215(e) to Petitioner.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> From there, the intermediate appellate court used these facts, and our decisions in <em>Brown </em>and <em>Hardy, </em>to conclude that meaningful trial proceedings had begun and that Rule 4-215 therefore did not apply to Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Petitioner argues that this conclusion was erroneous and that meaningful trial proceedings had not begun when Peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>tioner requested to represent himself. To conclude that meaningful trial proceedings had begun, Petitioner argues that we must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">either draw a bright line rule holding that meaningful voir dire begins when the toe of the first juror crosses the threshold of the [courtroom], or that in the present case meaningful trial proceedings functionally began because the court delayed responding to the question, allowing the jury to observe the [Petitioner in the courtroom shackled and next to his attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Petitioner argues that, in <em>Hardy, </em>this Court \u201csought to avoid\u201d drawing a bright line rule that marked the beginning of meaningful trial proceedings. In <em>Hardy, </em>we recognized that the rule from <em>Brown </em>was not a bright line. <em>See Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 624-25, 4 A.3d at 915 (\u201cWe refused to draw a bright line definition delimiting the precise moment that marks the beginning of \u2018meaningful trial proceedings!.]\u2019 \u201d)\u2022 Despite this recognition, we made it clear that once voir dire begins, so have meaningful trial proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 628, 4 A.3d at 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Petitioner attempts to distinguish the factual circumstances of <em>Hardy </em>from his own. In <em>Hardy, </em>the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss his trial counsel \u201cwas brought after several voir dire questions had been asked.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Here, no questions had been posed when Petitioner asked to represent himself. The judge had barely begun to speak to the venire panel \u2014 only managing to wish them good morning, unable to even identify himself \u2014 when Petitioner interrupted him with his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Petitioner continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">[T]he standard question! ] posed when trial counsel is introduced! \u2014 jwhether [the venire members] knew him or her[ \u2014 ]had not been asked; without this question the jury did not see [Petitioner] as a counseled defendant who curiously lost his lawyer. Instead, the request was made before trial, as the prospective jurors were filing into the courtroom, and the judge deferred consideration of the request until a roll call of the jurors had been completed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Petitioner thus argues that there was no risk of confusion to the jurors, a risk that underscored our functional analysis in <em>Hardy. </em>There is reason to believe, however, that the jury could have \u201cbecome confused by seeing the defendant appear with an attorney one moment and without one the next[.]\u201d <em>Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 627, 4 A.3d at 917. As the judge was addressing the venire panel, Petitioner was at the defendant\u2019s table with his attorney and professed a desire to represent himself. The jury was asked to leave, and upon their return, Petitioner was without counsel. This may have created the sort of confusion we warned about in <em>Hardy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Petitioner\u2019s argument also fails to take into account language from <em>Hardy </em>in which we described the risk of disruption in allowing a defendant to change counsel \u201cafter the entire venire panel is summoned to the courtroom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Petitioner does argue that he \u201craised the issue at a time where an ultimate decision to discharge counsel would not have brought about the confusion envisioned in <em>Hardy </em>because [Petitioner\u2019s] discharged attorney was not introduced to the jury prior to the request being made, so there was no reason for the jury to question his absence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Besides confusion, however, Petitioner offers no reason why we should reconsider our functional analysis in <em>Hardy </em>and deviate from the inapplicability of Rule 4-215(e) \u201cafter the entire venire panel is summoned.\u201d Furthermore, it is clear from the record that Petitioner\u2019s request did cause a disruption in trial proceedings, as the venire panel had to be dismissed from the courtroom immediately after having been summoned, seated, introduced, and verified by the court clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Alternatively, Petitioner believes a finding that meaningful trial proceedings had begun at the time of his request would \u201ccut perilously close to the fundamental [constitutional right of an accused to represent himself.\u201d Petitioner directs our attention to <em>Brown, </em>in which we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">A defendant must have a last clear chance to assert his constitutional right. If there must be a point beyond which the defendant forfeits the unqualified right to defend pro se, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>that point should not come before meaningful trial proceedings have commenced. We have not entered the age of \u201cstop-watch jurisprudence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-5\"><em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 423, 676 A.2d at 522 (quoting <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>553 F.2d 886, 895 (5th Cir.1977)). In other cases, we have recognized the underlying importance of this \u201clast clear chance\u201d principle, which assures the defendant an opportunity to assert his constitutional right to self-representation before meaningful trial proceedings have begun. <em>See Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 625-26 n. 10, 4 A.3d at 916 n. 10; <em>State v. Campbell, </em>385 Md. 616, 633, 870 A.2d 217, 226-27 (2005). This principle is designed to prevent unjustified delays and obstructions in the timely administration of justice. <em>See Brown, </em>342 Md. at 423 n. 9, 676 A.2d at 523 n. 9; <em>Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 625, 4 A.3d at 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The State argues, and we agree, that Petitioner had ample opportunity to assert his constitutional right to self-representation before the venire panel entered the courtroom for jury selection. The record reflects that the trial court considered numerous preliminary matters in the morning before voir dire began, including a motion for witness sequestration, Petitioner\u2019s withdrawal of his not criminally responsible plea, a finding of Petitioner\u2019s competency to stand trial, and Petitioner\u2019s decision not to wear civilian clothing during his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Marshall was afforded the opportunity to speak to the court during these preliminary proceedings. When the court considered Petitioner\u2019s motion to withdraw his not criminally responsible plea, Petitioner interrupted his attorney and spoke about unrelated matters, which the court indulged for some time before stopping him, going so far as to say he would talk with Petitioner \u201ca bit more\u201d after hearing from Petitioner\u2019s attorney. Then, as the court considered Petitioner\u2019s decision to wear his prison clothes, the judge asked Petitioner if he wanted to change into a jacket and tie. In response, Petitioner said nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Petitioner argues that his request to represent himself came at \u201cthe first opportunity for him to make his wishes known to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>the judge,\u201d but we are persuaded by the State\u2019s argument that Petitioner had ample opportunity to assert his right to represent himself before meaningful trial proceedings had begun. Once the venire panel was summoned to the courtroom, meaningful trial proceedings had begun. As such, the standard of review on appeal is not whether the trial judge complied with the dictates of Rule 4-215(e), but rather, whether the trial judge\u2019s action constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">We therefore hold that the Court of Special Appeals did not err when it held that meaningful trial proceedings had begun. It also did not err in holding that Rule 4-215(e) did not apply to Petitioner\u2019s request to discharge his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

I wrote separately in <em>Hardy </em>but I agreed with the Majority\u2019s analysis on the demarcation of when \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d had begun. <em>See State v.

Op. at 364-66, 51 A.3d at 641-42 (2012). In this case, after some preliminary matters had been disposed of, a venire panel was summoned to the courtroom. After the panel members entered the courtroom, the trial judge greeted them, but, before he could introduce himself, he was interrupted by the petitioner\u2019s request to represent himself. Op. at 366-67, 51 A.3d at 642-43 (2012). Given the insignificance of what occurred in the courtroom before the appellant\u2019s request,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the logical effect of this holding, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>majority recognizes, <em>id. </em>at 374 n. 7, 376, 51 A.3d at 647 n. 7, 648-49 is to preclude the invocation of a Rule 4-215 request after the venire has been summoned. In so doing, it continues on the path it took in <em>State v. Hardy, </em>415 Md. 612, 624-25, 4 A.3d 908, 915 (2010) and has deviated further from the teachings of <em>State v. Brown, </em>342 Md. 404, 676 A.2d 513 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In <em>Brown, </em>this Court recognized that there is a limitation on when a request to discharge counsel or to proceed <em>pro se </em>pursuant to Rule 4-215 must be made, defining it as being before \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d begin. 342 Md. at 426, 676 A.2d at 524. We declined to define or establish a precise moment in time when that occurs, preferring to leave that determination to be made on a case-by-case basis. <em>See id. </em>at 423, 676 A.2d at 522-23 (refusing to adopt \u201can inflexible rule of <em>per se </em>untimeliness\u201d). There, the request to discharge counsel was made by the defendant during trial, <em>id. </em>at 410, 676 A.2d at 516, before the State had \u201ccompleted the examination of its first witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court held: \u201cRule 4-215 applies up to and including the beginning of trial, but not after meaningful trial proceedings have begun,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 428, 676 A.2d at 525, and, since trial had begun in that case, the Rule did not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 428, 676 A.2d at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">In <em>Hardy, </em>a divided Court misapplied the <em>Brown </em>holding and began the erosion of defendants\u2019 rights to counsel and to represent themselves <em>pro se </em>that today\u2019s decision continues. There, the defendant\u2019s request to discharge counsel was made during the voir dire proceedings, after a few questions, 4 or 5, had been asked. <em>Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 634, 4 A.3d at 921. Despite the fact that voir dire is a pre-trial proceeding, unlike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>examination of a witness during trial, and the concerns addressed, and warned against, in <em>Brown, </em>juror confusion and undue interference with trial, were trial concerns, which also were discussed in that context \u2014 it was, after all, a case where the request came after trial had begun \u2014 , the majority held that \u201c \u2018meaningful trial proceedings\u2019 have begun after a trial court has begun the voir dire process in a criminal trial.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 627, 4 A.3d at 916-917.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">As indicated, the majority in this case, continues along the path forged by <em>Hardy, </em>only further deviating from <em>Brown </em>and further and more blatantly undermining the right to counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>and self representation, rights which this Court recognizes are implicated by Rule 4-215. <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 412-13, 676 A.2d at 517 (\u201cA defendant\u2019s request to dismiss [] counsel implicates two rights that are fundamental to our system of criminal justice: the defendant\u2019s right to counsel, and the defendant\u2019s right to self-representation.\u201d); <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 817, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2532, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, 571 (1975) (\u201c[I]mplicit also in the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of a right to the assistance of counsel, is \u2018the right of the accused personally to manage and conduct his own defense in a criminal case.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Plattner, </em>330 F.2d 271, 274 (2d Cir.1964)). It thus establishes yet another, more restrictive \u201cbright line.\u201d To be sure, the majority, in <em>Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 627, 4 A.3d at 917, expressed concern about allowing the defense counsel to be discharged \u201cafter the entire venire panel is summoned to the courtroom [because it] poses a considerable risk of disruption to the trial proceedings in that courtroom, to the court\u2019s jury assignment system (as it is compelled to work around the court\u2019s consideration of the defendant\u2019s request), and to the court\u2019s administration as a whole.\u201d I did not interpret that comment then, nor do I now, as indicating that the \u201cstart of voir dire,\u201d which its holding identified as the critical point, was synonymous with the summoning of the venire.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">I dissent. The petitioner made his request to proceed <em>pro se </em>before any trial proceedings began, never mind \u201cmeaningful\u201d ones. I set forth my reasons extensively in my dissent to the <em>Hardy </em>decision. I stand by that dissent and adopt it for purposes of this dissent, with a few additions and embellishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">This case presents a significantly different factual scenario from that addressed in <em>Hardy. </em>Here, the petitioner\u2019s request to discharge counsel was made after the venire panel had been summoned and entered the courtroom and after the trial judge had begun introductory remarks, but before the panel had been oriented by reference to the facts of the case and parties and before the panel had been sworn. Thus, when the petitioner\u2019s request was made, the venire panel had no knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>edge of the case or the parties and, because it had not been sworn, no questions had been posed to it. The majority concludes, nevertheless, that voir dire, and thus, \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings had begun.\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>428 Md. at 377-78, 51 A.3d at 649. That simply is not so. In fact, such a conclusion strains, if not overwhelms, logic and common sense. Summoning the potential fact-finders for duty, to participate in the voir dire process, well may be a proceeding, or a part of a proceeding, but their mere appearance at the assigned time and place does not make it a \u201cmeaningful proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The majority adopts the <em>Hardy </em>plain meaning rationale that \u201cthe voir dire process represents a necessary step in any jury trial, and, therefore, with the beginning of voir dire, meaningful trial proceedings must have begun.\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>428 Md. at 372, 51 A.3d at 646 (quoting <em>Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 627, 4 A.3d at 916-17). I respond, as I did in <em>Hardy, </em>by pointing out that a \u201cnecessary step\u201d in a jury trial rationale is too general to be meaningful or helpful as an analytical tool. 415 Md. at 643-44, 4 A.3d at 926-27. Under such a rationale, an offender\u2019s arraignment, request for a jury trial, discovery hearings, the court\u2019s setting of a trial date on its calendar, and/or any other necessary processes that are, or may be, prerequisite to a jury trial, under a plain meaning analysis, would be \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings.\u201d Of course, our case law categorically excludes initial appearances and suppression hearings, pretrial stages of trial, from the category of \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings.\u201d <em>Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 625, 4 A.3d at 915 (citing <em>Joseph v. State, </em>190 Md.App. 275, 288, 988 A.2d 545, 553 (2010); <em>Hawkins v. State, </em>130 Md.App. 679, 688, 747 A.2d 759, 764 (2000); <em>Gonzales v. State, </em>408 Md. 515, 537, 970 A.2d 908, 921 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Moreover, a plain meaning analysis must, at the very least, reference, take account of, and be consistent with, the commonly understood or, if applicable, technical meaning of the terms used. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, also terming it \u201cvoir dire exam\u201d and \u201cexamination on the voir dire,\u201d defines \u201cvoir dire\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>\u201c1. A preliminary examination of a prospective juror by a judge or lawyer to decide whether the prospect is qualified and suitable to serve on a jury. 2. A preliminary examination to test the competence of a witness or evidence. 3. <em>Hist. </em>An oath administered to a witness requiring that witness to answer truthfully in response to questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1569 (7th Ed.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">While the historical, now obsolete, definition of \u201cvoir dire\u201d was a witness\u2019 swearing-in, the generally understood, which also is the legally technical, definition of voir dire is the <em>questioning </em>or <em>examination </em>into the character and possible biases<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of prospective jurors to determine their competence to serve as jurors. In that regard, this Court has defined voir dire as \u201cthe process by which prospective jurors are examined to determine whether cause for disqualification exists.\u201d <em>Dingle v. State, </em>361 Md. 1, 9, 759 A.2d 819, 823 (2000) (citing <em>Boyd v. State, </em>341 Md. 431, 435, 671 A.2d 33, 35 (1996)). According to this Court\u2019s definition of voir dire, the process cannot be said to have begun prior to the first question being asked and, it certainly cannot have begun if the members of the venire panel have not yet been sworn to answer questions truthfully. Voir dire, in point of fact, does not begin before a single question is posed and cannot consist merely of venirepersons filing into a courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">It is true that when the petitioner\u2019s request to proceed <em>pro se </em>was considered and decided, the venire panel had been oriented to some degree, had heard the court\u2019s opening remarks, been accounted for and sworn. That was not the petitioner\u2019s doing, however. He did not wait for these communications and processes to take place; rather, he made his request timely, before any of these things had occurred and it was the court who chose the timing for considering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>request. Had the court addressed the petitioner\u2019s request when it was made, there would have been no interaction whatsoever between the potential jurors and the parties, State and defendant, and very little \u2014 the court did not even succeed in introducing itself before the request came \u2014 between the potential jurors and the court. The majority is wrong in holding that \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d had begun based on its holding in <em>Hardy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Voir dire had not begun when the petitioner made his request. And the petitioner should not be prejudiced by the court\u2019s choice, because, for its convenience or other reasons, it chose to postpone consideration of the petitioner\u2019s request until it had \u201cfinish[ed] talking with the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That is precisely what the majority does, however, speculating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad\">\u201cPetitioner thus argues that there was no risk of confusion to the jurors, a risk that underscored our functional analysis in <em>Hardy. </em>There is reason to believe, however, that the jury could have \u2018become confused by seeing the defendant appear with an attorney one moment and without one the next[.]\u2019 <em>Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 627, 4 A.3d at 917. As the judge was addressing the venire panel, Petitioner was at the defendant\u2019s table with his attorney and professed a desire to represent himself. The jury was asked to leave, and upon their return, Petitioner was without counsel. This may have created the sort of confusion we warned about in <em>Hardy.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADu\"><em>Marshall, </em>428 Md. at 376, 51 A.3d at 648. Implicit in the majority\u2019s rejoinder is consideration of what occurred subsequent to the request and before discharge, the process of orienting and ultimately swearing the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">This Court has functionally defined \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d as the time when allowing the defendant to discharge counsel would pose a risk of disruption of trial procedure or confusion of the jury. <em>Marshall, </em>428 Md. at 372-74, 51 A.3d at 646-47 (citing <em>Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 627, 4 A.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>917). Using that definition, the majority holds that the functional concerns that existed in <em>Brown </em>exist here. The majority is wrong. There can be no juror confusion when there is no jury. At the time the petitioner\u2019s request was made, there was no jury, just venirepersons. Moreover, in this case, when the request was made, there had been no interaction between the parties, their counsel and the jury. Furthermore, the venirepersons were never addressed by counsel, so there was no risk of confusion due to a change in trial strategies. As I stated previously in <em>Hardy, </em>\u201c[a] defendant\u2019s access to effective counsel should not depend on, or take a backseat to, the potential \u2014 we have no idea whether, in fact, it will ever become reality \u2014 confusion of venirepersons, who may never hear his or her case, or any case, for that matter.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 415 Md. at 642, 4 A.3d at 926. The majority has identified and imposed a solution in search of a risk, one that may or may not exist or, if it does, may never come to realization. This prejudices a defendant more than would be the case were he seen by jurors, while still members of the venire, with counsel, before, later, being allowed to represent himself.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Lastly, there is no reason to believe that the petitioner made his request to discharge counsel in order to obstruct or delay the case. And I am far from convinced with regard to the majority\u2019s rejection of the petitioner\u2019s \u201c \u2018last clear chance\u2019 principle\u201d argument, recognized in <em>Brown. Marshall, </em>428 Md. at 376-77, 51 A.3d at 649 (citing <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 423, 676 A.2d at 522). Although this is an important principle, it is not a bright-line test as the majority makes it out to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Judge GREENE has authorized me to state that he joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-11\">. The petitioner\u2019s request was not considered by the court immediately after it was made. Rather, the court asked the petitioner, \"Would you let me finish talking with the jury and then we'll discuss that with you[?,]\u201d directed the petitioner to \"Please be seated\u201d and gave, to the venire panel, a brief overview of the voir dire process and allowed the court clerk to take the roll of the panel, and swear the venire. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>concluded, the venire panel was excused. Only then was the petitioner's discharge request addressed. By then, of course, the jury had been sworn and, so, arguably, so too had voir dire begun. When the court decided to address the request does not, and I submit should not, define when the request was made. Nor should it prejudice the petitioner\u2019s position. As we shall see, the considerations upon which the majority\u2019s holding depends do just that. Interestingly, and curiously, the trial court did not appear to believe that the request was untimely, that \"meaningful trial proceedings\u201d had begun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b408-6\">. In <em>Brown, </em>this Court identified the three alternatives for determining when a defendant\u2019s request to proceed <em>pro se </em>is untimely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">\"Courts differ on the exact point in time when the right to discharge counsel is curtailed. Some courts have held, for example, that requests to proceed pro se are <em>per se </em>untimely if asserted after the jury has been selected. Other jurisdictions have established impanelment of the jury as the 'cut-off point. Still others have held that requests are untimely if asserted after 'meaningful trial proceedings have commenced.' We agree with the view expressed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>553 F.2d 886 (5th Cir.1977), that: \u2018A defendant must have a last clear chance to assert his constitutional right. If there must be a point beyond which the defendant forfeits the unqualified right to defend pro se, that point should not come before meaningful trial proceedings have commenced. We have not entered the age of stopwatch jurisprudence.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">Thus we believe the better approach is to assess whether 'meaningful trial proceedings have commenced,\u2019 rather than adopting an inflexible rule of <em>per se </em>untimeliness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">342 Md. at 422-23, 676 A.2d at 522-23. (Internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">I am resolute in my conclusion that neither <em>Hardy </em>nor this case adheres to \"the flexible, case-by-case analysis that the Court in <em>Brown </em>sought to impose.\u201d In fact, I fear that the combination of this case and Hardy brings us to the place that the Court in <em>Brown </em>warned against, 342 Md. at 423, 676 A.2d at 522, where the order of the day is \"stopwatch jurisprudence,\u201d <em>id., </em>characterized by cutting a defendant's right to self-representation at an arbitrary point in time, unrelated to whether the principles and values underlying our system are furthered thereby. Setting as the line of demarcation when the venire panel enters the courtroom for jury selection, without regard to, or an examination of, whether there is, or could be, an actualized risk of juror confusion and bias based on the unique factual events of the case is a good example.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\">. Of course, the legal definition also defines \"voir dire\u201d as a preliminary proceeding. That is consistent with my <em>Hardy </em>dissent, in which I pointed out that \"voir dire does not take place 'throughout trial!\u2019 and] is a pre-trial proceeding!,]\u201d concluding that it is categorically and necessarily excluded from the definition of \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings,\u201d <em>see Hardy, </em>415 Md. at 641, 4 A.3d at 925.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\">. Clearly, the trial judge was referring to the venire and not the jury; the jury was not empaneled until some time later, after the petitioner\u2019s counsel had been discharged and voir dire conducted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b413-5\">. The majority observes, in response to the argument by the petitioner that no trial disruption would occur:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">\"Furthermore, it is clear from the record that Petitioner\u2019s request did cause a disruption in trial proceedings, as the venire panel had to be dismissed from the courtroom immediately after having been summoned, seated, introduced, and verified by the court clerk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-7\"><em>Marshall </em>v. <em>State, </em>428 Md. at 376, 51 A.3d at 649. Aside from the fact that the jurors were not excused immediately, ihis is not the kind of trial disruption to which the <em>Brown </em>opinion, on which <em>Hardy </em>heavily relied, had in mind. In <em>Brown, </em>we held that \"Rule 4-215 applies up to and <em>including the beginning of trial, </em>but not after meaningful trial proceedings have begun.\u201d 342 Md. at 428, 676 A.2d at 525 (emphasis added). By so holding, we sought to prevent the kind of disruption or confusion that would occur at trial.
