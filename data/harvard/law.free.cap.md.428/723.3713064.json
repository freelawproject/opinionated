In 2003, the County Council adopted an ordinance implementing that Charter provision. In 2011, the County Council amended the 2003 ordinance to provide, <em>inter alia, </em>that binding arbitration did not require the Council \u201cto appropriate funds or enact legislation necessary to implement a final written award\u201d in arbitration. An uncodified section of the 2011 Council bill also provided that, if any part of the 2011 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>ordinance were held invalid, the entire County Code section enacted by the 2003 ordinance, as amended through the 2011 ordinance, would be \u201cdeemed repealed by operation of law,\u201d with the result that impasses would be addressed by a Code section that did not authorize binding arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The Petitioners are certain aggrieved members of the bargaining units that are affected by the 2011 ordinance and those members\u2019 unions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They seek a declaratory judgment that the 2011 ordinance violates the 2002 Charter amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The Respondent is Anne Arundel County, Maryland (the County), a charter county with an executive budget system. The County contends that the 2002 Charter amendment, properly construed to avoid constitutional issues, requires the County Executive to propose funding in the budget to comply with a binding award, but that the County Council may reduce or eliminate that proposed appropriation. If the 2011 ordinance violates the Charter, the County seeks, by counterclaim, a declaratory judgment that the 2002 Charter amendment is unconstitutional under Maryland Constitution, Article XI-A (the Home Rule Amendment), \u00a7 3 because the Charter amendment is not \u201ccharter material,\u201d under <em>Cheeks v. Cedlair Corp., </em>287 Md. 595, 415 A.2d 255 (1980), and its progeny. Alternatively, if the binding arbitration provision in the Charter is valid, but the revised implementing provisions in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>2011 amendments to the County Code are invalid, the County seeks a declaration that the 2003 and 2011 Code provisions dealing with binding arbitration destruct under uncodified \u00a7 3 of the 2011 ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County held that the 2002 Charter amendment violated the Maryland Constitution. We granted Petitioners\u2019 application for certiorari and the County\u2019s Conditional Cross-Petition for certiorari prior to consideration of the case by the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Atkinson v. Anne Arundel County, </em>424 Md. 291, 35 A.3d 488 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">For the reasons that follow, we shall hold that the 2002 Charter amendment binds the County Council, and that portions of the 2011 ordinance, as well as its uncodified Section 3, violate the Charter and are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">\n<em>Historical and Legal Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The tension between public employee unions and local governments, particularly those bound by an executive budget system, has surfaced in Maryland appellate cases since at least <em>Mugford v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>185 Md. 266, 44 A.2d 745 (1945). Review of these cases, and of the legal background of the Charter and ordinances of the County, is necessary to an understanding of the parties\u2019 arguments in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">\n<em>Pre-2002 Charter Amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\"><em>Mugford </em>involved an agreement between a Teamsters\u2019 local union and the Department of Public Works of Baltimore City, purportedly acting on behalf of the City. In a taxpayers\u2019 action challenging the agreement, the trial court held it to be void, and no appeal was taken from that ruling. The trial court, however, concluded that the Central Payroll Bureau could collect union dues by payroll deduction from any employee who voluntarily agreed. This Court agreed, but it also observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-10\">\u201cThe City has no right under the law to delegate its governing power to any agency. The power of the City is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>prescribed in its charter, and the City Charter constitutes the measure of power that is possessed by any of its officials. To delegate such power to an independent agency would be a serious violation of the law. To recognize such delegation of power in any City department might lead to the delegation of such power in all departments, and would result in the City government being administered regardless of its charter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 271, 44 A.2d at 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The first case to reach this Court questioning binding arbitration between a local government and its employees was <em>Maryland Classified Employees Ass\u2019n. v. Anderson, </em>281 Md. 496, 380 A.2d 1032 (1977). Harford County had, by <em>ordinance, </em>provided for binding arbitration, pursuant to which an award was made in May 1975. Harford County did not fully implement the award, and certain employees sued to enforce it. This Court decided \u201cthat compensation of employees of a charter county may not be committed to binding arbitration unless so authorized by a public general law of Maryland or the organic law of that county.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497, 380 A.2d at 1032. Applying the rationale of <em>Mugford, </em>we said that the Harford County \u201cordinance in question plainly attempted to bind the County in the exercise of legislative discretion over compensation of its public employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511, 380 A.2d at 1040. This could not be done \u201cwithout being authorized to do so by public general law or by the County Charter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513, 380 A.2d at 1041.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>In <em>Griffith v. Wakefield, </em>298 Md. 381, 470 A.2d 345 (1984), firefighters employed by Baltimore County, inspired by <em>Anderson, </em>initiated, by voter petition, an amendment to the Baltimore County Charter that spelled out a system of binding arbitration. Taxpayers challenged the Charter amendment in an action that was decided after the voters had adopted the amendment. The challenge asserted that the amendment violated Maryland Constitution, Article XI-A, \u00a7 3, under the principles articulated in <em>Cheeks v. Cedlair Corp., </em>287 Md. 595, 415 A.2d 255, to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">In <em>Cheeks, </em>proponents of rent control for Baltimore City residential properties had initiated, by voter petition, an amendment to the City Charter that created a complete program for adopting and enforcing rent controls. The Charter amendment, as reproduced in Appendix A to the opinion in <em>Cheeks, </em>covers seventeen pages. <em>Id., </em>415 A.2d at 265-73. Article XI-A, \u00a7 3, however, provides that \u201cevery charter [formed under that article] shall provide for an elective legislative body in which shall be vested the law-making power of said City or County.\u201d Upon the adoption of a charter by a county, its County Council, \u201csubject to the Constitution and Public General Laws of this State, shall have full power to enact local laws.\u201d <em>Cheeks </em>held that \u00a7 3, and other sections of Article XI-A, required that the proposed amendment be \u201c \u2018charter material.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608, 415 A.2d at 262. This Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-5\">\u201c[A] charter amendment within the context of Art. XI-A is necessarily limited in substance to amending the form or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>structure of government initially established by adoption of the charter. A charter amendment, therefore, differs in its fundamental character from a simple legislative enactment. Its content cannot transcend its limited office and be made to serve or function as a vehicle through which to adopt local legislation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-4\">\u201cThe charter amendment proposed in this case was intended, not simply to create a new City agency with authority over matters pertaining to landlords and tenants, but rather to establish a comprehensive system for regulating rents within the City\u2019s residential housing market----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">\u201cWe think it clear that the amendment is essentially legislative in character. Considered as a whole, the amendment is not addressed to the form or structure of government in any fundamental sense and is not, therefore, \u2018charter material,\u2019 as the lower court so succinctly stated. Unless \u00a7\u00a7 1, 5 or 6 of Art. XI-A, either explicitly or implicitly, otherwise permit the voters to \u2018legislate\u2019 by charter amendment, notwithstanding \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of Art. XI-A, and to thereby directly exercise the City\u2019s police or general welfare powers, the amendment is invalid for insufficiency of subject matter in the sense that it is not a charter amendment within the contemplation of \u00a7 5.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM7\"><em>Id. </em>at 607-08, 415 A.2d at 261-62 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Returning to <em>Griffith v. Wakefield, </em>298 Md. 381, 470 A.2d 345, the Baltimore County firefighters case, this Court applied <em>Cheeks </em>to invalidate the binding arbitration amendment to the Baltimore County Charter. The parties to the case now before us find support in different portions of the opinion in <em>Griffith. </em>The Petitioners refer us to the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-m\">\u201cThe Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cheeks </em>is dispositive of the issue presented in the case at bar. Like the charter amendment in <em>Cheeks, </em>the proposed charter amendment in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>case prescribes \u2018in lengthy detail\u2019 [footnote omitted] an entire system of binding arbitration for a select group of county employees; it leaves nothing for the determination of the County Executive or the County Council.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 386, 470 A.2d at 348. The <em>Griffith </em>opinion then presented a two-page synopsis of the detail of the Baltimore County binding arbitration amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Anne Arundel County, on the other hand, emphasizes the passage set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">\u201cIf the proposed Baltimore County charter amendment had merely <em>authorized </em>the Baltimore County Council to enact a system of binding arbitration with regard to the compensation of Baltimore County employees, and if, pursuant to that authorization, the Baltimore County Council had exercised its discretion to enact <em>an ordinance </em>containing provisions similar to those in the proposed charter amendment now before us, the present case would be distinguishable from <em>Cheeks. </em>Under those circumstances, we would be required to decide the question which was \u2018assume[d]\u2019 but not decided in Anderson.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] In the present case, however, the proposed charter amendment did not authorize the County Council to enact binding arbitration legislation for county employees. It did not authorize any decisions by the constitutional legislative body. Instead, under the proposal, the charter itself would contain all of the law on the subject, and the Baltimore County Council would be deprived of all decision-making authority concerning the subject. Nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>in the <em>Anderson </em>case supports the validity, under Art. XIA, of such a charter provision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 389-90, 470 A.2d at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Also bearing mention are two additional decisions of this Court that preceded the adoption in 2002 of the Anne Arundel County Charter amendment that is at issue here. <em>Anne Arundel County v. Fraternal Order of Anne Arundel County Det. Officers &amp; Pers., </em>313 Md. 98, 543 A.2d 841 (1988) (\u201cthe Correctional Officers Case\u201d), involved a County ordinance providing for arbitration of certain issues arising out of collective bargaining. The County had established a new position, carrying the rank of lieutenant, for the Detention Center, but the County and the collective bargaining representatives were unable to agree whether the position was management or part of the bargaining unit. When the County refused to arbitrate the issue, the bargaining representatives sought to compel arbitration. That case held that \u201cthe determination of whether positions should be included in or excluded from the representation unit is not so determinative of employee compensation as to be an inappropriate subject for arbitration in the absence of authority granted by the Charter or General Assembly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116, 543 A.2d at 850. In discussing the issue, this Court held that the ordinance was sufficient authorization for the County to enter collective bargaining agreements and engage in arbitration, and that a charter provision or public general law was not needed. <em>Id. </em>at 113-14, 543 A.2d at 849. On the other hand, \u201cauthorization by public general law or charter provision consistent with Art. XI-A of the Maryland Constitution\u201d is required for a charter county to \u201cdelegate to an arbitrator a discretionary governmental power or function which the charter vests in the county executive and county council.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111, 543 A.2d at 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\"><em>Freeman v. Local 1802, Am. Fed\u2019n of State, County &amp; Mun. Employees Council 67, </em>318 Md. 684, 569 A.2d 1244 (1990), was a mandamus action against the County Executive of Harford County seeking to compel him to sign a collective bargaining agreement that had been negotiated pursuant to a Harford County ordinance. The Executive contended that a charter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>provision or public general law was required for Harford County to bargain collectively. We held that that contention was incorrect. <em>Id. </em>at 691, 569 A.2d at 1247. With respect to the issue now before us, we pointed out that the Correctional Officers Case had \u201creaffirmed the holdings in our prior cases that, absent authorization from the county charter or State public general law, the local ordinance could not validly provide for the delegation to others \u2018of certain duties involving the exercise of discretion specifically assigned by a county charter to the county executive and council.\u2019 313 Md. at 115, 543 A.2d at 850.\u201d <em>Id., </em>569 A.2d at 1247. The decision in <em>Freeman, </em>applying the law of mandamus, ultimately concluded that mandamus would not lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">\n<em>The 2002 Charter Amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">In 1988, \u00a7 811 was added to the Anne Arundel County Charter to provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\">\u201c[e]mployees in the classified service shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively through representative employee organizations of their own choosing as provided by ordinance of the County Council.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The Anne Arundel County Charter, in \u00a7 1203, also provides for the appointment by the County Council of a Charter Revision Commission after the publication of each decennial census. In its report of May 20, 2002, the 2000 census Charter Revision Commission (CRC) recommended that a new provision be added to Art. VIII in the Charter. The report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-8\">\u201cAuthorize binding arbitration for police, fire and other public safety contracts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-9\"><em>\u201cReasons: </em>The CRC feels that binding arbitration should be provided to public safety employees as a matter of fairness. This process provides for a skilled, neutral, and mutually agreed upon arbitrator, whose final decision will be based upon financial condition of the County, and the reasonable interest[s] of the affected employees, and all other relevant factors (Vote was 3 for, 2 against).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number><em>\u201cDissent: </em>Newton Gentry and Michael Gilligan believe that binding arbitration will leave a County financial decision in the hands of outside party, causing possible constraints on needed County services because of the existing tax cap.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">The County Council agreed with the CRC majority. At the Council meeting of August 5, 2002, the agenda included two resolutions proposing Charter amendments. Resolution No. 44-02 was described in the Minutes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-5\">\u201cCharter Amendment \u2014 Binding Arbitration for Law Enforcement Employees \u2014 Resolution proposing an amendment to the Charter of Anne Arundel County to provide that the County Council shall be required to adopt an ordinance providing for binding arbitration of disputes between the County and the Uniformed Officers of the Police Department, Sheriffs Department, and Office of Detention Facilities!;.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">One council member stated that it was \u201cimportant for our Law Enforcement Employees to be granted the opportunity for binding arbitration.\u201d Another council member stated that \u201cbinding arbitration is a fair way to resolve the differences that may occur during labor negotiations.\u201d The seven members of the Council unanimously adopted Resolution 44-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">A companion Resolution, 45-02, providing for a Charter amendment for \u201cBinding Arbitration for Uniformed Firefighters,\u201d was also unanimously adopted, with two members having recused themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">As proposed by Resolution 44-02, the voters adopted the 2002 Charter Amendment that is set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-9\">\u201cSec. 812. Binding arbitration for law enforcement employees and for uniformed firefighters of the Fire Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-10\">\u201c(a) In addition to the right granted to County employees in Section 811 of this Article to organize and bargain collectively, the County Council <em>shall provide </em>by ordinance <em>for binding arbitration </em>with authorized representatives of the appropriate employee bargaining unit in order to resolve labor disputes with the County\u2019s law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>employees. The ordinance shall provide for the appointment of a neutral arbitrator by the parties to the arbitration <em>who shall issue a binding decision to be implemented as part of the following year\u2019s budget process </em>and which shall take into account the financial condition of the County and the reasonable interests of the law enforcement employees and the county relating to the terms and conditions of employment. Law enforcement employees shall be uniformed officers of the Police Department, Sheriffs Department, and Office of Detention Facilities. Any ordinance that is enacted shall prohibit strikes or work stoppage by the law enforcement employees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">(Emphasis added). Charter \u00a7 812(b) makes the same provision for uniformed firefighters.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">To implement Charter \u00a7 812, the County Council adopted Bill 1-03, which became \u00a7 6-4-111 of the Anne Arundel County Code (2004) consisting of subsections (a) through (r). Under Bill 1-03, if an impasse exists on March 15 of any fiscal year, the parties may agree to a non-binding, confidential mediation but must commence arranging for binding arbitration as well. Provision is made for selecting an arbitrator and an alternative arbitrator. The powers and duties of the neutral arbitrator are set forth, time limits are established, and a \u201cbaseball\u201d type of award is to be rendered. Subsection (m) provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">\u201cThe final written award issued by the neutral arbitrator ... and the memorandum of agreed issues shall be final and binding upon the County and the Uniformed Public Safety Exclusive Representative and shall be implemented as part of the budget process for the appropriate fiscal years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Either party may move to vacate the award by an action in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>\n<em>The 2011 Ordinance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">On February 1, 2010, the Court of Special Appeals decided <em>Wicomico County Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 111 v. Wicomico County, </em>190 Md.App. 291, 988 A.2d 555 (2010). By a voter initiative, pursuant to Maryland Constitution, Article XI-A, \u00a7 5, the voters had amended the Wicomico County Charter at the November 2006 election to provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaS\">\u201c\u2018The Wicomico County Council shall provide by law for collective bargaining with binding arbitration with an authorized representative of the Wicomico County Sheriffs Office deputies. Any law so enacted shall prohibit strikes or work stoppage by deputies. The County Council shall provide by law a labor code for sworn employees of the Wicomico County Sheriffs Office to effectuate this charter provision. This section shall supercede any conflicting provisions of the Wicomico County Charter or other Wicomico County provisions.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 295, 988 A.2d at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Thereafter, the Wicomico County Council passed an ordinance which provided that the Executive was bound by an arbitrator\u2019s award, but that the County Council was not. <em>Id. </em>at 296, 988 A.2d at 557. Aggrieved employees sought a judgment declaring that the Charter amendment was binding on Wicomico County and that the ordinance did not comply with the Charter. Wicomico County counterclaimed for a declaration that the Charter amendment was unconstitutional. The circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals agreed with Wicomico County. The intermediate appellate court concluded that the amendment did not change the form and structure of government. \u201c[Rjather, it required the Council to legislate on the subject of personnel matters affecting a certain group. The Amendment imposed a binding system of arbitration applicable to one group of County employees and was legislative in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302, 988 A.2d at 561. The court also considered that \u201c[i]f the Charter Amendment had merely authorized the Wicomico County Council to enact a system of binding arbitration, and the County Council exercised its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>discretion to enact a law pursuant to that authorization, the Council would not have been deprived of all decision-making authority,\u201d citing <em>Save Our Streets v. Mitchell, </em>357 Md. 237, 254, 743 A.2d 748[, 758] (2000). \u201cThe Charter Amendment, however, mandated that the Council enact legislation, with or without County Executive approval.\u201d 190 Md.App. at 302-03, 988 A.2d at 561. There was no application for certiorari from this Court of Special Appeals decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">The infighting next moved to the General Assembly. Senate Bill 1123 of the 2010 session, as introduced, would have provided that a county or municipal corporation may adopt a local law or ordinance that allows for binding arbitration. The bill was amended in the course of passage to result in an uncodified, retroactive, emergency, public general law, enacted as Chapter 651 of the Acts of 2010. Section 1 of Chapter 651 in relevant part provides that \u201ca county or municipal corporation that has adopted a local law or ordinance that allows for binding arbitration ... is retroactively authorized to adopt a local law or ordinance that allows for binding arbitration____\u201d Section 2 of Chapter 651 directs that it be construed to apply \u201conly retroactively and may not be applied or interpreted to have any effect on or application to any local law or ordinance that allows for binding arbitration enacted after the effective date of this Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">The 2011 ordinance that is the object of the Petitioners\u2019 complaint in the instant matter was enacted by Council Bill <em>Aril. </em>It amended, <em>inter alia, </em>Anne Arundel County Code, \u00a7 6-4-111, subsection (m) to provide in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">\u201cExcept for those provisions that require an appropriation of funds or the enactment of legislation to implement, the final written award issued by the neutral arbitrator ... and the memorandum of agreed issues shall be final and- binding upon the County and the Uniformed Public Safety Exclusive Representative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">Other features of Council Bill 4-11 to which Petitioners object are subsections (u) and (v).

Does \u00a7 812 of the County Charter apply to the County Council, so as to void provisions in Sec. 2 of Bill 4-11?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">II.

If the answer to I is \u201cyes,\u201d and the answer to II is \u201cno,\u201d is Sec. 3 of Council Bill No. 4-11 invalid for violating \u00a7 812 of the County Charter?<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">There are no facts in dispute in this case. The standard of review is whether the declaratory judgment was correct as a matter of law. <em>See Catalyst Health Solutions, Inc. v. Magill, </em>414 Md. 457, 471-72, 995 A.2d 960, 968 (2010). As applied to Council Bill 4-11, the County submits that we must determine whether the County Council, in enacting Bill 4-11, was acting within the \u201clegal boundary\u201d of Charter \u00a7 812. However phrased, the legal issue is the proper construction of Charter \u00a7 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The parties disagree on the effect of Charter \u00a7 812 on the respective roles of the County Executive and County Council in the budget process. Under Charter \u00a7 706, the County Executive is required to submit to the County Council, not later than seventy-five days prior to the end of the fiscal year, the proposed County budget for the ensuing fiscal year. Section 706(a) provides in relevant part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-8\">\u201c[t]he proposed current expense budget shall contain ... (4) an estimate of the several amounts which the County Executive deems necessary for conducting the business of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>County to be financed from and not to exceed estimated revenues for the ensuing fiscal year[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Under Charter \u00a7 709, \u201cthe County Council may decrease or delete any items in the budget,\u201d with certain exceptions not relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Petitioners submit that the County Executive must include in the budget, and the County Council must approve, appropriations necessary to comply with a binding arbitration award. With respect to the County Executive, Bill 4-11 provides that, if a final award is based on the final offer of the employees\u2019 representative, and if the County Council so requests, the County Executive is to submit to the County Council recommendations for amending the budget in order to fund that final written award. Code \u00a7 6-4-111(s)(4) (2011). Under Bill 4-11, the County Council may or may not choose to fund the final award.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The County contends that Bill 4-11 simply construed Charter \u00a7 812 to retain the Council\u2019s power to reduce or delete appropriations and that that construction is necessary to avoid rendering Charter \u00a7 812 unconstitutional. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Charter \u00a7 812 requires the County Council to \u201cprovide by ordinance for binding arbitration,\u201d and to provide for \u201cthe appointment of a neutral arbitrator ... who shall issue a binding decision to be implemented as part of the following year\u2019s budget process[.]\u201d In the context of municipal government employee labor relations, the terms quoted from Charter \u00a7 812 have a plain meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">The Harford County ordinance involved in <em>Anderson </em>spelled out a final step in dispute resolution, in relevant part, reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_3\">\u2018\u201cIn the event that a dispute remains unresolved after thirty (30) days of mediation, the County Executive shall submit the dispute to <em>binding </em>arbitration.... <em>The decision of the arbitration board shall be binding on both parties. </em>(Emphasis added).\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-9\"><em>Anderson, </em>281 Md. at 507-08, 380 A.2d at 1038. Referring to this language, we said that \u201c[t]he County ordinance in question plainly attempted to bind the County in the exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>legislative discretion over compensation of its public employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511, 380 A.2d at 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">The Anne Arundel County Charter provision before us is even more clear than that in the <em>Anderson </em>case. As demonstrated above, the County Council is an integral part of the budget process, and \u00a7 812 requires that the neutral arbitrator\u2019s \u201cbinding decision be implemented as part of the following year\u2019s budget process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In addition to relying on Charter \u00a7 709, the County points to Charter \u00a7 801 that provides, in relevant part, for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuCO\">\u201ca classification and pay plan, enacted by ordinance, for all positions in the classified service. The classification plan shall include minimum qualifications for each class of position and the pay plan shall allocate such class of positions to a salary range.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The County says that charter provisions like \u00a7\u00a7 709 and 801 cannot be amended by implication. But, \u201cif two statutes contain an irreconcilable conflict, the statute whose relevant substantive provisions were enacted most recently may impliedly repeal any conflicting provision of the earlier statute.\u201d <em>State v. Harris, </em>327 Md. 32, 39, 607 A.2d 552, 555 (1992). The County Council is part of the government of Anne Arundel County, Maryland. An award in arbitration cannot be binding and not binding on the County at the same time and in the same respect. There is an irreconcilable conflict between the plain language of Charter \u00a7 812 and provisions in Sec. 2 of Bill No. 4-11 under which the County Council asserts a power to modify or abrogate a binding award.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">In <em>State v. Ghajari, </em>346 Md. 101, 695 A.2d 143 (1997), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-8\">\u201c \u2018It is well settled that when two statutes, one general and one specific, are found to conflict, the specific statute will be regarded as an exception to the general statute.\u2019 <em>Farmers &amp; Merchants [Nat'l.] Bank [v. Schlossberg], </em>306 [Md. 48,] 63, 507 A.2d [172,] 178 [ (1986) ] (holding general enactment impliedly repealed by specific enactment). In such a sit\u00faa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>tion, the specific statute is controlling and the general statute is repealed to the extent of the inconsistency. <em>See [Criminal Injuries Comp. Board v.] Gould, </em>273 Md. [486,] 495, 331 A.2d [55,] 61 [ (1975) ]. Thus, when reconciling a specific and a general statute, a court should give effect to the specific statute in its entirety and should retain as much of the general statute as is reasonably possible. <em>See </em>1A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7\u00a7 23.06, 23.09, 23.16 (5th ed. 1993)\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 116, 695 A.2d at 150. Thus, if an impasse in bargaining with County employees covered by Charter \u00a7 812 were to result in binding arbitration, and the neutral arbitrator chose the employees\u2019 final offer, and \u00a7 812 were still in effect, the final award would be binding on the County, which includes the County Council.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The County directs our attention to County Code, Article 6, \u201cPersonnel,\u201d Title 4, \u201cEmployee Relations,\u201d where \u00a7 6-4-101(1) defines \u201cAdministration\u201d to mean \u201cthe County Executive and officers and agents under the County Executive\u2019s supervision.\u201d The County represents that collective bargaining negotiations are conducted between the employee representatives and the Administration. From this, the County concludes that Charter \u00a7 812 binds only the Administration. This argument ignores the requirement in \u00a7 812 that the neutral arbitrator\u2019s binding decision \u201cbe implemented as part of the following year\u2019s budget process.\u201d The argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>violates the rule of construction that, ordinarily, no words are to be omitted, and effect is to be given to all words in the statute or charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">We are referred by the County to the Baltimore County Charter and Code. There, \u00a7 801 of the Charter provides that \u201c[t]he county council is further authorized to, and shall by law, provide for a system of binding arbitration by a neutral arbitrator to resolve disputes\u201d arising out of collective bargaining with certain public safety employees. The Baltimore County Code, \u00a7 4-5-505, \u201cBINDING ARBITRATION,\u201d subsection (i) provides that \u201c[t]he County Council is not bound by any decision made under this section and may act upon the submitted legislation to implement the memorandum of understanding under this section in accordance with the provision of the Charter.\u201d The Baltimore County Charter, of course, is not before us, and we need not construe \u201ca system of binding arbitration\u201d as the quoted terms appear in the Baltimore County Charter \u00a7 801. It is sufficient to note for present purposes that the Baltimore County Charter does not require the \u201cbinding decision to be implemented as part of the following year\u2019s budget process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Article XI-A</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">In addressing this issue, we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that a charter amendment recommended by a Charter Revision Commission and proposed by the legislative body is subject to the requirement that the amendment be charter material to the same extent as if the amendment had been initiated by a petition of the voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\"> We consider it to be settled that binding arbitration is an appropriate subject matter for inclusion in a county charter. That is the teaching of <em>Anderson, </em>281 Md. 496, 380 A.2d 1032, the Correctional Officers Case, 313 Md. at 111, 543 A.2d at 847-48, and <em>Freeman, </em>318 Md. at 691, 569 A.2d at 1247. The whole point in placing Charter \u00a7 812 before the voters was to obtain authorization for including provision for binding arbitration in the County\u2019s \u201cconstitution.\u201d Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>\u00a7 812 does not run afoul of Constitution, Article XI-A, by including what amounts to an entire statute in the Charter and, thus, \u00a7 812 avoids the defect in the Baltimore City Rent Control Charter initiative struck down in <em>Cheeks, </em>287 Md. 595, 415 A.2d 255, and in the Baltimore County Firefighters Charter initiative struck down in <em>Griffith, </em>298 Md. 381, 470 A.2d 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The County submits, however, that the law on \u201ccharter material\u201d has been clarified by <em>Save Our Streets v. Mitchell, </em>357 Md. 237, 743 A.2d 748 (2000), involving two cases decided in one opinion. One case, <em>Mitchell, </em>involved a voter initiative for an amendment to the Montgomery County Charter that would prospectively prohibit speed bumps and allow the County one year within which to remove previously installed speed bumps. Holding that the proposed amendment violated Maryland Constitution, Article XI-A, the circuit court prohibited placing the measure on the ballot, and this Court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">In the other case, <em>Hiter, </em>decided at the same time, voters in Harford County petitioned for a referendum on a charter amendment estabhshing standards for \u201cadequate public facilities.\u201d The amendment provided for a one-year moratorium on building and grading permits and on approval of subdivision and site plans, following which, any development that did not meet the standards set forth in the charter amendment, unless exempted, would be prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">In analyzing these initiatives, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-8\">\u201c[T]he length and detail of a proposed charter amendment are not dispositive as to whether the proposed amendment constitutes legislation or proper charter material. An important consideration is the degree to which the county council retains discretion and control regarding an area under its authority pursuant to Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 253, 743 A.2d at 757. The amendments in the two cases \u201cwould as completely remove any meaningful exercise of discretion from the County Council as would have the amendments in <em>Cheeks </em>and Griffith.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>In <em>Save Our Streets, </em>this Court quoted from <em>Griffith, </em>298 Md. at 389-90, 470 A.2d at 350, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-4\">\u201c \u2018If the proposed Baltimore County Charter amendment had merely <em>authorized </em>the Baltimore County Council to enact a system of binding arbitration ... and if, pursuant to that authorization, the Baltimore County Council had exercised its discretion to enact <em>an ordinance </em>containing provisions similar to those in the proposed Charter amendment ..., the present case would be distinguishable from <em>Cheeks </em>.... In the present case, however, the proposed Charter amendment did not authorize the County Council to enact binding arbitration legislation for County employees. It did not authorize any decisions by the constitutional legislative body. Instead, under the proposal, the Charter itself would contain all of the law on the subject, and the Baltimore County Council would be deprived of all decision-making authority concerning the subject!.]\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-5\"><em>Save Our Streets, </em>357 Md. at 254, 743 A.2d at 757-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The quoted language from <em>Griffith </em>employs a technique used in writing judicial opinions when the operative standard is a question of degree, in this case, the extent to which discretion of the legislative body is precluded by the proposed Charter amendment. <em>Griffith </em>illustrated a proper recognition of the Council\u2019s constitutional law-making power, Const., Art. XI-A, \u00a7 3, by hypothesizing a Charter amendment providing that the Council may adopt binding arbitration and leaving to the Council the policy question of whether, and if so, how, binding arbitration should operate. On the other hand, the proposed Charter amendment that was before the Court in <em>Griffith </em>did not authorize binding arbitration because it did not authorize any decisions by the legislative body. Rather, the Charter amendment contained all of the law on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The question presented in the case before us falls somewhere between the two <em>Griffith </em>examples. The County Charter directs the County Council to adopt a binding arbitration ordinance that would be implemented in the budget process. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>The Charter leaves fleshing out of the directive to the County Council. Authorization for binding arbitration can only be achieved by a public general law or by a Charter provision. Whether some portion of the County Council\u2019s role in the budget process is to be transferred to a neutral arbitrator, in the event of an impasse in collective bargaining with public safety employees, affects the form and structure of government. To say that the voters of a county, exercising their power to amend the Charter, cannot direct that their policy decision be implemented by the County Council would be to hold that only the County Council ultimately can decide whether binding arbitration is County policy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That is contrary to the holdings in <em>Anderson, </em>the Correctional Officers Case, and <em>Freeman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The voters\u2019 directive in County Charter \u00a7 812, for the Council to implement, in some fashion, binding arbitration in the budget process, does not implicate, on analysis, the lawmaking power of the Council under Const., Art. XI-A, \u00a7 3. (\u201cEvery charter ... shall provide for an elective legislative body in which shall be vested the law-making power of said ... County.\u201d). The power of the County Council, under the County Charter, to reduce or delete appropriations in the Executive\u2019s budget, is impliedly derived from Const., Art. XIA, \u00a7 1, setting forth the process for preparing and adopting a Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\"><em>Annapolis v. Anne Arundel County, </em>347 Md. 1, 698 A.2d 523 (1997), explains the distinction. Chapter 1041 of the Acts of 1945 had directed the County to pay to Annapolis one-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>seventh of the amount remitted by the State to the County from any new sources of revenue. In 1958, a new tax on cigarettes was imposed. The County adopted its Charter in 1964. Eventually payments by the County to Annapolis ceased. In the resulting litigation, this Court held that the adoption of a Charter had impliedly repealed Chapter 1041, a public local law.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Chapter 1041 was a law dealing with appropriations. Article XI-A, \u00a7 3 authorizes a Council to repeal local laws on matters covered by the Express Powers Act, Maryland Code (1957, 2011 Repl.Vol.), Article 25A, \u00a7 5, but the express powers do not include appropriations. Nevertheless, \u201c \u00a7 1 of Article XI-A authorizes charter provisions concerning the organization and structure of the county government including the method or system for making governmental decisions.\u201d <em>Annapolis, </em>347 Md. at 15, 698 A.2d at 529 (citing <em>Ritchmount Partnership v. Board of Supervisors of Elections for Anne Arundel County, </em>283 Md. 48, 388 A.2d 523 (1978) (holding that Art. XI-A authorized the County\u2019s Charter to provide for a referendum on Council ordinances)).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Pertinent to the question of decision-making on matters of appropriations, this Court in <em>Annapolis </em>further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">\u201cThis Court has taken the position that the method or system for budgeting and appropriating revenues set forth in a county\u2019s charter, including the executive budget system in effect in several counties, constitutes proper charter material under Article XI-A, \u00a7 1. The budgetary and appropriation system \u2018is a fundamental aspect of the form and structure of a home rule county\u2019s government. <em>Board [of Supervisors of Elections of Anne Arundel </em>County] <em>v. Smallwood, </em>327 Md. 220, 241, 608 A.2d 1222, 1232 (1992).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 15, 698 A.2d at 530.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">Once the voters, acting under Const. Art. XI-A, \u00a7 1, made the policy decision, Charter \u00a7 812 left all of the detail of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>implementation to the Council for the exercise of its Art. XIA, \u00a7 3 law-making power in Bill 1-03. It covered possible mediation, each step in the selection of the neutral arbitrator, timing, the powers of the arbitrator, receipt of final offers of each party, ten factors to be considered by the arbitrator after receiving evidence, the final, binding award, possible revision thereof by agreement, post-hearing motion or court action, and implementation of the award as part of the budget process. We hold that Charter \u00a7 812 did not unconstitutionally preclude the exercise of the County Council\u2019s law-making discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Because <em>Wicomico County Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 111 v. Wicomico County, </em>190 Md.App. 291, 988 A.2d 555 (2010), is substantially at odds with the views expressed herein, that opinion is disapproved.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Section 3 of Bill 4-11</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">Section 3 of Bill 4-11, in substance, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-5\">\u2022 Neither Sec. 2 of Bill 4-11 nor Code \u00a7 6-4-111 is severable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">\u2022 If any provision of Sec. 2 is invalid:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-7\">\u2022 No provision of \u00a7 6-4-111 may be given effect;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-8\">\u2022 Section 6-4-111 \u201cshall be deemed repealed by operation of law\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-9\">\u2022 The impasse procedure will be governed by Code \u00a7 6-4-110.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">Inasmuch as we have held that Charter \u00a7 812 is valid and that Sec. 2 of Bill 4-11, at least in part, is invalid, the County asks that this case be remanded to the circuit court so that the declaratory judgment may be modified to state \u201cthat \u00a7 6-4-111 of the County Code as enacted by Bill No. 1-03 and amended by Bill No. 88-10 shall be deemed repealed in its entirety as provided in \u00a7 3 of Bill No. 4-11.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thereby, the impasse resolution procedure ultimately would consist of submitting a fact finder\u2019s recommendation to the County Council which could \u201ctake the action it determines to be in the public interest.\u201d Code \u00a7 6-4-110(g). Petitioners contend that Sec. 3 of Bill 4-11 violates the mandate of Charter \u00a7 812 under which \u201cthe County Council shall provide by ordinance for binding arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">Section 3 of Bill 4-11 does more than invert the ordinary presumption that legislation is intended to be severable in the event of partial invalidity. Total invalidity of Sec. 2 of Bill 4-11, as per the nonseverability provision, ordinarily would result in the reinstatement of \u00a7 6-4-111, as enacted by Bill 1-03 and amended by Bill 88-10. <em>See Howard County Metropolitan Commission v.

Section 1013 of the Prince George\u2019s County Charter, adopted in 1970, \u201cprovided that the County waived its governmental immunity and could be sued in tort in the same manner and to the same extent as any private person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419, 564 A.2d at 97. <em>Bradshaw v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>284 Md. 294, 301, 396 A.2d 255, 260 (1979), so held, but excluded from the waiver of immunity cases in which the county\u2019s agent enjoyed public official immunity. By Chapter 825 of the Acts of 1976, the General Assembly enacted Maryland Code (1957, 1981 Repl.Vol.), Art. 25A, \u00a7 5(CC), conferring on charter counties the power, in relevant part, to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">\u201cprovide by ordinance or inclusion in the county charter for the waiver of sovereign immunity so that the county may be sued in tort actions in the same manner and to the same extent that any private person may be sued.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number><em>James v.

App. at 420, 564 A.2d at 98. The 1982 version of Prince George\u2019s County Charter \u00a7 1013 was before this Court in <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Fitzhugh, </em>308 Md. 384, 519 A.2d 1285 (1987). We held that under \u00a7 5(CC) of the Express Powers Act, \u201c[i]f a county elects to waive immunity, it must do so fully and without limitation on the scope of that immunity, although it may to some degree limit the extent of its liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393, 519 A.2d at 1289-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">We then addressed the severability issue and recognized the ordinary rule reinstating the prior provision in the event of invalidity of the later provision. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\">\u201cIf the offending provision is severed, the remainder of \u00a7 1013 constitutes a full waiver of governmental immunity. The section would read as it did in 1976, and in <em>James [v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>288 Md. 315, 418 A.2d 1173 (1980)] we held it had that effect. If the language added in 1982 is not severed, \u00a7 1013 is invalid in its entirety, because of its violation of the Express Powers Act. The total invalidity of the 1982 version of \u00a7 1013 means that this case is governed by the section as it was adopted in 1976.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 395, 519 A.2d at 1290.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">While <em>Fitzhugh </em>was pending, Prince George\u2019s County, in 1986, again amended Charter \u00a7 1013, limiting its waiver to cases in which its officers, agents or employees did not enjoy public official immunity. The provision was clearly invalid under <em>Fitzhugh. </em>The 1986 amendment, however, also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-9\">\u201c \u2018The sentences, clauses or phrases of this section shall not be severable. If any such sentence, clause or phrase of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>section is declared unconstitutional or invalid for any reason, then it is intended and declared by the people of the County that the entire section be declared invalid.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><em>Surratt, </em>80 Md.App. at 421, 564 A.2d at 98 (emphasis removed from original).

The same conclusion was reached by Judge Young in two cases in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. <em>See Walker v.

Prince George\u2019s County, </em>320 Md. 439, 578 A.2d 745 (1990), this Court reversed the Court of Special Appeals on the ground that the wording of the ballot question did not convey with reasonable clarity the scope and effect of the 1986 Charter amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 450-51, 578 A.2d at 751.

This grant of power does not require a county to waive governmental immunity. A charter county is free to exercise the power to waive immunity or not as it sees fit. There is nothing mandatory about this. It is only when a county chooses to waive immunity under \u00a7 5(CC) that the \u2018all or nothing\u2019 requirement of the subsection comes into play.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-8\"><em>Fitzhugh, </em>308 Md. at 394, 519 A.2d at 1290.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">The provisions of Anne Arundel County ordinances dealing with binding arbitration are controlled by County Charter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>\u00a7 812. Unlike the Express Powers Act and the Prince George\u2019s County Charter dealing with the waiver of sovereign immunity, the Anne Arundel County Charter, \u00a7 812, mandates that there be an ordinance adopting binding arbitration, implemented as part of the budget process, for the resolution of impasses in collective bargaining with public safety employees. The voters of Anne Arundel County determined in Charter \u00a7 812 that the County Council would not have discretion to reject the effect of binding arbitration. The total repeal of Code \u00a7 6-4-111 that is attempted by Sec. 3 of Bill 4-11 violates Charter \u00a7 812 and is of no effect.

But in the particular circumstances here, where the duties involved, ordinarily discretionary, are ministerial because of the binding arbitration provision, we are inclined to permit the challenge. It is manifest that the validity of a binding arbitration provision of a collective bargaining law which concerns compensation of public employees is a matter of substantial public importance. Absent public general law in the field, it is likely to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>question which will frequently arise in the relationship between public employee and government employer. The implementation of such a binding arbitration award may require an increase in taxes or give rise to fiscal and budgetary problems affecting third parties. Moreover, it appears that the structure of bureaucratic authority will not be seriously disrupted in this instance by permitting the challenge. These considerations, we believe, outweigh contrary interests.

The County\u2019s argument, that Charter \u00a7 812 does not repeal by implication, based on inconsistency, other sections of the Charter, is an argument that itself is inconsistent. One of the provisions of Council Bill 4-11 is Code \u00a7 6-4-111(t). It provides that if the County Council decides to fund a final written award that is based on the final offer of the employees' representative, the County Council may fund that award without an amendment to the budget proposed by the County Executive. The County argues that this provision is authorized by Charter \u00a7 812, interpreted to make a final award binding only on the County Executive, but not binding on the County Council. Under the County\u2019s analysis, Charter \u00a7 812 repeals by implication part of Charter \u00a7 709 providing that the \"County Council shall have no power to ... increase any expenditure recommended by the County Executive for current ... purposes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b776-7\">.

Specifically, Article XI-A of our Constitution states, with respect to local law-making power, that, \u201c[e'lvery charter so formed shall provide for an elected legislative body in which shall be vested the law-making power of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>said City or County.\u201d Maryland Constitution Article XI-A, Section 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Section 812 of the Anne Arundel County Charter purports to direct the Anne Arundel County Council to implement, by ordinance, a system of binding arbitration for labor disputes with law enforcement personnel and firefighters. The Section, in pertinent part, requires the County Council to include in the yearly budget any award that has been made by the arbitrator, without any discretion in the County Council to modify the award in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">In so doing, Section 812 violates the Maryland Constitution by delegating the power to appropriate County revenue, an essential aspect of local law-making power,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to a private actor. In going in the opposite direction, the majority erroneously asserts that Section 812 is constitutional because the County Council retains some measure of discretion and control over spending the County\u2019s money in that it has the power to enact ordinances that control the logistics of the arbitration process. The standard used, and its application by the majority are in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>The appropriate test to determine whether a limitation on the County Council\u2019s power is permissible is, \u201cthe degree to which the county council retains discretion and control regarding an area under its authority pursuant to Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution,\u201d as articulated by Judge John C. Eldridge in <em>Save Our Streets v. Mitchell, </em>357 Md. 237, 253, 743 A.2d 748, 757 (2000). The majority states that Section 812 does not violate our State Constitution because, \u201c[ojnce the voters, acting under Const. Art. XI-A, [Section] 1, made the policy decision, Charter [Section] 812 left all of the detail of the implementation to the Council for the exercise of its Art. XI-A, [Section] 3 law-making power in Bill 1-03.\u201d Maj. Op. at 749-50, 53 A.3d at 1200. This assertion is without merit, however, because Section 812 does not leave any discretion in the County Council with regard to whether it will fund any award made by an arbitrator, or when and how. Thus, the County Council <em>does not </em>retain control or discretion over its budget, which is an important aspect of its law-making power. <em>See City of Annapolis v. Anne Arundel County, </em>347 Md. 1, 14, 698 A.2d 523, 529 (1997) (\u201c[T]he authority to budget and appropriate revenue is implicit in Article XI-A and is an inherent power of all Maryland counties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">The abrogation of the County Council\u2019s law-making power by delegation to the arbitrator of the ability to impugn the budget is the gravamen of this case and renders Section 812 unconstitutional. In <em>Anne Arundel County v. Fraternal Order, </em>313 Md. 98, 543 A.2d 841 (1988), we distinguished between charter amendments that leave sufficient discretion to the County Council to survive Constitutional scrutiny and those that do not. At issue in that case was whether a newly created lieutenant position of the Anne Arundel County Detention Center should have been included in a collective bargaining unit. The charter amendment we scrutinized imposed binding arbitration on the County and the law enforcement union with respect to whether the position would be included in the bargaining unit, but left to the County Council the discretion to determine the pay for the position. We held that the amendment was constitutional because, \u201cthe County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Council and the County Executive still retain the ultimate decision-making authority with respect to employee compensation\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117, 543 A.2d at 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Our brethren on the Court of Special Appeals, in <em>Wicomico County FOP, Lodge 111 v. Wicomico County, </em>190 Md.App. 291, 988 A.2d 555 (2010), also have implemented our jurisprudential distinction. In that case, a charter amendment that purported to require that the Wicomico County Council adopt binding arbitration and include any award in its budget, much like the Charter provision at issue here, was determined to be unconstitutional. The amendment at issue required the County Council to adopt legislation that would provide a framework for the arbitration process. In holding that the amendment was not constitutional, our brethren in the intermediate appellate court relied on our decisions in <em>Cheeks v. Cedlair Corp., </em>287 Md. 595, 415 A.2d 255 (1980) and <em>Griffith v. Wakefield, </em>298 Md. 381, 470 A.2d 345 (1984) to conclude that, because the amendment \u201cmandated the enactment of legislation which usurped the Council\u2019s legislative discretion with respect to a specific subject matter and a specific group of employees,\u201d it was unconstitutional. <em>Wicomico County, </em>190 Md.App. at 303, 988 A.2d at 560-61. The majority disavows this case without any analysis and, in so doing, <em>sub silencio, </em>overrules <em>Cheeks </em>and <em>Griffith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">In differentiating <em>Wicomico County </em>and its jurisprudential origins in <em>Cheeks </em>and <em>Griffith, </em>the majority adheres to the tenets of the <em>dissent </em>in <em>Griffith. </em>In <em>Griffith, </em>we were faced with a proposed Baltimore County charter amendment that purported to set forth a system for binding arbitration to resolve collective bargaining disputes involving County-employed firefighters. The proposed amendment \u201cset[ ] forth, in minute detail, the composition, function, and powers\u201d of the arbitration board that was to resolve any disputes between the County and the firefighters. <em>Griffith, </em>298 Md. at 386, 470 A.2d at 348. The proposed amendment also stated that any award by the arbitration board would be binding on the County Council and County Executive, that the County Executive was required to include any funds necessary to carry out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>the arbitration board\u2019s awards, and that the County Council could not decrease or remove such funds when it approved the budget submitted by the County Executive, just as in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">We held that the amendment was not appropriate \u201ccharter material\u201d because it \u201cis not intended to, nor does it, alter the \u2018form or structure\u2019 of the Baltimore County government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388, 470 A.2d at 349. Instead, we recognized that the proposed amendment divested the County Council <em>of any </em>discretion related to compensation of Baltimore County firefighters. We were careful, however, to note that a system of binding arbitration could be implemented, but only if done in two steps; first, the charter would have to be amended to <em>permit </em>the County Council to enact legislation regarding binding arbitration, then the County Council would have to enact such legislation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-5\">If the proposed Baltimore County charter amendment had merely <em>authorized </em>the Baltimore County Council to enact a system of binding arbitration with regard to the compensation of Baltimore County employees, and if, pursuant to that authorization, the Baltimore County Council had exercised its discretion to enact <em>an ordinance </em>containing provisions similar to those in the proposed charter amendment now before us, the present case would be distinguishable from <em>Cheeks.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 389-390, 470 A.2d at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">The dissent in <em>Griffith, </em>authored by the author of the instant opinion, would have upheld the charter amendment because the author did not agree with the principle that the citizens of a county may authorize the County Council to adopt binding arbitration but are not permitted to control the details of the scheme. Under his view, the citizens of a county, consistent with our State Constitution, could completely divest the County Council of its legislative power in favor of an arbitrator. The dissent did not agree that the power of the citizens of a county was limited to mere authorization; rather he believed that citizens have the right to set forth whatever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>system of local government they wish, including one in which all legislative discretion has been removed to a private actor. This rationale, which was rejected by the majority in that case, is precisely what the majority now embraces, thereby <em>sub silentio </em>overruling <em>Griffith </em>and <em>Cheeks </em>and explicitly rejecting <em>Wicomico County. </em>Not only does the majority confuse our jurisprudence, but it practically permits an arbitrator to enfeeble the finances of the County by making an award for which there is not sufficient money in the local coffers.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Finally, the majority makes much of the fact that Section 812 was approved by the voters and that, \u201c[t]o say that the voters of a county, exercising their power to amend the Charter, cannot direct that their policy decision be implemented by the County Council would be to hold that only the County Council ultimately can decide whether binding arbitration is County policy.\u201d Maj. Op. at 748, 53 A.3d at 1199. This statement, however, completely misconstrues the amendment at issue. There is no question that the citizens of a county can authorize the County Council to enact binding arbitration, manifesting the policy of the County. What the citizenry cannot do, however, is take over the role of the County Council by assigning its power to set the County budget to a private actor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The majority has uprooted three decades of our jurisprudence regarding the constitutionality of charter amendments. The legal landscape that results from today\u2019s decision is one in which the citizens of a county could divest the legislative body of budgetary authority without constitutional violation. I disagree and thus dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b784-6\">. While the majority recognizes that making budgets and appropriating funds are \"inherent powers\u201d of counties in Maryland, Maj. Op. at 748-49, 53 A.3d at 1199, it concludes that a system of binding arbitration \"does not implicate, on analysis, the lawmaking power of the Council.\" Maj. Op. at 747-49, 53 A.3d at 1198-99. My colleagues assert that our statement in <em>City of Annapolis v. Anne Arundel County, </em>347 Md. 1, 698 A.2d 523 (1997) that, \"[t]he budgetary and appropriation system is a fundamental aspect of the form and structure of a home rule county's government[,j\u201d <em>id. </em>at 15, 698 A.2d at 530 (internal quotations omitted), stands for the principle that a charter amendment purporting to direct the County Council to appropriate funds in a certain manner, in this case consistent with an arbitrator\u2019s award, is proper charter material. This highlights a fundamental misunderstanding of the instant amendment and our prior cases. Section 812 <em>does not </em>alter the form or structure of the budget system; rather, it obliterates the County Council\u2019s constitutional discretion in the existing process. The majority's mistake in this regard, while clearly important for our jurisprudence, is not my focus because the majority errs more substantially in concluding that Section 812 does not divest completely the County Council of its control over the budget, as will be explained <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b788-7\">. The majority also seems prepared to subject those laws approved by the voters to a less substantial constitutional scrutiny than those laws not so voted upon, a decision that makes no sense whatsoever when one considers that citizens voting on legislation is simply a vehicle to enactment, not deserving of any special status as compared to any other vehicle for enacting legislation. Moreover, such a system of constitutional review would destroy any notion that we are a representational democracy and eviscerate the power of our Constitution to prevent the enactment of unjust laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
