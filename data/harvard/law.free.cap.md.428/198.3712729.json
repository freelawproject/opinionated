The first is whether the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission should have exercised jurisdiction over the claim when the employment agreement contained a forum selection clause providing, <em>inter alia, </em>that claims for workers\u2019 compensation benefits should be governed by Virginia law and that the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission should have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve such claims. The second issue presented by the employer and insurer is whether injuries occurring while playing and practicing professional football are \u201caccidental injuries\u201d and thus compensable under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">The facts underlying the two issues raised in the Court are not disputed by the parties. In March 2004, the respondent Thomas Tupa and the petitioner Pro-Football, Inc., trading as (t/a) the \u201cWashington Redskins,\u201d entered into a four-year National Football League (NFL) employment contract for Tupa to play football for Pro-Football, Inc. The position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>played by Mr. Tupa was \u201cpunter.\u201d Pro-Football, Inc., t/a the Washington Redskins, is incorporated in Maryland and owns its stadium, named \u201cFedEx Field,\u201d which is located in Land-over, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. All of Pro-Football, Inc.\u2019s \u201chome\u201d football games are played at FedEx Field in Maryland, and the players\u2019 practice or \u201cwarm-up\u201d just before the games also occurs at FedEx Field. Pro-Football, Inc., has its headquarters and practice facility in Virginia, and most practices are at the Virginia facility. Such practices, of course, are for the purpose of getting the players ready to play well at the football games.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The employment contract between Tupa and Pro-Football, Inc., contained, in an addendum, a forum selection clause which stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\"><em>\u201cJURISDICTION. </em>The parties hereto agree that this Player Contract shall for all purposes be deemed to have been negotiated and executed in Virginia; that should any dispute, claim or cause of action (collectively \u2018dispute\u2019) arise concerning rights or liabilities arising from the relationship between the Player and the Club, the parties hereto agree that the law governing such dispute shall be the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and that the exclusive jurisdiction for resolving such dispute in the case of Workers\u2019 Compensation is the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, and in the case of Workers\u2019 Compensation claims the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act shall govern.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">In January 2005, Tupa complained of mild lower back pain, and he was examined by Dr. Thomas Schuler of the Virginia Spine Institute. At the time, Dr. Schuler determined that Tupa suffered from \u201csignificant underlying spondylosis and stenosis,\u201d a condition which the doctor did not believe would effect Tupa\u2019s ability to play during the 2005-2006 football season, particularly because Tupa had successfully completed the 2004-2005 season. The doctor concluded that Tupa \u201cshould be able to play one or two more seasons\u201d before the condition greatly impacted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>On August 19, 2005, at FedEx Field, during his pre-game warm-up for a pre-season game, Tupa landed awkwardly after a punt and felt a sharp pain in his lower back. He described the pain as a \u201cjarring\u201d sensation, sought immediate medical attention, and received medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">On August 22, two days later, Tupa again visited Dr. Schuler, who noted that Tupa was reporting \u201c95% back pain.\u201d An MRI disclosed \u201csignificant progression of the disc degeneration ... [t]hat clearly progressed significantly from a year ago with much more collapse.\u201d When Tupa saw Dr. Schuler again on August 28, Dr. Schuler concluded that Tupa had significant discogenic pain and could possibly be a good candidate for surgery. The doctor also determined that Tupa was not able to continue playing professional football until he was able to get his condition and the related pain \u201ccalmed down.\u201d The doctor recommended intradiscal steroid injection \u201cas a last ditch effort to get [Tupa] back to a functional status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">When Tupa next saw the doctor on September 2, 2005, Tupa reported that the pain had not subsided and that he continued to have numbness and tingling sensations in his feet. Dr. Schuler recommended giving Tupa\u2019s condition more time to heal naturally before proceeding with an operative solution. Dr. Schuler also noted that \u201cthe patient is still disabled from participating in the NFL, and he is still working aggressively in his rehabilitation to get back to a functional pain-free status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Despite a treatment regime which included medication and physical therapy, Tupa\u2019s condition did not improve. In January 2006, during an end of season evaluation, Dr. Schuler noted that Tupa suffered from \u201ca marked disc collapse ... of approximately 90%.\u201d Dr. Schuler concluded that Tupa\u2019s condition would not improve further without major spinal surgery, and that, even if Tupa did have surgery, it would be unlikely that he would ever be able to play professional football again. After discussing his options, along with the related risks, with Dr. Schuler, Tupa decided to forego surgery. Dr. Schuler noted that Tupa \u201cunderstands] the risks of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>surgery versus no surgery, and participation and non-participation in the NFL. [Tupa] agrees ... he is not a candidate for the NFL at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">On May 15, 2006, Tupa filed a claim for benefits because of his back injury with the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. He subsequently withdrew this claim, and the Virginia Commission dismissed the matter \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">On October 12, 2006, Tupa sought an independent medical evaluation from Dr. Michael Franchetti. Dr. Franchetti concluded that the back injury sustained by Tupa on August 19, 2005, was \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of medical certainty ... a career-ending injury for\u201d Tupa. Another doctor, Dr. Charles Jackson, evaluated Tupa on December 11, 2006, and he likewise concluded that Tupa\u2019s professional football career would be shortened, but he disagreed with the other doctors\u2019 assessment that the back injury was caused by Tupa\u2019s professional football activities. Rather, he concluded that the August 19th injury \u201cmanifest[ed] an ongoing degenerative spine condition which ... was aggravated by years of [punting].\u201d He determined that \u201c[t]he kicking incident did not cause or precipitate damage to [or] materially change the degenerative condition which\u201d caused the end of Tupa\u2019s career.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">At the present time, Tupa has not sought surgical intervention to address his back pain. He no longer plays professional football, but is currently employed in a sedentary position, which he has held since February 2006. Tupa was paid by Pro-Football, Inc., pursuant to his contract, for the remainder of the 2005-2006 season. Although Tupa still suffers from pain and takes medication to address it, he acknowledged in the circuit court trial that he believes that he will eventually need back surgery, although he is delaying the procedure for as long as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Tupa filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits with the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission on March 30, 2007. The petitioners, Tupa\u2019s employer and its insurer, challenged Tupa\u2019s claim on the issues of \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>er the injury was an accidental injury, and whether his disability was casually related to the injury in August 2005. On March 3, 2008, the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission held a hearing on Tupa\u2019s contested claim. The Commission decided, on March 14, 2008, that the Maryland Commission could properly exercise jurisdiction over Tupa\u2019s claim, that Tupa had sustained an accidental injury arising \u201cout of and in the course of [his] employment,\u201d and that Tupa\u2019s disability was causally related to his accidental injury. Tupa was awarded temporary partial disability benefits and the petitioners were ordered to pay the related medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Pro-Football, Inc., and its insurer filed an action for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County and requested a trial by jury. Although the parties agreed that there were no factual disputes regarding the issue of jurisdiction, a two-day jury trial was held, in which the jury decided that Tupa had sustained an accidental injury in August 2005 and that his disability was causally connected to that accidental injury. The Circuit Court determined, as a matter of law, that the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission was entitled to exercise jurisdiction over Tupa\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Tupa\u2019s employer and its insurer noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed in a reported opinion, <em>Pro-Football v. Tupa, </em>197 Md.App. 463, 14 A.3d 678 (2011). The intermediate appellate court agreed with the Commission and Circuit Court that the Commission properly exercised jurisdiction over Tupa\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim, that Tupa was a covered employee, that Tupa incurred an accidental injury in August 2005, and that there was ample evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s finding that Tupa\u2019s disability was caused by the August 2005 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Tupa\u2019s employer and insurer petitioned this Court for a -writ of certiorari which was granted. <em>Pro-Football v. Tupa, </em>420 Md. 81, 21 A.3d 1063 (2011). The petitioners raise in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Court the following two issues (Petitioners\u2019 brief in this Court at 2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">\u201cQuestions Presented</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">\u201cI. Whether Maryland has jurisdiction over the Claimant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim when the Claimant signed an employment contract agreeing to bring all workers\u2019 compensation claims in the Commonwealth of Virginia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">\u201cII. Whether the Claimant sustained an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment on August 19, 2005.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">The petitioners\u2019 principal argument is that the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission had no jurisdiction over Tupa\u2019s claim and that the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act had no application to the claim because \u201cthe Claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>was contractually bound to bring his claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\u201d (Petitioners\u2019 brief at 4). The petitioners rely upon opinions of this Court indicating that \u201c \u2018forum-selection clauses are presumptively enforceable.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting <em>Secure Financial v. Popular Leasing, </em>391 Md. 274, 282, 892 A.2d 571, 576 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">None of this Court\u2019s opinions relied upon by the petitioners, however, involved a workers\u2019 compensation claim. More specifically, none of these opinions involved a statute which voided a provision in an employment contract waiving the rights of a covered employee under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, in \u00a7 9-104(a) of the Labor and Employment Article of the Code, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">\u201c\u00a7 9-104. Agreements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">(a) <em>Exemption from duty; waiver of right.</em>\u2014(1) Except as otherwise provided in this title, a covered employee or an employer of a covered employee may not by agreement, rule or regulation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">(i) exempt the covered employee or the employer from a duty of the covered employee or the employer under this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">(ii) waive a right of the covered employee or the employer under this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-10\">(2) An agreement, rule, or regulation that violates paragraph (1) of this subsection is void to the extent of the violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">Thus, an agreement exempting \u201cthe employer from a duty of the ... employer under the\u201d Act is \u201cvoid.\u201d (\u00a7 9\u2014104(a)(i)). Furthermore, an agreement waiving \u201ca right of the covered employee ... under the\u201d Act is void (\u00a7 9-104(a)(ii)). Although \u00a7 9-104 contains a few special provisions, such as for railroad employees, none of them are applicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Section 9-104(a), in plain, unambiguous language, precludes an agreement which exempts an employer from the duty of paying workers\u2019 compensation benefits which are otherwise due under the <em>Maryland </em>statute. The section also precludes an agreement which waives the right of an employee to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits which are otherwise due under the <em>Maryland </em>statute. A holding that forum selection clauses constitute an exception to \u00a7 9-104 would contravene basic principles concerning the interpretation of statutes. The petitioners would have us construe \u00a7 9-104 as if there was in the statute an exception for forum selection clauses. This we cannot do. As stated in numerous cases, a \u201c \u2018plainly worded statute must be construed without forced or subtle interpretations designed to ... limit the scope of its operation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris v. Board of Education, </em>375 Md. 21, 31, 825 A.2d 365, 371 (2003), quoting <em>Caffrey v. Dept. of Liquor Control for Montgomery County, </em>370 Md. 272, 292, 805 A.2d 268, 279 (2002). Inserting into \u00a7 9-104 an exception for forum selection clauses \u201c \u2018would be to re-draft the statute under the guise of construction,\u2019\u201d <em>Montrose Christian School v. Walsh, </em>363 Md. 565, 595, 770 A.2d 111, 128-129 (2001), quoting <em>Davis v. State, </em>294 Md. 370, 378, 451 A.2d 107, 111 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Moreover, the applicable authorities support our conclusion that the forum selection clause in the employment contract was ineffective to divest the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission of the ability to exercise jurisdiction. In <em>Kacur v. Employers Mut. Cas. Co., </em>253 Md. 500, 509, 254 A.2d 156, 161 (1969), this Court held that a forum selection clause in the employment contract was ineffective in a workers\u2019 compensation case, and the Court quoted with approval Professor Larson as follows (3 Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 87.71 at 395 (1968 Supp.)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">\u201c \u2018Express agreement between employer and employee that the statute of a named state shall apply is ineffective either to enlarge the applicability of that state\u2019s statute or to diminish the applicability of the statutes of other states. Whatever the rule may be as to questions involving commercial paper, interest, usury and the like, the rule in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>workmen\u2019s compensation is dictated by the overriding consideration that compensation is not a private matter to be arranged between two parties; the public has a profound interest in the matter which cannot be altered by any individual agreements. This is most obvious when such an agreement purports to destroy jurisdiction where it otherwise exists; practically every statute has emphatic prohibitions against cutting down rights or benefits by contract. The only exception occurs under several statutes which explicitly permit the parties to agree that the local statute shall not apply to out-of-state injuries.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In <em>McElroy v. Pohopek, </em>375 Md. 574, 578 n. 2, 594-595, 826 A.2d 474, 476 n. 2, 486 (2003), this Court held that Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation law applied to an employee\u2019s claim despite a forum selection clause in the employment contract stating that the employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claims \u201cshall be exclusively governed by the [workers\u2019] compensation laws of the State of Alabama.\u201d <em>See also Alaska Packers Assn. v. Comm\u2019n, </em>294 U.S. 532, 55 S.Ct. 518, 79 L.Ed. 1044 (1935) (The employment contact, entered in California for work in Alaska, provided that Alaska Workers\u2019 Compensation law should apply, but the Supreme Court of California, upholding an award of benefits under California workers\u2019 compensation law, held that the forum selection clause was invalid. The Supreme Court of the Untied States affirmed, holding that the application of California workers\u2019 compensation law violated neither the Full Faith and Credit Clause nor the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">As pointed out by the Court of Special Appeals in the present case, numerous cases in other states have also refused to give effect to forum selection clauses in workers\u2019 compensation cases. <em>See Pro-Football v. Tupa, supra, </em>197 Md.App. at 477, 14 A.3d at 686, collecting some of the cases; <em>Swenson v. Nickaboine, </em>793 N.W.2d 738, 743 (Minn.2011); <em>Gotkin v. Weinberg, </em>2 N.J. 305, 308, 66 A.2d 438, 439 (1949); <em>McIlvaine Trucking, Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board, </em>570 Pa. 662, 673, 810 A.2d 1280, 1286 (2002); <em>Jenkins v.

Baltimore Colts, </em>53 Md.App. 526, 454 A.2d 872 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In <em>Rowe, </em>a professional football player was injured while practicing in a \u201cscrimmage,\u201d and sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The Court of Special Appeals held in <em>Rowe </em>that the player had not suffered an \u201caccidental injury\u201d within the meaning of the definition presently codified as \u00a7 9-101(b)(1). The <em>Rowe </em>opinion, 53 Md.App. at 535, 454 A.2d at 877, stated that \u201caccidental injury\u201d within the meaning of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act included injury \u201cproduced by some unusual and extraordinary condition or happening in the employment.\u201d The opinion continued (53 Md.App. at 535-536, 454 A.2d at 878, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">\u201cThe key to the application of the term \u2018accidental injury,\u2019 is whether the occurrence was an <em>unusual or unexpected </em>happening in the course of employment. Thus, if a stenographer was suddenly subjected to another employee\u2019s striking him or her in the elbow with great force, the resulting injury would at a minimum be <em>unusual, unexpected, </em>and surprising. It would, in any event, not be a commonplace happening. Consequently, the stenographer would properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>be said to have incurred an accidental injury within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">\u201cOn the other hand, a professional football player is engaged in an occupation in which physical contact with others is not only expected, commonplace, and <em>usual, </em>but is a requirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The Court of Special Appeals in the present case held that <em>Rowe </em>was contrary to current statutory and case law, and specifically that it was inconsistent with this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Harris v. Board of Education, supra, </em>375 Md. 21, 825 A.2d 365. The Court of Special Appeals overruled <em>Rowe, </em>and we fully agree with that Court\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">This Court in <em>Harris v. Board of Education </em>explicitly rejected the principle used in <em>Rowe </em>that an \u201caccidental injury\u201d must arise from an unusual or unexpected occurrence. Prior to <em>Harris, </em>several appellate opinions had held that, in order for an injury occurring during employment to be \u201caccidental,\u201d the injury must result from some \u201cunusual strain, exertion or condition in employment.\u201d <em>Sargent v. Board of Education, Baltimore County, </em>49 Md.App. 577, 580-581, 433 A.2d 1209, 1211 (1981). <em>See, e.g., Stancliff v. H. B. Davis Co., </em>208 Md. 191, 198, 117 A.2d 577, 581 (1955); <em>Geipe, Inc. v. Collett, </em>172 Md. 165, 190 A. 836 (1937); <em>Schemmel v. Gatch &amp; Sons, </em>164 Md. 671, 166 A. 39 (1933); <em>State Roads Commission v. Reynolds, </em>164 Md. 539, 165 A. 475 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">In <em>Harris, </em>a cafeteria worker was engaged in her usual work day activity of laundering the linens at the end of the day. She dragged a forty-five pound box of laundry soap outside, and when she subsequently bent down, her back \u201ccracked.\u201d She was in excruciating pain, and she immediately sought medical attention. During judicial review of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission\u2019s order granting Harris compensation, the case went to the jury, which determined that the Harris\u2019s injury was not \u201caccidental\u201d because it did not result from an unusual work activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">This Court in <em>Harris </em>reviewed previous cases requiring that an accidental personal injury arise out of \u201cunusual activity\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>order to quality for workers\u2019 compensation and determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">\u201c[t]he line of cases in this Court requiring that an accidental personal injury arise out of \u2018unusual activity\u2019 for there to be coverage obviously adds a requirement not contained in the statutory language.\u201d 375 Md. at 30, 825 A.2d at 371.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Reviewing the statutory language and earlier Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation cases, including <em>Victory Sparkler Co. v. Francks, </em>147 Md. 368, 128 A. 635 (1925), this Court held that \u201cwhat must be unexpected, unintended, or unusual is the resulting injury and <em>not </em>the activity out of which the injury arises.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>375 Md. at 36, 825 A.2d at 374. The <em>Harris </em>Court explained (375 Md. at 33, 825 A.2d at 372):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">\u201c \u2018The statutory definition of injury, which was made compensable without reference to neglect of employer or fault of worker, except when the injury was self-inflicted or the sole result of the intoxication of the employee, and the abolition of the fellow-servant rule, of defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk, and the substitution of a regulated and certain compensation for damages, contribute convincingly to the conclusion that the legislative intent was to include within the act not only the newly created class of compensable injuries, but also <em>every injury which could be suffered by any worker in the course and arising out of the employment, for which there was then a subsisting right of </em>action.... With this conception of the purpose and effect of the act, the Legislature was consistent in making the prescribed liability of the employer and remedy of the employee exclusive <em>with respect to all injuries sustained in the hazardous employment,\u2019 \u201d </em>quoting <em>Victory Sparkler, </em>147 Md. at 376-377, 128 A. at 637-638.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">In 2 <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation </em>\u00a7 22.04 (2007), the treatise refers to the \u201cconspicuously wrong\u201d idea that football injuries should not be considered accidental because \u201cfootball is a dangerous sport fraught with expectation of injury.\u201d Larson points out that, in \u201calmost all states in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>National Football League operates,\u201d injuries occurring during practice or the game are \u201croutinely treated as compensable.\u201d He comments that denying workers\u2019 compensation benefits to professional football players effectively denies a class of covered employees compensation for doing precisely the job they were hired to do. Larson also draws attention to the inherent contradictions in this approach, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">\u201cAnd why is doing the job itself not covered? Because everyone knows it is fraught with danger. As well, then, tell the coal miner \u2014 whose occupation is far more dangerous \u2014 that he or she is covered, so long as the miner does not go down into the mine----The books are full of cases in which compensation is denied a covered worker because he or she was <em>not </em>doing the job at the time. But never before because he or she <em>was </em>doing the job____To say that football injuries are not accidental because of the probability of injury is, if one looks more closely, no more than to say that any activity with a high risk factor should be ruled noncompensable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Larson criticizes \u201cthe kind of loose thinking\u201d that characterizes professional sports injuries as not accidental <em>(ibid.):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">\u201cAs a little reflection will show, this is tantamount to saying that the player in effect intended to get himself injured. This is, of course, preposterous. True, some of these sports are rough. But everything about them is elaborately designed to prevent actual disabling physical injury. All the forbidden practices \u2014 clipping, piling-on, face-masking, spearing, unnecessary roughness, and a host of others \u2014 are precisely intended to do everything possible to forestall injury----It is, of course, not particularly surprising if, as a result of some such mish-mash of erroneous impressions both about professional sports and about workers\u2019 compensation the untrained person-on-the-street (or in the jury) just somehow feels the professional athlete should not get compensation. But it is unworthy of a legally trained mind to substitute this kind of superficial reaction for an accurate analysis that simply accords professional athletes the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>protection under compensation law as is enjoyed by everyone else who works for a living.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Tupa\u2019s injury occurred \u201cout of and in the course of [his] employment.\u201d He was warming up for a game when he landed awkwardly and thereafter sought immediate medical treatment. Ample evidence was presented to show that Tupa suffered a compensable accidental injury during the course of his employment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">RESPONDENT\u2019S MOTION TO STRIKE GRANTED.

As pointed out in the text, the Court of Special Appeals dealt with four issues, namely (1) whether the Maryland Commission should have exercised jurisdiction in light of the forum selection clause in the employment contract, (2) whether Tupa was a \"covered employee\u201d under the Maryland statute, (3) whether the injury in August 2005 was an \u201caccidental injury\u201d within the meaning of the Maryland statute, and (4) whether Tupa\u2019s disability was caused by the August 2005 injury. The petition for a writ of certiorari raised the first three of these issues but did not include the fourth. In their briefs and oral argument before this Court, however, the employer and insurer raised only two issues, <em>i.e., </em>whether the Maryland Commission should have exercised jurisdiction in light of the forum selection clause and whether Tupa sustained an accidental injury within the meaning of the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">The \"covered employee\u201d issue was not mentioned in petitioners\u2019 opening brief, reply brief, or oral argument.
