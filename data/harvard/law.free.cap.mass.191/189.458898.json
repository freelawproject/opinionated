The relation between the defendants and the plaintiff disclosed by the \u2022 bill is, it seems to us, the ordinary relation between a broker and his client or customer which, though it involves a certain amount of trust and confidence in the broker on the part of the customer, is not a fiduciary relation, but a relation as debtor and creditor. <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>180 Mass. 458. The allegations that \u201c the plaintiff relied upon the knowledge and experience of the defendants in regard to buying and selling stocks . . . and employed the defendants as his brokers in order to avail himself of said peculiar knowledge and experience\u201d add nothing jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">The averments that <em>\u201c </em>the number of purchases and sales which the plaintiff requested the defendants to make on his account was very great \u201d and that \u201c owing to the number of said transactions, -it is impossible for the plaintiff to state with certainty how much the defendants now owe\u201d but that a large amount is due him upon a proper accounting do not in form or substance allege that the accounts are so complicated that they cannot be conveniently adjusted in an action at law. In <em>Badger </em>v. <em>McNamara, uli supra, </em>and <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>114 Mass. 121, where the facts alleged resembled those in the bill before us, it was held that the plaintiff was not entitled to relief. In <em>Badger </em>v. <em>McNamara </em>the cases of <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>1 Cush. 82, and <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Cumston, </em>110 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>82, were distinguished on the ground that, in those cases, the accounts were to be settled on the same principles that they would be if the parties were partners. The bill cannot be maintained for discovery alone if that is not incidental to any relief which the court has the right to grant. Moreover as said by the court in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Webber, </em>2 Gray, 558, 561, \u201c The main purpose of these provisions of the practice act,\u201d referring to the provisions relating to interrogations, \u201c was to substitute, in place of the tedious, expensive and complex process of a bill of discovery on the equity side of the court, an easy, cheap and simple mode of interrogating an adverse party, as incident to and part of the proceedings in the cause in which the discovery was sought,\u201d thus imparting, in theory at least, to the remedy at law almost if not quite the efficacy of a bill of discovery in equity. See <em>Gunn </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>171 Mass. 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\">\n<em>Recree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
