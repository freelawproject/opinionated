Writ dated May 14, 1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-6\">At the trial in the Superior Court before <em>Hardy, </em>J. it appeared that the planks were used to form a bridge over a space between the building and the street the bottom of which was three or four feet below the level of the street and contained a spur track of a railroad from which cars were unloaded into the building. The use of planks for this purpose was the method prevailing at the defendants\u2019 building. The plaintiff testified that he noticed other teamsters using the planks and watched the way they placed them when loading their teams. The two planks used by the plaintiff were about twelve feet long and ten inches or a foot wide. The planks were placed by the plaintiff in the position described in the opinion, where also other material facts are stated as well as the exclusion of certain evidence offered by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s statement in regard to the matter of there being ice on the sill, which is referred to in the opinion, was that when he returned to his team after the accident he found a man, that he learned was the miller, chopping some ice off the sill with a small hatchet, and that that was the first knowledge he had that there was anything the matter with the sill. Another witness testified that after the plaintiff was hurt he saw the defendants\u2019 miller chopping ice off the sill. The miller himself testified that there was a \u201c small little bit \u201d of ice on the sill which he picked off the sill with a meat pick; that he picked \u201cthat ice out of the way so no more could slip.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-8\">At the close of the evidence the judge ordered a verdict for the defendants; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number><em>C. Reno &amp; F. P. Fagan, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b612-5\"><em>C. S. Knowles &amp; W. B. Sprout, </em>for the defendants, were not called upon.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b612-6\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"As9\">The evidence tended to show that the accident was caused by the displacement of one end of one of two planks upon which the plaintiff was standing. Each plank was supported at one end by a sill three inches wide formed by a plank spiked to the side of the mill, and at the other end by the plaintiff's wagon. The planks lay on the wagon \u201con a perfectly flat surface,\u201d being \u201c level from the building to the wagon,\u201d and \u201c they did not slant or tip in any way.\u201d They were put in place and adjusted by the plaintiff. He was an experienced teamster, and although he testified \u25a0 that he had never before used such a contrivance in loading from a building he must be held nevertheless to have fully understood the perils incident to this method of loading and unloading a wagon. He accepted and used the planks with a full knowledge of their nature. By him they were adjusted, and he must- be held to have known that upon him rested the duty of keeping them in place. It is argued by the plaintiff that there was ice upon the sill. But, even if that was so, it does not change the responsibility of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The evidence that at some time previous to the accident the planks had moved off, as also the evidence that on the day before the accident the sill was covered with dust from the meal or corn, was properly rejected within the discretion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
