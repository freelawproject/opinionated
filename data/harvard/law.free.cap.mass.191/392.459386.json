Said first party agrees to construct and equip said spur track, furnishing the necessary materials therefor and putting it in proper condition for use as soon as it reasonably may.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-5\">\u201c Second. Said second party agrees to bear the entire expense of the construction and equipment of said spur track and to pay for the same within thirty days after its completion and the presentation of the bills, and it is agreed that if payment is not made within said thirty days said first party may remove said track, and the expense of construction, after deducting the value of materials removed, shall be paid by second <em>party; </em>and it is also understood and agreed that said second party shall bear the expense of the maintenance of said spur track and shall pay the bills therefor as they are presented from time to time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-6\">\u201cThird.

Said first party agrees that said second party may erect its coal scales on the property of the first party by the side of said spur track, and also a temporary coal platform and temporary shed for carrying on its coal business, and also a temporary weighing room, and may use the same during the life of this agreement, and for that purpose may enter said premises of first party ; and that said scales, platform and sheds shall remain the property of the second party, and that the first party may make no charge for use and occupation of its premises by the second party during the life of this agreement. And said second party hereby agrees to assume all risk of damage to tho buildings comprising his plant and the contents thereof by fire, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>communicated from locomotives of the first party by sparks or otherwise, and waives, and hereby releases said first party from all claims that may arise for such damages made by any insurer or other person on account of such damage.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-3\"><em>C.

The terms of the agreement were \u201c that whenever said first party may find it necessary for the accommodation of its business to remove said spur track,\u201d no claim for damage shall be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">In our opinion this provision comes within the class of cases collected in <em>Lockwood Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Mason Regulator Co. </em>183 Mass. 25, 26, in which the decision of one party to the contract is final, \u201c however unreasonable he might be, provided he acted in good faith.\u201d See in this connection <em>Whittemore </em>v. <em>New </em>York, <em>New Haven, &amp; Hartford </em>Railroad, 174 Mass. 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">In case of such a contract, evidence that \u201c it was not necessary for the accommodation of the defendant\u2019s business to remove the spur track in question at the time when it was removed,\u201d is not material, in the absence of evidence that the defendant did not act in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant:</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
