By a codicil the testatrix directed that the house and land included in the trust after the decease of her two sisters should be sold and the proceeds equally divided between two cousins of the testatrix named. The codicil then provided as follows: \u201c Should it so happen, that after paying all expenses and dues, and delivering sundry gifts of my private personal effects, there should not be sufficient money left from the saleable portions of my estate, to pay the full amount of the sums given and bequeathed to sundry persons and Institutions, as enumerated in my Will and Codicil, then my will is, that said recipients shall each receive a <em>pro rata </em>as will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>equalize the distribution of the Amounts.\u201d The will contained a residuary clause. After paying debts and legacies including the $50,000 for the trust above named the executors had in their hands about $20,000, and brought a bill for instructions as to whether the whole of this should be distributed to the residuary legatees or whether they should retain in their hands a sufficient amount to pay with the $50,000 in the trust the $59,000 of legacies payable upon the death of the testatrix\u2019s two sisters. <em>Held, </em>that the testatrix by the provision in her codicil intended to place all of the legatees under the will and codicil, except those to whom specific legacies were given, upon an equal footing, and the executors were ordered to retain out of the funds in their hands a sufficient sum to pay in full the deferred legacies when they became payable.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-3\">Bill in equity, filed in the Supreme Judicial Court on May 19,1905, by the executors under the will of Maria W..

After the payment of all debts and legacies, including the payment of $50,000 to themselves as trustees, the executors had in their hands securities to the amount of $20,000. This bill was brought to determine whether the executors should retain from the residue in their hands funds sufficient to provide for the payment in full of the legacies payable at the death of the life tenants, both of whom were living when the bill was filed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b195-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number><em>F.

Wales and others, residuary legatees and devisees under the will, contended that the whole of the fund in the hands of the plaintiffs should be distributed immediately among the residuary legatees, leaving for the postponed legatees under article fifth of the will only the trust fund created by that article whether sufficient to pay them in full or not.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b195-6\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB2\">By the second clause of her will the testatrix gives certain pecuniary legacies; then she makes provision for various specific bequests of articles of personal property including jewelry, pictures, books, etc., and by the fifth clause gives the trustees $50,000 and certain real estate in trust to pay to her sisters the net income for life, and upon the death of the survivor to pay out of the trust fund <em>\u201c </em>the following legacies,\u201d naming them; concluding the clause with a direction to the trustees to \u201c transfer, pay over and convey the whole residue of said trust estate to the persons entitled to the residue of my estate under the following article in fee.\u201d \u201c The following article \u201d is the residuary clause, which gives \u201c all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate both real and personal including the remainder and reversion of the trust estate created by the Fifth Article of this will\u201d to certain persons therein named with provisions for the succession in case of the death of any of them. This was in substance the way the will disposed of the estate at the time when the codicil was executed. The legacies given by the .fifth clause out of the trust estate amounted to $59,000. The trust estate, including the real estate, which was and is valued at about $15,000, amounted to $65,000. There would, therefore, except for some unforeseen contingency, have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>been sufficient to pay all of the legacies thus given, and to leave a residue. And the testatrix must be presumed to have understood and appreciated these facts. By the codicil, however, material alterations were made in the will, and the scheme of it was, as we think, radically changed. By it the testatrix gave additional pecuniary legacies, and directed that the real estate included in the trust should be sold after the death of her sisters and the proceeds divided equally between two cousins. This, as the testatrix must have known, rendered the trust estate insuffi- ' cient to meet the legacies that were to be paid out of it, and no doubt directed her attention to the possible abatement of the other legacies when the legacies given by the codicil were added to them. This, it seems to us, is the explanation of the presence in the codicil of the provision as to a <em>pro rata </em>payment \u201c of the sums given and bequeathed to sundry persons and institutions as enumerated in my will and codicil\u201d if \u201cthere should not be sufficient money left from the saleable portions of my estate to pay the full amounts of the sums \u201d so given and bequeathed. And the natural construction of the provision is, we think, that the testatrix intended thereby to place all of the legatees, except those to whom specific bequests were made, as well those to whom legacies were given out of the trust fund as those who were not, upon an equal footing, and that they should all be paid in full if there was enough of the estate to pay them, \u201c after paying all expenses and dues, and delivering sundry gifts of my private personal effects,\u201d and if not that they should all abate <em>pro rata. </em>She expressly includes \u201c the sums given and bequeathed to sundry persons and Institutions, as enumerated in my Will and Codicil,\u201d and nowhere manifests any intention to draw any distinction between the legacies that were made payable out of the trust estate and those that were not. The testatrix did not work out her scheme in all its details, but her intention is, we think, reasonably plain. Whether, as the will stood before the execution of the codicil, in case of a loss in whole or in part of the trust fund, the legacies payable out of it would have abated altogether or in part, as the case might be, as the counsel for the residuary legatees contends, or whether the loss would have had to be made up out of the rest of the estate, as the counsel for the legatees under the fifth clause contends, it is not necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>consider, in view of the construction which we think must be given to the provision in the codicil relating to <em>pro rata </em>payments. The result is that the executors should retain out of the funds in their hands sufficient funds to pay in full the legacies under the fifth clause when and as they become due. The question as to what disposition should be made of the interest if any that may come due or accumulate and of any surplus that may remain is not strictly speaking before us, though we may perhaps not improperly observe that we do not see why both would not go to the residuary legatees.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
