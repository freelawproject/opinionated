There was other evidence which was conflicting and irreconcilable. <em>Held, </em>that the questions as to the identity of the horse that kicked the plaintiff, whether the horse was vicious, and if so whether the defendant knew or should have known this, and whether he used proper care to protect the plaintiff from injury, were for the jury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-7\">Tort for personal injuries from being kicked by one of a pair of horses attached to an ice team of the defendant as the plaintiff was walking along the sidewalk of Norfolk Place, leading from Harrison Avenue extension to Washington Street, in Boston, at 8.15 A. M. on April 25, 1902. Writ dated January 10,1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-8\">At the trial in the Superior Court before <em>Sherman, </em>J. the evidence was conflicting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-9\">There was evidence tending to show that two teams of the defendant delivered ice in Norfolk Place; that one team driven by one Nutting delivered ice at Marston\u2019s restaurant near Washington Street in a building called the Arcade on the right hand side of Norfolk Place coming from Washington Street, and that the other team driven by one Hale delivered ice for R. H. White\u2019s soda fountain, the entrance to which was Inear Harrison Avenue extension and was on the opposite side of Norfolk Place from the Arcade; that the width of the ice cart was six feet and five inches from tire to tire and that the hubs extended six inches on each side ; that Norfolk Place was two hundred and sixty-six feet long, and was at its narrowest point seven feet from curb to curb.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>There was evidence that at some time during that spring there had been driven on the nigh side of Nutting\u2019s team a green horse that had been known to be somewhat irritable. Both of Hale\u2019s horses were kind and gentle and had never been known to kick.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-3\">On cross-examination Nutting testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-4\">\u201c Well, I don\u2019t know exactly what horse I had on the twenty-fifth of April; I was at one time driving a gray horse that I had some trouble with, on the Norfolk Place route, he was one of a pair of gray horses; I usually backed in to Norfolk Place, and if I backed in it would bring that gray horse that I had trouble with nearest to the sidewalk; most always when I was in Norfolk Place that horse was nearest to the narrow sidewalk; I had trouble with harnessing him as soon as I got him; I had trouble harnessing him the first night I got him; from that time on I always had trouble harnessing him; I had trouble with harnessing him from the time I took him until they let him go; I don\u2019t know what became of him afterwards; it is true that Norfolk Place is so narrow that we had to stop near the sidewalk wherever we could; whether it was near the place where we were to deliver ice or not, we had to get the ice wherever we could stop and drag it up to where we wanted to put it; I delivered ice on the side of the street opposite R H. White\u2019s; Hale delivered ice on the same side of the street as R. H. White\u2019s; that is we delivered ice on the side the narrow sidewalk was on.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-7\">One Johnson, a stableman in the employ of the defendant, testified that the horses driven by Hale were quiet, gentle and good; that he never knew of their kicking; that Nutting\u2019s off horse was a good, steady one and that the nigh one which he used about the time of the accident was a green one, which had a boil on his neck that irritated him; that the boil was there when they bought him but that after it healed he was quiet and steady; and that he never had seen him kick.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-8\">Upon cross-examination he testified that Nutting drove a pair of gray horses in April, 1902 ; that there was no record kept at the company\u2019s office to enable him to know what particular horses were driven at that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-9\">There was evidence that the horse that kicked the plaintiff was a gray horse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>At the close of the evidence the counsel for the defendant asked the judge to rule that, upon all the evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover and to direct a verdict for the defendant. This the judge refused to do and submitted the case to the jury. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $2,800; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b620-3\"><em>W.

It would serve no useful purpose to rehearse it in detail. We are of opinion that the questions as to the identity of the horse which kicked the plaintiff, whether the horse was vicious, and whether the defendant knew or should have known it and used proper care to protect the plaintiff from injury were for the jury. The judge rightly refused to order a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">\n<em>\u00a1Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
