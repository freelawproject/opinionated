that thereupon they went upon the land in question, and while there Butland informed the petitioner that he was not the owner of the land, but might own it some day; that he had a contract in writing with Blackwell to build a house upon the land; that Butland then took from his pocket the contract dated January 1, 1903, and gave it to the petitioner to read ; that the contract was signed by both the Butlands and Blackwell; that the petitioner and Butland then made a verbal contract for the work and materials furnished, for which the lien was claimed; that the petitioner began work on the next day; that he saw Blackwell for the first time on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>January 6, 1903, at Blackwell\u2019s home; that on January 6 the petitioner found a man upon the land in the employ of Blackwell engaged in cutting down trees, and stopped him; that he then went to Blackwell\u2019s house and informed Blackwell what he had done; \u201c that he had stopped Blackwell\u2019s man from cutting trees, as Butland had given him the trees \u201d ; that Blackwell responded, \u201c What right have you to stop my man from cutting down my trees, Butland does not own that land, and may never own it, he has a contract to build the work, and I have a good mind not to allow you to dig another shovelful of dirt there, and I want you to leave my house at once \u201d ; that the next morning Blackwell came to the place where the work was going on and told the petitioner that he wanted to apologize for what he had said to him the day before, adding: \u201cIt is a fine day, so push the work along, don\u2019t take away too much dirt, and do a first class job \u201d ; that Blackwell came upon the land almost every day and gave him directions about the work ; that on January 11 or 12 Blackwell came on the land and said to the petitioner that \u201c he wanted the house changed like a plan he gave Butland to give me,\u201d and gave the petitioner a sketch of a plan saying: \u201c follow that \u201d; that the petitioner continued to do the work according to this sketch or plan until about January 24 or 26, and that the work was nearly completed, when Blackwell came upon the land with another sketch or plan, and told the petitioner to change the work to conform to the sketch or plan which he then gave him; that the petitioner completed the work under the last sketch or plan, and that the petitioner ceased work on January 30, 1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-30\">The respondent Blackwell testified in substance that in Jan-nary, 1903, he owned the land in question; that he wanted to sell the land to some one who would erect a house on it; that he would furnish part of the money for building the house, taking a mortgage as security; that he wanted the house to be of sufficient value to make it a good security for the mortgage; that he met Butland and Butland agreed to buy the land and erect a house on it; that Butland had no money, and it was agreed that Butland should take a deed of the land and give a mortgage of $4,000 the consideration of which was $1,500, the price of the land, and $2,500, which Blackwell was to advance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>toward the construction of the house as the work progressed; that at Butland\u2019s request the transaction was made in his wife\u2019s name; that about January 4 or 5, 1903, he, Blackwell, drew the contract printed on pages 429,430, a deed of the land from himself to Elizabeth Butland, and a mortgage back from Elizabeth Butland to himself; that he dated all the papers January 1 for convenience; that he gave the contract, the mortgage and the mortgage note to John Butland, the husband of Elizabeth, for him to obtain her signature to the papers; that a day or two afterward Butland returned the papers to him signed by Mrs. Butland; that he held the papers in abeyance until the plan of the house could be agreed upon, as he did not intend to complete the transaction until the plan was satisfactory; that he sent his man down to cut some trees and the petitioner came up to his house to see about it; that the petitioner said Butland had given him the trees, and Blackwell responded, \u201cButland don\u2019t own the land, and may never own it, and he has no right to the trees, and I forbid you from cutting any trees or doing any work on the land \u201d; that he did not see the petitioner again until after the contract was completed; that several plans of a house were considered before one was selected, which consumed several days of time; that on January 14, everything being satisfactory, Butland and the respondent Blackwell went to the registry of deeds, that Butland then signed the contract, the mortgage and the mortgage note; that the respondent Blackwell then signed and acknowledged the deed, and signed the contract, and that the deed and the mortgage deed then were recorded together; that it was all one transaction; that But-land paid nothing for the land; that he, Blackwell, did not authorize Butland to make a contract with any one to work on the house, and that he did not know that McCormack had been employed, or that he had done any work until after January 14,1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A5mW\">It appeared in evidence that John Butland died after the petition was filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-7\">The foregoing was all the material evidence in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-8\">Upon the issues for the jury the parties agreed upon the answers to issues one and four, and the judge directed the answers to issues two, three and eleven before the verdict of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>the jury and to issues nine and ten after the verdict.

The question tried was whether the lien was established as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>against the mortgage held by Blackwell, the former owner of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\">The contract of January 1, 1903, between the Butlands and Blackwell, then the owner, authorized and required the former to erect a house upon the land. By implication from the contract, Blackwell authorized the Butlands to employ either directly or through sub-contractors the necessary workmen to erect the house, and the labor thus employed was performed by his consent within the intendment of the statute. <em>Hilton </em>v. Merrill, 106 Mass. 528. <em>McCue </em>v. <em>Whitwell, </em>156 Mass. 205, and cases therein cited. The evidence as to when this contract took effect was conflicting, but the jury, in answer to the fifth and sixth questions, found that it was made and took effect before January 2,1903. The jury, in answer to the seventh and eighth questions also found that before January 14,1903, the consent of Blackwell or of some person rightly acting for him as owner was shown by acts and declarations other than the contract of January 1, 1903.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">If therefore the contract between the petitioner and the But-lands for the work was made before January 14, 1903, the lien would hold against the fee, notwithstanding the subsequent conveyances which were delivered on that day. It became therefore important to ascertain when the petitioner made his contract; and the tenth question framed for the jury was as follows: \u201c What was the date of the contract between Butland and the petitioner?\u201d It does not clearly appear in the report whether this issue actually was submitted to them or not, but it does appear that after the verdict of the jury upon the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth issues the judge directed them to answer the tenth by giving the date as January 2,1903. It is now objected by the respondent that upon the evidence the tenth issue presented a question of fact upon which it was the province of the jury to pass. And this is undoubtedly true. But the answer is that so far as material to the case the jury in the verdict upon the four issues upon which they returned a verdict had indicated their view on the tenth issue. It is to be borne in mind that the evidence as to whether before January 14, the time when Blackwell\u2019s deed to Mrs. Butland and the mortgage back were delivered, Blackwell or any one acting for him as owner had any knowledge that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>this work was being performed by the petitioner was conflicting, the petitioner testifying that Blackwell had such knowledge and Blackwell testifying to the contrary; and it was left to the jury to find where the truth lay. They found that before January 14, 1903, Blackwell had such knowledge. This by necessary implication showed that the jury found that the petitioner\u2019s contract was made and the work begun before January 14, 1903, or in other words that the jury believed the petitioner. When by their verdict so much had been made clear, it was plain that it was immaterial on what particular day of January before the fourteenth the contract was made. It was enough if it was made before the fourteenth. Moreover, in this proceeding it was within the power of the judge to withdraw from the consideration of the jury an issue which had become immaterial by reason of the verdict given; and the action of the judge in ordering the verdict may be regarded in substance as such a withdrawal. In any event the respondent was in no way harmed by the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Whatever errors, if any, there were in directing the answers to the other questions have become immaterial by reason of the verdict of the jury upon those decided by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">The question of variance in the pleading <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> does not seem to have been raised at the trial, and we do not think it is open to the respondents on this report. The result is that the lien is established as against the mortgage and a sale decreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-15\"><em> </em>The variance relied on by the respondents was between the allegation in the petition, that Elizabeth Bntland was the owner of the land when the petitioner made the contract under which the work was done, and the answer to the first issue, agreed upon by the parties, that Elizabeth Butland was not the owner of the land when she made the contract with the petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
