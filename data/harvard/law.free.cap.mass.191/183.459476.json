By a subsequent agreement signed by the parties the contract was extended for three years. The stock was not readily salable and had no value in the open market until the expiration of the extended time and up to the date of the writ. The testatrix died and the plaintiff was appointed before the expiration of the period of the guaranty, and it was agreed that the plaintiff acted seasonably in demanding performance of the guaranty and in bringing his action. <em>Held, </em>that the fact that the guaranty contained no words of succession was immaterial as without them the right of action passed to the plaintiff as executor, that the guaranty did not expire with the death of the testatrix as it was continued in force by an express mutual agreement to a date named, and that the facts warranted a finding for the plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-9\">Contract upon a guaranty in writing against loss on account of a purchase of certain stock given by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix.

The case was submitted to the Superior Court upon agreed facts which contained the stipulation that, if the defendant was liable, judgment was to be entered for the plaintiff for $2,000. The presiding judge ordered judgment to be entered for the plaintiff in the sum agreed and reported the case to this court. If the defendant is liable the judgment is to be <em>affirmed; </em>otherwise judgment is to be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">We think that the judgment should be affirmed. The defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ant contends that the guaranty was to the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix personally and that it expired with her. If that is not so he further contends, if we understand him, that the guaranty should be construed as in force for a reasonable time only and that that also expired at her death. He relies for these contentions on <em>Rotch </em>v. French, 176 Mass. 1, where the opinion it should be noted was by a majority of the court. The guaranty runs, it is true, to Emma L. Phillbrook, the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix, without mentioning her heirs, executors, administrators or assigns. But the guaranty is an absolute one \u201c against loss of principal on said purchase of said stock,\u201d differing in that respect from the guaranty in <em>Rotch </em>v. French, supra, and there is no reason why it should not pass as a part of her estate to her executor. The fact that there are no words of succession in the guaranty does not prevent it from passing since the executor succeeds <em>qua </em>executor to the personal estate of his testator and the rights of action growing out of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\">There is no ground for the defendant\u2019s contention that the guaranty continued in force for a reasonable time only. By mutual agreement between the defendant and the plaintiff it was extended to January 31, 1903. The plaintiff\u2019s testatrix died December 26, 1902., and on or about March 30, 1903, the plaintiff demanded of the defendant payment of $2,000, which he claimed to be due the estate under the guaranty. The agreed facts state that the stock mentioned in the agreement \u201c was not readily salable and had no value in the open market \u201d and that that condition of affairs continued to the date of the plaintiff\u2019s writ. And it is also agreed \u201c that the plaintiff was not personally guilty of laches in making such demand or in the bringing of his' writ.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">It is plain we think that the finding of the presiding judge in favor of the plaintiff was well warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
