Davis was called as a witness by the defendants, and qualified as an expert. On his cross-examination he was asked the following question: \u201c Holding the piece of timber when you are doing edge planing against the knife in the case of an inexperienced man do you regard that work as dangerous?\u201d On objection by the defendants the judge excluded the question, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-6\">One Marshall, who is mentioned in the opinion, was called by the plaintiff as a witness in rebuttal, and testified that at the time he and the plaintiff went to work on the planer there was no guard about the machine, and that.he never saw one there at any time before the accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then offered to prove by this witness, as tending to contradict the defendant Emery J. Davis, that that defendant made a guard for the machine on the day after the accident, and that the guard then made was the only guard that was seen about this machine while the witness was employed in the defendants\u2019 factory. On objection by the defendants the judge excluded the question, and the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-8\">At the close of all the evidence the plaintiff asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-9\">1. If the negligence of the defendants and the negligence of a fellow servant contributed to the injury of the plaintiff, while the plaintiff was himself in the exercise of due care, in the performance of his work, he may recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-10\">2.

If the plaintiff was set at work by the defendants in an unsafe and dangerous place, without sufficient instruction, the jury would be authorized to find negligence on the part of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-12\">The judge refused to make any of these rulings, and ordered a verdict for the defendants.

The plaintiff was eighteen or nineteen years old, and was hired as \u201ca lumper\u201d at $5 a week and had worked round the shop about three weeks, helping, tying up bundles of sheathing, piling lumber, sweeping and running errands. He never had worked on the planer before, or, as he testified, seen it in operation, and was uninstructed in regard to working upon it. Marshall picked up a plank, called a door frame side, and placed the edge, which was about two inches wide, against the planer to straighten it. This left a part of the knives uncovered. There was a guide or gauge on one side of the machine, and while the plaintiff was assisting Marshall to hold the plank against the guide \u201cit jumped, kicked or flew from under the plaintiff\u2019s hand,\u201d and his hand went into the knives of the planer receiving the injuries complained of. The accident happened within a few moments after the plaintiff had been set to work on the machine. \u201c There was uncontradicted evidence that the buzz planer was a dangerous machine when used without a guard to do wood planing upon; that when knots, knurls and other irregularities came in contact with the knives, the board was liable to kick up or jump; this action of the board had a strong tendency to throw the hand of the operator against the knives, but an experienced man could get his hands out of the way and protect himself. The evidence was uncontradicted that knots, knurls and other things liable to make the board jump were not always visible on the surface of the board, and that there was no guard on the machine when the plaintiff worked upon it. . . . The plaintiff testified without contradiction that he had no knowledge of the tendency of the board or plank to jump or kick.\u201d He also testified that he knew that there were knives there and that if he put his hand on them he would get hurt. While the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as reported in the bill of exceptions would seem in some respects to have been disingenuous, it is plain, we think, that there was evidence that would have warranted the jury in finding that he was set to work on a dangerous machine without such warning or instruction as he should have had. He knew that there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>knives and that if his hand got into them it would be injured. But he did not know, or at least there was evidence tending to show that he did not, of the liability of a board or plank to kick or jump while being planed, and of the danger arising therefrom. It cannot be said, we think, as matter of law, that the risk was an obvious one, or that he assumed it. <em>Joyce </em>v. <em>American Writing Paper Co. </em>184 Mass. 230. <em>Jarvis </em>v. <em>Coes Wrench Co. </em>177 Mass. 170. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Wason Manuf. Co. </em>135 Mass. 294. <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Ludlow Manuf. Co. </em>162 Mass. 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">There was also evidence tending to show that guards were in general use on such machines, and that a guard could have been used as the machine was being operated at the time of the accident, and would have served as a protection to an inexperienced person. It cannot be said, therefore, adopting language used in <em>Wheeler v. Wason Manuf. Co., supra, </em>296, that the jury would not be warranted in finding that the planer was in an unsafe and improper condition for the plaintiff, a beginner in the. use of such machinery, to be put to work upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">We see no error in the exclusion of the evidence offered to show that a guard for the machine was made the day after the accident and thereafter used. <em>Whelton </em>v. <em>West End Street Railway, </em>172 Mass. 555. <em>Lacey </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>168 Mass. 479. And we think that the question put to the expert might properly be excluded by the presiding judge in the exercise of his discretion. But for reasons above stated we think that the judge was wrong in directing a verdict for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">\n<em>Pxceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
