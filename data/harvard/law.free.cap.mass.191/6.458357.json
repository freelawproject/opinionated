Credit was given for payments made on account by the defendant amounting to $136, and a balance of $57.50 was alleged to be due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-24\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Fox, </em>J., without a jury. It appeared that the last payment made by the defendant was made on October 10, 1903; that the plaintiff delivered at first twenty-one volumes of the first edition, and sixteen volumes of the second edition, and afterwards from time to time delivered volumes 17 to 23 inclusive of the second . edition. Volumes 24 to 28 inclusive although published never were delivered. The remaining volumes necessary to complete the set of thirty-two volumes were not published when the action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-25\">The defendant asked the judge to rule:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-26\">\u201c 1. That the contract was an entire contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-27\">\u201c 2.

That upon all the evidence the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-4\">The judge refused to rule as requested and found for the plaintiff in the sum of $58.82, which was the full amount claimed by the plaintiff. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-5\">In support of his exceptions the defendant contended that the contract was an entire one for the delivery of the second edition of the encyclopaedia to be completed in not less than thirty-two volumes for which on the delivery of the whole he was to pay at the rate of $7.50 per volume ; that he did not agree to pay for any part of the second edition less than the whole, and that the payments made by him really were made in advance in anticipation of the delivery of the whole work.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-6\"><em>C.

The balance sued for was due even if the memorandum on the back in regard to payments be considered as constituting a part of the contract. The rulings requested were rightly refused, and we discover no error in the manner in which the judge dealt with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
