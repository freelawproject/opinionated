Writ dated October 11, 1902.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-3\">At the trial in the Superior Court before DeQourcy, J. the plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that he was driving in an ordinary delivery wagon a horse which was kind, easily managed and not afraid of the cars; that he left his horse unhitched on the southerly side of Salem Street in front of a house of a customer, which he entered for the purpose of taking orders; that he sometimes used a weight; that he remained in this house about ten minutes, during which time he did nothing with reference to the horse, nor did he see the horse; that while he was in the house the horse walked across the road to the northerly side, and across the track of the defendant, where he proceeded to graze just below the driveway upon the premises of one Horne; that he never knew the horse to move before; that the hind wheels and the rear portion of the body of the wagon were upon the track of the defendant while the horse was standing and feeding from a tree, grazing; that a car of the defendant was due to pass at that point shortly after the plaintiff entered the house ; that the plaintiff knew that the cars of the defendant passed that point every half hour; that the track for some distance toward Haverhill, from whence the car came, was curved and on a down grade but the motorman had an opportunity to see the plaintiff\u2019s wagon at a distance of three hundred feet before reaching the place of collision; that the car continued over this distance at a considerable rate of speed, one witness saying that he held on to his seat and told the conductor that the car was going too fast; that the car struck the wagon and ran a distance of eighty feet or two car lengths beyond the point of collision; that the horse of the plaintiff was killed and the wagon demolished.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-4\">One of the passengers on the car testified that he saw the plaintiff\u2019s team while the car was passing a pole three hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>feet before reaching the place of the accident. The motorman, called by the defendant, testified that he saw the wagon on the track while the car was approaching on the curve a distance of two hundred and fifty feet from the place of the accident; that he did all that he could to stop the car after he saw the wagon on the track; but that the car was going so fast that he could not stop it before it struck the wagon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-3\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that the plaintiff could not recover. The judge refused to rule as requested, and submitted the case to the jury. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $325 ; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-4\"><em>C. H. Poor &amp; E. B. Fuller, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-5\"><em>J. J. Ryan, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b350-6\">Lathrop, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A15\">If we assume in favor of the plaintiff that there was some evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant\u2019s motorman in not stopping the car sooner than he did, we are of opinion that the plaintiff did not sustain the burden of proof, which was upon him, of showing that he himself was in the exercise of due care, in leaving the horse unfastened in any way for ten minutes by the side of a street when he knew that a car was about due. The plaintiff sometimes used a weight, and it is evident that if one had been used in this case the accident might not have happened. While there was evidence that the horse was kind, easily managed and not afraid of cars, yet the accident was caused not by the horse being frightened, but by his wandering across the street and the track of the defendant, and grazing upon some trees, leaving the wagon upon the track. During the ten minutes while the plaintiff was absent, he remained in a house, during which time he did nothing with reference to the horse, nor did he see the horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The case differs from <em>Southworth </em>v. <em>Old Colony &amp; Newport Railway, </em>105 Mass. 342, upon which the plaintiff chiefly relies. In that case the driver was not accustomed to hitch his horse, and was absent only four or five minutes. The street where he left the horse was not one where cars were passing. The railroad crossing was on another street, and from fifty to one hundred rods distant from the place where the horse was left.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">We do not intend to decide that momentarily leaving a horse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>unhitched upon a street, is negligence as a matter of law; but we are of opinion that under the circumstances of the case before us, the instruction requested should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
