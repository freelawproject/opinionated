L. c. 19, \u00a7 23, cannot be maintained against the mayor of that city, as by St. 1885, e. 323, \u00a7 4, the control of all buildings used for the police of that city is given to the board of police.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Petition, filed August 7 and amended September 19, 1905, against the mayor of Boston, alleging that the petitioner was a veteran of the Civil War within the meaning of R.
