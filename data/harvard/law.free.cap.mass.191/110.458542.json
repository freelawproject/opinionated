I think the note came due on the 19th.

The defendant asked the judge to rule that on the evidence the plaintiff as a matter of law was not entitled to recover. The judge refused so to rule, and the defendant excepted. The judge instructed the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFYv\">\u201cI don\u2019t know as I can say much to you on this subject, but under the pleadings it is admitted that the notes were signed by the defendant. She signed the notes as surety for the railroad company as described in the notes, and under that signature she bound herself not only jointly to pay the notes but severally upon demand, and therefore it is not necessary for the plaintiff in this suit to bring a suit against all of the parties, that is, join them together as parties defendant, but the plaintiff has a right to bring suit against this defendant alone, and it has seen fit to do so, so you would necessarily find under this proof that this defendant did sign the note. She said by the terms of that note that she would pay the note on demand, and some evideuce has been offered here of the demand. It is for you to say whether that evidence is sufficient to satisfy you that a proper demand was made in accordance with the terms of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AKk\">\u201c If there is nothing here to meet that proposition, and you are satisfied that the demand was made, then the plaintiff is en~ titled to recover against the defendant. There has been no evideuce introduced here on the part of the defendant to show that any other payments have been made than the payments indorsed on the notes themselves. That is, the payment on the part of the principal on one of the notes to the amount of $2,400 and the payment of interest. How it is for you, when you retire to your jury room, if you are satisfied that a proper demand has been made, to assess the amount of damages that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, and the damages will be the amounts of the notes unpaid and the amount of interest due upon such balance from the date of the note at the amount of six per cent up to the date of the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A1y\">\u201cI think I have given you all the information that is necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>in connection with the case, unless there are some suggestions ..that the counsel desire to make.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-4\">The defendant excepted to so much of the charge as instructed \u2022the jury that the defendant bound herself with the rest jointly and severally to pay the note on demand, and to so much of the charge as instructed the jury that the effect of the notes was that the defendant said she would pay the notes on demand, and to so much of the charge as instructed the jury that it was for them to say that there was evidence that a proper demand was made on the defendant, and that that was a question of fact to be left to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-5\">The jury found for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b136-6\"><em>E. L. </em>Marchant, for the defendant, submitted a brief.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b136-7\"><em>C. F. Choate, Jr., </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b136-8\">Knowlton, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANx\">The promissory notes declared on were signed by the Hampshire and Worcester Street Railway Company as principal, and by the defendant and two other persons as sureties. In each of them the signers \u201c jointly and severally promised to pay \u201d the amount stated. The defendant, therefore, became liable individually and severally, as well as jointly, for the payment. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>5 Mass. 358. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>6 Mass. 519, 523. <em>Union Bank </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>8 Met. 504, 510. In this particular the fact that she signed as a surety does not affect her primary liability to the holder of the notes, but only shows the relations of the makers to one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">The notes were payable at the Fourth National Bank, Boston, and, from a time about three months after the delivery of them, they were at this bank for nearly five months, awaiting payment. Copies of letters written by the plaintiff to the defendant were put in evidence, which well warranted a finding by the jury that the defendant was notified of a demand for payment of the notes at the place where they were payable. Without intimating that any formal demand was necessary, this was ample to justify the verdict against the defendant for the amount remaining unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">The oral testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s treasurer was competent to explain an ambiguity in the letter of November 19, written to the defendant. Without explanation, the language of the letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>might suggest a possibility of an arrangement with the principal to extend the time of payment without the consent of the defendant, which might discharge her as a surety. The testimony tended to show that the proposition referred to was made by the defendant\u2019s husband in her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"AYR\">The case rightly was submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"AhO\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
