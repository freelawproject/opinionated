Writ dated August 31, 1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-9\">At the trial in the Superior Court before <em>Sherman, </em>J. the defendant at the close of the evidence asked the judge to rule that there was no evidence of any defect which could have been discovered by the most careful inspection, and that on all the evidence the verdict must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-10\">The judge refused to make these rulings and submitted the case to the jury together with the question \u201cWas there a crack or opening in the seat arm which could have been seen or observed, prior to the accident?\u201d The jury answered \u201cYes,\u201d and returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,437.50. By agreement of the parties the judge reported the case for determination by this court. If the ruling of the judge was right, judgment was to be entered upon the verdict; but if a verdict for the defendant should have been ordered, judgment was to be entered for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b418-11\"><em>S.

She was injured by the back of the seat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>in front of her falling on her knee. The fall of the back of the seat was caused by the breaking of the metallic armature (an inch and a quarter thick), by which it was attached to the post on the side of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">The plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified that after the accident they examined the break, and half of it was bright and the other half was \u201c rusty,\u201d \u201c black,\u201d \u201c dull,\u201d and \u201c corroded.\u201d In our opinion this evidence warranted a finding that the arm was cracked before the accident. We are also of opinion that if it was cracked as the testimony indicated, the jury were warranted in finding that the crack would have been seen on inspection. The case of <em>Harnois </em>v. <em>Cutting, </em>174 Mass. 398, relied on by the defendant, was the case of a flaw, not of a crack.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
