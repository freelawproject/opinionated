The regulation of the State board of health alleged to have been violated was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-12\">\u201c No person shall enter upon Elder\u2019s Pond, situated in the Town of Lakeville, or upon Assawompsett Pond, situated in the Towns of Lakeville and Middleboro, said ponds being used by the City -of Taunton as sources of water supply, for the purpose of cutting and taking ice, or cut or take ice from either of said ponds, without a written permit, signed by the Board of Water Commissioners of the City of Taunton, stating the time and place for which such permission is given.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-13\">The case was submitted to the jury upon an agreed state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>ment of facts. It was agreed that Assawompsett Pond is a great pond, and was used by the city of Taunton as a source of water supply, and that the State board of health on June 14, 1902, made the regulation printed above, complying with the provisions of R. L. c. 75, \u00a7 114, in regard to publication of notice; that the defendant, without obtaining permission from the water commissioners of the city of Taunton as required by the regulation, entered upon the pond on the day alleged for the purpose of obtaining ice to be used for domestic purposes and cut without- such permit about five tons of ice, and that in doing so he did not in any way affect the purity of the water or do any act that tended to cause pollution of any kind whatever, and that his act in no way interfered with the city\u2019s use of the water; that he had the right of access, to the pond and entered upon it using proper care. It further was agreed that at the time the defendant was cutting ice other persons were cutting ice upon the pond, having permits from the water commissioners of the city of Taunton, and that, although the acts done by the defendant did not in any way tend to pollute or affect the quality of the water, the cutting of ice on the pond under certain conditions might pollute the water of the pond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b407-5\">The defendant asked the judge to order a verdict of not guilty. This he refused to do, and instructed the jury that upon the facts agreed they would be warranted in finding the defendant guilty of the offence charged in the complaint. The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-6\"><em>E. C. Bumpus, (J. B. Sullivan, Jr., </em>with him,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-7\"><em>T. E. Grover, </em>District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b407-8\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Adh\">The regulation here in question was made under St. 1897, c. 510, \u00a7 1, (now R. L. c. 75, \u00a7 113,) which gives the State board of health \u201c authority to make rules, regulations and orders for the purpose of preventing the pollution and securing the sanitary protection \u201d of ponds used <em>inter alia </em>as sources of water supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">It is not necessary to decide whether the principle acted on in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sisson, </em>189 Mass. 247, and in <em>Brodbine </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>182 Mass. 598, would enable the State board acting under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>this statute to make a regulation requiring a permit to cut ice on such ponds.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\">However that may be, the act under which the regulation here in question was made does not authorize the board to delegate the granting or withholding of such a permit to another board, in this case the board of water commissioners of the city of Taunton. For this reason the regulation in question is void, and it does not become necessary to consider the other objections to it raised by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
