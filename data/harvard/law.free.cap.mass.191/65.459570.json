Contract.</em>\n</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b87-8\">In an action of contract for the non-delivery of a barge load of coal, in which the defendants set up the statute of frauds, the plaintiff put in evidence the following alleged memorandum in writing of the contract, addressed to one who acted in the transaction for J. M., the plaintiff, and signed by the defendants: \u201c Dear Sir : Confirming the agreement made by our Mr. O. with you today. We have entered an order for a barge load of anthracite coal, one bin each of egg, stove and nutt, to be shipped to J. M., East Boston. We are to bill this coal to Mr. M. at \u00a78.50 per ton f. o. b. at Perth Amboy, and are to pay you a commission of 25c. per ton. The coal to be paid for cash on delivery of the bill of lading. We have bought this coal with the understanding that it is to be loaded next week, and have engaged a barge of about 800 tons\u2019 capacity from the B. L., Transportation Co. at \u00a71.25 freight to transport same. Please get Mr. M. to send us a written confirmation of this order.\u201d There was evidence that an oral contract of sale had been made in accordance with the terms named in the memorandum. <em>Held, </em>that the memorandum was one of a sale and not of a mere offer to sell, and was sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-9\">- Contract for alleged breach of an oral contract to sell to the plaintiff a barge load of about eight hundred tons of anthracite coal for the price of $8.50 per ton to be delivered by the defendants free on board a vessel at Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and to be loaded during the week beginning November 30,1902. Writ dated January 24, 1903.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-10\">The answer contained a special denial and set up the statute of frauds. At the trial in the Superior Court before <em>Hardy, </em>J. it appeared that at the time the contract was made the plaintiff was engaged in the retail coal business in Boston, and the defendants were copartners engaged in the business of buying and selling coal in Boston under the firm name of F. H. Odiorne and Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-11\">Odiorne Swain, one of the defendants, called as a witness by the plaintiff, testified that he was one of the partners in the firm of F. H. Odiorne and Company, and that he and one Browne attended to the business of the firm together; that between October, 1902, and January 15, 1903, he purchased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>only one cargo of coal, and that that cargo consisted of eight hundred tons of anthracite coal, egg, stove and nut mixed, which he bought from Meeker and Company of New York at $8 per ton f. o. b. at Perth Amboy, N. J.; that his firm had an offer of this coal from Meeker and Company, and that with his approval, his firm acting as brokers, his salesman, one O\u2019Brien, offered the same for $8.50 per ton f. o. b. at Perth Amboy; that the offer was made to one Betteley, who reported it to the plaintiff; that upon O\u2019Brien\u2019s report to the witness of his interview with Betteley the witness wrote a letter to Betteley, which was produced, identified by the witness and was admitted against the objection of the defendants. The letter was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-5\">\u201c F. H.

The coal to be paid for cash on delivery of the bill of lading. We have bought this coal with the understanding that it is to be loaded next week, and have engaged a barge of about 800 tons\u2019 capacity from the Bee Line Transportation Co. at $1.25 freight to transport same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-16\">\u201c Please get Mr. Morrison to send us a written confirmation of this order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-17\">\u201c Yours truly,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-18\">\u201c F. H. Odiorne <em>&amp; </em>Co.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-19\">The witness then was asked, \u201c You state you have entered an order for a barge load of anthracite coal. Where did you enter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>that order, on your books ? \u201d and answered \u201c Made a memorandum on our books.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-5\">The witness further testified that he did not remember whether he actually accepted the offer of Meeker and Company before writing this letter, or whether this was done after the writing of the letter; that the two transactions were as nearly as possible at the same time; that he had \u201c a complete agreement, an agreement that was completed at some time with Meeker to furnish me that coal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-6\">The witness testified that with reference to writing and making the entry on his books, he thought that he followed out his usual custom when making a contract for the sale of coal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-7\">He then was asked, \u201cAnd that wording that you have put in there 6 We have entered an order for a barge load of anthracite coal,\u2019 and followed up by the entry which you made on your books, is your usual course when you make a sale of coal, is it not?\u201d and answered, \u201cWe do not have any usual custom about that, sir. We do that in different ways, at different times, under different conditions.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-8\">Betteley to whom the letter printed above was addressed testified that he was a coal dealer in Boston ; that on November 28, 1902, O\u2019Brien, who is named in the letter, representing F. H. Odi\u00f3me and Company came to his office, and Betteley, acting for the plaintiff, made with O\u2019Brien an oral contract for the purchase of the coal on the terms named in the letter; that he told O\u2019Brien that he wanted a memorandum of the sale and that O\u2019Brien brought him the letter printed above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-9\">He further testified that he notified the plaintiff over the telephone in the presence of O\u2019Brien that the sale had been consummated; that a day or two afterwards he called at the office of F. H. Odiorne and Company and asked the defendant Swain what were the prospects of shipping that cargo he had sold to Morrison, and that he was told by Swain that the coal would be loaded in a few days; that Swain asked him if he had an acknowledgment from Morrison, and he said that Morrison had telephoned him twice and that Morrison wanted the coal; that when asked whether he had an acknowledgment in writing he said that he had not, and that Swain said, \u201c Why don\u2019t he send it over?\u201d and that the witness replied, \u201cWell, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>presume he will, that is all right \u201d; that that was all the conversation they had. When the witness was asked whether Swain made any reply to that he answered that he offered no objection ; that a few days afterwards he saw O\u2019Brien in relation to the cargo, and in reply to his inquiries was told that they were waiting for the barge to get there and the cargo to be shipped.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-5\">At the close of the evidence the judge ruled, as stated in the opinion, that there was no sufficient memorandum to satisfy the statute of frauds, and ordered a verdict for the defendants, stating \u201c The evidence to my mind is convincing that this was really an offer on the part of the defendants in reference to this cargo of coal, and the terms of the contract had not been sufficiently shown here, by the contract put in evidence, \u2014 the writing,\u2014 to comply with the statute, therefore, I shall have to order a verdict for the defendants.\u201d The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b90-6\"><em>E. E. </em>Blodgett, <em>(R. E. Goodwin </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b90-7\"><em>H. N. </em>Shepard, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b90-8\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4D\">This is an action of contract to recover damages for failure to deliver a cargo of coal. The question is whether there was a sufficient memorandum of the contract within the statute of frauds. The judge ruled that there was not, and directed a verdict for the defendants, and the case is here on exceptions by the plaintiff to this ruling. We think that the ruling was wrong, and that the case should have been submitted to the jury under proper instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">There was testimony tending to show that a sale was made as alleged, and the jury should have been instructed that if they found that, taking all of the circumstances into account, a sale was made as alleged, then the writing relied on constituted a sufficient memorandum within the statute. As was said of the memorandum in <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>Flagler, </em>9 Allen, 474, so it may be said of the memorandum here: \u201cThe nature and description of the merchandise, the quantity sold, the price to be paid therefor, the terms of payment and the time within which the article was to be delivered, are all clearly set forth.\u201d According to the terms of the memorandum, the coal was to be shipped and billed to John Morrison (the plaintiff), thus clearly indicating him as the purchaser, and the memorandum was signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>by the defendants, the parties to be charged thereby. It is to be regarded also, we think, as a memorandum of a sale, and not of an offer to sell. It states that \u201c we have entered an order for a barge load of anthracite coal \u201d; and one of the defendants testified, though subsequently qualifying it, that in making this entry \u201c he thought that he followed out his usual custom when making a contract for the sale of coal.\u201d It also states that, \u201c we have bought this coal with the understanding that it is to be loaded next week, and have engaged a barge of about 800 tons\u2019 capacity from the Bee Line Transportation Co. at $1.25 freight to transport same,\u201d\u2014circumstances which are more consistent, to say the least, with an actual sale than with an offer to sell. The concluding sentence in which the defendants ask Betteley, to whom the writing containing the memorandum is addressed, to \u201cget Mr. Morrison to send us a written confirmation of this order,\u201d can only be regarded, we think, as a request to him to do what he there is asked to do. Moreover, if the written confirmation there asked for could be regarded as in the nature of a condition precedent, there was evidence which would have warranted the jury in finding that the defendants were content with an oral confirmation by the plaintiff and waived a confirmation in writing. The objection that the sale was to Betteley because the writing containing the memorandum was addressed to him does not need extended consideration. As already observed the memorandum clearly designates Morrison as the party to whom the coal was sold, and there was evidence tending to show that Betteley was acting only as a broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
