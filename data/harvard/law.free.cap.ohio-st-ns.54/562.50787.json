The .Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company answered, setting up several defenses, which need not be particularly noticed here; the pleadings are quite voluminous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-6\">After the issues were made' up and the cause tried in the court of common pleas, it was taken on appeal to the circuit court, where it was tried at the October term, 1887.

And it is further ordered, adjudged and decreed that the said stockholders shall pay to the said William D. Hamilton the said moneys hereinbefore found due to him, amounting on the first day of this term to the sum of twenty-three thousand one hundred and seventy-eight ($23,17(8.00) dollars, with interest thereon at the rate of seven per cent, per annum, in like manner as the same may hereafter be apportioned among such of them defendants in this case as are solvent.

The case is reported in 48 Ohio St., 218. Afterwards the cause was again taken to the circuit court on appeal from certain proceedings had in the court of common pleas, and on the 23d day of December, 1893, by leave, of the circuit court, the plaintiff filed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>amendment to his amended petition, in which it was alleged, in substance, that the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company was the owner of the stock which, in the original and amended petitions it was alleged belonged to Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co.; and the amendment asked that the liability thereon be assessed against that railroad company. To that amendment the railroad company pleaded the former judgment of the circuit court in bar. The reply thereto was in the nature of a demurrer. At its October term, 1894, the circuit court made and entered on its record a finding to the effect that, at the commencement of the action, the Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. stock belonged to the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, which, added to its other stock made it the owner of 17,801 shares of stock of the insolvent corporation, upon which number of shares, so determined, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company was held liable to be assessed for the payment of the creditors of the insolvent corporation, and judgment was rendered against it accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-4\">Various other findings were made and judgments rendered, which we do not deem it necessary to further refer to here. The Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company excepted to the finding\u2019 and judgment against it, and prosecutes error here to obtain a reversal.

By sections twelve and fourteen the officers of the company, and their powers and duties; are to be fixed by the president and directors, or a majority of them. The .powers and authority of the corporation are also fixed within certain specific limits.

The judgment below should be reversed because: 1. The former j udgment (that which was affirmed in 48th Ohio State) was either final or interlocutory. It was treated as both.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-7\">2. If final, nothing could be done below except only to execute it. It was error, therefore, if final, to make new parties either of defendant stockholders or co-plaintiff creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-8\">It was also error, if final, to change the issue as to the stock held by Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-9\">These errors were prejudicial because: (1) without new parties the case could not proceed; and (2) if the judgment had stood as final that Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. owned the stock standing in their name, then Shields, Evans &amp; Co., as the assignors of that stock, would have been liable to assessment upon it, they being in court and Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. beyond the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-10\">The claim of W. D. Hamilton would, in that event, have been cancelled by his obligation as a member of the firm of Shields, Evans ds Co. to pay the assessment on this stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>The claim of Smith would have been cancelled because he took his notes after maturity and, therefore, with full notice of all equities. As a result the obligation of Shields, Evans <em>&amp; </em>Co. to pay the assessment on this stock would apply to him because he, so taking his notes, stood in their shoes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-6\">II. When the court below, as to these matters, treated the former judgment as interlocutory and allowed the change of issue as to the Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. stock to be made, it opened up the whole case. It was competent, therefore, for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad company, in defending against this new claim, to raise all defenses it might have. It did then make and establish as a new defense, under the general issue, want of corporate power. The court below expressly so found.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-7\">We claim, with respect to this question, that it was the duty of the plaintiff below, when he showed \u2018the stock was held by a corporation, to go further and affirmatively show that the corporation had the corporate power so to hold it. But, however, this may be, the charter of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company is in evidence, and we call attention to it as showing, not only want of corporate power as found by the court below, but also want of authority and power in the officials of the company, even its board of directors, to purchase and hold the stock on which it is sought to hold this company liable to the assessment in this action. The powers of these respective officials are defined in the charter and it shows no such power in any of them. But the rule is that a corporation acts by its board of directors and only by its board. There is no attempt to show that the board of directors of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Baltimore and Ohio Company ever authorized anything with respect to this Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-5\">There was not sufficient testimony, therefore, to support the conclusion that the stock was held in trust for the B. &amp; O. Company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-6\">But, if there had been, it was error to assess the B. &amp; O. Company on the stock in the name of Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co., because the court will not look beyond the legal holder of stock to assess the beneficial owner, except only where the stock has been put out of the name of the real owner, for some fraudulent or improper purpose. It was so held in the case of <em>Henkle </em>v. <em>The Salem Manufacturing Co., </em>39 Ohio State, 547.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-7\">There is no pretense of evidence or claim that there was any fraudulent purposb on the part of anybody in connection with the placing of this stock in the name of Drexel, Morgan <em>&amp; </em>Co.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-8\">It was error to assess the B. <em>&amp; </em>O. Company on this stock, in the second place, because, not having this stock in the name of the B. <em>&amp; </em>O. Company, it never held itself out as owner to creditors, and never induced credit on that account, and, therefore, never misled anybody. In <em>Harpold\u2019s case, </em>46 Ohio State, 397, it was held that Harpoid should be assessed on the stock there in controversy, although he had sold it and asked that it be transferred, and had done all that was incumbent on him to have it transferred, on the ground, that remaining in his name, he was thereby held out to creditors as the owner of the stock, and they had a right to assume that he was the stockholder and liable to assessment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-9\">The change of issue as to this stock opened up the case also, if it were not already open, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>question as to the solvency or insolvency of. the Newark, Somerset &amp; Straitsville Railroad Company. We are told that this question was settled by the former judgment. We do not think so. The record shows that no such question was presented to or passed upon by this court in the case reported in the 48th Ohio State. We understand the rule to be as announced by this court in the <em>Pugh case, </em>43d Ohio State, page 121; that the court is bound by only such questions as are presented to it, considered by it and passed upon by it, and that it is not bound by a question that only \u201clurks in the record.\u201d The question of the insolvency of the Newark, Somerset &amp; Straitsville Railroad Company was not presented to, considered by or passed upon by this court. But, if it had been, the B. &amp; O. Company.had a right to make that' defense when it was sought, after the case had been sent down from this court, to change the issue and increase its liabiity,' and it did make that defense, and the record\" shows that it established that defense. The general finding of insolvency in special finding is cancelled by the specific findings of fact made at the same time, which show that the road was still in operation; that <em>it had not been placed in the hands of a receiver or assignee, but was a going concern, with a la/rg&amp; rental and a valuable </em>\u25a0equity' <em>of redemption. </em>There is nothing to controvert any of these facts. There was no excuse, therefore, for the bringing of this action against stockholders before judgment recovered and execution returned <em>nulla bona.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-7\">But, if it was insolvent when this suit was brought in December, 1881, it had been equally insolvent for more than six years prior thereto, as shown by the record. .For the record discloses' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>that from and after the execution of the lease to the B, &amp; O. Company, January 1st, 1872, down to the time of the bringing of this suit in 1881, there was no change whatever in the debt of this company, except only by the execution of the notes sued upon in this case which are not, for reasons to be given, to be considered in determining the question of insolvency. On the contrary, the road was constantly improving and developing and becoming more valuable. In other words, it was more insolvent when these notes were executed in December, 1872, than it was when the petition was filed in December, 1881. The right of creditors to enforce the stockholders\u2019 liability was, therefore, barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b602-5\">III. The only question decided by this court in 48 Ohio State, pertinent to the present inquiry was that the equities between assignor and assignee stockholders should be adjusted in the final judgment. That holding had reference to the fact, among others, that Shields,. Evans <em>&amp; </em>Co. were assignors of the stock on which it is now sought to assess the B. &amp; O. Company. These equities were not adjusted by the court below as required by law, because: (1) The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company purchased its stock with the distinct understanding and agreement, as set forth in the lease and in the letters and telegrams that passed between the companies, that there was not and should not be created any floating debt of the Newark, Somerset &amp; Straitsville Railroad Company. Shields, Evans &amp; Co., the assignors of this stock, were parties to that agreement, and they got the full benefit of the results of the agreement; (2) in view of these stipulations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>agreements it was expressly agreed when these notes were executed that they should be paid only out of the earnings of the road under the lease, and subject to the redemption of the preferred stock. (3) The issuing of the notes in view of all this, was a fraud on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company. (4) Smith, the plaintiff, bought after maturity and, therefore, with full notice, while Hamilton, a member of the firm of Shields, Evans &amp; Co., and a director of the Newark, Somerset &amp; Straitsville Railroad Company, had full notice from the beginning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-6\">In adjusting equities, the court below should, in view of all this, have held that the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company took this stock from Shields, Evans <em>&amp; </em>Co., under such circumstances as to preclude any implied undertaking to pay, on account of its statutory liability, the notes which had been so issued to Shields, Evans &amp; Co. The exact opposite was the truth in so far as the circumstances make the agreement with respect to the matter namely: That there should be no liability to pay any debt previously contracted to Shields, Evans &amp; Co., or anybody else \u2014 the agreement being that there should not be any such debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-7\">IV. The neglect and omission of plaintiff to make all solvent stockholders parties was fatal, and the petition should have been dismissed on that account. The statutory provision on the subject of stockholders\u2019 liability'provides that all the stockholders shall' be jointly liable in an action where all are sued. It is prejudicial error to a stockholder of a corporation to omit any solvent stockholder in a suit brought to enforce the stockholders\u2019 liability, although the assessment of those who are brought into court may be propor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>tionately reduced on account of the omission to sue those who are not parties, because the debt, to the extent it is not satisfied, remains over against the corporation, and the stockholder who is assessed may be again made to suffer by the taking of the corporation\u2019s property. It is not a sufficient answer, therefore, whore solvent stockholders are omitted, to say eith r that only a few were omitted or that those who were sued were assessed less on that account.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-5\">V. The common ownership, at the time of the execution of these notes, of both the notes sued upon and the stock now s ught to be assessed, cancels the one the other. The liability of stock to assessment attaches at the moment the debt of the corporation is created. When, therefore, these notes were given in December, 1872, the liability of the stockholders to be assessed under their statutory liability, then and there attached.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-6\">The stock was then held by Shields, Evans &amp; Co. The notes were also held by Shields, Evans <em>&amp; </em>Co. Had suit then been brought \u2014 and the company was as insolvent then as it was in 1881 \u2014 it would have been sued by Shields, Evans &amp; Co., to collect their notes by an assessment upon themselves on account of the stock which they held. It was not competent for this cancellation to be avoided by selling the notes in one direction and the stock in another. In adjusting the equities between assignor and assignee, the court below completely ignored these facts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-7\">VI. There is no equity in favor of either Smith or Hamilton, and never was.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-8\">Hamilton was a member of the firm of Shields, Evans &amp; Co., and a director of the Newark, Somerset &amp; Straitsville Railroad Company. He not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>only had full knowledge of all the agreements and stipulations, but was an active party in making them. He knew that these notes were not payable except only out of the earnings of the Newark, Somerset &amp; Straitsville Railiroad Company; he knew the making of them was in violation of the stipulations of the lease and the other agreements referred do that there should be no floating debt created. Recognizing these facts he never sought to collect the same or to make any claim on account of them until after this suit was brought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b605-6\">As to Smith, he is in a much worse attitude. He is a mere speculative litigant. He not only had full knowledge of all these facts attending the creation of this indebtedness and the execution of these notes and the agreement that they should be paid only out of the earnings and that there should be no floating debt, but he also knew that except only as to this paper, there had been no change in the indebtedness of the Newark, Somerset &amp; Straitsville Railroad Company from the time when the paper was made down to the time when he bought it, and he knew, therefore, that the company was no more insolvent at the one time than it had been at the other. He knew necessarily when he bought the paper that it was past due. Aside, therefore, from the actual knowledge he had, he was \u201con notice\u201d and took subject to all equities. Knowing all these facts, both actually and constructively, he \u2022 sought to buy up this dishonored paper. The record shows he paid $14, 000 for $65,000, principal and interest; and there is something else to which we call especial attention, and that is, that he did not buy this dishonored paper, at about twenty cents on the dollar, <em>until after he himself had sold to the Baltimore </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>c&amp; Ohio Railroad from $115,000 to $150,000 oj the stock of the Newcvrk, Somerset &lt;&amp; Straitsville Rgil/i'o'od Company. </em>In other words he did not buy up this paper until the Newark, Somerset &amp; Straitsville Railroad Company had, from his own sale, acquired, as he thought, a solvent stockholder whom he might be able to squeeze into the payment of his claim. Accordingly we find him, immediately after he acquired this paper, asking, not the maker of it, the Newark, Somerset &amp; Straitsville Railroad Company, to pay it, or to make some arrangement about it, but asking the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, through Mr. Quincy, a general manager, who had nothing whatever to do with the subject, whether or not it would take up the paper, or whether it wanted to do anything about the paper, and 9, little bit later we find him telling the private secretary of Mr. Quincy that he would take $50,000 for his notes; or in other words, that he would throw off the interest. Payment being refused, he next brought suit and now asks the courts to require the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company to pay in the settlement of his claim and Hamilton\u2019s more than $300,000, to which large amount the claims have grown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b606-5\">It would be difficult to think of a case more unconscionable, as in violation of good faith and positive agreements, or a standing more objectionable, because of the speculative character of the complainant, or a judgment that should more certainly be reversed because of manifest errors.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b606-6\"><em>J. Buckingham, George B. Smythe </em>and <em>J. D. Jones, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b606-7\">The question is, what office does the judgment of the circuit court of 1887, and the facts found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>then by the court, perforin in the course of this litigation. Counsel for plaintiff in error claims that it counts for nothing, that it was mere byplajr, and that the B. <em>&amp; </em>O. R. R. Co. can, as matter of right, have all the matters then heard and determined, reheard, and set aside as of no potency whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b607-6\">If it was final, the judgment settled all matters expressly in dispute, and just as well, all matters admitted or not disputed; also all matters of defense, which the B. &amp; O. Co. as- stockholder did plead, but also all matters of defense, which the company might have pleaded. The judgment settled all those matters pleaded or which might have been pleaded, not only for that hearing, but, between the same parties, for all time and under all circumstances. <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>7 O.

But it has been held in the following cases, that no rehearing of judgments in error,, in the supreme\u2018cou^t, can be allowed, and that the judgments are final. <em>Longworth et al. </em>v. <em>Sturgis, </em>2 O.

T. That the notes owned by Smith and Hamilton, were valid claims against the N., S. &amp; S. R. R. Co., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>and as such, enforcible' against the defendants\u2014 \u2022 stockholders of that .company, in proportion to their stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-6\">2. That the N., S. &amp; S. R. R. Co. was insolvent in that sense, which supports a judgment against its stockholders, for its debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-7\">3. That the allegations of the amended petition, and the facts found by the court, justified the judgment that the stockholders should pay, without any judgment being first obtained on the notes by plaintiff and Hamilton.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-8\">4. That it was not agreed by the payees of the notes, held by plaintiff (below) and Hamilton, that they should be paid only out of the earnings of the railroad, or upon any condition, which precluded a judgment against the N., S. &amp; S. Co. or its stockholders for payment of the amounts due on them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-9\">5. 'That the B. &amp; O. Co. was a stockholder, and the owner of 4002 or <em>more </em>shares of the stock of the N., S. &amp; S. R. R. Co. and that it was liable to the plaintiff and Hamilton, for its proportionate amount.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-10\">6. All the facts, which were found by the court, and that they were sustained by sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-11\">There has been no controversey over any of the claims settled by the, subsequent proceedings, except that made by the B. <em>&amp; </em>O.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8p\">The principal grounds urged in argument for the reversal of the last judgment rendered by the circuit court against the plaintiff m error, briefly stated, are, in substance: 1. That the insolvency of the Newark, Somerset <em>&amp; </em>Straits-ville Railroad company, in the sense which author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>izes an action to be maintained against its stockholders, was not established; or, if it was, that insolvency had existed for a period so long before the commencement of the plaintiff\u2019s action, that it was barred by the statute of limitations. 2. That there was a fatal defect of parties, by the omission to have all the stockholders before the court. 3. That the plaintiff in error, being itself a corporation, was incapacitated to hold stock in the insolvent corporation, and was therefore, not subject to assessment for the debts of the latter company. 4. That the notes which the plaintiffs were seeking to' enforce, were obtained \u2022 after maturity, from Shields, Evans &amp; Co., who, under certain agreements with the plaintiff in error, could not have enforced them as against it, and the holders took them subject to the same infirmities; or, at least, the indebtedness should have been reduced by an amount equal to a proportional assessment on stock of the insolvent corporation owned by Shields, Evans &amp; Co., while they were the holders of the notes. And 5. That the judgment against the plaintiff, in error, for the amount assessed ag\u2019ainst the Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. stock, was without authority, the ownership of that stock having-been determined by the former judgment to be in Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co., and not in the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">One contention of counsel for the defendants in error is, that the first four of the grounds of reversal above stated were involved in, and determined adversely to the plaintiff in error by, the former judgment of the circuit court, which having been affirmed by this court, became a final adjudication upon them, and as between the parties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>precludes further inquiry. That they were so involved and determined is manifest from the record. The amended petition contained allegations of the insolvency of the defendant corporation, and no plea in bar was interposed; the stockholders were named as defendants, and their names and the number of shares owned by them respectively were set out with proper averments of ownership, without apparent omission of any, and no defect of parties was pleaded; the ownership by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad company of a specified number of shares was alleged, and no want of capacity to own them was asserted; the plaintiffs, Smith and Hamilton, set up the notes obtained from Shields, Evans &amp; Co. as valid claims against the insolvent corporation and its stockholders, and issues were joined between them and the plaintiff in error, presenting' the variofis phases of the controversy concerning their right to have them enforced in the action. Upon submission of the cause, the court found the equity with the plaintiffs, the allegations of their pleading's to be true, and all the issues in their favor, and rendered judgment for them and against the defendants. That was necessarily a determination of the insolvency of the defendant corporation, and that the action was not barred; that the necessary parties were before the court; that the plaintiff in error had capacity to hold the stock it was so found and adjudged to own; and that the indebtedness asserted by the plaintiffs in, the action was valid and subsisting to the amount found by the court. As said by counsel for the defendants in error, every fact necessary to that determination \u201cstands as a fact adjudicated between the parties, and, as between them, cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>be relitigated in any subsequent proceeding in the same action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">\u201cQuestions before the court for decision, and by the court decided, as essential to a final judgment, are conclusively and finally adjudicated. The law as declared cannot be changed upon a second or subsequent appeal.\u201d Elliott on Appellate Procedure, section 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">It has been declared by this court that: \u201cWhen the facts which constitute the cause of action or defense have been between the same parties, submitted to the consideration of the court, and passed upon by the court, they cannot again be the proper subjects for action or defense, unless the finding and judgment of the court is opened up and set aside by proper authority. This principle of law extends still further in quieting litigation. A party cannot re-litigate matters which he might have interposed, but failed to do in a prior action, between the same parties or their privies, in reference to the same subject matter. And if one of the parties failed to introduce matters for the consideration of the court, that he might have done, he will be presumed to have waived his right to do so.\u201d <em>Bridge Co. </em>v. Sargent, 27 Ohio St., 233, 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The application of the same principle to the fifth ground urged in behalf of the plaintiff in error for the reversal now sought, renders it not the less certain that the former judgment of the circuit court was final and conclusive also as to the ownership of the stock of the insolvent corporation. As has been noticed in the statement of the case, the amended petition alleges, as a fact, that the firm of Drexel, Morgan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>&amp; Co. was the owner of shares of stock of the insolvent corporation to the number of thirteen thousand four hundred and fifty, and the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad company was the owner of four thousand and two shares, or more, of the stock of the insolvent corporation, thirty-five hundred of which were issued to it as preferred stock ;each share being of the value of fifty dollars. And it is further averred that said parties were liable to contribute <em>pro </em>rata, according to \u201ctheir respective shares,\u201d for the payment of the creditors of the corporation. The finding of these allegations to be true, followed by judgment predicated upon that finding, must be accepted as final and conclusive of the ownership of the stock of the corporation, by the parties, and the extent of their respective ownerships, as alleged; as much so,as of any other material fact in the case. We attach no significance to the words \u201cor more, \u201d following the designation of the number of shares belonging to the plaintiff in error; they furnish no basis for a liability beyond the number of shares specified, and certainly can 'afford no warrant for charging the plaintiff in error with liability on the stock distinctly averred to be the property of Drexel, Morgan <em>&amp; </em>Co., and conclusively found and adjudged to be so, by the judgment rendered. Nor do we find any reservation in the judgment, under which the court in its subsequent proceedings was authorized to apportion and assess against the plaintiff in error any liability on account of the stock so found and adjudged to belong to Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co. The further proceedings which the nature of the case required, on being remanded by the circuit court, were those relating only to the apportionment of the liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>among the solvent stockholders, and' did not include or contemplate a re-trial of, or inquiry into any question of fact which had been settled by the judgment rendered. Nor, was it competent for the circuit court, after the term at which the judgment was rendered, to vacate it, in whole or part, except in the mode provided by statute, which was not done; so that, the answer pleading that judgment in bar, contained a good defense to the claim set up in the amendment to the petition, by which it was sought to establish the ownership by the plaintiff in error, of the stock which had been previously adjudged to belong to Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co-, and was an appropriate method of saving the party\u2019s right. Our conclusion therefore is, that the assessment made against the plaintiff in error, to the extent that it was based on that stock was erroneous, and invalid, and must be set aside, leaving the assessment to stand only in so far as it was made upon the number of shares of stock determined by the former judgment of the circuit court to be owned by the plaintiff in error, at the rate finally fixed by that court in making the apportionment of the liability among the stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">\n<em>The judgment will be modified accordingly, and otherwise affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
