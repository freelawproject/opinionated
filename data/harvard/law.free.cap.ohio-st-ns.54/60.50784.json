The right of action was denied by the general term upon the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>that no privity of contract exists between the holder of a check and the bank upon which it is drawn, and, therefore, that no right of action exists in the holder against the bank, until the bank has accepted the check. 27 <em>W. </em>L. B., 105; <em>Covert </em>v. Rhodes, 48 Ohio St., 66; the latter ease upsets the rule established in <em>McGregor </em>v. Loomis, 1 Disney, 247.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-5\">The case of <em>Covert </em>v. <em>Rhodes </em>does not decide that an action may not, under any circumstances, be maintained against a bank by the payee of an unaccepted cheek, but simply that the drawer may revoke the check by notice to the bank prior to its presentation. <em>Morrison </em>v. Bailey, 5 Ohio St., 13; <em>Stewart </em>v. Smith, 17 Ohio St., 82 ; <em>Kahn </em>v. Walton, 46 Ohio St., 195.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-6\">All the authorities agree that the implied contract of a banker with his depositor is to pay the depositor\u2019s checks when presented. It is a breach of this implied contract, and a clear wrong, for the banker to refuse .to pay, when there are funds on deposit applicable to the check ; but it is said that the payee of the check can not complain nor maintain an action for breach of this contract, because he is not a party'to the. contract, but a third-party, between whom and the bank there is no privity of contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-7\">This is a good objection to the action in those states which deny the right of a third party, for whose benefit a contract is made, to maintain an action upon it. All the cases cited by opposite counsel proceed upon this ground. <em>Carr </em>v. <em>National Security Bank, </em>107 Mass., 45. In England the doctrine is carried to great extremes. Wald\u2019s Pollock on Contracts, 204.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-8\">But in Ohio the objection of want of privity cannot prevail, for it is the settled law of this state, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>contrary to the rule in England, in Massachusetts, and in the supreme court of the United States, that a third person for whose benefit a contract is made may maintain an action at law upon it. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>4 Ohio St., 333; <em>Bagalay </em>v. <em>Waters, 7 </em>Ohio St., 367; <em>Trimble </em>v. <em>Strother, </em>25 Ohio St., 381; <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Maurer, </em>38 Ohio St., 543; <em>Emmitt </em>v. <em>Brophy, </em>42 Ohio St., 82.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-6\">It is true, as held in several of these cases, that the third, person\u2019s right of action is lost if the original parties revoke the contract before the third party gives notice of his rights. And the case of <em>Covert </em>v. <em>Rhodes </em>is but the logical application of this doctrine to the case of a check revoked before presentation. <em>Munn </em>v. <em>Burch, </em>25 Ill., 35; <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Stanford, </em>28 Ill., 168; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>80 Ill., 212; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Corbin &amp; Co., </em>26 Iowa, 315; <em>Lester </em>v. <em>Given, </em>8 Bush., 358; <em>Gordon v.

They are not authorities against the right to sue where there has been a wrongful refusal to pay, as at bar.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-8\"><em>Pogue, Pottenger &amp; Pogue, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-9\">The payee of a check cannot maintain an action on it against the drawee, the bank, when the bank refuses to accept it. From the time of the earliest opinion expressed by Judges Storer and Spencer in <em>McGregor </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>1 Disney, 247 (1856), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>up to the present day, tlie views of many of the courts of our country have changed on this question of the right of the payee of a check to sue the drawee of a cheek who refuses to accept it, though he may have sufficient funds to pay it, and nearly every court of last resort in the United States and England which has passed upon this question for the first time since the decision on <em>Bank of Republic </em>v. Millard, 10 Wall., 152 (1869), has said that the payee has no . right to sue the drawee on failure to accept <em>either at law or in equity.

The grounds' urged are not identical in all cases, nor is the reasoning wholly consistent, but the following is believed to be a fair resume of the conclusions: Because of the universal usage of banks to cash the checks drawn by a depositor, where he has sufficient unincum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>bered balance standing to his credit, a duty is implied on the part of the bank to so pay, and the holder takes the check relying upon this usage. Serious injury may result to the holder by the bank\u2019s refusal to' pay, for, while he may have an action against the drawer, that would prove delusive in the frequent instance of the drawer\u2019s insolvency, and the bank\u2019s wrongful action would be the real cause of the loss. The law, therefore, implies a contract on the part of the bank with its depositors to pay their checks as presented so long as the fund is sufficient, and should, for like reasons, imply a contract with whomever may become the holder of such cheek to pay on presentation. The check is treated as an equitable assignment <em>pro tanto </em>of the fund in the hands of the bank, and, by the act of presentation the check-holder is brought in privity with the bank, his right to sue completed, and he may sue the drawer and the bank in one action, the former as drawer and the latter as an implied acceptor. He may also sue the drawer on the check\u2019s dishonor, or the bank for money had and received.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Forcible and ingenious arguments in support of the right to maintain the action are presented by Mr. Morse, in his valuable work on Banking, by Mr. Daniels in his treatise on Negotiable Instruments, vol. 2, section 1638, where the arguments <em>pro </em>and <em>con </em>are stated and ably reviewed, and by a number of decisions, some of which \u00e1re the following: <em>Munn </em>v. Burch, 25 Ill., 35; <em>Ins. Co. </em>v. Stanford, 28 Ill., 168; <em>Bank </em>v. Bank, 80 Ill., 212 (but see opinion in <em>Bank </em>v. Bank, 7 Bissell, U. S., 195); <em>Roberts </em>v. Corbin, 26 Iowa, 315 <em>Lester </em>v. Given, 8 Bush, 358; <em>Fogarties </em>v. Bank, 12 South <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Carolina, 518 ; <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Muchler, </em>34 La. Ann., 608; <em>Fonner </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>31 Neb., 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The contrary doctrine is maintained by many text writers and decisions. Following are some of the authorities: -Randolph on Commercial Paper, vol. 2, p. 280; Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, section 1284 ; Van Schaack on Bank Checks, 212; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Millard, </em>10 Wallace, 152; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>94 U.

Eq., 74; Wald\u2019s Pollock on Contracts, 190, 204; 2 Ames\u2019 Bills and Notes, 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">It is not doubted that, as a general proposition, there can be no cause of action upon a contract unless there is privity of contract between the obligor and the party complaining. But it is urged in argument here that while the want of privity is a good objection to the action in those states which deny the right of a third party for whose benefit a contract is made to maintain an action upon it, in Ohio the objection of want of privity cannot prevail for the reason, as held bjr this court in a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>cases, that an agreement made on a valid consideration by one person with another, to pay money to a third, can be enforced by the latter in his own name, and that the third person is not named does not affect the right to enforce it. The most recent case involving this principle is that of <em>Emmitt </em>v. <em>Brophy, </em>42 Ohio St., 82. The action was upon a bond given by Emmitt to the county commissioners in the sale of a bridge by the Scioto Bridge Co., in which Emmitt obligated himself \u201cto pay off and liquidate all claims and demands, whether in judgment or otherwise, existing against said bridge, so that the full use of said bridge may enure to the public without let or hindrance. \u2019 \u2019 Brophy at the time was a judgment creditor and the owner of all of the claims enumerated in the bond. Owen J., in the opinion, after reciting the facts, observes : \u201cThese facts are strongly suggestive that it entered into the contemplation of the parties to this bond at the time of its execution, that this particular lien of the plaintiff upon the bridge was to be ' discharged by Emmitt. Its existence was known to them, and they seem to have left nothing to conjecture. Indeed, if Brophy and Potter had been expressly named as the lien-holders, it is difficult to see how this would have added to the definiteness of the bond, or made more certain the intention of the parties. This seems *to be a conclusive answer to the suggestion that there is want of privity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">No one of the cases cited carries the doctrine farther than the foregoing. In no one of them is it held that a right to sue in a stranger can be raised by mere implication. No where is it held that the obligation will attach in favor of future creditors not named and not known, and as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>amounts not specified or then ascertainable, to the extent of giving to such creditors a right of action on the contract. It must be apparent, even on brief reflection, that it does not follow from these decisions that there is privity between check-holder and bank before acceptance, and that in order to cover the case at bar a marked extension of the doctrine must be made. Reasons urged for such extension, however plausible, do not seem sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">On the contrary, strong reasons against the proposition may be adduced, among others, this: The transaction of giving the check does not, as will be shown further on, substitute the check-holder for the drawer. The latter may maintain an action for the breach of the contract to honor his check, and if the holder has a similar right, the result is that two persons may maintain separate actions upon the same instrument at the sam\u00e9 time to recover against the same defendant as a principal debtor. The inference that the right to recover by the check-holder is denied only in the states where a right of recovery is refused to one for whose benefit a contract is made by another, arises from a misapprehension of the authorities. In many states where the right of a check-holder to sue the bank is not assented to, the right of one for whose benefit* a contract is made to recover upon it is recognized. See <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>20 N. Y., 268; <em>Burr v. </em>Beers, 24 N. Y., 178; <em>Coster </em>v. <em>The Mayor, </em>43 N. Y., 399; <em>Merriman v. </em>Moore, 90 Pa.

Truesdale, 28 Ind., 44 ; <em>Brice </em>v. <em>King, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>1 Head\u2019s (Tenn.), 152; <em>Greeny. Morrison, </em>5 Col.,. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj8\">It is insisted that the ease should not turn alone on the legal idea of privity, for, under our system of procedure, it is immaterial whether the interest of the paj^ee against the hank is legal or equitable, and that the action here may be maintained on equitable grounds. In a well-considered case, <em>Covert </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>48 Ohio St., 66, this court held that \u2018 <em>\u2018a </em>bank check or draft for a part of the sum due the drawer, does not, before acceptance by the drawee, constitute an equitable assignment of the amount for which-it is drawn.\u201d The conclusion is amply sustained by the reasoning\u2019 of the opinion, and no discussion is necessary. If there is no equitable assignment of the debt <em>pro tcmto, </em>how can equitable considerations prevail? The proceeding is not an equitable one; and .if it were, we do not understand that equity has different rules from thos\u00e9 of law with respect to the rights and obligations of parties to negotiable paper. As applicable to such case we believe that reason, and the great preponderance, of authority,- establish the following conclusions : The relations of bank and general depositor is simply the ordinary one of debtor and creditor, not of agent and principal, or trustee and <em>cestui que trust. </em>The bank agrees with its depositor to receive his deposits, to account with him for the amount, to repay to him on demand, and to honor his checks to the amount of his credit when the checks are presented; and for any breach of that agreement the bank is liable to an action by him. The deposits become the absolute property of the bank, impressed with no trust, and the bank\u2019s right to use the money for its own benefit is immediate and continuous, which right con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>stitutes the consideration for the bank\u2019s promise to the depositor. The bank\u2019s agreement with the depositor involves or implies no agreement with the holder of a check. The giving of a check is not an assignment of so much of the creditor\u2019s claim; it passes no title, legal or equitable, to the holder in the moneys previously deposited, nor \u25a0 does it create a lien on the fund, for there is no special fund out of which the check can.be paid, nor does it transfer any money to the credit of the holder ; it is simply an order which may be countermanded and payment forbidden by the drawer any time before it is actually cashed or accepted. If accepted, then the agreement is to pay according to the terms of the check or acceptance; but until then the payee looks exclusively to the drawer. He can maintain no action against the bank, for the bank owes to the payee no legal duty, and an action at law cannot be maintained except there is shown to have been a failure in the performance of 'legal duty. Being liable to the drawer to account with him for failure to honor his check, the bank cannot, either on legal or equitable considerations, be held at the same time liable to the holder of the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Tested by these rules, the plaintiff could have, no cause of action against the bank, and the superior court committed no error in the judgment rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\n<em>Judgment affi/rmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
