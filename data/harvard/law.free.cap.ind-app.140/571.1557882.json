After answering appellant's complaint, putting the cause at issue, appellee filed with the clerk, in vacation, interrogatories in writing to be answered by plaintiff. Later appellee filed his verified motion to dismiss for failure of plaintiff to answer the interrogatories. The motion was sustained, after hearing, and judgment entered dismissing appellant\u2019s cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">The dismissal of a cause of action is a final judgment from which an appeal lies. <em>Meier, etc. </em>v. <em>Soc. Sec. Adm. et al. </em>(1958), 287 Ind. 421, 422, 146 N. E. 2d 239; <em>Dawson et al </em>v. <em>Wright, Mayor, etc., et al. </em>(1955), 234 Ind. 626, 630, 129 N. E. 2d 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">The authority and procedure for interrogatories set forth in Acts 1881 (Spec. Sess.), ch. 38, \u00a7351, p. 240, \u00a72-1028, Burns\u2019 1946 Replacement, has been interpreted by our courts to require a rule or order against the plaintiff to answer interrogatories within a specified time before the party can be held in default and a motion to dismiss can be sustained.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-15\"><em>\u201cA </em>rule must be taken to answer them, [the interrogatories] or the party can not be deemed in default.\u201d <em>Cates </em>v. <em>Thayer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>(1884), 93 Ind. 156, 157; <em>Rice and Another </em>v. <em>Derby </em>(1856), 7 Ind. 649, 651.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">\u201cNo steps were taken to compel an answer; but a motion was made to dismiss the cause, because the interrogatories were not answered. The motion was overruled. This was right. ... A case was not presented making it the absolute duty of the Court to dismiss under \u00a7 363, 2 R. S. p. 120.\u201d <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Ellis </em>(1860), 14 Ind. 516.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Although \u00a7 2-1028, <em>swpra, </em>was amended by Acts 1965, ch. 53, \u00a7 2, p. 83, the requirement for a rule or order to answer set forth in the above decisions, in our opinion, was not changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The 1881 Act, <em>supra, </em>provided in this regard that, \u201c[a] 11 interrogatories must be answered within the time limited, positively and without evasion, and the court may enforce the answers by attachment or otherwise; . . .\u201d This provision was deleted in the 1965 amendment and, while it provides that \u201cthe party upon whom the interrogatories have been served shall serve a copy of the answers . . . within fifteen [15] days . . .\u201d, there is no provision whatsoever in the 1965 amendment for the enforcement thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Our Supreme Court set forth the law concerning the right to dismiss an action in this State in <em>Soderling </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>(1950), 229 Ind. 47, at page 53, 95 N. E. 2d 298, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiqG\">\u201cThe right of a court to dismiss an action in Indiana is limited by Sec. 2-901, Burns\u2019 1946 Replacement. Courts may dismiss actions: (1) \u2018. . . where the plaintiff fails to appear on trial.\u2019 (2) \u2018. . . on the refusal to make the necessary parties, after having been ordered by the court.\u2019 (3) \u2018. . . on application of some of the defendants, where there are others whom the plaintiff fails to prosecute with diligence.\u2019 (4) \u2018. . . for disobedience by the plaintiff of an order concerning the proceedings in the action.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-10\">\u2018In all other cases, upon the trial, the decision must be upon the merits.\u2019 Certainly there is nothing in this statute authorizing the trial court in this case to dismiss the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>The only inherent power of dismissal possessed by the trial court is to dismiss an action of which it has no jurisdiction. There is no question concerning the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction of this action. See <em>State ex rel. Hurd </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1949), 227 Ind. 93, 84 N. E. 2d 181.\u201d See also: <em>State ex rel. Terminix Co. of Ind. </em>v. <em>Fulton C. C. </em>(1956), 235 Ind. 218, 132 N. E. 2d 707.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">\u25a0Since no rule to answer interrogatories was served upon plaintiff-appellant, and since there is no issue of the jurisdiction of the trial court, the trial court erred in sustaining appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Appellee filed herein his motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, that the judgment below be affirmed. Such motion to dismiss or affirm has been considered and inasmuch as we are of the opinion that appellant\u2019s brief is sufficient to present the question involved in this appeal, such motion is now overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Judgment reversed with instructions to deny appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s cause of action for failure to answer interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Reversed with instructions to deny appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Cooper, C. J., Carson and Prime, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">Note. \u2014 Reported in 224 N. E. 2d 514.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
