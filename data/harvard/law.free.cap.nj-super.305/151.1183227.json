The proposed facility was to consist of a four hundred and fifty-six (456) square foot shelter housing radio equipment, and a ninety (90) foot high steel monopole with up to twelve 12\" by 54\" panel-type antennas.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">The Board conducted hearings on the application on February 7, 1995, April 4, 1995, and May 2, 1995. At the February 7 Hearing, Comcast presented expert testimony from Seth Parkoff, a radio frequency engineer; Alice Fahy-Elwood, a radiation protection specialist; and Janice Talley, a senior planner. Vincent J. Dotoli, Esquire, appeared representing himself and other objectors, all South Plainfield property owners within sight of the proposed tower. Several members of the local community that attended the meeting spoke against the proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">At the April 4, 1995 hearing, objectors\u2019 counsel completed the cross-examination of Ms. Talley. The objectors then presented their own witnesses, including Richard Wolf, a telecommunications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>consultant; and John T. Chadwick, a professional planner. Corn-cast\u2019s counsel cross-examined these witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Comcast presented two rebuttal witnesses at the May 7, 1995 hearing: David Stern, Comcast\u2019s director of wireless systems engineering and Roger F. Grutzmacher, a partner in the firm of JGH Architects. At the conclusion of the May 2, 1995 hearing, the Board denied Comcast\u2019s use variance application by a unanimous vote of 7-0. The Board\u2019s findings were memorialized in a written resolution of the same date.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">On June 4,1995, Comcast filed a complaint in lieu of prerogative writs challenging the use variance denial. The action was tried on September 29,1995 and May 24,1996. On the later date, the Law Division judge rendered his oral opinion and overturned the denial of the variances and ordered approval of Comcast\u2019s application. The Board and objectors appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">The M-3 zone is the least restrictive use zone in South Plain-field.

Residential uses are expressly prohibited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-13\"><em>(Ibid, </em>at sec. 708.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-14\">The M-2 Industrial Zone includes as a permitted use \u201cTelevision and Radio Studios and Antennas.\u201d (South Plainfield Zoning Ordinance, sec. 709.1C). This zone is located several hundred yards from Comcast\u2019s selected site, and is immediately adjacent to Route 287. Cellular communication towers are clearly not a permitted use in the M-3 Zone and, therefore, Comcast required a use variance. It also required a bulk variance in that the proposed height of ninety (90) feet exceeded the height limitation in the M-3 Zone.</p>\n<p id=\"AXy\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70d, provided at the time, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-16\">In particular cases and for special reasons, (a board of adjustment may) grant a variance to allow departure from regulations pursuant to article 8 of this act to permit: (1) a use or principal structure in a district restricted against such use or principal structure, (2) an expansion of a nonconforming use, (3) deviation from a specification or standard ... pertaining solely to a conditional use, (4) an increase in the permitted floor area ratio ..., (5) an increase in the permitted density ..., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>except as applied to the required lot area for a lot or lots for detached one or two dwelling unit buildings, which lot or lots are either an isolated undersized lot or lots resulting from a minor subdivision or (6) a height of a principal structure which exceeds by 10 feet or 10% the maximum height permitted in the district for a principal structure.

The first purpose was to increase communications capacity along Route 287 and the Middlesex Mall. The second purpose was to improve the efficiency of the system by improving the quality of the user \u201chand-off\u2019 between signal towers. Parkoff testified that the ninety foot proposed height of the monopole was necessary in order to achieve the desired increased capacity and efficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">According to Parkoff, this site is in the \u201cdead center\u201d of a \u201csearch area\u201d about \u201ca half mile in diameter\u201d selected by Comcast. He said that after a search area is created, Comcast\u2019s policy is to look for existing towers to co-locate with, examine the terrain and other factors that could affect the height of the tower, and to determine what real estate is available. He was aware of two other towers in the immediate area, both of which were, in his opinion, not sufficient for Comcast\u2019s purposes. One of the towers, owned by an excavation company, was located next to the chosen site but could not support the load of Comcast\u2019s antennas. The other tower, about two miles from the chosen site, owned by Nextel, was unacceptable because it fell outside the search ring area. Comcast evaluated ten locations within the search ring, and the chosen site \u201cwas one of the best ones; and, in the end, the only one that was available.\u201d Comcast would not provide these ten locations when requested by Attorney Dotoli. Comcast\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>counsel maintained that under <em>Sica</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>alternate sites are not probative or relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Parkoff testified that there are other technological options that Comcast was \u201ctrying to implement\u201d in order to increase capacity. These technologies include digital communication, which \u201chas the potential of tripling or multiplying by ten the number of channels\u201d available, and micro cells, whereby small, unobtrusive antennas are placed at very low levels in order to obtain coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Richard Wolf was presented as the objectors\u2019 technological expert. Wolf noted that the cellular phone industry in the South Plainfield area is very competitive, and that the three major competitors, Comcast, Bell Atlantic Mobile, and Nextel, operate on a \u201cfor-profit\u201d basis. He stated that the towers currently operate under an \u201canalog system.\u201d He offered several reasons why the proposed Comcast tower should not be approved. First, he stated that there is no technological reason why Comcast could not use the Nextel tower or reinforce the existing tower located adjacent to Comcast\u2019s proposed site. He also discussed the use of \u201cmini cells\u201d or \u201cmicro cells\u201d as \u201ca way of providing service to a limited geographical area.\u201d These are placed where there are \u201chigh concentrations of people\u201d such as \u201cin a mall site or inside a building\u201d or other \u201chot spots where people are demanding a lot of service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Wolf also stressed the change in system design to digital technology, which multiplies a system\u2019s capacity potential by a factor of 20. He said communication towers built within the past four to five years are equipped to handle both analog and digital technology. He estimated that \u201cprobably ten to twenty percent of the calls being carried in this country are digital,\u201d and by this time next year, 50 percent of the calls will be digital. He noted that Comcast and \u201c[a]ll of the wireless carriers are going to digital ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>to increase their capacity and so they don\u2019t have to put up new towers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Comcast offered David Stern, a Comcast director of wireless systems engineering, as a rebuttal witness. He testified that the Nextel tower \u201cfalls 1.75 miles away from the center of the search area and a mile and a quarter away from the edge of the search area. So it does not meet the criteria.\u201d He stated that the design criteria was to improve signal strength along Route 287 and Middlesex Mall, and that the Nextel site would not improve the signal strength in this area. He also indicated that the tower structure on the lot adjacent to the proposed site could not be used without being replaced. He stated that only a micro cell in \u201ceach and every one of the locations\u201d that Comcast was targeting would improve coverage in those areas. He estimated digital technology would increase capacity by a factor of five to eight times. He admitted it is technologically possible for an engineer to locate an antenna on the Nextel tower and still cover the Route 287 area and the Durham Avenue area, and that it would not be difficult from an engineering standpoint to replace the tower adjacent to the proposed site.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Comcast also offered the testimony of Janice Talley, a planner, who stated that the M-3 Zone was the most permissive zone in the area. She provided a general description of the surrounding area and presented a photographic exhibit illustrating what the proposed monopole would look like. She asserted the facility would be unmanned, have virtually no-traffic except for one maintenance visit per week, have an adequate entrance and exit, would require no water or sewer lines, would not emit any distracting noise, and would produce radio frequency emissions 2700 times lower than required by State regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Talley argued that according to New Jersey law a cellular phone tower is an \u201cinherently beneficial use\u201d and, therefore, the positive criteria for the use variance must be considered satisfied. She stated that placing the antenna on the proposed site would not create a significant impact considering the industrial uses permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>ted within the M-3 Zone. She also stated that there are no detrimental impacts from the proposed use and, in considering the public interest considerations in communications, any negative aspects of the proposed use are outweighed by the positive aspects. She acknowledged that the social and beneficial purposes for manufacturing zones, like the M-3, are to permit manufacturing and industrial-type activities, which create a \u201cgood employment base\u201d as well as a \u201cfairly solid ratable base.\u201d She agreed Comcast\u2019s proposed site would not bring any jobs to South Plain-field, and was only a \u201cmarginal ratable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The objectors called John Chadwick as an expert in professional planning. He opined that some inherently beneficial uses are more compelling than others. He would rank \u201clow or moderate cost housing\u201d high on a list of inherently beneficial uses, and \u201ccellular towers\u201d at the lowest end of such a list. He noted that, from a planning perspective, the use of the site will not conform to the zoning objectives of the community. He described the area as \u201cin transition\u201d from farmland and scattered residential development to a manufacturing and office corridor connected with Route 287. As an area in transition, it would be more vulnerable to an adverse impact from the placement of a cellular tower than a zone that has already been fully developed. He opined that \u201cthe manmade conditions in the area or the physical conditions of the land don\u2019t support, in my opinion, the testimony that the site was selected based on the topographic condition, because the elevation is clearly lower than the surrounding areas.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He concluded that the proposed tower \u201cwill contribute to [the M-3 Zone\u2019s] development at a much lower level than anticipated under the zoning plan from the standpoint, again, in terms of jobs, in terms of improvements of the sites for buildings and, therefore, revenue flows to the municipality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>In unanimously voting to deny the application, the Board adopted a resolution, dated May 2, 1995, which lists nineteen \u201cfindings\u201d and eleven \u201cconclusions,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">\n<em>FINDINGS</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">1. [Comcast] ... is the Lessee of a portion of the property known as and located at 313 Durham Avenue, also known as Lot 9, in Block 488 in the Borough of South Plainfield.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">2. The premises in question is 133,294 square feet and presently being used as heavy machinery repair and storage located in the M-3 Zone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-9\">3. The applicant is requesting a use variance to construct an unmanned Cellular Telecommunications facility ... [gives dimensions] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-10\">4. [Comcast] ... testified that the proposed antenna would assist in increasing the capacity and coverage (signal strength) on their present cellular communications systems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-11\">5. [Comcast] ... testified that the site in question, which is located on a threshold street, in the general area of the intersection of Durham Avenue and Route 287, was one of many sites they considered for the proposed ... facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-12\">6. [Comcast] ... refused to disclose the identity of the other loeation[s],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-13\">7. [Comcast] ... admitted that the site in question was lower than some of the other alternative sites.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-14\">8. [Comcast] ... also admitted that selecting an alternative site that was more elevated may allow ... [them] to reduce the overall height of the antenna.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-15\">9. There is an antenna of the approximate size required by Comcast within the immediate area of the site which could have been modified or reconstructed to accommodate the communications needs of ... [Comcast].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-16\">10. The area immediately surrounding the [site] ... is an area in transition, at the very threshold of a significant amount of the motor vehicle traffic into South Plainfield and vulnerable to inappropriate development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-17\">11. Substantial deviations from the Zoning Plan in this area could have a permanent adverse effect on the municipal planning for this area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-18\">12. The objectors to the application offered expert testimony that some of the existing towers in the general area (including Nextel Tower) could provide the required service requested by the applicant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-19\">13. The expert witnesses ... indicate a digital technology will increase the capacity of existing transmission facilities for a minimum of five times to a maximum of twenty times their existing capacity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-20\">14. [Comcast] ... testified that it would be changing to digital technology over the next two years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-21\">15. Digital technology would significantly decrease the need for towers similar to the one proposed in this application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>16. The Board agrees with the finding of [Chadwick] ... that the erection of this facility would detract from future development of the area ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\">17. The Board agrees with [Chadwick] that the facility in question would be esthetically ... unpleasing to both [sic] future development of the area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">18. [Comcast] ..., through its witnesses, acknowledges that the anticipated introduction of digital communication technology had significantly decreased in need for the monopoles of the proposed height.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">19. [Comcast] ... acknowledges that it was possible to accomplish some of its intended capacity and coverage goals, especially for stationary users, by the use of micro cells within the intended area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSIONS</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">1. [Comcast] ... has failed to demonstrate that the relief can be granted without substantial detriment to the intent and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Plan, being a deterrent to the permitted use development of the area in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">2. [Comcast] ... has failed to demonstrate that the relief requested can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good, being an esthetic detriment to a main corridor within the Borough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">3. [Comcast] ... offered no conditions that would ameliorate the negative impact upon the public good and the intent and purpose of the Zoning Plan and Zoning Ordinance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-11\">4. The detriment to the public good, the Zoning Plan and Zoning Ordinance, outweighs the public interest of the use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-12\">5. It is the determination of the Board that the desired goal to the capacity and coverage for the mobile telecommunications system, can be accomplished in other ways which would not adversely impact upon public good or the intent and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance or Zoning Plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-13\">6. The site in question is inappropriate for the proposed use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-14\">7. The proposed use on the site in question would have a substantially adverse impact on the zoning and planning of the Borough of South Plainfield.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-15\">8. The proposed use does not provide public benefit, but simply provides additional service to customers of Comcast.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-16\">9. The Board determined that the inherent beneficial characteristic of the proposed use is significantly less compelling than other iypes of inherently beneficial uses such as churches, schools, hospitals, low and moderate income housing, day care centers, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-17\">10. The increased service which may result from the proposed use could be accomplished by other means such as micro-cells, using existing towers and digital technology.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-18\">11. The significant detriment to the Borough and the Zoning Plan and Zoning Ordinance should not be outweighed by the minimal inherent beneficial characteristic of the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>When eourts review a decision to grant a variance, they must recognize that the Legislature has vested the municipality with discretion to make the decision involved. <em>Booth v.

(Note to the Senate, Summary of Senate Bill 824, in which \u201ccellular towers\u201d were specifically mentioned as being implicated). The amendment was designed to clarify \u201cthat it is not enough for a use variance applicant to prove that the proposed use constitutes an inherently beneficial use ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>The amendments seek to make it clear that \u201can applicant must still prove that the use will <em>not substantially impair the zoning plan. </em>By restoring this balance, municipalities will again be able to evaluate a proposed use on a particular site to ensure that it does not have a negative impact on the overall zoning plan of the community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">47 <em>U.S.C. </em>s.332(c)(7), specifically preserves the control of the local zoning authorities by providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">[N]othing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of a State or local government or instrumentality thereof over decisions regarding the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">[47 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 332(c)(7)(A).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">47 <em>U.S.C. </em>s.332(c)(7)(B)(iii) requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-12\">[a]ny decision by a State or local government or instrumentality thereof to <em>deny </em>a request to place, construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-13\">[47 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 332(e)(7)(B)(iii) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">Against this statutory background and the relevant case law, we consider Comcast\u2019s argument that the Board\u2019s stated reasons for denying the use variance application, as set forth in the memorializing resolution, were not grounded in fact and were conclusory in nature. We also consider Comcast\u2019s assertion that only the effect of a proposed facility at a specific location should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>considered as part of the negative criteria, and not the fact that there may be a zone elsewhere that permits similar facilities. Comcast points out that a contrary rule would create two different tests: one for towns that completely exclude the proposed inherently beneficial use, and one for those towns that exclude the use in some places, and allow it in others. Comcast also claims that no party has legitimately argued that the proposed site in the M-3 Zone is not suitable; arguments have only been made that there may be a \u201cmore\u201d suitable site in the M-2 Zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">We do not consider the record to support the proposition that the proposed erection of a 90\u2019 monopole is permitted in the M-2 Zone, as asserted by appellants. Nonetheless, after a review of the entire record, we cannot say the Board\u2019s findings are unsupported or that it acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably in its balancing of the relevant considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The Board, in applying <em>Sica, </em>first properly identified \u201cthe public interest at stake,\u201d accepting Comcast\u2019s assertion that the proposed antenna would assist in increasing the capacity and coverage of their present cellular communications system in the area. The Board concluded, however, that \u201cthe inherent beneficial characteristic of the proposed use is significantly less compelling than other types of inherently beneficial uses____\u201d The Board further noted that the proposed use \u201csimply provides additional service to customers of Comcast.\u201d The Board\u2019s findings and conclusions with respect to this aspect of Comcast\u2019s application were not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">We next look at the Board\u2019s second task relating to the identification of the detrimental effect that would ensue from the grant of the variance. The Board did not consider the consequences to be minimal, as it found that the monopole would be located on \u201ca threshold street\u201d and that the area is \u201cin transition,\u201d thereby making it \u2018Vulnerable to inappropriate development.\u201d This finding is supported by expert testimony in the record. These findings support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the applicant failed to demonstrate that the variances could be granted without substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>tial detriment to the public good. The Board concluded that the monopole would subject a main corridor to the Borough to aesthetic detriment, thereby bringing about the risk that the zone would not come out of its transition in accordance with the goals of the Zoning Plan. Even if we were to consider the detrimental effect as less than substantial, we cannot say that, based upon the Board\u2019s findings with respect to the weight to be given to the inherently beneficial use, that on balance approval was mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Thirdly, the Board considered whether it might reduce the detrimental effect by imposing reasonable conditions on the use, but apparently was not able to find any means and further noted that Comcast \u201coffered no conditions that would ameliorate the negative impact upon the public good and the intent and purpose of the Zoning Plan and Zoning Ordinance.\u201d The record is indeed barren of any suggestion as to how the 90\u2019 monopole at the threshold of the Borough from a major highway could be made less obvious or aesthetically pleasing.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Lastly, the Board balanced the positive and negative criteria to determine whether the variance could be granted without substantial detriment to the public good. In this regard, we look to the 1997 statutory amendments as well as the holding of our Supreme Court in <em>Sica, supra, </em>and conclude that the two are not incompatible. Rather, a proper application of the court\u2019s directive in <em>Sica </em>employs the same criteria the Legislature emblazoned in the statutory directive, namely, \u201c[n]o variance or other relief may be granted under the terms of this section, including a variance or other relief involving an inherently beneficial use, without a showing that such variance of other relief can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and will not substantially impair the intent and the purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70d <em>(L. </em>1997, c. 145). The prohibition had always remained that no relief may be granted even for an inherently beneficial use without a showing that the variance or relief can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and that the grant would not substantially impair the intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>and purpose of the Zoning Plan and Zoning Ordinance. <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">There was substantial testimony in the record upon which the Board could conclude that there was detriment to the Zoning Plan as it pertained to future development of the M-3 Zone, an area in transition. There was uncontraverted evidence to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the benefit to the general public was not significant. Considering the testimony that there were other technological means to accomplish the enhanced service sought by Comcast, including using existing towers, microcells, and the increasing use of digital technology, it cannot be said that the Board\u2019s conclusion is unreasonable or arbitrary. Moreover, the refusal of Comcast to disclose the identity of other locations was cited by the Board and no doubt was a significant factor in its conclusion that Comcast had not given sufficient consideration to other sites that would not as adversely impact upon the Borough\u2019s threshold area.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Comcast was required to carry the burden of proving that the negative criteria were met, as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70d, namely, that the intent and purpose of the Zoning Plan and Zoning Ordinance will not be substantially impaired. <em>Weiner v. Zoning Bd. of Adj. of Glassboro, </em>144 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509, 516, 366 A.2d 696 (App.Div.1976). The Board did not have the burden \u201cto find affirmatively that the plan would be substantially impaired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We add that 47 <em>U.S.CA </em>\u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(iii) does not impose upon the local authority the burden to demonstrate such impairment and thereby remove from the applicant the burden of proving that the variance will not substantially impair the intent and the purpose of the Zone Plan and Zoning Ordinance, as asserted by our dissenter. The Board\u2019s burden under the federal statute is satisfied when it denies a cellular tower use variance in writing and supports its decision with substantial evidence in a written record. Here, the Board satisfied its burden by setting forth in its May 2, 1995 written \u201cresolution\u201d nineteen detailed findings of fact and eleven statements of conclusions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>drawn from lengthy substantive hearings on the matter. The plain language of section 332 does not impose any additional burdens on the Board or relieve Comcast of its burden under the state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Moreover, the dissenter\u2019s argument that the Board may have violated 47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 332(e)(7)(B)(i)(I) and unreasonably discriminated among providers of functionally equivalent services ignores the true value of the prior grant and other available technological resources. The Board found that the existing towers, microcells, and the increasing use of digital technology were sufficient to meet Comcast\u2019s need for enhanced service along Route 287 and the accompanying area. As a result, the Board reasonably denied the erection of Comcast\u2019s proposed tower in close proximity to and with the same capabilities of the existing structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">We are not unmindful of the labor and sensitivity reflected in the decision of the Law Division judge. We conclude, however, that where, as here, the issue is one that is close, the Board is in the better position to weigh the positive and negative criteria and make the determination as to whether on balance the grant of the variance can be made without substantial detriment. <em>Booth, supra, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>at 306, 234 A.2d 681. Considering the presumption in favor of the Board\u2019s decision, the Law Division should not have set it aside as arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. <em>Kramer, supra, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>at 296-97, 212 A.2d 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\"> <em>Sica v.

We concluded that the applicant had not established that the proposed tower was an inherently beneficial use. <em>Id. </em>at 517, 697 A.2d 195. <em>Pierce </em>is distinguishable from the present case because the proposed tower was to be built by the landowner who was not in the communications business. The tower would have been a speculative venture in the hope that once it was built a communications company might lease it. Consequently, we held that the applicant \u201cwas simply unable to show that any public need would actually be served by the proposed tower.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The status of mobile communications facilities as inherently beneficial uses is enhanced by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (TCA), Pub.L.

In <em>Sprint Spectrum L.P. v.

As previously indicated, Congress also had determined that such services should be available from multiple providers in competition with each other. 47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 332(c)(1)(C). At least one court has observed that the TCA\u2019s limitations on local zoning authority implements Congress\u2019 intent to increase competition in the industry. <em>Western PCS II, supra, </em>957 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1237. Thus, in terms of New Jersey zoning law, the Board\u2019s assumption that Comcast\u2019s proposed use is an inherently beneficial use was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Because Comcast\u2019s monopole satisfied the affirmative criteria, the Board focused on the negative criteria, and denied the variance on that ground. In <em>Sica v. Board of Adj. of Wall, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>152, 603 A.2d 30 (1992), the Court addressed the negative criteria in a case involving an inherently beneficial use. The Court held that in such a ease the Board must balance the affirmative and negative criteria because \u201cthe need for balancing is implicit in the statutory requirement that the grant of a variance must be \u201cwithout substantial detriment to the public good.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164, 603 A.2d 30 (quoting <em>Medici v. BPR Co., </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>1, 22 n. 12, 526 A.2d 109 (1987)). The Court observed that \u201cnot every detriment will support the denial of a use variance. Only one that is <em>\u2018substantial \u2019 </em>will suffice.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The procedural guide suggested by the Court in <em>Sica </em>involves, in part, identification of \u201cthe detrimental effect that will enure fi*om the grant of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166, 603 A.2d 30. Once the Board identifies the detrimental effect, it must \u201cweigh the positive and negative criteria and determine whether, on balance, the grant of the variance would cause a substantial detriment to the public good.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court noted that \u201c[t]his balancing, \u2018[w]hile properly making it more difficult for municipalities to exclude inherently beneficial uses ... permits such exclusion when the negative impact of the use is <em>significant.\u2019 \u201d Ibid, </em>(emphasis added) (quoting <em>Baptist Home v. Borough of Riverton, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>226, 247, 492 A.2d 1100 (Law Div.1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Applying this test, I am persuaded that the negative impact of the proposed monopole is not significant. The proposed location of the monopole in the Borough\u2019s most permissive industrial zone is the most important fact in this case. The M-3 zone is adjacent to Interstate Route 287 which, south of Route 22, is lined with industrial and commercial uses. The pole and its accessory facilities will occupy 2,500 square feet of a 133,000 square foot lot, the balance of which is used as a facility for the repair and storage of heavy machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The majority opinion lists the permitted uses in the M-3 zone. Those uses include a variety of manufacturing and industrial processes, as well as office buildings and research facilities. On its face, Comcast\u2019s pole with its array of antennas is compatible with those uses. The objectors\u2019 planning expert testified that desirable manufacturing and office uses would not seek to locate in the M-3 zone if the pole is installed. However, he presented no empirical evidence to support that rather startling statement. Equally feeble as a rationale for precluding the pole was his testimony that the pole would not create jobs and would not contribute to the tax base. Although the pole and its supporting equipment will not create a single job, the installation is utilizing only 2,500 square feet of a large industrial lot and is not displacing any existing employment opportunities. I conclude that the record does not support a finding as required in <em>Sica, supra, </em>that the proposed monopole\u2019s negative impact, if any, would be significant or substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">I agree with the majority that the record does not adequately support the conclusion that the monopole is a permitted use in the nearby M-2 zone. That zone permits \u201cTelevision and Radio Studios and Antennas.\u201d The language suggests that a permitted antenna must be used in connection with a television or radio \u201cstudio.\u201d Comcast\u2019s application does not involve construction of a \u201cstudio.\u201d Moreover, the proposed pole would exceed the M-2 zone\u2019s height limitations and a variance under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70d(6) would be required. In any event, the Board\u2019s resolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>did not find that the pole is a permitted use in the M-2 zone and the Board\u2019s denial was not based on such a fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Comcast\u2019s application preceded enactment of the TCA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and neither the Board nor the Law Division applied the federal statute. Nevertheless, the Law Division\u2019s judgment is consistent with the TCA, and the TCA buttresses the conclusion that the Board erred in denying Comcast\u2019s application. The requirement in 47 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 332(e)(7)(B)(iii) that a local government\u2019s denial of an application to locate a wireless service facility be \u201csupported by substantial evidence\u201d imposes the burden of persuasion on the local government agency. See <em>Sprint Spectrum L.P., supra </em>(holding that zoning authority\u2019s moratorium on processing of development permits for cellular communication towers violated the TCA); <em>Illinois RSA No. 3, Inc. v. County of Peoria, </em>963 <em>F.Supp. </em>732 (C.D.Ill.1997) (holding that denial of special use permit to build cellular communications tower in low density residential district violated TCA because it was not supported by substantial evidence, though the denial was not arbitrary or capricious and, therefore, did not violate the Illinois Constitution); <em>Western PCS II, supra </em>(holding that .denial of special exception request to mount wireless telecommunications antenna to water tank violated TCA because it was not supported by substantial evidence; it amounted to unreasonable discrimination among providers of functionally equivalent services, and violated TCA\u2019s requirement that local regulations not have the effect of prohibiting provision of personal wireless services); <em>BellSouth Mobility Inc., supra </em>(holding that denial of tall structure permit for a monopole of 197 feet violated TCA because it was not supported by substantial evidence). The TCA shifts the burden of persuasion to the Board whether or not the facility is considered an inherently beneficial use under New Jersey zoning law. Thus, it appears that the TCA dilutes the impact of the 1997 amendment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70c <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>and d, as applied to wireless communications facilities. <em>L. </em>1997, c. 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Although the issue was not raised below, the Board also may have violated 47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I) which provides that a local government \u201cshall not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services.\u201d This subsection of the TCA is relevant because the Board, by resolution dated August 2, 1994, nine months before it denied Comcast\u2019s application, granted a variance to one of Comcast\u2019s competitors to permit the erection of a steel tower 191 feet in height in the M-3 zone. The United States District Court addressed similar facts in <em>Illinois BSA No. 3, supra, </em>and found that the County had violated the TCA\u2019s antidiscrimination provision. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">The County admits that it has permitted a cellular tower in the R2 district, and the Zoning Code also does not expressly permit cellular towers as speeial uses in the R2 district just as it does not do so for the R1 district. If the County refuses to permit towers in the R1 district but allowed one in the R2 district, then it violated the Telecom Act\u2019s antidiscrimination provision. 47 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 332(c)(7)(B) prohibits local governments from unreasonably discriminating \u201camong providers of functionally equivalent services.\u201d The County offers no reason why it would permit someone to construct a cellular tower in the R2 district and not the R1 district. And without any reason, discrimination is unreasonable and violates the Telecom Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">[963 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 744.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">The Board\u2019s resolution in the present ease did not attempt to distinguish Comcast\u2019s application from the 1994 application. In addition to being relevant regarding the discrimination issue, the prior approval, involving a higher and larger tower in the same zone, provides additional support for the conclusion that the denial of Comcast\u2019s application was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">I make a concluding observation. Until the ripening of new technology makes these antennas unnecessary, they will be built. If so, then it appears that in most cases their construction in commercial/industrial zones, such as South Plainfield\u2019s M-3 zone, rather than in residential areas, will have the least impact on a community. Moreover, if a municipality may preclude a wireless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>communication facility in an industrial/commercial zone such as the M-3, as the majority holds, then it can prevent the location of such facilities in more restrictive zones. It is unlikely that the federal courts, in applying the TCA, -will permit such limitations on \u2022the development of a competitive wireless communications network.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">I would affirm the Law Division.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-5\"> The TCA was enacted on February 8, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b204-12\"> It is likely that future challenges of local zoning decisions preventing the construction of such facilities will be in the United States District Court. <em>See </em>47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(v); 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1331.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
