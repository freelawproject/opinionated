Thelander, and plaintiffs appeal from the dismissal of their case against him. We reverse the grant of summary judgment to Thelander.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">The issue before us relates to the responsibility of attorney Thelander for the alleged malpractice of Weinstein in letting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>statute of limitations run after he was retained to represent plaintiffs. Plaintiff Mariusz Staron was allegedly injured in an automobile accident on or about October 20, 1985, and the parties agree that the complaint had to be -but was not -filed within two years thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The record before the judge on Thelander\u2019s motion for summary judgment reveals the following. After the accident, plaintiff was referred to Weinstein by a friend. He recalled meeting Weinstein in \u201cat least two\u201d locations. Plaintiff first met with Weinstein at his Elizabeth office and thereafter \u201cin a different place.\u201d He did not recall seeing Weinstein \u201cin any offices that bore the name of Robert Thelander, Esq.\u201d or \u201cat 603 Springfield Avenue in Summit,\u201d Thelander\u2019s address, or \u201cever meeting with\u201d Thelander.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">An \u201cAgreement to Provide Legal Services\u201d (\u201cretainer agreement\u201d), dated November 7, 1985, was executed by plaintiffs and Weinstein. The first page of the agreement refers to \u201cSheldon G. Weinstein, Esq. whose address is 603 Springfield Ave., Summit, NJ\u201d as the \u201claw firm\u201d retained, but on the second page the law firm is listed as \u201cRobert C. Thelander, Esq.\u201d above Weinstein\u2019s signature. In a letter addressed to State Farm County Mutual Insurance Co. (\u201cState Farm\u201d) dated November 8,1985, a day after the retainer was executed, Weinstein wrote on Thelander stationery that \u201cwe represent\u201d Mariusz Staron and requested Personal Injury Protection benefits. Weinstein was listed as \u201cOF COUNSEL\u201d on the top right corner of Thelander\u2019s stationery, and a copy of the letter was sent to plaintiffs. Another letter to State Farm dated the same day on similar Thelander stationery was sent by Weinstein, with a copy to plaintiffs, making a claim based on the driver\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">In his motion for summary judgment Thelander certified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">6. By letter of August 15, 1986, I advised Mr. Weinstein that X was terminating my relationship with him. At that time, my secretary prepared an inventory of pending matters of which I was aware and unpaid bills for services previously rendered and sent them to Mr. Weinstein. With respect to suits in process, I prepared and filed Substitutions of Attorney with various courts involved and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>further wrote to all of the clients of whom I had knowledge, advising them that Mr. Weinstein and I were discontinuing our association and giving them Mr. Weinstein\u2019s home address so that they could contact him directly as their lawyer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">7. My first knowledge of Mr. and Mrs. Staron\u2019s relationship with Mr. Weinstein <em>was </em>upon my being served with the <em>Summons </em>and Complaint in the present matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">8. My relationship with Mr. Weinstein was fully terminated as of September 30, 1986.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">10. At no time did Mr. Weinstein ever advise me of the existence of Mr. and Mrs. Staron as his clients, nor was there any file kept in my office on their behalf to my knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">Plaintiff last met with Weinstein in or around 1989. In that year plaintiff had a second accident but decided to see another attorney because of the delay it was taking to process the first case.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">In granting summary judgment, the motion judge relied on <em>Homa v. Friendly Mobile Manor, Inc., </em>93 <em>Md.App. </em>337, 612 A.2d 322 (1992), <em>cert. granted, </em>329 <em>Md. </em>168, 617 A.2d 1085, <em>and cert. dismissed, </em>330 <em>Md. 318, </em>624 A.2d 490 (1993), and found no \u201capparent authority\u201d by which Weinstein could bind Thelander or his firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\"><em>Homa, supra, </em>involved a suit brought against an attorney and his law firm for fraud, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty owed to the client. One of the issues before the Court of Special Appeals was the liability of the firm for the conduct of attorney Homa. In concluding that Homa had no actual authority to bind the firm, notwithstanding that the \u201cengagement letter\u201d was prepared on the firm stationery with his name listed as \u201cOf Counsel,\u201d 612 A.2d at 334, the court considered the proofs regarding the nature of the services to be rendered, the reasons why plaintiff selected Homa personally to do the work and Homa\u2019s personal involvement as a consultant in the underlying transaction, plaintiffs lack of knowledge of Homa\u2019s \u201caffiliation with [the firm] until he received the engagement letter\u201d and the lack of remuneration to be paid to the firm. <em>Id. </em>at 334. Upon review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>the proofs resulting in the trial court\u2019s judgment for the firm after hearing plaintiffs evidence at trial, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">In addition, it is reasonable to conclude, based on the express terms of the agreement and lack of any evidence indicating otherwise, that Homa was not engaged in this transaction for the benefit of [the Firm], and that [the Firm] was not to receive remuneration or other benefits for the services provided by Homa. Friendly presented no evidence of any contact with [the Firm] at all, or of any payments made to [the Firm].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\"><em>[Homa, supra, </em>612 A.2d at 334.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">With respect to the claim of \u201capparent authority\u201d the <em>Homa </em>court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">The party seeking to rely on the agency relationship based upon apparent authority must establish:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">(1) that the principal has manifested his consent to the exercise of such authority or has knowingly permitted the agent to assume the exercise of such authority; (2) that the third person knew of the facts and, acting in good faith, had reason to believe, and did actually believe, that the agent possessed such authority; and (3) that the third person, relying on such appearance of authority, has changed his position and will be injured or suffer loss if the act done or transaction executed by the agent does not bind the principal. [3 <em>Am.Jur.2d </em>Agency] \u00a7 80 (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">In the ease <em>sub judice, </em>Friendly presented no evidence of any contact with or reliance upon any conduct by [the Firm] that would establish that [the Firm] authorized Homa to act on its behalf in this transaction or that [the Firm] stood to benefit in any way from the agreement between Friendly and Homa. Even though there is one piece of correspondence on [the Firm] letterhead, and as Friendly notes Homa\u2019s personal stationery indicated shared office space with [the Firm], there is no evidence that [the Firm] knew or should have known about this particular transaction. No fees were to be paid to [the Firm]; moreover, fees were to be paid to Homa only if he personally procured a bona fide qualified purchaser for Friendly Manor (the agreement did not provide a separate fee for his legal services). In addition, as discussed <em>supra, </em>the evidence is sufficient to support the finding that Homa was not hired by Rossignol and Weiner because of his association with [the Firm] and would have been hired even if not associated with [the Firm],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-11\"><em>[Homa, supra, </em>612 A.2d at 335.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">We conclude that the motion judge\u2019s reliance on <em>Homa </em>was misplaced. In fact, the <em>Homa </em>court\u2019s review of the evidence presented at trial emphasizes why summary judgment was improperly granted in this case involving a retainer for purposes of litigation. Proper resolution of the issues in this ease requires a detailed evaluation of the facts including whether plaintiffs intend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>ed to retain only Weinstein to represent them as their attorney; whether his relationship with Thelander became relevant to their decision to sign the retainer agreement; whether Thelander was to be involved in the handling of Weinstein\u2019s trials and in whose name the pleadings were to be filed; what fees, if any, Thelander was to receive upon recovery; whether plaintiffs knew of the dissolution of the Thelander relationship before the malpractice occurred and continued to have Weinstein represent them, and why Thelander failed to notify plaintiffs of the dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u201cA lawyer is of counsel if designated as having that relationship with a firm or when the relationship is regular and continuing although the lawyer is neither a partner in the firm nor employed by it on a full-time basis.\u201d Restatement of the Law (Third), <em>Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers, </em>\u00a7 203, cmt. c(ii) (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, 1996). While the term \u201cof counsel\u201d has also been used to signify the attorney responsible for litigation, as opposed to, for example, the lawyer who drafted the brief, the term has also been defined to apply \u201cto the counsel employed by a party in a cause, and particularly to one employed to assist in the preparation or management of an action, or its presentation on appeal, but who is not the principal attorney of record for the party.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>975 (5th ed.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In the context of a motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs made a sufficient showing that Thelander\u2019s firm became counsel for plaintiffs by virtue of both the retainer agreement and the fact that Weinstein had at least apparent authority to enter into such agreements on behalf of the firm. <em>See Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers, supra, </em>\u00a7 26, cmts. a, e (incorporating agency principles including \u201capparent authority to act for the lawyer in undertaking a representation\u201d); Rodriguez v. Hudson County Collision Co., 296 N.J.Super. 213, 220-21, 686 A.2d 776, 779-780 (App.Div.1997).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Vis to a law firm\u2019s vicarious liability, it is established that every partnership member is jointly and severally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>liable for torts committed by other members of the partnership acting within the scope of the firm business. <em>See, e.g., Falzarano v. Leo. </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>315, 320-21, 635 A.2d 547 (App.Div.1993) (this is so even though \u201cthey do not participate in, or ratify, or have knowledge of such negligence or legal malpractice\u201d); <em>R.P.C. </em>5.1; <em>R.P.C. </em>7.5; <em>Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers, </em>\u00a7 79 (Tentative Draft No. 8,1997). Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">Many lawyers practice as partners, members, or associates of law firms. When a client retains a lawyer with such an affiliation, the lawyer\u2019s firm assumes the authority and responsibiliiy of representing that client, unless the circumstances indicate otherwise ... and the firm is liable to the client for the lawyer\u2019s negligence. (See \u00a7 [79] [Chapter 4]). Should the lawyer leave the firm, the client may choose to be represented by the departing lawyer, the lawyer\u2019s former firm, neither or both (see \u00a7\u00a7 43 &amp; 44).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\"><em>[Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers, supra, </em>\u00a7 26, cmt. h.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Having become counsel for plaintiffs, it was the responsibility of the Thelander firm to either terminate the representation or give notice that it was terminated by virtue of Weinstein\u2019s departure.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">In terminating a representation, a lawyer must take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect the client\u2019s interests, such as <em>giving notice to the client of the termination, </em>allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fee the lawyer has not earned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\"><em>[Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers, supra, </em>\u00a7 45(1) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-10\"><em>Cf. Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 79, cmt. (i) (principal\u2019s vicarious liability \u201cdoes not extend to acts and omissions occurring after the lawyer ceased to be a firm principal, except to the extent that failure to give proper notice of a dissolution or withdrawal may result in continuing responsibility for the firm\u2019s affairs.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">Nevertheless, there are some exceptions to the general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-12\">The firm and its principals are ordinarily liable for wrongful acts and omissions of lawyers who have an of-counsel relationship with the firm <em>(see </em>\u00a7 203, Comment (c)(ii)) [quoted above in this opinion], to the extent that and while they are doing firm work. However, the scope of liability for acts of an of-counsel lawyer may be affected by the terms of the of-counsel relationship and the extent of the lawyer\u2019s affiliation to the firm apparent to the lawyer\u2019s clients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-13\"><em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 79, cmt. (c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-14\"><em>See also Homo, supra, </em>612 A.2d at 334-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-15\">It is undisputed that Thelander did not know of plaintiffs\u2019 case, and he gave no notice to plaintiffs of the disillusion of his firm\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>relationship with Weinstein on that ground. It is also uneontested that the malpractice did not occur until over a year after the relationship was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">However, the retainer agreement referred to Thelander as the firm retained. Moreover, no written agreement between Thelander and Weinstein, either when their relationship was created or ended, was produced in discovery or presented to the motion judge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In fact, neither the deposition of Weinstein<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> nor Thelander was taken or considered on the motion. Thus, Thelander\u2019s role in Weinstein\u2019s cases and his entitlement to a share of the proceeds of any recovery obtained by Weinstein was not developed. <em>See R.P.C. </em>1.5(c). Additionally we do not know what systems Thelander developed, or tried to employ, to assure knowledge of, and proper control over, cases which were retained by Weinstein as \u201cof counsel\u201d to his firm. Therefore we reject the theory that Thelander was not liable as a matter of law for any malpractice committed by Weinstein in these circumstances. Accordingly, we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings on the issues raised.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\"> We need not consider if Weinstein had actual authority to enter a retainer agreement on behalf of the Thelander firm at the time it was executed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b269-7\"> The record does include Thelander\u2019s letter to Weinstein, dated August 15, 1986, terminating their relationship as of September 30, 1986. Therein, Thelander mentions knowing nothing about certain matters and complaints he had heard about Weinstein. He refers to the division of fees and trust funds, and says \"I will advise people in regard to pending matters that, as of September 30, 1986, we are no longer associated and that they should contact you in regard to the cases which they have requested you to handle on their behalf.\" The record also contains subsequent letters about fees in given cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b269-8\"> Weinstein was suspended from the practice of law for three months, effective July 15, 1996, \"and until further Order of the [Supreme] Court,\" and should be available as a witness. <em>In re </em>Weinstein, 144 <em>N.J. </em>367, 368-69, 676 A.2d 1086 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
