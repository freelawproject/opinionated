When she reported for work on the morning of February 8, 1991, plaintiff was informed that there were no customers for her to serve and that she could go home. Under the terms of her employment, this meant that plaintiff would receive no compensation for that day. However, plaintiff told the owner of La Cachet, Maria Lopez, that she was going on vacation and asked if she could get a facial. Lopez agreed to this request and assigned defendant Marina Bratsupis to administer the facial using a machine manufactured by defendant Christine Valmy, Inc. (Christine Valmy). At some point during this procedure the machine suddenly emitted scalding water and steam, which caused burning and scarring to plaintiffs neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">Plaintiff brought this personal injury action against La Cachet, Bratsupis and Christine Valmy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After deposing plaintiff, Christine Valmy moved for summary judgment. The trial court grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>ed the motion, concluding in an oral opinion that plaintiff had not produced any expert opinion or other evidence from which a jury could find that the machine manufactured by Christine Valmy was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">When the case was called for trial against La Cachet and Bratsupis, the parties stipulated that the sole liability issue was whether plaintiffs accident occurred during and in the course of her employment and consequently was barred by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-1 to -128, and that this issue could be decided solely on the basis of plaintiffs deposition. The parties also stipulated that if the case was not barred by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, there was no defense to the plaintiffs negligence claim and the case should be scheduled for a trial on damages. The court concluded in a letter opinion that plaintiffs accident had occurred during and in the course of her employment and consequently that her tort action against La Cachet and Bratsupis was barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Plaintiff appeals. We affirm the summary judgment in favor of Christine Valmy. However, we conclude that plaintiffs accident did not occur during and in the course of her employment. Therefore, we reverse the dismissal of plaintiffs complaint against La Cachet and Bratsupis and remand for a trial on damages against these defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Plaintiffs appeal from the dismissal of her product liability claim against Christine Valmy is clearly without merit and does not require extended discussion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E). Plaintiff stated in her answers to interrogatories that she did not intend to present any expert opinion testimony to support this claim. Instead, she indicated that she would rely solely upon statements of two eoworkers at La Cachet that the machine \u201cnever worked right\u201d and \u201calways caused problems.\u201d However, plaintiff did not present any evidence as to when the machine was manufactured, whether La Cachet purchased the machine new or used, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>La Cachet properly maintained the machine, or whether the machine was properly used by La Cachet\u2019s employees. In fact, plaintiff testified that the machine was on the premises prior to the time La Cachet hired the two coworkers whose statements she relies upon in support of her claim against Christine Valmy. Therefore, plaintiff did not present evidence from which a trier of fact could infer without supporting expert testimony that the machine was defective when distributed. <em>Compare Moraca v. Ford Motor Co., </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>454, 460, 332 A.2d 599 (1975); <em>Ventura v. Ford Motor Corp., </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>45, 53, 433 A.2d 801 (App.Div.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">To be compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, an accident must \u201caris[e] out of and in the course of employment.\u201d N.J.S.A 34:15-7. The phrase \u201cin the course of\u2019 employment refers to \u201cthe time, place, and circumstances of the accident in relation to the employment\u201d and the phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 employment refers to the \u201ccausal origin\u201d of an accident. <em>Coleman v. Cycle Transformer Corp., </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>285, 288, 520 A.2d 1341 (1986) (quoting 1 A. Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 6.10 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">We have serious doubt whether plaintiffs accident occurred \u201cin the course of\u2019 employment. Plaintiff would have been within the course of her employment if she had tripped on the carpet at the entrance to the beauty salon when she was reporting for work or as she was departing after being informed that there was no work available. However, we consider it strongly arguable that when plaintiff decided to stay in the shop in order to obtain a facial, she no longer was in the course of her employment but rather occupied the same status as any other customer. The fact that she received the facial on a day she had reported for work appears purely coincidental; she could just as easily have received this treatment on one of her days off. Nevertheless, the prior decisions of our courts have construed this test of compensability quite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>expansively. <em>See, e.g., Coleman v. Cycle Transformer Corp., supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 289-90, 520 A.2d 1341; <em>Mikkelsen v. N.L. Indus., </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>209, 212-13, 370 A.2d 5 (1977). Therefore, despite our reservations, we assume for the purpose of this opinion that plaintiff was still in the course of her employment when the accident occurred and proceed to the question whether the accident \u201carose out of\u2019 that employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">To be found to have \u201caris[en] \u2018out of the employment,\u201d the risk of an accident \u201cmust be of such nature\u201d that it \u201cmight have been contemplated by a reasonable person when entering the employment, as incidental to [that employment].\u201d <em>Coleman v. Cycle Transformer Corp., supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 289, 520 A.2d 1341 (quoting <em>Rafferty v. Dairymen\u2019s League Coop. Ass\u2019n, </em>16 <em>N.J. Misc. </em>363, 366, 200 A. 493 (Dep\u2019t of Labor, Workmen\u2019s Comp. Bureau 1938)). \u201cA risk is incidental to the employment when it belongs to or is connected with what a workman has to do in fulfilling his contract of service.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Applying this basic test, the Supreme Court has identified three categories of risks which may result in an accident arising out of an employment: risks \u201cdistinctly associated\u201d with the employment, such as an employee\u2019s fingers getting caught in a machine; \u201cneutral\u201d risks, such as an employee getting struck by lightning while on the job; and risks that are \u201cpersonal\u201d to an employee, such as a non-work related heart attack suffered while on the job. <em>Id. </em>at 290-92, 520 A.2d 1341. Accidents resulting from risks which are \u201cdistinctly associated\u201d with the employment or \u201cneutral\u201d are compensable, but accidents resulting from \u201cpersonal\u201d risks are non-compensable. <em>Id. </em>at 291-92, 520 A.2d 1341.. The Court described \u201cpersonal risks\u201d as including those which arise from the \u201cpersonal proclivities\u201d of the employee and consequently have a \u201cminimal\u201d connection to the employment. <em>Id. </em>at 292, 520 A.2d 1341 (quoting <em>Howard v. Harwood\u2019s Restaurant Co., </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>72, 85, 135 A.2d 161 (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">We conclude that plaintiffs accident arose from a \u201cpersonal risk\u201d because she had a facial at her employer\u2019s beauty salon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>solely for her own personal benefit. We recognize that an accident which occurs while an employee is engaged in an activity to improve her appearance which is mandated or encouraged by the employer may be found to arise out of the employment. <em>See Watson v. Nassau Inn, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>155, 376 A.2d 1215 (1977). However, plaintiff testified that even though Lopez was extremely concerned about the appearance of her employees and insisted that they get their haircuts and manicures at La Cachet, she never directed or encouraged plaintiff to get a facial. In fact, plaintiff had received only two or three facials during the four years she was employed at La Cachet, and she asked Lopez for permission to receive a facial solely because she was going on vacation. Moreover, when asked at her deposition whether it was necessary for her to have a facial on a routine basis \u201cto make the proper presentation ... as a professional in a beauty business,\u201d plaintiff responded: \u201cI look good without a facial.\u201d Because the employer provided the free facial for plaintiffs benefit rather than to serve the employer\u2019s interests, plaintiffs accident did not arise out of a risk that belong[ed] to or [was] connected with what [she had] to do in fulfilling [her] contract of service. <em>Coleman v. Cycle Transformer Corp., supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 289, 520 A.2d 1341. Instead, it was solely the \u201cpersonal proclivities\u201d of the employee which gave rise to the harm. <em>Id. </em>at 292, 520 A.2d 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the summary judgment in favor of Christine Valmy but reverse the dismissal of plaintiffs complaint against La Cachet and Bratsupis and remand the case for a trial on damages against these defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-13\"> Plaintiff also filed a petition for workers' compensation, which was settled prior to any adjudication of whether her accident occurred during and in the course of employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
