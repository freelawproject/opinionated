Although the inmate agreed to deliver the note to defendant\u2019s codefendant who was housed in a different section of the jail, he instead surrendered it to the county prosecutor. We hold that the State did not deliberately extract the incriminating information in the absence of counsel, and the statement was thus properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">A jury found defendant guilty of conspiracy <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-2), first degree robbery <em>(N.J.S.A </em>2C;15-1), second degree aggravated assault <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-lb(l)), and possession of imitation cocaine with intent to distribute <em>(N.J.S.A </em>20:35-11). The' trial court sentenced defendant to sixteen years imprisonment on the conviction for first degree robbery and to a concurrent four year term on the imitation drug count. The remaining convictions were merged.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The convictions emanated out of a bizarre plot by defendant, Michael Noble, and Theodoros Merias, to sell fake cocaine to Alan Vitkosky, an undercover agent posing as a drug purchaser. As originally conceived, the plan called for defendant and his companions to exchange crumpled cookies disguised to look like cocaine for the payment of $3,300. The scheme went awry, however, when Noble reached into Vitkosky\u2019s waistband in an attempt to relieve him of his money and instead found a gun. In the ensuing struggle, defendant kicked Vitkosky\u2019s face, shattering his nose. Back-up units were immediately alerted, and defendant and his accomplices were quickly arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">At trial, defendant conceded that he, Noble and Merias attempted to sell imitation drugs to Vitkosky. He contended, however, that Vitkosky became upset when he realized that the \u201ccocaine\u201d that had been shown to him was really crumpled cookies. Defendant testified he kicked Vitkosky only when the agent reached for his gun. Defendant claimed that he was unaware of the fact that Vitkosky was a police officer, and that he had acted in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Noble\u2019s version of the incident substantially corroborated defendant\u2019s account. Noble testified that in the course of transferring the fake cocaine, he noticed a gun protruding from Vitkosky\u2019s waistband. As he and defendant attempted to flee, Vitkosky \u201cspun to the side,\u201d apparently reaching for the weapon. Noble claimed that he and defendant struggled with Vitkosky in an attempt to disarm him, and that they realized Vitkosky was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>police officer only when they heard sirens from nearby police cars. However, immediately after his arrest, Noble gave a written statement to the police in which he admitted that he and defendant attacked Vitkosky in an attempt to relieve him of his money which both men believed was concealed in the officer\u2019s waistband. Noble\u2019s written statement was read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The State was also permitted to admit in evidence a letter defendant had written to Noble while the two men were confined in the Mercer County Detention Center. In the letter, defendant instructed Noble to tell his lawyer that they never intended to sell narcotics to Vitkosky and that they struck the officer because he was about to pull a gun from his waistband. Defendant had given the letter to Robert Packlaian, an inmate assigned to the jail\u2019s law library, with the direction that it be delivered to Noble. At defendant\u2019s behest, Packlaian had previously delivered a note to Noble and had arranged a meeting between the two men. This time, however, Packlaian notified Investigator Lester Worthington of the Mercer County Prosecutor\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Packlaian had first met Worthington several months earlier. On that occasion, Packlaian received information about a homicide and reported what he learned to Detective William Hunt, a member of the Ewing Township Police Department. Hunt contacted Worthington, who then interviewed Packlaian. According to Packlaian, neither Hunt nor Worthington asked him to obtain additional information. However, several months later, another inmate, William Green, gave Packlaian a note in which he confessed that he had killed his wife and wanted to plead \u201ctemporary insanity.\u201d Packlaian reported the incident to Worthington. While making no specific promises to Packlaian, Worthington mentioned that he was aware of the charges then pending against him, and stated that he would apprise the appropriate authorities of his cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">During his conversation with Worthington about the Green matter, Packlaian suddenly interjected the information he had received from defendant. Worthington knew nothing about defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>dant\u2019s case. After obtaining directions from his supervisor, however, Worthington returned to the jail and retrieved defendant\u2019s letter from Paeklaian. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s pretrial motion to suppress, finding that Paeklaian had not acted as a government agent in obtaining the letter and that the State had not deliberately elicited defendant\u2019s incriminating statement in the absence of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">We first address defendant\u2019s argument that admission of his letter to Noble violated his right to counsel. Defendant claims that the State used Paeklaian as an investigatory tool with the specific intent of extracting incriminating information in the absence of his attorney. We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The purpose of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is to \u201cenable the defendant to confront the prosecution and to ensure the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>261, 265, 609 A.2d 400 (1992). The constitutional right is premised on the notion that the \u201caverage defendant does not have the professional legal skill to protect himself.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 <em>U.S. </em>458, 462-63, 58 <em>S.Ct. </em>1019, 1022, 82 <em>L.Ed. </em>1461, 1465 (1938). Because of its \u201cexalted status,\u201d in the hierarchy of constitutional protections, <em>State v. Tucker, </em>265 <em>N.J.Super. </em>296, 326, 626 A.2d 1105 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>259, 645 A.2d 111 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>1090, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>751, 130 L.Ed.2d 651 (1995), the right to counsel attaches at or immediately after the \u201cinitiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Kirby v. Illinois, </em>406 <em>U.S. </em>682, 689, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1877, 1882, 32 L.Ed.2d 411, 417-18 (1972); <em>see also, Michigan v. Jackson, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>625, 629, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1404, 1407, 89 L.Ed.2d 631, 638 (1986). It is undisputed that formal adversarial proceedings had been instituted against defendant when he gave Paeklaian the letter to be delivered to Noble. At issue, therefore, is whether the letter was obtained in violation of defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Once the right to counsel has attached and has been asserted, the State is obliged to honor it. This obligation encompasses more than preventing the accused from obtaining the assistance of counsel. <em>Maine v. Moulton, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>159, 170-71, 106 <em>S.Ct. 477, </em>484, 88 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>481, 492 (1985). The Sixth Amendment also \u201cimposes on the State an affirmative obligation to respect and preserve the accused\u2019s choice to seek this assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 484, 88 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 492. The police and the prosecutor may not act \u201cin a manner that circumvents [or] dilutes the protection afforded by the right to counsel\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The constitutional guaranty protects against governmental intrusion into the \u201cintimate relationship\u201d between a defendant and his attorney. <em>State v. Sugar, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>1, 13, 417 A.2d 474 (1980). It applies with equal force in the more subtle context of indirect and surreptitious interrogations involving \u201cjailhouse informants.\u201d <em>State v. Bey, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>451, 468, 610 A.2d 403 (App.Div.1992), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>19, 611 A.2d 657 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The seminal case involving a violation of the Sixth Amendment by questioning a represented defendant in the absence of an attorney is <em>Massiah v. United States, </em>377 <em>U.S. </em>201, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>1199, 12 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>246 (1964). There, incriminating statements of a defendant, indicted but free on bail, were secretly monitored by a \u201cbody wire\u201d on the person of a codefendant who had agreed to act as an informant. The statements were admitted at trial. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the defendant had been denied his Sixth Amendment rights when \u201chis own incriminating words ... [were] deliberately elicited from him [by the federal agents] after he had been indicted and in the absence of counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1203, <em>12 L.Ed.2d </em>at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\"><em>United States v. Henry, </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>264, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2183, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d 115 </em>(1980), followed in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Massiah. </em>In <em>Henry, </em>the defendant confessed to an inmate that he had participated in a bank robbery. The inmate was a paid informer who allegedly had been placed in the same cell as the defendant by federal agents in order to secure information eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>cerning the robbery. He had been told by the agents to \u201cbe alert to any incriminating statements, but not to initiate any conversation or question [the defendant].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2187, 65 L.Ed.2d at 119. The Supreme Court reversed the conviction, holding there was a violation of the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right not to be questioned without his attorney present. <em>Id. </em>at 274, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2189, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 125. In reaching this conclusion, the Court reasoned that the defendant\u2019s incarceration at the time he was engaged in a conversation by the informer \u201cma[d]e him particularly susceptible to the ploys of [the] undercover ... agent\u201d because he and the informer appeared to \u201cshare[ ] a common plight.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court said in this context that it was not critical to determine who instigated the subject of the crime under investigation, but it was only necessary that a \u201c \u2018deliberate elicitation\u2019 of incriminating statements\u201d had occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 272, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2187, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">These principles were subsequently applied in <em>Maine v. Moulton, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>159, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>477, 88 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>481. There, the police entered into an agreement with the defendant\u2019s codefendant to tape record conversations relating to the theft of automobiles. Although the defendant initiated the incriminating conversations that were recorded, the Court held that \u201cknowing exploitation by the State of an opportunity to confront the accused without counsel\u201d constituted a violation of the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 176, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 487, 88 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 496. The Court added that \u201c[i]t was the police who suggested to [the codefendant] that he record his telephone conversations with [the defendant] ... and [it was the police who] put a body wire transmitter on him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176-77, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 487, 88 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 496. By taking this action, the State was said to have \u201cknowingly circumvented Moulton\u2019s right to have counsel present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 489, 88 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The Court last revisited this subject in <em>Kuhlmann v. Wilson, </em>477 <em>U.S. </em>436, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2616, 91 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>364 (1986). There, as in <em>Henry, </em>the defendant, who was charged with murder and robbery, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>was placed in a jail cell with a paid informer. In a conversation \u25a0with the informer, the defendant initially denied that he was involved in the crimes. The informer responded that defendant\u2019s denial \u201cdid not sound too good.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439-40, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2619, 91 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 372. Several days later, the defendant admitted to the informer that he had committed the murder and robbery. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>finding that the facts were indistinguishable from those in <em>Henry. Wilson v. Henderson, </em>742 <em>F.</em>2d 741, 746-47 (2d Cir.1984). The Supreme Court reversed, holding that \u201ca defendant does not make out a violation [of the Sixth Amendment] simply by showing that an informant, either through prior arrangement or voluntarily, reported his incriminating statements to the police.\u201d 477 U.S. at 459, 106 S.Ct. at 2630, 91 L.Ed.2d at 384. Instead, \u201cthe defendant must demonstrate that the police and their informant took some action, beyond merely listening, that was designed deliberately to elicit incriminating remarks.\u201d Ibid. In reaching this result, the Court stressed that \u201cthe primary concern of the <em>Massiah </em>line of decisions is secret interrogation by investigatory techniques that are the equivalent of direct police interrogation.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Against this backdrop, candor requires us to confess our difficulty in reconciling several of these decisions. However, we are able to distill several unifying themes. The existence or absence of an explicit agreement or prearrangement between law enforcement and an informer is obviously an important factor in determining whether the informer is serving as a government agent in an attempt to secure information against the accused. <em>See, e.g., Thomas v. Cox, </em>708 <em>F.2d </em>132, 136-37 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 <em>U.S. </em>918, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>284, 78 L.Ed.2d 262 (1983). Similarly, governmental involvement placing an informant near the defendant may be a critical circumstance in determining whether incriminating information has been deliberately elicited by the State in the absence of the accused\u2019s attorney. <em>See, e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>Lightbourne v. Dugger, </em>829 F.2d 1012, 1021 (11th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>835 F.2d 291 (11th Cir.1987); <em>cert. denied, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>934, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>329, 102 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>346 (1988); <em>Colorado v. Freeman, </em>739 P.2d 856, 859 (Colo.Ct.App.1987). Another criterion is the source of the informer\u2019s motivation \u2014 specifically, whether he or she has been promised a reward in return for obtaining information. <em>State v. Nations, </em>319 <em>N.C. </em>318, 325, 354 S.E.2d 510, 514 (1987). While no \u201cdefinitive test\u201d has yet been developed in determining whether an informer serves as a government agent in obtaining incriminating information and whether the State\u2019s involvement is sufficient to ground a finding of \u201cdeliberate elicitation,\u201d the factors we have described form a valuable analytical framework for resolution of these issues. <em>See </em>James J. Tonkovicz, <em>An Adversary System Defense of the Right to Counsel Against Informants: Truth, Fair Play, and the Massiah Doctrine, </em>22 <em>U.C. Davis L.Rev. </em>1, 92 n. 283 (1988),</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Applying these principles, we are in accord with the Law Division\u2019s finding that Packlaian was not serving as a government agent when he obtained defendant\u2019s letter and that the State did not deliberately elicit the incriminating information in the absence of counsel. The record is barren of any evidence suggesting the existence of an explicit or implicit agreement between Packlaian and the prosecution to secure information from defendant. Nor does the evidence indicate that the State was involved in placing Packlaian near the defendant in order to trick him into confessing. While perhaps Packlaian wished to curry favor with the prosecutor, no specific promise of lenity had been made to him at the time he was approached by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The simple and overriding fact is that defendant revealed his guilt unwittingly. But it is no more unfair to use the evidence he exposed through his lack of guile than it is to turn against him clues at the scene of the crime that a brighter, better informed, or more gifted criminal would have hidden. The Sixth Amendment \u201cis not violated whenever \u2014 by luck or happenstance \u2014 the State obtains incriminating statements from the accused after the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>to counsel has attached.\u201d <em>Maine v. Moulton, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>at 176, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 487, 88 L.Ed.2d at 496 (Powell, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Packlaian voluntarily reported defendant\u2019s statement to the police after initially aiding him in arranging a meeting with Noble. Undoubtedly, defendant\u2019s reliance on Packlaian\u2019s loyalty was misplaced. However, neither an ordinary citizen nor an inmate in jail should be discouraged from reporting what he knows to the authorities and from lending his aid in surrendering evidence of crime he has obtained. We doubt the soundness of a rule that would insulate defendant from Packlaian\u2019s apostasy. It was defendant\u2019s poor luck or poor thinking in enlisting Packlaian that led to the disclosure of incriminating evidence. It was not the State\u2019s violation of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">In his principal brief, defendant additionally contends: (1) the trial court erred by permitting a witness to read to the jury Noble\u2019s prior statement to the police, (2) the trial court erroneously denied a motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case, (3) the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, and (4) the sentences were manifestly excessive. In a <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief, defendant claims: (1) he was deprived of a fair trial because the trial judge failed to notify him that she was acquainted with a juror and (2) he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">The arguments advanced in the principal brief are clearly without merit and do not require extended discussion. <em>B. </em>2:11-3(e)(2). The trial court properly exercised its discretion in permitting the prosecution to read to the jury Noble\u2019s prior inconsistent statement made to the apprehending officer. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>613(b), 803(a)(1). In his trial testimony, Noble stated that he and defendant attacked Vitkosky because they noticed a gun tucked in his waistband. On cross-examination, the prosecutor questioned Noble regarding his statement made to the arresting officer at the time the crime was committed. In Noble\u2019s prior statement, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>admitted that he \u201csaw a bulge in Vitkosky\u2019s waist and ... figured he had the money there and [he] was going to take it.\u201d Noble\u2019s statement at the time of his arrest was materially inconsistent with his trial testimony and was properly admitted for the truth of the matter asserted. <em>See State v. Pasha, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>265, 270, 655 A.2d 92 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>453, 663 A.2d 1360 (1995); <em>State v. Ross, </em>162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>47, 51, 392 A.2d 210 (App.Div.1978), aff<em>'d in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>239, 403 A.2d 457 (1979); <em>State v. Ramos, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>530, 538, 526 A.2d 284 (App.Div.1987); <em>State v. Provet, </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>432, 436-38, 337 A.2d 374 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>174, 343 A.2d 462 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The evidence was sufficient to withstand defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal, and the jury\u2019s verdict did not constitute a miscarriage of justice. Giving the State the benefit of all its favorable testimony as well as all legitimate inferences flowing from its proofs, a reasonable jury could find guilt of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 459, 236 A.2d 385 (1967). Specifically, the jury could reasonably find based on the evidence that defendant and his accomplices either inflicted or attempted to inflict serious bodily injury on Vitkosky while in the course of attempting to steal the victim\u2019s money. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1. Moreover, the jury\u2019s verdict did not constitute a manifest denial of justice but instead was supported by ample evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">We perceive no sound basis to disturb the sentences imposed. While perhaps the trial court \u201cdouble counted\u201d several aggravating factors, <em>see State v. Jarbath, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>394, 404-05, 555 A.2d 559 (1989), we are satisfied that the overall sentences were fair and well deserved. <em>But see State v. Mara, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>204, 214, 601 A.2d 718 (App.Div.1992); <em>State v. Varona, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>474, 491, 577 A.2d 524 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>386, 585 A.2d 389 (1990),</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Finally, we are entirely unpersuaded by the arguments advanced in defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief. Initially, we reject defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>contention that he was deprived of a fair trial because he was not informed of the trial judge\u2019s relationship with the foreman of the jury. Defendant\u2019s contention is factually inaccurate. During the selection of the jury, the judge apprised the parties that she was acquainted with Alfred Ramey, a prospective juror. The judge noted that she had once worked with Mr. Ramey, who was presently employed as an assistant attorney general. Neither the prosecutor nor defendant requested additional information on the subject. Because Mr. Ramey had been placed in the first seat of the jury box, he was appointed jury foreman. Clearly, the relationship between the trial judge and the juror was fully disclosed. Although defendant had not exhausted his peremptory challenges, he chose to have Ramey remain on the jury. Plainly, no error occurred, and no prejudice resulted. We do not reach the merits respecting defendant\u2019s claim of deprivation of effective assistance of counsel because his argument rests upon facts not contained in the present record. While we note that the present record indicates defendant was ably and vigorously represented by his attorney, we cannot fairly adjudicate defendant\u2019s claim. Our affirmance of defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences is, of course, without prejudice to his right to file a petition for post-conviction relief with respect to this point. <em>See State v. Preciose, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>451, 462, 609 A.2d 1280 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
