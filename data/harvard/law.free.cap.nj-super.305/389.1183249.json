Pursuant to that regulation, the individualized education program each local district must develop for a handicapped child must include in its description of the child\u2019s education program \u201cany specialized equipment and materials\u201d necessary. In contrast, the governing federal statutes, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1400 to -1485, amended by Pub.L. No. 105-17, \u00a7 601 to -657, 111 Stat. 37 (1997) (20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1400 to -1491(o) (1997)) <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act, (Technology Act), 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2201 to -2288, require as part of a child\u2019s education program consideration of \u201cassistive technology devices\u201d and \u201cassistive technology services\u201d as defined in the IDEA and Technology Act. Plaintiff, New Jersey Protection and Advocacy, Inc., contends that the terminology the State regulation uses is different from and, facially at least, more narrow than the federal terminology and therefore is invalid. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\n<em>I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Before we discuss the applicable federal and State law, some background in connection with the present dispute between the parties may be helpful. On April 4,1994, the Department published proposed amendments to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:28-2.10, 3.6 and 4.3, including the amendment to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:28-3.6(d)(5)(xv) specifically at issue in this matter. 26 <em>N.J.R. </em>1422, 1423 (April 4, 1994). As proposed, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:28-3.6(d)(5)(xv) would require that the individualized education program (IEP) of a child with a disability must include \u201cany specialized equipment or materials\u201d necessary to ensure that the child receives a free appropriate public education (FAPE) as required by IDEA. <em>See </em>20 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1400(c), amended by Pub.L. No 107-17, \u00a7 601(d)(1)(A), 111 Stat. 42 (1997) (20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(a) (1997)); 20 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1412(1), (2)(A)(i), amended by Pub.L. No. 105-07, \u00a7 612(a)(1), 111 Stat. 60 (1997) (20 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1412(a)(l)(1997)). Prior to the amendment, <em>N.J.AC. </em>6:28-3.6(d)(5)(xv) provided that the child study team need only include any specialized equipment. During the regulatory process on this proposed amendment, the Department was requested to specifically incorporate the federal terms \u201cassistive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>technology, services and training\u201d into <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:28-6(d)(5)(xv). By letter dated May 2, 1994, Deborah Bain, chairperson of the Technology Assistive Resource Program (TARP), pointed out that the purpose of the Technology Act was to \u201cexpand the availability of assistive technology services and devices to individuals with disabilities.\u201d TARP recommended that the Department amend <em>N.J.AC. </em>6:28-3.6(d)(5)(xv) to specifically include these common federal terms to facilitate greater understanding and effective communication between and among departments and provide consumers with a broader spectrum of equipment and services options.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In addition, on May 4, 1994, the New Jersey Department of the Public Advocate, Division of Advocacy for the Developmentally Disabled (DADD), plaintiffs predecessor agency, also submitted comments to the proposed amendments. DADD expressed concern that the federal terms \u201cassistive technology devices\u201d and \u201cassistive technology services\u201d were not specifically identified as items the local school districts would be required to consider and to provide to qualified students through the IEP planning process. DADD recommended that the Department revise the proposed amendments to include \u201cassistive technology devices\u201d and \u201cassistive technology services\u201d as items required for consideration during the IEP planning process.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In response, the Department determined that the proposed amendment should only modify \u201cspecialized equipment\u201d to include \u201cspecialized materials\u201d 26 <em>N.J.R. </em>2787 (July 5,1994). In rejecting the requests to use the federal terminology, the Department stated that it \u201cbelieves that assistive technology [was] included in specialized equipment and materials. In addition, assistive technology [including environmental adaptations] is referenced at <em>N.J.AC. </em>6:28-4.2(a)(l)(v) under program options. Therefore, the Department believes that the issue is addressed in regulation.\u201d 26 <em>N.J.R. </em>2787-88. And so the Department adopted the proposed amendment without the federal terminology. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The IDEA (formerly the Education of All Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA)), provides federal money to assist states and local agencies in educating handicapped children. <em>Hendrick Hudson Dist.

Thus, Congress intended the Technology Act to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>(E) <em>increase and promote coordination among State </em>agencies, and between State agencies and private entities that are involved in carrying out activities under this subchapter ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">(F) (i) <em>increase the awareness of laws, regulations, </em>policies, practices, procedures, and organizational structures, <em>that facilitate the availability or provision of assistive technology devices and assistive technology services; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">(ii) <em>facilitate the change of laws, regulations, </em>policies, practices, procedures and organizational structures, <em>that impede the availability or provision of assistive technology devices and assistive technology services;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">(I) <em>increase awareness and knowledge of the efficacy of assistive technology devices and assistive technology services </em>among\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">(i) <em>individuals with disabilities and their family members, ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">(iii) <em>educators </em>and related service personnel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">[29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 2201(b)(l)(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">Importantly, states receiving funds shall provide an assurance to develop, implement, and monitor state laws and regulations \u201cthat will improve access to, provision of, funding for, and timely acquisition and delivery of, assistive technology devices and assistive technology services____\u201d 29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 2212(e)(7)(B)(i).

During the regulatory process, the De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>partment seemed to be in agreement that the federal terms were applicable, but believed its own proposed language was sufficient. In response to the appeal, we sense that the Department now may be asserting some equivocation as to what it must do under the federal laws. If the Department agrees the federal terms and their definition under federal law are applicable, we do not understand why it has generated the present confrontation by not, with the use of whatever language may be deemed appropriate, making it clear to all who read the regulations that the category \u201cspecialized equipment and materials\u201d does include \u201cassistive technology devices and services\u201d as defined by the Technology Act and as expressly incorporated into the IDEA, as have other agencies of this State. <em>See N.J.AC. </em>10:46 \u2014 2.3(d)(3) (Department of Human Services, Division of Developmental Disabilities, \u201csupport services\u201d include \u201cassistive devices\u201d); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:45-1.2 (Department of Labor, Division of Vocational Rehabilitation Services, \u201crehabilitative technology\u201d includes \u201crehabilitative engineering, assistive technology devices, and assistive technology services\u201d). <em>And see, Fla.

There we considered a special education regulation adopted by the Department in light of an IDEA requirement that participating states develop plans to provide all handicapped children with appropriate public education \u201cregardless of the severity of their handicap.\u201d The Department of Education\u2019s regulation had narrowed the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the statute by not requiring the handicap to be a \u201cserious\u201d one. Like the present case, the Department labeled the plaintiffs concern a \u201cquibble over semantics\u201d and assured that a child with a worsening condition would be identified as having a \u201cserious\u201d impairment. <em>Id. </em>at 161, 497 A.2d 1272. Finding the Department\u2019s assurance insufficient, we expressed concern that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ash\">the regulation impermissibly narrows the statutory language and frustrates the policy embodied in it. We are concerned that the professionals will follow its plain meaning rather than its unexpressed intention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 162, 497 A.2d 1272.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">We said that \u201c[s]ince the regulations are written to be read and followed by nonlawyers in hundreds of school districts across the state, a statewide knowing wink at the plain meaning of the language of the regulation is not a reliable solution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163-64, 497 A.2d 1272. Thus, we invalidated the Department\u2019s regulation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The amendment here fails to include a definition of \u201cspecialized equipment and materials.\u201d While the amendment does refer to \u201cassistive technology including environmental adaptations,\u201d it is not in the context of an IEP, but rather in the context of \u201c[a] full continuum of alternative placements\u201d and as an educational program option for education in the regular classroom. <em>N.J.AC. </em>6:28-4.2(a)(l)(v). \u201cAssistive technology devices and services\u201d as defined under the federal law are not so limited. Moreover, the amendment does not provide a more specific definition of what constitutes \u201cassistive technology.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6:28-1.3 does state that words and terms, unless otherwise defined in the regulations, \u201cshall be defined in the same manner as those words and terms used in the [IDEA].\u201d But since the critical federal terms, \u201cassistive technology <em>devices </em>and <em>services </em>\u201d are not included in the regulation, this would suggest the federal definitional provisions for them are not applicable at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Plaintiff posits that \u201c[e]xamples of assistive technology devices range from a wheelchair accessible desk to enable a child to complete class assignments, to customized cushions to enable a child to be properly and comfortably positioned so he or she can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>fully concentrate and participate in class work and discussions, to a communications device that allows a child without speech or hearing to communicate with teachers and other students. Examples of corresponding assistive technology services range from an evaluation of the student who needs the device, to training to use the device for the student, and his or her teachers, aides and parents.\u201d These examples would indeed appear to fall within the federal definitions. <em>See </em>29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 2202(2), (3); 20 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1401(a)(25), (26), as amended by Pub.L. No. 105-17, \u00a7 602(1), (2), 111 Stat. 37, 42 (1997) (20 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1401(1), (2) (1997)). Facially, the State category of \u201cspecialized equipment and materials\u201d is not so broad. While it might encompass the examples of assistive technology <em>devices, </em>it would not appear to encompass the examples of assistive technology <em>services.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">It may well be that, as intended by the Department, both \u201cassistive technology devices\u201d and \u201cassistive technology services\u201d as defined in the federal law, are to be considered by the local districts in developing a child\u2019s IEP as \u201cspecialized equipment or materials.\u201d But it is not the Department that acts upon and utilizes <em>N.JAC. </em>6:28-3.6 in the first instance. That responsibility is at the local level. We have no assurance that the Department\u2019s intentions are fully understood, or that the full extent of what might be available as an \u201cassistive technology device or service\u201d under the federal law is known. And even if the local district personnel are aware of that, we doubt the regulation as presently written would convey that to a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">To make the availability of these devices and services known and accessible, in part, was the purpose of Congress\u2019 adoption of the Technology Act as part of the IDEA requirements. Use of the term \u201cspecialized equipment and materials,\u201d without any definition at all simply does not further that purpose. Indeed, it may hinder it.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">We briefly address the Department\u2019s reliance upon the September 29, 1994 letter from the Assistant Secretary of the United States Department of Education (USDOE) conditionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>approving the Department\u2019s education plan for 1995 to 1997. First, plaintiff was not a party to that approval process. Second, the State\u2019s reliance upon <em>Georgia Assoc. of Retarded Citizens v. McDaniel, </em>716 F.2d 1565, 1572 (11th Cir.1983), <em>cert. granted and judgment vacated, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>1213, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>3581, 82 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>880 (1984), <em>modified on remand and on other grounds, </em>740 F.2d 902 (1984), as support for its contention that the federal approval is dispositive, is misplaced. There the court recognized there is no statutory provision by which a concerned parent may challenge a state plan once it has been approved by the USDOE. But in striking down a Georgia state provision, approved by the USDOE, which allowed only 180 days of school for each special education student without considering each student\u2019s individual needs, the court stated \u201c[w]e do not find that approval of [the] state plan ... creates any presumption as to the legality of the 180 day policy____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1573.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Likewise, we find the Department\u2019s somewhat extensive discussion of the USDOE regulations and interpretations thereof as not particularly helpful. As we understand the Department\u2019s contentions, these regulations and interpretations demonstrate that \u201cthe USDOE [does] not view assistive technology devices and services as some new requirement imposed upon the State. Rather, assistive technology devices and services simply are part of the special education, related services and supplementary aids and services that have always been required to be provided to children with disabilities.\u201d That may well be so. We do not suggest that if the Department expressly includes the federal terminology in its regulations that should herald new devices or services. The point is, the Department\u2019s terminology does not facially seem to include what the Department says it includes. If it is the Department\u2019s fear that by including the exact language of \u201cassistive technology devices and services,\u201d local school districts will be required to provide more than the federal government requires under those terms, that clearly can not be so. It is of course the federal parameters that form the boundaries of a child\u2019s IEP. The Department\u2019s regulation must clearly include those boundaries, if only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>ensure that all affected know that is so, and all are on an equal playing field, not subject to the varying knowledge and interpretive abilities of those calling the plays.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">We thus invalidate <em>N.J.AC. </em>6:28-3.6(d)(5)(xv) to the extent that it does not make clear that \u201cassistive technology devices\u201d and \u201cassistive technology services,\u201d as defined under federal law, are to be considered in developing a child\u2019s IEP. We remand to the Department for promulgation and adoption of an amendment to <em>N.J AC. </em>6:28-3.6 consistent with this opinion. We do not mandate any particular form of amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-12\"> Effective June 1997, the IDEA was substantially amended.
