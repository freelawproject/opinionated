BALDRIDGE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">POINT II THE COURT\u2019S DECISION TO FORBID THE APPELLANT FROM EXPOSING THE CHILDREN TO MR. BALDRIDGE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS IT IMPINGES UPON APPELLANT\u2019S RIGHT TO MARRY MR. BALDRIDGE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">POINT III THE COURT\u2019S USE OF ITS \u201cPARENS PATRIAE\u201d RESPONSIBILITY IN THE WITHIN MATTER IS MISPLACED AND CONSTITUTES REVERSIBLE ERROR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">POINT IV WHAT THE RESPONDENT DID, IN ACTUALITY WAS RESTRAIN MR.

BALDRIDGE IN ANY MANNER.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-12\">POINT VII THE COURT ERRED IN REGARD TO BOTH THE AMOUNT OF AND THE DURATION OF REHABILITATIVE ALIMONY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-13\">POINT VIII THE COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN NOT AWARDING COUNSEL FEES TO THE APPELLANT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-14\">Our careful review of the record leads us to conclude that these contentions are without merit and require only the following discussion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(A)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-16\">The trial testimony revealed instances of abusive conduct by Baldridge against the children of two of his prior wives, and there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the trial judge\u2019s finding that the Mishlen children \u201cwould be in danger with Mr. Baldridge.\u201d <em>See Rova Farms Resort Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 483-84, 323 A.2d 495 (1974). Defendant\u2019s.contention that there was no proof that Baldridge \u201cacted in an inappro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>priate way to the two children of [the Mishlen] marriage\u201d is irrelevant to the ultimate issue of their safety, as there was proof of a pattern of abuse of children with whom he previously lived. Moreover, the children need not become a member of Baldridge\u2019s household or become \u201cvictim[s] of domestic violence\u201d so that a domestic violence restraining order can be obtained. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-19(d). A restraining order can be obtained as part of the matrimonial proceedings relating to the custody of the children. <em>Cf. N.B. v. T.B., </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>35, 42, 687 A.2d 766 (App.Div.1997) (\u201cDisputes which do not rise to the level of domestic violence can and should be addressed and resolved by the Chancery Division, Family Part ... without necessarily relying on the Domestic Violence Act\u201d). As the Supreme Court recently said in <em>Kimella v. Kinsella, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>276, 317-18, 696 A.2d 556 (1997):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">Of course, the primary and overarching consideration [in making a custody decision] is the best interest of the child. <em>See Fantony, supra, </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>at 536 [122 A.2d 593] (\u201cOur law in a cause involving the custody of a child is that the paramount consideration is the safety, happiness, physical, mental and moral welfare of a child\u201d). The best-interest analysis is an additional requirement \u201csuperimposed upon an analysis of the statutory scheme.\u201d Moreover, that analysis requires the court to consider any and all material evidence____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">The \u201cbest-interestof-the-child\u201d standard is more than a statement of the primary criterion for decision or the factors to be considered; it is an expression of the court\u2019s special responsibility to safeguard the interests of the child at the center of a custody dispute because the child cannot be presumed to be protected by the adversarial process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">[Id. at 317-18, 696 A.2d 556 (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Defendant argues that by restraining her from exposing the children to Mr. Baldridge, the Family Part judge essentially infringed upon her constitutional right to marry Mr. Baldridge. While defendant testified at the trial that she had no present \u201cplans to marry Mr. Baldridge\u201d at the time, we address the issue in light of her testimony that she wanted to \u201cestablish a normal relationship\u201d with Baldridge and her children together, and then decide about her future with Baldridge in that context.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">In <em>Zablocki v. Redhail, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>374, 383, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>673, 679, 54 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>618, 628 (1978), the United States Supreme Court de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>dared that \u201cthe right to marry is of fundamental importance,\u201d giving rise to the right of privacy protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process clause. <em>See also, e.g., Boddie v. Connecticut, </em>401 <em>U.S. </em>371, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>780, 28 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>113 (1971); <em>Loving v. Virginia, </em>388 <em>U.S. </em>1, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967). The <em>Zablocki </em>decision concerned a Wisconsin statute which required court approval of a marriage by a parent with a prior support obligation. The Court concluded that the statute was unconstitutional because it \u201cunnecessarily impinge[d] on the right to marry\u201d and \u201csignificantly interfere^] with the exercise of a fundamental right\u201d without being \u201cclosely tailored to effectuate\u201d the legitimate state interests of counselling the parent of \u201cthe necessity of fulfilling his prior support obligations\u201d and of protecting \u201cthe welfare of the out-of-custody children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 682, 54 L.Ed.2d at 631-32. Significantly, the Court found that the Wisconsin statute \u201cinterfered] directly and substantially with the right to marry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 681, 54 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 631; <em>id. </em>at 391, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 683, 54 L.Ed.2d at 634 (Burger, C.J., concurring) (noting the \u201cintentional and substantial interference with the right to marry.\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Neither <em>Zablocki </em>nor any case brought to our attention suggests that a parent could not be required to make an election between (1) being the principal custodial parent with restrictions related to the custody, (2) marrying a spouse of choice and living with him or her away from the children, or (3) marrying and living part-time with each. (The parties to this matrimonial litigation agreed to \u201cjoint legal custody\u201d with defendant designated as the \u201cprimary residential custodial parent,\u201d and the judgment so provided. Both parties are competent caring parents). Here, the order does not \u201cdirectly\u201d interfere with defendant\u2019s right to marry. Defendant is free to marry anyone she chooses, including Baldridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Our courts have recognized that the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the children can be made paramount to other fundamental rights. <em>See Holder v. Polanski, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>344, 350-51, 544 A.2d 852 (1988) (restricting the freedom of a custodial parent to move out of state when contrary to the \u201cbest interests of the children\u201d). <em>See, generally, Shapiro v. Thompson, </em>394 <em>U.S. </em>618, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969) (recognizing the right of interstate travel);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see also Rinier v. State, </em>273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135, 142, 641 A.2d 276 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied,, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>269, 649 A.2d 1288 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>1016, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>1358, 131 L.Ed.2d 216 (1995) (New Jersey requirement that married couples\u2019 filing joint federal tax return must file joint State return presented \u201cno direct legal obstacle in the paths of persons desiring to get married\u201d (quoting <em>Zablocki, supra, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>at 387, n. 12, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 681 n. 12)).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">We add that because defendant had no \u201cplans to marry Mr. Baldridge\u201d at the time of trial, the effect of the judgment provision prohibiting defendant from having contact with Baldridge in the presence of her children can again be analyzed should her plans change. Post-trial developments, such as whether Baldridge elected to undergo counselling or a parenting skills course, may have impact on the proper restrictions or limitations ordered with respect to custody at that time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Lepis v. Lepis, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>139, 416 A.2d 45 (1980) (regarding alimony and support obligation).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The defendant was thirty-four years of age and attending Brookdale Community College at the time of the divorce proceeding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She had been employed before she was married in 1985 and prior to becoming pregnant with her first child who was born in 1987. Her youngest child started kindergarten last fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The trial judge\u2019s award of rehabilitative alimony, designed to \u201cenable [the] former spouse to complete the preparation necessary for economic self-sufficiency,\u201d <em>Milner v. Milner, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>209, 213-14, 672 A.2d 206 (App.Div.1996) (quoting <em>Hill v. Hill, </em>91 <em>N.J.. </em>506, 509, 453 A.2d 537 (1982)), was clearly appropriate in this case involving a relatively short marriage and a young divorcee. <em>Heinl v. Heinl, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>337, 346, 671 A.2d 147 (App.Div. 1996). The six-month award was to expire in February 1997 (six months after the judge\u2019s opinion rendered before the judgment was signed), and if defendant\u2019s attainment of economic self-sufficiency did not occur despite her good faith efforts, defendant could have applied for an extension based on the \u201ccircumstances\u201d as they developed. <em>Milner, supra, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 214-15, 672 A.2d 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">There is some appeal to the thought that rehabilitative alimony should have been structured to permit completion of college to help defendant enter the job market more easily and at a higher income, particularly because of her parenting responsibilities for the young children at home. Defendant requested such an approach in her post-trial written submission, and it may even inure to plaintiffs long-term economic interest. However, the trial judge expressed lengthy reasons for the rehabilitative alimony award she granted, noting among other things that defendant \u201cdoes not remember when she started Brookdale Community College, or how long she has been going there,\u201d \u201cthat she had not provided any information as to what type of degree she would seek,\u201d that \u201cshe has not provided any information as to how long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>her degree or license would take to achieve,\u201d and that defendant was interested in employment which did not necessarily require a college degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The judge also recognized that defendant\u2019s parenting responsibilities impacted on the length and amount of rehabilitative alimony, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23(b)(6), but concluded that defendant could go back to work (and make at least $125 per week) because \u201cboth children will be in school full time.\u201d We cannot, therefore, conclude that the limited period of rehabilitative alimony was too short. Moreover, given the husband\u2019s income and obligation to pay for the children\u2019s insurance coverage, unreimbursed medical expenses and parochial school education in addition to the court imposed child support, we find no basis to disturb the amount of rehabilitative alimony awarded. <em>Heinl v. Heinl, supra, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 345, 671 A.2d 147 (to vacate a trial court\u2019s finding concerning alimony, we must conclude that the trial court clearly abused its discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">In essence, Judge Patricia Del Bueno Cleary rendered extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law to support her decision. We find no basis to disturb them.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-6\"> Justices Stewart, Powell and Stevens wrote separate opinions concurring in the result. Justice Rehnquist dissented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b675-7\"> We need not discuss the impact of cases dealing with contested child placement and termination proceedings notwithstanding that \u201c[t]here are few rights more fundamental in and to our society than those of parents to retain custody over and care for their children, and to rear their children as they deem appropriate.\u201d <em>Jordan by Jordan v. Jackson, </em>15 F.3d 333, 342 (4th Cir.1994). <em>See also, e.g., In re Guardianship of J.C., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>1, 9-10, 608 A.2d 1312 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b675-8\"> Courts seek to encourage bonding with both parents because it is generally in the best interest of children. As Baldridge is not a party to this action, the court was not asked to, and could not, order him to do anything as a prerequisite to his being with the children. That is not to say, however, that defendant could not formulate such a plan, with Baldridge\u2019s consent, for incorporation into an order, so that the legitimate interests of everyone involved are adequately protected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\"> Defendant had also earned credits at Montclair State College.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
