Hansen (collectively referred to as Hansen). Micciche, a general contractor, constructed a residential dwelling for plaintiffs. Hansen inspected the dwelling on plaintiffs\u2019 behalf before closing of title. In granting summary judgment, the motion judge concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 election to proceed with binding arbitration under the New Home Warranty and Builders\u2019 Registration Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>46:3B- -1 to -20, precluded the present action for money damages against both Micciche and Hansen. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>The essential facts are undisputed. On March 31, 1992, plaintiffs entered into a contract with Micciche to purchase a newly-constructed home in Elmwood Park, Bergen County for a price of $320,000. Plaintiffs retained the services of Hansen, who conducted an inspection of the dwelling. Hansen found no significant problems, stating that the house \u201cappears to be of sound construction.\u201d Plaintiffs thereafter closed title and took occupancy on July 3,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">On September 26, 1992, plaintiffs submitted a \u201cpunch list\u201d of items to Micciche, requesting that the list be addressed pursuant to plaintiffs\u2019 New Home Owners\u2019 Warranty. Many of the items were cosmetic in nature. However, plaintiffs also complained that the family room bathroom \u201cdoorway is sinking,\u201d \u201cmain beam is dropping,\u201d and the doorway frame is \u201cout of plumb.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Dissatisfied with Mieciche\u2019s response to their letter, on November 23, 1992, plaintiffs submitted a request for dispute settlement with the Department of Community Affairs, Division of Codes and Standards, Bureau of Homeowner Protection (Division). Their request described the principal defect as \u201cmain beam dropped ... causing a multitude of problems over it.\u201d They also submitted to the Division the \u201cpunch list\u201d previously sent to Micciche, as well as a letter explaining the manner by which the house was \u201cslowly sinking\u201d over the \u201cmain beam.\u201d Plaintiffs demanded that the builder correct the \u201ccrookedness\u201d by jacking up the beam and placing a longer column under it. The Division responded by sending plaintiffs a \u201cConsent to Formal Dispute Settlement\u201d form, and advised plaintiffs that a \u201cneutral third-party dispute settler\u201d would be assigned to the matter \u201cin accordance with the regulations governing new home warranties.\u201d The letter also advised plaintiffs that, upon written consent by the homeowner and builder, the dispute settler was empowered to issue a binding award of arbitration covering all defects. Both plaintiffs and Micciche executed the \u201cDispute Settlement\u201d form and agreed to binding arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>On behalf of the Division, William Montague inspected plaintiffs\u2019 dwelling in the presence of Mr. Konieczny, Mr. Micciche and Micciche\u2019s attorney. In his certification, Micciche\u2019s attorney states that after the inspection, Montague told the parties that certain \u201cproblems\u201d needed correction, but there was no evidence that the main basement girder (the \u201cmain beam\u201d) had deflected.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">On January 25, 1993, the written decision rendered by Montague was sent to the parties. As to plaintiffs\u2019 principal claim, that the \u201cmain beam\u201d had deflected, Montague found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">While girder shows no signs of deflection, a ially column has been placed at center of girder. There is no evidence of any future failure at this time. However, the Builder shall adjust basement door to 1st story to within standards, sec. 5:23-3.5(g)li. He shall also adjust 1st story bathroom door so as to operate and close.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Montague also directed that Micciche address unrelated claims concerning poor workmanship. The award ordered that Micciche complete the necessary repairs within sixty days and noted that the award was \u201cfinal and binding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">On January 29, 1993, four days after the written award was issued, plaintiffs, through their attorney, attempted to withdraw from the arbitration proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Division rejected the request, noting that plaintiffs\u2019 filing of a claim against the warranty constituted an election of a remedy under <em>N.J.S.A </em>46:3B-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">Plaintiffs thereafter filed the present action in the Law Division against Micciche and Hansen. As to Micciche, plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages, claiming breach of contract, common-law fraud, violations of the Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>56:8-1 to -48, and negligence. As to Hansen, plaintiffs seek damages for his professional negligence in failing to properly inspect the premises and discover the defects existing in the dwelling prior to closing of title. Plaintiffs also allege that Hansen breached their contract and violated the Consumer Fraud Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>In granting summary judgment to all defendants, the motion judge concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 initiation of the binding arbitration procedure under the New Home Warranty and Builders\u2019 Registration Act (Act) constituted an election of remedy which barred them from all other remedies in a court of law against both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">We agree with the motion judge that plaintiffs are barred from seeking a judicial remedy against Micciche for damages relating to the \u201cmain beam\u201d defect. N.J.S.A 46:3B-9 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">Nothing contained herein shall affect other rights and remedies available to the owner. The owner shall have the opportunity to pursue any remedy legally available to the owner. However, initiation of procedures to enforce a remedy shall constitute an election which shall bar the owner from all other remedies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Having opted for binding arbitration under the Act, plaintiffs are barred from seeking additional relief against Micciche from the courts to recover damages for defects submitted to the arbitrator, as well as for defects they knew about but did not submit to arbitration. <em>Spolitback v. Cyr Corp., </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>264, 268-70, 684 A.2d 1021 (App.Div.1996); <em>Rzepiennik v. U.S. Home Corp., </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>230, 237, 534 A.2d 89 (App.Div.1987). Moreover, the election of remedies subsumed all of their claims for damages against Micciche, including common law fraud and alleged violations of the Consumer Fraud Act. <em>Rzepiennik, supra, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 237, 534 A.2d 89. The preclusion arises not only because of the statutory bar under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:3B-9, but also based on principles of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. <em>Ibid.; Chattin v. Cape May Greene, Inc., </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>618, 634-38, 524 A.2d 841 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>148, 526 A.2d 209 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Plaintiffs argue that <em>Rzepiennik </em>is distinguishable because there the builder apparently took steps to correct the defects found to exist by the arbitrators, 221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 234, 534 A.2d 89, whereas here, plaintiffs rejected the arbitration procedure before Micciche attempted to make the repairs. Plaintiffs point to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Rzepiennik\u2019s holding that \u201c[w]e thus find nothing inequitable in the fact that, having opted for arbitration <em>and having garnered the benefits therefrom, </em>the Rzepienniks are barred by the warranty ... and <em>N.J.SA </em>46:3B-9 from seeking further relief in the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237, 534 A.2d 89 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs argue that here, when they agreed to arbitration, they simply elected a \u201cforum\u201d but, since they had not \u201cgarnered the benefits therefrom\u201d by having Micdehe make the repairs, they received no administrative \u201cremedy\u201d under the Act. Thus, they reason, they never sought to \u201cenforce a remedy\u201d and consequently the statutory bar under <em>N.J.SA </em>46:3B-9 is inapplicable. We reject the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>46:3B-9 states that <em>\u201cinitiation of procedures to enforce a remedy </em>shall constitute an election which shall bar the owner ft-om all other remedies.\u201d (Emphasis added). Sensibly, this language must mean that when a homeowner \u201cinitiates\u201d a binding arbitration proceeding, as plaintiffs did here, the homeowner has elected the administrative procedure to \u201cenforce a remedy\u201d relating to defects in new home construction. This interpretation is consistent with the pertinent regulation, <em>N.J AC. </em>5:25-3.10, which reads that \u201c[pjursuant to New Home Warranty and Builders\u2019 Registration Act (P.L.1977, c. 467) <em>the filing of a claim </em>against the warranty specified by this subchapter shall constitute the election of a remedy and shall bar the owner from all other remedies.\u201d (Emphasis added). In this regard, <em>N.J.S.A </em>46:3B-9 differs from the \u201ccomplementary\u201d remedies provided under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:5-13, which affords both an administrative and Superior Court remedy. <em>See Aldrich v. Manpower Temp. Servs., </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>500, 504, 650 A.2d 4 (App.Div.1994), <em>certif. denied, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>442, 655 A.2d 445 (1995). Unlike <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:3B-9, under the LAD it is not until a \u201cfinal determination\u201d is rendered by one forum that the choice becomes preclusive. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-27 <em>(\u201cthe final determination </em>[on a LAD complaint] ... shall exclude any other action, civil or criminal, based on the same grievance of the individual concerned\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation is incompatible with the legislative purpose of the election of remedy provision: the waiver of any judicial remedy upon election of a prompt, convenient and cost-saving means of resolving disputes concerning construction defects. Under plaintiffs\u2019 reading of the statute, the homeowner would have it both ways. He or she could initiate binding arbitration and, if dissatisfied with the arbitration award, or even if during the proceedings there is a sense that the arbitrator will probably reject the claims, he or she could simply \u201cwithdraw\u201d from the proceedings and file for damages in the Law Division because the homeowner had not yet \u201cgarnered the benefits\u201d of the award. To permit such unilateral action undercuts the salutary purposes of the election of remedy and procedural bar provision of the Act. A homeowner should not be allowed to avail himself or herself of the arbitration proceeding and unilaterally abort that proceeding in the face of an adverse determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">We recently held in <em>Spolitback, supra, </em>that \u201c[a]n election of remedies that has the effect of barring alternative relief must be knowingly and voluntarily made, ... especially where the choice is to arbitrate disputes rather than to litigate them.\u201d 295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 270, 684 A.2d 1021. <em>See also Marchak v. Claridge Commons, Inc., </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>275, 282, 633 A.2d 531 (1993). We therefore concluded that plaintiffs in that case could not be held to have made a preclusive choice to arbitrate issues \u201cof which they were unaware at the time they submitted known claims for resolution by that procedure.\u201d <em>Spolitback, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 270, 684 A.2d 1021. Only those claims submitted to the arbitrator and those \u201cwarranty-covered defects known to plaintiffs\u201d at the time of submission to arbitration were therefore barred by <em>N.J.S.A </em>46:3B-9. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Here, on February 10, 1993, sixteen days after the arbitration award was rendered, plaintiffs received a written report from an expert, Thomas V. Ashbahian, an architect and engineer. Ashba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Man focuses on plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cmain beam\u201d deflection claim. It is undisputed that this claim was not only known to plaintiffs at the time of the arbitration proceeding, but was submitted to the arbitrator and addressed by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">However, Ashbahian\u2019s report also states that: (1) a second concrete slab was poured in the basement \u201cover the old slab without removal of the defective concrete\u201d; (2) there was a \u201cblatant code violation at the base riser of the basement stair\u201d; (3) an \u201cunacceptable practice\u201d was followed by attaching a wood post to the stair riser; (4) there was a \u201clack of joist hangers at flush connections\u201d; (5) there was an \u201cexcessive amount of drilling [through] floor joists\u201d throughout the floor framing; and (6) he found \u201csubstandard\u201d framing throughout the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">We cannot say that plaintiffs knew about these purported defects in workmanship when they elected to pursue their administrative remedy under the Act. It may be that the defects described by Ashbahian are not of a type reasonably observable by laypersons. Would a layperson know, for example, about the purported \u201cexcessive amount of drilling\u201d through the floor joists as a result of their own post-occupancy inspection? Nor can we ascertain with certainty whether or not the defects described by the expert overlap with or are subsumed by plaintiffs\u2019 basic complaint concerning the main beam. We therefore remand so that the trial judge may determine, by the standards we enunciated in <em>Spolitback, </em>which of the claims against Micciche addressed by Ashbahian are barred by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:3B-9 and which are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">As stated, the motion judge concluded that the election of remedy bar under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:3B-9 also precluded plaintiffs\u2019 present action in its entirety against Hansen for damages arising from his negligent failure to inspect plaintiffs\u2019 residence. In so holding, the judge observed that \u201c[t]he remedy for disputes in HOW arbitration is an exclusive remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>The election of remedy and preclusive bar under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:3B-9 must be read in the context of the entire legislative scheme. The Act authorizes the creation of a new home warranty by rules and regulations and adoption of procedures for the implementation and processing of claims against the builder and, if necessary, against a new home warrant security fund. <em>N.J.S.A </em>46:3B-3a. The Act imposes liability upon a \u201cbuilder\u201d of a new home for any defect in the construction of the new home covered by the warranty. <em>N.J.S.A </em>46:3B-4. A \u201c[b]uilder\u201d is defined as any individual corporation, partnership or other business organizations \u201cengaged in the construction of new homes.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>46:3B-2f. Consequently, the \u201cinitiation of procedures to enforce a remedy\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A </em>46:3B-9, which forecloses the homeowner from any remedy at law, must refer to the enforcement of a remedy solely against a \u201cbuilder,\u201d since no other third party is subject to the warranty provisions. Because Hansen is not a \u201cbuilder,\u201d the election of remedy procedures bar under <em>N.J.S.A </em>46:3B-9 does not apply to him. The question remains, however, whether there is issue-preclusive effect in Hansen\u2019s favor to the HOW arbitrator\u2019s determination that the main beam or girder was structurally sound, based on common law principles of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In appropriate circumstances, arbitration awards may be given collateral estoppel effect in subsequent judicial proceedings. <em>Nogue v. Estate of Santiago, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>383, 385-86, 540 A.2d 889 (App.Div.1988); <em>Chattin, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 634-38, 524 A.2d 841. In deciding the issue, we have been governed by the factors set forth by the <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>\u00a7\u00a7 27, 28 and 83 (1982). <em>Nogue, supra, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 386-87, 540 A.2d 889; <em>see also Hernandez v. Region Nine Housing Corp., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>645, 659-60, 684 A.2d 1385 (1996). Arbitration awards, like any administrative determination, should be issue-preclusive \u201conly under certain circumstances.\u201d <em>Nogue, supra, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 386, 540 A.2d 889. The determinations made by the arbitrator or agency are entitled to preclusive effect \u201cif rendered in proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>which merit such deference.\u201d <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>at 660, 684 A.2d 1385 (quoting <em>Ensslin v. Township of N. Bergen, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>352, 369, 646 A.2d 452 (App.Div.1994), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>446, 663 A.2d 1354 (1995)). The proceeding must entail the essential elements of adjudication. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Judgments, supra, </em>at \u00a7 83(2)(a)-(e).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">\u2018The essential question is whether ... an issue is formulated as it would be in a court and decided according to procedures similar to those of a court---- An issue of fact is so formulated when there is assertion and controversion of the occurrence of a legally significant event____ If an issue has thus been formulated, and if the procedure for resolving it is substantially similar to that used in judicial adjudication, the ... determination of the issue should be given preclusive effect in accordance with the rules of res judicata.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-11\"><em>[Nogue, supra, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 386-87, 540 A.2d 889 (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments, supra, </em>at \u00a7 83 cmt. b).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">A second question, raised here, is whether an arbitration award should have issue-preclusive effect in favor of a defendant who was not a party to the arbitration proceedings. Generally, collateral estoppel permits a defendant who was not a party to an action involving a common plaintiff to use a finding of fact from the prior action to preclude litigation of the issue in a pending case. <em>Batson v. Lederle Labs., </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>49, 52, 674 A.2d 1013 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>261, 686 A.2d 763 (1996); <em>Kortenhaus v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., 228 N.J.Super. </em>162, 164, 549 A.2d 437 (App.Div.1988). This is referred to as <em>\u201cdefensive </em>collateral estoppel.\u201d <em>Kortenhaus, supra, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 164, 549 A.2d 437. The modern trend favors relaxation of the traditional rule of mutuality of parties, in favor of a more pragmatic case-by-case approach. <em>Zirger v. General </em>Acc. <em>Ins. Co., </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>327, 337-38, 676 A.2d 1065 (1996). \u201cGenerally the question to be decided is whether a party has had his day in court on an issue, rather than whether he has had his day in court on that issue against a particular litigant.\u201d <em>McAndrew v. Mularchuk, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>156, 161, 183 A.2d 74 (1962). Ultimately, the com\u00ed; must employ a \u201cdiscretionary weighing of economy against fairness.\u201d <em>Kortenhaus, supra, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 165, 549 A.2d 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Under <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments, supra, </em>\u00a7 29, entitled \u201cIssue Preclusion in Subsequent Litigation -with Others,\u201d a plaintiff, in order to avoid the preclusion bar, must demonstrate that he or she \u201clacked full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue\u201d in the prior proceeding, or there are \u201cother circumstances justify affording [plaintiff] an opportunity to relitigate the issue.\u201d Factors to be considered, as well as those enumerated in <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>\u00a7 28, are whether: (1) the prior forum afforded plaintiffs procedural opportunities in the presentation and determination of the issues; (2) plaintiffs could have effected joinder of the present defendant in the prior proceeding; and (3) other compelling circumstances make it appropriate that plaintiffs be permitted to relitigate the issue. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 29(2), (3), (8).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Applying the <em>Restatement </em>principles, we hold that plaintiffs are collaterally estopped from relitigating against Hansen the arbitrator\u2019s determination that the main beam or girder was structurally sound. The only <em>Restatement </em>factor favoring plaintiffs\u2019 argument against issue-preclusion is that they could not have effected joinder of Hansen in the administrative arbitration proceeding, since Hansen was not subject to the provisions of the Act. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 29(3). However, no New Jersey case has held that this factor is dispositive in deciding the issue-preclusion question. <em>See Batson, supra, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 54, 674 A.2d 1013. Moreover, that factor has less qualitative weight here, since plaintiffs were not compelled to arbitrate the \u201cmain beam\u201d defect issue; they could have sought judicial relief in the first instance naming both Miceiche and Hansen as party defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">This is not a case where procedural opportunities in the presentation and determination of the \u201cmain beam\u201d issue were not available to plaintiffs during the arbitration proceeding. <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments, supra, </em>at \u00a7 29(2). Indeed, a comprehensive regulatory scheme has been adopted governing the administrative disposition of claims made by homeowners under the Act. The rules set forth a multitude of performance standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>and define the builder\u2019s responsibility to satisfy those standards. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:25-3.1 to -3.7. When a homeowner files a Notice of Claim with HOW, and both parties agree to binding arbitration, a qualified arbitrator is appointed, who inspects the subject property and conducts a hearing in accordance with the rules of procedure of the American Arbitration Association. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:25-5.5(c)3i(l). As we read the regulations, neither party is foreclosed from presenting expert testimony or written reports in support of their respective positions concerning the alleged defects in construction. The arbitrator is required to make specific findings fixing responsibility, describing the extent of the defect, and setting forth the date by which the defect must be corrected. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:25-5.5(c)3i(2). If the written decision requires clarification, either party may request reinstatement of the arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction for that purpose. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Consequently, measured by the considerations enumerated by the <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>\u00a7 29, we are confident that plaintiffs had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the \u201cmain beam\u201d issue during the arbitration proceeding. They presented written statements describing their claim. The arbitrator inspected the premises and made written findings. The expert report submitted by Ashbahian on February 10, 1993, after the arbitration award was rendered, was reasonably obtainable prior to the arbitration proceedings. <em>See Kozlowski v. Smith, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>672, 675, 475 A.2d 663 (App.Div.1984). Therefore, they are collaterally estopped from relitigating that issue in the context of proving damages they allegedly suffered arising out of Hansen\u2019s negligent inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Plaintiffs, however, are not otherwise foreclosed from pursuing their Law Division action against Hansen to recover damages relating to other purported defects arising out of Hansen\u2019s alleged negligent failure to inspect. Because no professional liability expert report has been submitted to us, we do not know the scope of the claim against Hansen, and what alleged damages plaintiffs in fact suffered as a result of his conduct. On remand, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>judge should make specific findings, applying the <em>Restatement </em>factors, respecting whether other claims are precluded as a result of the arbitrator\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">We reject Hansen\u2019s argument that the entire controversy doctrine bars plaintiffs\u2019 action against him. The doctrine\u2019s underlying purpose, to require mandatory party joinder, is to assure that \u201call potentially responsible persons will participate in the original action.\u201d <em>Olds v. Donnelly, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>424, 434, 696 A.2d 633 (1997). \u201cRequiring the joinder of all parties with a material interest in a litigation thus guarantees a complete determination of liability, avoids prejudice to absent parties, and prevents a duplication of lawsuits.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Even if the entire controversy doctrine applies to arbitration proceedings, <em>see Thornton v. Potamkin Chevrolet, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>1, 6-7, 462 A.2d 133 (1983), it cannot bar plaintiffs from asserting their claims against Hansen when he could not have been joined in the HOW arbitration procedure because of statutory constraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Finally, plaintiffs\u2019 argument that defendants waived their right to raise the defense of collateral estoppel is without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E). Both defendants advanced the doctrine as an affirmative defense in their answers. <em>See R. </em>4:5-4; <em>Williams v. Bell Tel. Labs., Inc., </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>109, 115, 623 A.2d 234 (1993), cited by plaintiffs, is readily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Affirmed in part; reversed and remanded in part for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-11\"> Plaintiffs claim that the request to withdraw was made before they received and read the written arbitration award. We view tins assertion as immaterial to disposition of the issues before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
