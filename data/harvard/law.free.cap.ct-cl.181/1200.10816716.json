Defendant has filed motions for summary judgment in both cases on the ground that the plaintiffs have failed to state claims for relief because they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>have not been deprived of any compensable property rights, the land in question being batture land subject to a servitude in favor of the State of Louisiana for use for levee purposes without necessity of payment of compensation and the state having granted to the United States the right to exercise that servitude for levee purposes and the furtherance of the construction of a flood control project. On December 11, 1967, upon consideration of defendant\u2019s motions for summary judgment, the court ordered that the defendant\u2019s motions he granted and the petitions be dismissed on the ground that the lands used by the United States Corps of Engineers for the improvement of levees for which the plaintiffs claim compensation is batture land under the Louisiana Constitution of 1921 (Art. 16, sec. 6) and may be taken by the United States as a donee of the State without compensation to the owners. See <em>General Box Co. </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 351 U.S. 159 (1956).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
