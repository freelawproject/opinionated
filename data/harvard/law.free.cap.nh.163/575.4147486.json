She argues that the Derry Family Division <em>{Moore, </em>J.) erred when it granted Eric a fault-based divorce. In addition, she challenges the trial court\u2019s division of the parties\u2019 property and its denial of her alimony request. Further, she contests the validity of the stipulated parenting plan. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">The trial court found the following facts. The parties were married in 1997. During their marriage, they purchased a home in Cand\u00eda, where they lived with their son and one of Eric\u2019s children from a previous marriage. In addition, Eric\u2019s parents lived in an in-law apartment over the garage of the marital home.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">In the later years of their marriage, the parties began to experience marital difficulties. They demonstrated little to no affection toward one another, and Jeannie refused to be intimate with Eric. On November 30, 2008, Jeannie learned that Eric had engaged in a single instance of adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-15\">Three days later, on December 3, 2008, while the pair discussed then-marriage during a telephone conversation, Jeannie told Eric that she was going to kill the parties\u2019 minor child, Eric\u2019s child from a previous relationship, and Eric\u2019s parents. She also told him that she was going to burn down the marital residence. Following their conversation, Jeannie \u201cdoused the marital residence and garage with gasoline and attempted to ignite it with a lighter.\u201d In addition, she \u201cdestroyed a portion of the marital residence and property with an ax[],\u201d and then chased Eric\u2019s father around the house with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>the ax, as he tried to prevent her from hghting the gasoline. Consequently, the next day, Eric obtained a restraining order against Jeannie. As a result of her actions, Jeannie was charged with two counts of attempted murder, one count of attempted arson, and one count of criminal mischief.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">On December 9, 2008, Eric filed for divorce, claiming irreconcilable differences caused the breakdown of the parties\u2019 marriage. <em>See </em>RSA 458:7~a (Supp. 2011). Thereafter, he amended his divorce petition and added an alternate ground for divorce, claiming Jeannie \u201cha[d] so treated [him] as seriously to injure health or endanger reason.\u201d RSA 458:7, V (2004). After he amended his petition, but prior to the final hearing, Jeannie was convicted of one count of attempted arson and one count of criminal mischief and was subsequently sentenced to two to four years at the New Hampshire State Prison for Women. As a result, during the final divorce hearing, Eric asked the court to consider that Jeannie\u2019s \u201cconviction of a crime punishable by prison for more than one year constitute^] fault grounds that caused the breakdown of the marriage.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 458:7, IV (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Following the final hearing, the trial court granted Eric a decree of divorce \u201con the grounds of [Jeannie\u2019s] conviction of a crime and imprisonment for more than one year.\u201d In addition, after consideration of the parties\u2019 debt and marital assets, as well as Jeannie\u2019s incarceration, the court concluded that an unequal division of the marital property in Eric\u2019s favor was warranted. Further, the court adopted the parties\u2019 stipulated parenting plan, which awarded Eric decision-making and residential responsibility for their minor son, and detailed a plan to facilitate progressively increased contact between Jeannie and the boy. Finally, the court denied Jeannie\u2019s request for alimony, finding it \u201cunwarranted.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">\n<em>I. Fault-Based Divorce</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">We first address Jeannie\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in granting Eric a fault-based divorce on the grounds of her conviction and subsequent imprisonment. She asserts that Eric is not an \u201cinnocent party\u201d because he committed adultery, and, therefore, he is precluded from obtaining a fault-based divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">RSA 458:7 (2004) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">A divorce from the bonds of matrimony shall be decreed in favor of <em>the innocent party </em>for any of the following causes: . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-11\">II. Adultery of either party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>IV. Conviction of either party, in any state or federal district, of a crime punishable with imprisonment for more than one year and actual imprisonment under such conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">V. When either party has so treated the other as seriously to injure health or endanger reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">RSA 458:7, II, IV-V (emphasis added). Although the trial court did not make a specific finding that Eric was an \u201cinnocent party,\u201d because it granted a divorce on fault grounds, we assume it made such a finding. <em>See Dombrowski v. Dombrowski, </em>131 N.H. 654, 663 (1989). We will affirm the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless the evidence does not support them or they are legally erroneous. <em>In the Matter of Hampers &amp; Hampers, </em>154 N.H. 275, 279 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">In <em>Rockwood v. Rockwood, </em>105 N.H. 129, 129 (1963), we considered whether the husband, who was found guilty of adultery, was \u201cthe innocent party\u201d and therefore entitled to a divorce. We determined that \u201cinnocent\u201d meant \u201cfree from guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131 (quotations omitted). We then explained that a spouse cannot be \u201cthe innocent party\u201d if he \u201cis guilty of an offense against the other spouse, which would be grounds for divorce.\u201d <em>Id:, see Schwarz v. Schwarz, </em>427 S.W.2d 734, 739 (Mo. Ct. App. 1968) (\u201c[T]he conduct of one party will not prevent him from being adjudged an innocent party unless it be such as to entitle the other party, prima facie, to a divorce.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Here, the record does not support the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that Eric was \u201cthe innocent party.\u201d Eric does not dispute his infidelity; yet, he contends that he is still an \u201cinnocent party\u201d because Jeannie\u2019s conduct, and not his adultery, was the primary cause of the marital breakdown. Eric argues that the parties\u2019 agreement to \u201cwork through\u201d the affair constituted Jeannie\u2019s condonation of his adultery, thus restoring his status as an \u201cinnocent party.\u201d The affirmative defense of condonation \u201cis the forgiveness of an antecedent matrimonial offense on condition that it shall not be repeated.\u201d <em>Tibbetts v. Tibbetts, </em>109 N.H. 239, 241 (1968) (quotations omitted). Under the doctrine, \u201c[i]f either party to a marriage thinks proper to forgive the infidelity of the other, it cannot afterwards be set up as a ground of divorce, without evidence of a [further] injury.\u201d <em>Quincy v. Quincy, </em>10 N.H. 272, 273 (1839).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">The record, however, does not support Eric\u2019s assertion that Jeannie condoned his infidelity. While she may have agreed to work on their marriage, her conduct in the days immediately following his disclosure does not support a finding that Jeannie forgave Eric\u2019s adultery. Two days after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>his disclosure, Eric received numerous voicemail messages from Jeannie who was \u201cirate\u201d and at times \u201cjust screaming and yelling.\u201d On the third day after his disclosure, she threatened and attempted to kill his family and destroy the marital home. Moreover, during the divorce hearing, Jeannie stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think forgiveness was the question at the time. It was what did I \u2014 what do I need to do to \u2014 if \u2014 what did I miss, what did I need to do was what we were \u2014 what we were trying to find out.\u201d Thus, the doctrine of condonation is inapplicable here, and therefore, Eric cannot claim the status of an \u201cinnocent party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Because we conclude that Eric is not entitled to a fault-based divorce, we need not address Jeannie\u2019s alternative argument that the cause of the marital breakdown could not have been her conviction since she had not yet been convicted when the divorce petition was filed or amended prior to the final hearing. Nevertheless, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision dissolving the parties\u2019 marriage. The record supports a dissolution based upon irreconcilable differences. <em>See </em>RSA 458:7-a. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision to the extent that it granted Eric a fault-based divorce; otherwise, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to grant a divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">\n<em>II. Alimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Next, Jeannie contends that the trial court erred in denying her alimony. Pursuant to RSA 458:19 (Supp. 2011), a trial court may award alimony if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">(a) The party in need lacks sufficient income, property, or both, including property apportioned in accordance with RSA 458:16-a, to provide for such party\u2019s reasonable needs, taking into account the style of living to which the parties have become accustomed during the marriage; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">(b) The party from whom alimony is sought is able to meet reasonable needs while meeting those of the party seeking alimony, taking into account the style of living to which the parties have become accustomed during the marriage; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-10\">(c) The party in need is unable to be self-supporting through appropriate employment at a standard of living that meets reasonable needs ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">RSA 458:19, (I)(a)-(c). Trial courts have broad discretion in awarding alimony. <em>In the Matter of Peirano &amp; Larsen, </em>155 N.H. 738, 746 (2007). We review the trial court\u2019s decision under our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>After consideration of the factors enumerated in RSA 458:19, the trial court denied Jeannie\u2019s alimony request, finding \u201cthat the [petitioner [did] not have the ability to pay and that the Respondent [did] not have a definitive need for alimony due to her incarceration.\u201d In addition, the court noted that \u201cthe [petitioner has had to pay a majority of the marital debt since the Respondent\u2019s criminal conduct . . . and will continue to pay during her period of incarceration.\u201d Nevertheless, Jeannie contends that the evidence supports her need for alimony, as well as Eric\u2019s ability to pay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">In determining whether to award alimony, the trial court considered Eric\u2019s yearly salary of $93,000 and his monthly veteran\u2019s benefits of $243, as well as the estimated $337,400 value of the marital property awarded to him, including the home mortgage loan of $272,898.47 and home equity loan of $27,809.74. In addition, the court considered the $56,511.61 of marital debt allocated to Eric and his obligations as primary support for the parties\u2019 son and his two other children. Despite his relatively high salary and his award of the marital residence, the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Eric\u2019s obligations to support the children, to pay down the encumbrances on the marital residence, to pay his individual debt, and to pay the marital debt while Jeannie is incarcerated, make an alimony award \u201cunwarranted\u201d and \u201cinappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The record also supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Jeannie did not need alimony. \u201cThe primary purpose of alimony is rehabilitative,\u201d <em>In the Matter of Fowler and Fowler, </em>145 N.H. 516, 520 (2000), and it \u201cis designed to encourage the recipient to establish an independent source of income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). \u201c \u2018Rehabilitative\u2019 alimony is based on the theory that modern spouses are equally able to function in the job market and to provide for their own financial needs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, \u201c[t]he purpose of an order for support is not to provide a life-time profit-sharing plan.\u201d <em>Calderwood v. Calderwood, </em>114 N.H. 651, 653 (1974) (quotations and ellipsis omitted). Given Jeannie\u2019s incarceration, an alimony award would not have fulfilled its purpose of \u201cencouraging] the recipient to establish an independent source of income.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Fowler, </em>145 N.H. at 520 (quotations omitted). Moreover, during her incarceration, her basic needs will be met; thus, she does not \u201clack[] sufficient income, property, or both... to provide for [her] reasonable needs.\u201d RSA 458:19,1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">As there is sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s factual findings, we uphold them. <em>In the Matter of Henry, </em>163 N.H. at 183. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court sustainably exercised its discretion in declining to make an alimony award.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>\n<em>III. Properly Distribution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Jeannie next asserts that the trial court\u2019s distribution of the marital property constitutes an unsustainable exercise of discretion. RSA 458:16-a, II (2004) creates a presumption that equal distribution of marital property is equitable. <em>In the Matter of Henry, </em>163 N.H. at 183. Absent special circumstances, the court must make the distribution as equal as possible. <em>Id.) see </em>RSA 458:16-a, II. In making its determination, the court is required by statute to consider various factors, including \u201cthe length of the marriage, the ability of the parties to provide for their own needs, the needs of the custodial parent, the contribution of each party during the marriage and the value of property contributed by each party.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Crowe &amp; Crowe, </em>148 N.H. 218, 221 (2002); <em>see </em>RSA 458:16-a, II. The trial court may also consider \u201c[a]ny other factor that the court deems relevant.\u201d RSA 458:16-a, II(o). A trial court is not precluded, however, from awarding a particular asset in its entirety to one party. <em>In the Matter of Salesky &amp; Salesky, </em>157 N.H. 698, 708 (2008). As we afford trial courts broad discretion in determining property distribution, we will not overturn the trial court\u2019s decision absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Id. </em>If the court\u2019s findings can reasonably be made on the evidence presented, they will stand. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Jeannie first asserts that the trial court failed to state its reasons and make specific findings and rulings to support its unequal division of the marital property. RSA 458:16-a, IV requires the trial court to \u201cspecify written reasons for the division of property which it orders.\u201d Further, if the \u201ccourt concludes that an unequal distribution of property is warranted, it should state its reasons and make specific findings and rulings supporting its decision.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Peirano, </em>155 N.H. at 749 (quotation omitted). A court can satisfy these requirements by citing facts from the record that reflect the factors listed in RSA 458:16-a. <em>See In the Matter of Costa &amp; Costa, </em>156 N.H. 323, 327 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Here, to support its decision, the trial court referenced several factors enumerated in RSA 458:16-a. For example, the court found that since Eric has a continuing obligation to pay a majority of the joint marital debt, awarding him seventy percent of the thrift savings plan was warranted; further, the court specifically directed Eric to \u201cutilize [the] funds to pay the parties\u2019 marital debt during Jeannie\u2019s period of incarceration.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 458:16-a, 11(b) (listing as a factor the \u201cliabilities of each party\u201d). Moreover, the court noted that \u201cthe [petitioner has remained in the marital residence with his children from a previous marriage, as well as the parties\u2019 minor son.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 458:16~a, 11(e) (listing as a factor \u201c[t]he need of the custodial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>parent... to occupy or own the marital residence\u201d). The trial court also noted that Eric \u201cpaid down the mortgage by $4,750 and the personal loan by $8,727 during the pendency of the divorce.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 458:16-a, II(o) (permitting the court to consider \u201c[a]ny other factor that the court deems relevant\u201d). Finally, the court noted that Jeannie \u201cdestroyed a portion of the marital residence\u201d and that Eric would be \u201csolely responsible for payment of all costs associated with the marital residence including but not limited to . . . repairs and maintenance of the home.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 458:16-a, 11(f) (permitting the court to consider \u201cactions . . . during the marriage which contributed to the ... diminution in value\u201d of the marital property). Given the record and the court\u2019s narrative order, we conclude that the trial court made sufficient written findings to support its unequal apportionment of the parties\u2019 marital assets in Eric\u2019s favor. <em>See In the Matter of Costa, </em>156 N.H. at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Next, Jeannie contends that there were no special circumstances justifying an unequal distribution of the marital property. <em>See McAlpin v. McAlpin, </em>129 N.H. 737, 740 (1987). While she acknowledges Eric\u2019s responsibility to provide a home for their child, she maintains that this \u201cspecial circumstance was remedied when the trial court awarded him the marital home.\u201d Thus, she contends, \u201c[t]here were no other special circumstances which fit the facts associated with this case, except fault, which was granted in error by the trial court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">While we agree with Jeannie\u2019s assertion that the trial court erred in granting a fault-based divorce, we nevertheless sustain its unequal distribution of the marital property because the decision is supported by other considerations. As described above, the court\u2019s written findings illustrate several \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d that factored into its decision. Regardless, Jeannie essentially contends that even if the trial court considered some of the relevant statutory factors, and even if there is evidence to support its findings, the court nevertheless failed to weigh the factors properly. In matters of property settlement and divorce, however, we allocate broad discretion to the trial court, <em>McAlpin, </em>129 N.H. at 740, and the record supports the court\u2019s unequal division.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Jeannie further argues that the trial court erred \u201cin its determination that the equity in the marital home would be <em>de minimus </em>at best.\u201d In addition, she contends the court improperly considered Eric\u2019s parents\u2019 contribution toward the construction of the marital home\u2019s in-law apartment. While the court noted Eric\u2019s parents\u2019 contribution, it focused on the relative debts of each party, and ultimately concluded that Eric\u2019s debt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>responsibility significantly outweighed Jeannie\u2019s. Because the record supports the trial court\u2019s factual finding regarding the equity in the marital home, we uphold it.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ-\">\n<em>IV. Parenting Plan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Finally, Jeannie challenges the stipulated parenting plan, arguing that it effectively terminated her parental rights. She contends that she lacked the capacity to agree to the plan because she was \u201cdistraught\u201d during the divorce proceedings and \u201csuffer[ed] from mental and emotional duress.\u201d We decline to address her challenge to the parenting plan, however, because she did not raise the argument before the trial court, and, therefore, has not preserved it for our review. <em>See LaMontagne Builders v. Brooks, </em>154 N.H. 252, 258 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b604-8\">\u00dcALIANIS, C.J., and LYNN, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
