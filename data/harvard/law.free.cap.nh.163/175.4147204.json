Henry, appeals the final decree in his divorce from the petitioner, Marty A. Henry. He argues that the Derry Family Division <em>(Moore, </em>J.) erred when it granted the petitioner a fault-based divorce. He also challenges the trial court\u2019s division of the parties\u2019 property and its decision to award the petitioner alimony. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">The trial court found the following facts. The parties were married for approximately thirty-six years. Although they did not conceive any children together, in 1979 the respondent adopted the petitioner\u2019s son. On May 22, 2009, the petitioner petitioned for a fault-based divorce on the ground that the respondent had \u201cso treated [her] as seriously to injure [her] health or endanger [her] reason.\u201d RSA 458:7, V (2004). She alleged that the parties\u2019 relationship broke down approximately a week before she filed for divorce, on May 14, 2009, when the parties\u2019 son informed her that the respondent had sexually abused him when he was twelve. She contended that the discovery of this information seriously endangered her health and reason, causing her to suffer from depression, insomnia and weight loss. Although the respondent denied the allegation, the trial court found that his denial was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Based upon the petitioner\u2019s testimony and that of her son and daughter-in-law, as well as an e-mail message and voicemail message from the respondent, the trial court granted the petition for a fault-based divorce, finding that the respondent\u2019s inappropriate conduct with the parties\u2019 son seriously endangered the petitioner\u2019s health and reason. Given the petitioner\u2019s inability to provide for her own reasonable needs and the respondent\u2019s ability to provide for both his needs and hers, the trial court awarded the petitioner $1,500 per month in alimony until the respondent retires from his current position at General Electric and begins receiving a pension. Additionally, the court ordered a slightly unequal distribution of the parties\u2019 assets, with the petitioner receiving fifty-three percent and the respondent receiving forty-seven percent of them. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Before addressing the parties\u2019 arguments, we note that although the trial court specifically ruled upon the petitioner\u2019s requests for findings and rulings, the respondent, who is the appealing party, has not provided the requests for findings and rulings in the record submitted on appeal; therefore, the record does not reflect the substance of the trial court\u2019s rulings. However, we assume that they support the trial court\u2019s decision and, further, we do not consider ourselves limited to the findings and rulings the trial court recited in its narrative order. <em>See In re Guardianship of Nicholas P., </em>162 N.H. 199, 202 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\n<em>I. Fault-Based Divorce</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">We first address the respondent\u2019s assertion that the trial court erred by granting the petitioner a divorce on the ground of conduct that seriously injured her health or seriously endangered her reason. <em>See </em>RSA 458:7, V; <em>see also In the Matter of Guy &amp; Guy, </em>158 N.H. 411, 412 (2009) (explaining that the adverb \u201cseriously\u201d modifies both \u201cinjure health\u201d and \u201cendanger reason\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The gravamen of a cause of action for divorce on this ground is the injury to health or the danger to reason. <em>In the Matter of Guy &amp; Guy, </em>158 N.H. at 413. \u2018Whether the behavior proved is a sufficient ground of divorce depends on whether it has seriously injured health or endangered reason. This is the <em>sole test.\u201d Id. </em>(quotation and ellipsis omitted; emphasis added). While the statute does not require proof of conduct that would have affected an average or reasonable person, it does require proof that the health or reason of the complaining spouse was <em>actually </em>affected. <em>Id. </em>Whether the innocent party has been so treated is a question of fact for the trial court. <em>Id. </em>We will sustain the trial court\u2019s findings on this issue unless they lack evidentiary support or are legally erroneous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Because the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the respondent\u2019s conduct seriously injured the petitioner\u2019s health or seriously endangered her reason, we uphold it. The parties\u2019 son testified that on May 14, 2009, he told the petitioner that the respondent had abused him beginning when he was twelve or thirteen years old. The son said that the abuse happened in connection with \u201cbuddy showers,\u201d which were showers he took with the respondent when he was twelve or thirteen years old ostensibly to help him become \u201cfamiliar with naked men\u201d and to \u201cconserve water.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The petitioner testified that the conversation took place as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">[M]y son looked at me and brought up these buddy showers that... had been explained to [me] were so that when he entered high school and . . . [was] going to be confronted with the male body . . . [the buddy showers were] to make him feel more comfortable ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">The expression on his face scared me, and I looked at him and I said, but they were buddy showers. And he told me they were more than buddy showers. I asked him one question, I said can you please tell me the act that I think you\u2019re talking about was never consummated, that you weren\u2019t violated, and he said I can\u2019t tell you that, and I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">The petitioner testified that a few days later, after she had met with her divorce attorney, she confronted her husband:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">I looked at [the respondent] and I said I know what you\u2019ve done to my son. . . . [T]hen I said this is my attorney\u2019s card. I filed for divorce this morning, and I want your house keys and credit cards----I told him his things were in the hot-tub room____[H]is first comment when I told him I knew what he had done was it\u2019s not like it wasn\u2019t consensual. And with that remark, my daughter-in-law freaked out, got very upset, how could you call it consensual with a child? He said, well, it was probably a moment of weakness on both parts. And I told him I couldn\u2019t let him in the house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">The next morning, the respondent sent an e-mail to the petitioner, which stated: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be divorced. I want to stay with my family of 35 years.... I\u2019m deeply sorry I hurt you because I screwed up 30 years ago. I never meant to hurt [our son]----\u201d The respondent also left a voice mail message for the petitioner in which he again stated that the incident \u201cwas probably a moment of weakness on both parties\u2019 part.\u201d Additionally, the petitioner testified that she asked the respondent about his conduct \u201con <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>numerous occasions.\u201d The respondent said, \u201cI was just a kid. ... I didn\u2019t know what [I] was doing.\u201d When the petitioner asked the respondent why the abuse stopped, he \u201cwouldn\u2019t answer that question.\u201d At trial, the respondent admitted taking \u201cbuddy showers\u201d with the parties\u2019 son when the son was a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\">The petitioner testified that when her son told her about the abuse, she \u201cfreaked out\u201d and that this \u201clasted for quite a while.\u201d She testified that she \u201cfeel[s] like someone that [she] loved and trusted totally destroyed [her] and [her] son.\u201d The petitioner testified that as a result of learning that the respondent abused her son, she has \u201chad a lot of anxiety attacks\u201d and has \u201cgone into depression.\u201d She testified that as a result of the disclosure, she is seeing a counselor and taking medication for her symptoms. She also testified that she has \u201clost a little bit of weight a little quicker than they probably wanted [her] to, even though [she] ha[s] had [gastric bypass] surgery to do that.\u201d Additionally, she testified that she suffers from \u201cthe shakes,. .. lightheadedness[,]. .. and ... dizziness,\u201d which she attributes to \u201cnerves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The parties\u2019 son testified that as a result of his disclosure about the abuse, the petitioner \u201chas been extremely upset, withdrawn, daily almost\u201d and has had \u201cfar more bad days than good days.\u201d He testified, \u201cDays she\u2019ll sit crying in the dark in the living room in the love seat under a blanket.\u201d He also testified that she has suffered from \u201cweight loss, dropped-foot syndrome\u201d as well as \u201c[p]eriods of lightheadedness, dizziness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the respondent\u2019s conduct caused serious injury to the petitioner\u2019s health or seriously endangered her reason. \u2018While the testimony presented by the parties conflicted, the trial judge was in the best position to evaluate the evidence, measure its persuasiveness and assess the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Mannion &amp; Mannion, </em>155 N.H. 52, 57 (2007). Here, the record supports the trial court\u2019s findings, and we find no legal error in its decision to grant the petitioner a divorce on the ground that the respondent\u2019s conduct seriously injured her health or seriously endangered her reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">We reject the respondent\u2019s assertion that his alleged conduct was insufficient as a matter of law to constitute treatment that seriously injured the petitioner\u2019s health or seriously endangered her reason because it occurred thirty years ago and was not directed towards the petitioner herself. <em>\u201cAny behavior\u201d </em>that \u201caffects the other physically or mentally is treatment within the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Guy &amp; Guy, </em>158 N.H. at 413 (quotations omitted; emphasis added). For a spouse\u2019s behavior to satisfy the statute, \u201c[i]t does not matter whether the conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>was directed towards the innocent spouse or whether the guilty spouse engaged in the conduct with malevolent intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While the respondent\u2019s alleged conduct may have occurred many years ago, the petitioner learned of it only days before filing for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">We also reject his assertion that the trial court was compelled to find that the petitioner\u2019s symptoms were not caused by his alleged conduct. Both the petitioner and her son testified that they were so caused. While the respondent disputed this, it was for the trial court to resolve such conflicts in evidence. <em>See In the Matter of Aube &amp; Aube, </em>158 N.H. 459, 465 (2009). As the fact finder, the trial court was entitled to accept or reject, in whole or in part, the testimony of any witness or party, and was not required to believe even uncontroverted evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The respondent also argues that the petitioner\u2019s symptoms do not qualify for consideration under the statute as a matter of law. He likens this case to <em>In the Matter of Guy &amp; Guy, </em>158 N.H. at 413-14. <em>In the Matter of Guy &amp; Guy </em>is factually distinguishable from this case. The petitioner in <em>In the Matter of Guy &amp; Guy </em>was only \u201cangry, upset, and distraught\u201d when she discovered that her husband, the respondent, was exchanging e-mails with other women, including a former girlfriend. <em>Id. </em>at 413 (quotation omitted). There was no evidence that the husband\u2019s conduct had harmed her physical well-being. <em>Id. </em>at 414. Nor was there evidence that she suffered the type of mental anguish the statute was intended to encompass. <em>Id. </em>By contrast, there was evidence that the petitioner in this case fell into a depression, spent days crying, lost weight, and experienced dizziness and lightheadedness as a result of learning that her husband had sexually abused her son when her son was a child. There was also evidence that the respondent\u2019s alleged conduct caused the petitioner to seek counseling and medication for her symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">We have previously ruled that symptoms similar to the petitioner\u2019s suffice. <em>See In the Matter of Peirano &amp; Larsen, </em>155 N.H. 738, 753 (2007) (wife suffered \u201csignificant emotional distress\u201d and sought assistance of pastoral counselor (quotation omitted)); <em>In the Matter of Gronvaldt &amp; Gronvaldt, </em>150 N.H. 551, 553-54 (2004) (wife suffered emotional distress and sought counseling); <em>Routhier v. Routhier, </em>128 N.H. 439, 440 (1986) (wife sought counseling); <em>Morgan v. Morgan, </em>101 N.H. 470, 471 (1958) (wife became \u201chighly nervous\u201d and lost weight); <em>Szulc v. Szulc, </em>96 N.H. 190, 191 (1950) (wife lost considerable weight and became \u201ca complete wreck\u201d (quotation omitted)). Given the severity of the petitioner\u2019s symptoms, we cannot say that, as a matter of law, the effect on her physical and mental health is insufficient to sustain a divorce under RSA 458:7, V.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>\n<em>II. Alimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">We next address the respondent\u2019s challenge to the alimony award. RSA 458:19 (Supp. 2010) authorizes a trial court to award alimony if: (1) the party in need \u201clacks sufficient income, property, or both, including property apportioned in accordance with RSA 458:16-a, to provide for such party\u2019s reasonable needs, taking into account the style of living to which the parties have become accustomed during the marriage\u201d; (2) the party from whom alimony is sought \u201cis able to meet reasonable needs while meeting those of the party seeking alimony, taking into account the style of living to which the parties have become accustomed during the marriage\u201d; and (3) the party in need \u201cis unable to be self-supporting through appropriate employment at a standard of living that meets reasonable needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In determining the amount of alimony, a trial court must consider various factors enumerated in RSA 458:19, IV. Specifically, the court must consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">the length of the marriage; the age, health, social or economic status, occupation, amount and sources of income, the property awarded under RSA 458:16-a, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities, and needs of each of the parties; the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income; the fault of either party as defined in RSA 458:16-a, II\u00a9; and the federal tax consequences of the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">RSA 458:19, IV(b). The court \u201cmay also consider the contribution of each of the parties in the acquisition, preservation, or appreciation in value of their respective estates and the noneconomic contribution of each of the parties to the family unit.\u201d RSA 458:19, IV(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Trial courts have broad discretion in awarding alimony. <em>In the Matter of Peirano &amp; Larsen, </em>155 N.H. at 746. We review the trial court\u2019s decision under our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">The respondent first argues that the trial court failed to consider the statutory factors listed in RSA 458:19, IV. In its narrative order, however, the trial court specifically stated that it considered \u201cthe length of the parties\u2019 marriage, their age, their health, their social and economic status, the Respondent\u2019s occupation and the Petitioner\u2019s lack of full time gainful employment\u201d as well as \u201cthe amount of resources of current and future income and the property awarded pursuant to RSA 458:16\u201d and \u201ceach party\u2019s vocational skills,... current employability, the liability and needs of each party and [the] opportunity for future acquisition of assets and income[, and] the fault entered on behalf of the Respondent.\u201d The court also found facts relevant to the statutory factors enumerated in RSA 458:19, IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>The respondent next asserts that the evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s finding that he is able to meet his own reasonable needs while meeting those of the petitioner as well. As there is evidence to support this finding, we uphold it. He contends in effect that even if the trial court considered the relevant statutory factors and even if there is evidence to support its factual findings, it failed to weigh the statutory factors properly. However, we defer to the trial court\u2019s judgment on such issues as resolving conflicts in the testimony, measuring the credibility of witnesses, and determining the weight to be given evidence. <em>In the Matter of Aube &amp; Aube, </em>158 N.H. at 465. We conclude that on the record before it, the trial court was not compelled to deny the petitioner\u2019s alimony request.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\n<em>III. Property Distribution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u201cRSA 458:16-a, II creates a presumption that equal distribution of marital property is equitable.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Watterworth &amp; Watterworth, </em>149 N.H. 442, 453 (2003) (quotation and ellipsis omitted). Absent special circumstances, the court must make the distribution as equal as possible. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u201cThe statute enumerates various factors for the court to consider, such as the length of the marriage, the ability of the parties to provide for their own needs, the needs of the custodial parent, the contribution of each party during the marriage and the value of property contributed by each party.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Crowe &amp; Crowe, </em>148 N.H. 218, 221 (2002); <em>see </em>RSA 458:16-a, II (2004). Additionally, the court may consider \u201c[a]ny other factor [it] deems relevant\u201d in equitably distributing the parties\u2019 assets. RSA 458:16-a, II(o). A trial court is not precluded, however, from awarding a particular asset in its entirety to one party. <em>In the Matter of Maynard &amp; Maynard, </em>155 N.H. 630, 637 (2007). As we afford trial courts broad discretion in determining matters of property distribution in fashioning a final divorce decree, we will not overturn the trial court\u2019s decision absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Id. </em>If the court\u2019s findings can reasonably be made on the evidence presented, they will stand. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The respondent first challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling requiring him to pay \u201cone half of any COBRA costs that the parties may incur in order to maintain [the petitioner\u2019s] health insurance coverage.\u201d Because the respondent has not demonstrated that he preserved this argument for our review, we decline to consider it. <em>See In the Matter of Canaway &amp; Canaway, </em>161 N.H. 286, 291-92 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">The respondent next asserts that the trial court\u2019s distribution of the parties\u2019 marital property was inequitable. Specifically, he argues that he is entitled to a greater share of the parties\u2019 real estate holdings, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>retirement plan accounts and other tax-deferred assets, the parties\u2019 household furnishings, and the parties\u2019 tax refund received in 2009. He contends as well that it was inequitable for the court to have required him to continue making payments on the equity line encumbering the marital home and to pay a greater percentage than the petitioner of certain of the parties\u2019 debts. Further, he argues that he should not be responsible for certain uninsured medical expenses and that he is entitled to an award from the marital estate to reimburse him for his attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Based upon our review of the record submitted on appeal, and considering the trial court\u2019s finding of fault, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s distribution of property between the parties does not require reversal. <em>In the Matter of Stapleton &amp; Stapleton, </em>159 N.H. 694, 698 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\"> To the extent that the respondent asserts that the trial court erred as a matter of law by dividing assets that the respondent inherited from his parents during the marriage, we disagree. By statute, marital property subject to equitable distribution \u201cshall include <em>all </em>tangible and intangible property and assets, real or personal, belonging to either or both parties, whether title to the property is held in the name of either or both parties.\u201d RSA 458:16-a, I (2004) (emphasis added); <em>see </em>RSA 458:16-a, II (\u201cWhen a dissolution of a marriage is decreed, the court may order an equitable division of property between the parties.\u201d). This statutory definition of marital property subject to equitable distribution does not exclude inherited property \u201cbelonging to either or both parties.\u201d RSA 458:16-a, I. While RSA 458:16-a, II(n) allows a trial court to consider the \u201cvalue of any property acquired by gift, devise, or descent\u201d in determining whether an equal division of marital property is equitable, it does not require the trial court to consider this or to assign it any particular weight. <em>See In the Matter of Costa &amp; Costa, </em>156 N.H. 323, 327 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b204-7\">Dalianis, C.J., and DUGGAN, Conboy and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
