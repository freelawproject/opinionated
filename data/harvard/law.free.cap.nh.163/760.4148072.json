J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVc\">This case is before us pursuant to an order entered by the United States Supreme Court vacating the judgment in <em>State v. Dilboy, </em>160 N.H. 135 (2010) <em>(Dilboy I), </em>and remanding for further consideration in light of <em>Bullcoming v. New Mexico, </em>131 S. Ct. 2705 (2011). <em>Dilboy v. New Hampshire, </em>131 S. Ct. 3089 (2011). On remand, we reconsider only our holding on the Confrontation Clause issue. As to the other five issues, our prior decision in <em>Dilboy I </em>remains unchanged. In <em>Dilboy I, </em>we affirmed the conviction of the defendant, Anthony Dilboy, on two counts of manslaughter, <em>see </em>RSA 630:2 (Supp. 2005) (amended 2006), and two alternative counts of negligent homicide, <em>see </em>RSA 630:3 (2007). <em>Dilboy I, </em>160 N.H. at 139. After reconsidering our decision in light of <em>Bullcoming </em>and thoroughly reviewing the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">The following facts, relevant to the issue before us, are supported by the record. Additional facts can be found in our opinion in <em>Dilboy I. See Dilboy </em>1,160 N.H. at 140-42. On March 7,2006, the defendant drove through a red light at a high rate of speed and collided with the passenger-side of a Volvo sedan, killing both the driver and the passenger. After the collision, paramedics took a blood sample from the defendant and transported him to Wentworth-Douglass Hospital. At the hospital, four additional blood samples and one urine sample were taken from the defendant. The six samples were tested at the State Police Forensics Toxicology Laboratory (State forensic laboratory), a division of the New Hampshire Department of Safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">Prior to trial, the defendant filed several motions <em>in limine. </em>In one motion, entitled \u201cDefendant\u2019s Motion <em>in Limine\u201d </em>(MIL), the defendant sought to prevent the State from presenting certain evidence related to the forensic testing of the defendant\u2019s six samples. The defendant \u201canticipated that the State may see [sic] to elicit testimony regarding,\u201d among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>documents, the transmittal slips, the reports of the lab examinations sent from the department of safety to the Dover Police, and blood test results. In the body of the motion, he explained his objection to the introduction of \u201cblood test results,\u201d stating: \u201cIt is unclear what documentary evidence the state may seek to introduce regarding the blood test results in this case---[I]t appears \u2018raw data\u2019 will be utilized and the state will seek to introduce not the \u2018reported value\u2019... but rather an interpretation of other, or further, test results.\u201d The defendant argued that such documents are testimonial and, without live testimony, inadmissible under the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The State objected to the defendant\u2019s motion and also filed \u201cState\u2019s Motion <em>in Limine </em>Re: Evidence Relied Upon by Experts\u201d (State\u2019s Motion), moving to admit evidence relied upon by its expert, Michael Wagner, Ph.D., the assistant laboratory director of the State forensic laboratory. The Superior Court <em>(Fauver, </em>J.) held a hearing on December 13, 2007. At the hearing, the trial court heard arguments from the parties on the defendant\u2019s MIL and the State\u2019s Motion. The State explained that Wagner would give an opinion at trial and would be relying upon blood collection forms \u201cthat show when and how the blood samples were collected from the defendant^] . . . the raw data and the analyst\u2019s record of [requesting] the tests.\u201d The State also asserted that \u201cdefense counsel has filed many motions that... address the same subject from different angles ... and... it would be very helpful... to ask defense counsel to specify exactly what it is he\u2019s talking about.\u201d The trial court asked the defendant to articulate his position, and the defendant responded, \u201cI want the ability to cross-examine any evidence that is going to be presented to this jury.\u201d The trial court inquired further, explaining that \u201cwe\u2019re trying to nail it down a little bit for the State.\u201d The defendant, without elaborating, maintained that all of the <em>documents </em>described in his MIL are testimonial under <em>State v. O\u2019Maley, </em>156 N.H. 125 (2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant did not, however, specifically argue that Wagner\u2019s <em>testimony </em>would violate his right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">After the hearing, the trial court ruled \u201cthat the transmittal slips, the blood sample collection forms, and the blood test results are non-testimonial.\u201d The trial court elaborated that \u201cthe blood test results are non-testimonial but the interpretation of the results is testimonial.\u201d The trial court deferred ruling with respect to the laboratory reports until trial because \u201c[t]he defendant did not submit these forms for the court\u2019s review and therefore the court [could not] make a determination at [the] time [it issued the order].\u201d The court did not specifically address whether Wagner\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>violated the Confrontation Clause. The parties\u2019 motions were granted in part and denied in part \u201cconsistent with [the court\u2019s] analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">At trial, the State presented the expert testimony of Wagner. He testified about his job duties, laboratory procedures, and the outcomes of the laboratory tests on some of the defendant\u2019s samples. He explained that, as assistant laboratory director, his role is to \u201creview the data[,] . . . the paperwork^]... [the] comments[,]... [and] any issue that\u2019s involved in the analysis of [a] sample.\u201d Although it is unclear from the record who performed the tests on the defendant\u2019s samples, Wagner testified that he reviewed the toxicology tests on \u201cspecimens that purported to have come from [the defendant]\u201d and that the \u201claboratory issued results from that analysis.\u201d He also explained that \u201c[the laboratory] render[s] a report that demonstrates what we... found in [a] particular sample.\u201d When asked if he had \u201calso stated some opinions with respect to interpreting the findings of [the] lab on those samples,\u201d Wagner replied, \u201cYes.\u201d While testifying, he stated that he had his \u201coriginal data file\u201d with him and reviewed it during his testimony. However, the file was not admitted into evidence and neither counsel nor the trial court inquired as to what was contained within the file.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The bulk of Wagner\u2019s testimony focused upon \u201cthe uses, dosages, and possible effects from the use of, or withdrawal from, various drugs.\u201d Wagner did not offer an opinion about whether the defendant was, in fact, under the influence of controlled drugs at the time of the collision; nor did he opine as to any effects the defendant may have actually experienced. He did, however, testify about specific symptoms other witnesses had attributed to the defendant. He also testified about the tests \u201cpurportedly]\u201d run on the defendant\u2019s samples. While he did not expressly repeat any out-of-court statements of other analysts and at no point identified by name any other analyst from his laboratory, he did testify that certain substances were present in the defendant\u2019s blood, stating, for example, that in one blood sample, \u201cwe\u201d found trace amounts of Clonazepam and cocaine, as well as a quantifiable amount of Benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine. At some point after Wagner\u2019s testimony, the transmittal slips were admitted into evidence, but the laboratory report letters conveying the test results to the police were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The jury found the defendant guilty of two counts of manslaughter and two alternative counts of negligent homicide. The defendant appealed his conviction, arguing six separate errors, including that the Superior Court (Fauver, J.) erred in admitting evidence of laboratory test results in violation of the Federal Confrontation Clause. Finding no error, we affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">The defendant then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court on the Confrontation Clause issue. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>granted certiorari, vacated our decision in <em>Dilboy I, </em>and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Bullcoming. </em>In <em>Bullcoming, </em>the Supreme Court relied upon <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>129 S. Ct. 2527 (2009), in holding that the report of a forensic scientist absent from trial was not admissible through the \u201csurrogate\u201d testimony of a different scientist.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The relevant issue before us in <em>Dilboy I </em>was whether the admission of certain evidence at trial violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Sixth Amendment provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. CONST, amend. VI. The \u201cwitnesses against\u201d an accused are \u201cthose who bear testimony.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 51 (2004) (quotations omitted). The protections of the Confrontation Clause apply, therefore, whenever \u201ctestimonial evidence is at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68. A witness\u2019s testimonial statements are admissible only if the witness either appears at trial, <em>id. </em>at 60 n.9, or is unavailable for trial and the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the unavailable witness, <em>id. </em>at 53-54. When the evidence at issue is non-testimonial, however, the Confrontation Clause has no application. <em>See id. </em>at 68; <em>see also Whorton v. Bockting, </em>549 U.S. 406, 420 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">On appeal in <em>Dilboy I, </em>the defendant did not challenge the admission of the transmittal slips. Rather, he contended that the trial court erred in ruling that the blood test results were non-testimonial, and, accordingly, that Wagner\u2019s testimony at trial about the test results violated the Confrontation Clause. We assumed that the \u201ctest results\u201d about which Wagner testified were testimonial, but nonetheless held that his testimony did not violate the Confrontation Clause because he \u201cgenerated opinions based upon his review of\u2019 those results, and the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine him regarding his opinions. <em>Dilboy I, </em>160 N.H. at 150. The defendant now argues that \u201cthe facts and holding of <em>Bullcoming </em>compel a finding that\u201d Wagner\u2019s testimony violated his right to confrontation. The defendant asserts that Wagner\u2019s testimony \u201cabout the test results violated [his] right to confrontation because it communicated the testimonial statements of declarants who [sic] the State did not call as witnesses at trial.\u201d The State responds that <em>Bullcoming </em>is distinguishable and, therefore, is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The threshold issue in deciding whether the Confrontation Clause has been violated is whether any \u201ctestimonial statements\u201d of a non-testifying witness were admitted at trial. <em>See State v. Silva, </em>158 N.H. 96, 102 (2008). Although in <em>Dilboy I </em>we assumed, without deciding, that the testimonial statements of non-testifying witnesses were conveyed through Wagner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>testimony at trial, in light of <em>Bullcoming, </em>we believe we can no longer make such an assumption. Accordingly, before we determine whether Wagner\u2019s testimony about the blood test results violated the Confrontation Clause, we must address the trial court\u2019s ruling that \u201cthe blood test results are non-testimonial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Although the United States Supreme Court has not yet set forth a comprehensive definition of the phrase \u201ctestimonial statements,\u201d the Court has given some indication of what qualifies as a \u201ctestimonial statement.\u201d In <em>Crawford, </em>the Court listed examples of \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\"><em>ex parte </em>in-court testimony or its functional equivalent \u2014 that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially; extrajudicial statements contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions; [and] statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective -witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-7\"><em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52 (quotations and ellipsis omitted). In <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>129 S. Ct. at 2531-32, the Court explained that sworn documents reporting the results of forensic testing were \u201cfunctionally identical to live, in-court testimony, doing precisely what a witness does on direct examination\u201d and thus fell within the \u201ccore class of testimonial statements [described in <em>Crawford].\u201d </em>Most recently, in <em>Bullcoming, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2717, the Court held that an unsworn, but- signed and certified, forensic report was a testimonial statement. The Court explained that \u201c[a] document created solely for an evidentiary purpose, . . . made in aid of a police investigation, ranks as testimonial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2717 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Undoubtedly, if a forensic report created by a non-testifying analyst had been admitted against the defendant at trial in this case, it would violate the Confrontation Clause under both <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>and <em>Bullcoming. </em>However, no such reports were admitted. In fact, the trial court never even ruled on the reports because they were not submitted at the pre-trial hearing, and the parties apparently did not revisit the issue at trial. In this case, unlike in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>and <em>Bullcoming, </em>the only evidence of forensic testing that came in was Wagner\u2019s testimony about the \u201cblood test results.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">As explained above, the trial court ruled prior to trial that the \u201cblood test results are non-testimonial.\u201d In its order, the trial court referred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>\u201cblood test raw data,\u201d \u201cblood and urine test forms,\u201d and \u201cblood test results\u201d \u2014 sometimes interchangeably. The trial court did not, however, elaborate on what constitutes blood test results or make specific findings underlying its ruling that the test results are non-testimonial. Moreover, although we review whether a statement is testimonial <em>de novo, </em>in this case we have no specific statements to review because the documents, or other evidence, that constitute the \u201ctest results\u201d were never submitted into the record. \u201cIn the absence of specific findings, a court is presumed to have made all findings necessary to support its [ruling].\u201d <em>Burke v. Pierro, </em>159 N.H. 504, 510 (2009); <em>see also State v. Samuel, </em>No. M2009-01192-CCA-R3-CD, 2011 WL 2306034, at *7 (Tenn. Crim. App. June 7, 2011). Thus here, without the \u201ctest results\u201d to review, and without any specific findings explaining what the \u201ctest results\u201d are, we must assume the trial court made all findings necessary to support its ruling, and that those findings were supported by sufficient evidence. <em>Burke, </em>159 N.H. at 510; <em>see State v. Michelson, </em>160 N.H. 270, 275 (2010); <em>Bullcoming, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2722 (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (\u201c[W]e do not decide whether ... a State could introduce . . . raw data generated by a machine in conjunction with the testimony of an expert witness.\u201d); <em>Disharoon v. State, </em>Nos. S11G1880, S11G1881, 2012 WL 1571549, at *2 (Ga. May 7, 2012) (relying upon Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence in <em>Bullcoming </em>to find no Confrontation Clause violation where the testifying witness was the supervisor of the lab, was closely involved in almost every step of the testing process, and drafted the report).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The lack of a sufficient record similarly precludes our review of Wagner\u2019s testimony at trial. For example, although we know that Wagner had his original data file with him, we do not know what the file contained, and whether his testimony was based upon his own understanding of the tests, or whether he was reading or otherwise conveying the testimonial statements of others. And, although the defendant now argues that Wagner\u2019s testimony \u201cconveyed statements from others involved in collecting, transmitting, and testing [the defendant\u2019s] samples,\u201d he does not actually identify any analysts or any statements made by such analysts. The admission of Wagner\u2019s statements would violate the Confrontation Clause only if he recited the statements of a non-testifying witness, rather than his own opinions or conclusions based upon his review of the raw data. Indeed, as the State explained at the pretrial hearing, Wagner\u2019s testimony was an opinion based upon blood collection forms \u201cthat show when and how the blood samples were collected from the defendant^]... the raw data and the analyst\u2019s record of [requesting] the tests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">If Wagner\u2019s statements at trial about the \u201cresults\u201d of the tests were based upon his own review of raw data, such as graphic or numerical computer printouts, his statements may not have been a violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Confrontation Clause under <em>Bullcoming. See Bullcoming, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2722 (Sotomayor, J., concurring). However, if at trial Wagner was merely repeating a non-testifying analyst\u2019s statement of the \u201cresults,\u201d his testimony at trial might have been a Confrontation Clause violation. <em>See id. </em>at 2717 (determining that a forensic report, which contained test results and was \u201c \u2018formalized\u2019 in a signed document,\u201d contained \u201cmore than adequate [formalities] to qualify [it] as testimonial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-3\">Ultimately, there is no factual record that supports the defendant\u2019s theory of relief. <em>See Appeal of Bosselait, </em>130 N.H. 604, 607 (1988). It is the defendant\u2019s obligation to state \u201cexplicitly the specific ground of objection,\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 103, and to provide this court with a record sufficient to decide the issue raised on appeal, <em>State v. Parra, </em>135 N.H. 306, 309 (1992). To now address whether Wagner\u2019s testimony conveyed the testimonial statements of others would require us to either (1) speculate about what documents Wagner\u2019s testimony was based upon and whether he was testifying based upon his own interpretation of the raw data or merely repeating the statements of others, or (2) assume, as we did in <em>Dilboy I, </em>that his testimony conveyed the testimonial statements of others and then speculate as to whether his involvement was sufficiently close to justify his testimony, or whether his opinion was \u201cindependent,\u201d consistent with the concurrence in <em>Bullcoming. </em>Under the circumstances, we see no way to resolve the issue based upon such speculation, especially on an issue of first impression. Accordingly, because it was the defendant\u2019s burden to provide us with a record sufficient to decide his issues, we must affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">Finally, although the transmittal slips were admitted into evidence, we decline to address the defendant\u2019s Confrontation Clause arguments based upon them because the defendant did not address the issue in his brief in <em>Dilboy I. </em>Indeed, the defendant did not even brief the issue after the Supreme Court vacated <em>Dilboy I, </em>but rather raises the issue for the first time in a supplemental brief filed in response to an order issued by this court. Accordingly, he waived this issue. <em>See State v. Garcia, </em>162 N.H. 423, 435 (2011). We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b787-6\">Hicks, Conboy and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-7\"> For the reasons articulated in <em>Dilboy </em>I,160 N.H. at 151-52, to the extent that portions of the analysis in <em>O\u2019Maley </em>are inconsistent with <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>129 S. Ct. 2527 (2009), those portions, are no longer good law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
