We order the respondent disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b206-16\">The record supports the following undisputed facts. In September 2008, Heidi Gaudreau hired the respondent, an attorney licensed in New Hampshire since 1971, to help her file for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. This chapter of the Code allows individuals to reorganize their finances and repay creditors over time. Gaudreau had recently married and insisted that her husband and his income not be involved in the bankruptcy petition. The respondent, thus aware of his client\u2019s husband and income, prepared the necessary documents and submitted them to the bankruptcy court. One of those documents is Schedule I, \u201cCurrent Monthly Income of Individual Debtors),\u201d which calls for the preparer to supply the debtor\u2019s monthly income in one column and the debtor\u2019s spouse\u2019s monthly income in the other column. At the top of that document, the form states: \u201cThe column labeled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>\u2018Spouse\u2019 must be completed in all cases ... by every married debtor, whether or not a joint petition is filed, unless the spouses are separated and a joint petition is not filed.\u201d The respondent nevertheless entered zeroes in the spousal income column. On the line reserved for \u201cother monthly income\u201d of the debtor, the respondent entered \u201c$2,195.00\u201d in the appropriate field and wrote \u201ccontributions from spouse\u201d on the corresponding line.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Another document filed by the respondent with Gaudreau\u2019s petition was the \u201cChapter 13 Statement of Current Monthly Income and Calculation of Commitment Period and Disposable Income.\u201d On that form, the respondent also entered zeroes in the column designated for the debtor\u2019s spouse\u2019s income except on line 7, where he entered $365.83 in the spousal income column for \u201cAny amounts paid by another person... on a regular basis, for household expenses of the debtor.\u201d The next page of that form allows the filer to enter a \u201cmarital adjustment\u201d if \u201ccalculation of the commitment period... does not require inclusion of the [spouse\u2019s] income\u201d because such income was not paid on a regular basis for the debtor\u2019s household expenses. That adjustment would have allowed Gaudreau to ask the court to subtract the amount of her husband\u2019s income not being used for her household expenses from its calculation of the total amount of disposable income in the debtor\u2019s household. The respondent entered zeroes in the marital adjustment fields. He filed Gaudreau\u2019s bankruptcy petition along with these and other forms in September and October 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">After a hearing in November 2008, the bankruptcy trustee recommended against confirming Gaudreau\u2019s Chapter 13 plan in part because she had not established her disposable income. She then converted her case to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, but the trustee in that case moved to dismiss based, in part, upon Gaudreau\u2019s failure to disclose her husband\u2019s income. In June 2009, after the respondent\u2019s representation of Gaudreau had terminated, she withdrew her bankruptcy petition, and the bankruptcy court accepted her withdrawal and dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Based upon the respondent\u2019s representation of Gaudreau in her bankruptcy case, the PCC petitioned this court to disbar the respondent based on its conclusion that he knowingly made a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal in violation of Rule 3.3(a)(1) of the New Hampshire Rules of Professional Conduct. The respondent is currently subject to a separate two-year suspension from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">The PCC\u2019s findings of violations of the Conduct Rules must be supported by clear and convincing evidence. SUP. Ct. R. 37A(III)(d)(2)(C). In attorney discipline matters, we defer to the PCC\u2019s factual findings if supported by the record, but retain ultimate authority to determine whether, on the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>found, a violation of the rules governing attorney conduct has occurred and, if so, what the sanction should be. <em>Young\u2019s Case, </em>154 N.H. 359, 366 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The respondent argues that the PCC lacked clear and convincing evidence that he knowingly made a false statement of fact to the bankruptcy court, in violation of Rule 3.3(a)(1), when he entered zeroes in the columns on the two forms instructing filers to enter the amount of the debtor\u2019s spouse\u2019s income. He contends that he did not knowingly violate the rule in part because bankruptcy law is unsettled on the issue of what effect spousal income has in a bankruptcy case and in part because he reported his client\u2019s spouse\u2019s income \u2014 as \u201ccontributions from spouse\u201d \u2014 elsewhere on the forms and in the filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The Code sets forth in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322 (2006) the general contents of a Chapter 13 plan. A Chapter 13 plan allows for partial payments to creditors over certain \u201ccommitment periods\u201d of three to five years. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322(d)(1), (2). The length of a commitment period is determined by whether \u201cthe current monthly income of the debtor and the debtor\u2019s spouse combined\u201d is above or below a specified level. <em>Id. </em>Thus, to correctly determine the \u201ccommitment period,\u201d a debtor is required to disclose her and her spouse\u2019s income. Accordingly, both the Schedule I form and the Chapter 13 Statement of Current Monthly Income form include one column in which filers must enter the debtor\u2019s income, and a second column in which filers must enter the debtor\u2019s spouse\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">With this background in mind, we conclude that clear and convincing evidence supported the PCC\u2019s determination that the respondent knowingly made false statements to the bankruptcy court in violation of Rule 3.3(a)(1). The bankruptcy court in a Chapter 13 case uses the Schedule I form as a starting point to determine a petitioner\u2019s eligibility for bankruptcy protection and to select an appropriate plan and commitment period. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(10A)(A)(i) (2006); 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(b)(4)(ii) (2006); <em>In re Lanning, </em>545 F.3d 1269, 1282 (10th Cir. 2008), <em>aff'd sub nom. Hamilton v. Lanning, </em>130 S. Ct. 2464 (2010). As is clear from the statute, bankruptcy courts use spousal income to determine whether, and under what circumstances, the debtor is entitled to enter a repayment plan. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(b)(4)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The respondent argues that because the calculation of spousal income for the purposes of a bankruptcy case is \u201cnot entirely clear,\u201d and because he provided hints of Gaudreau\u2019s husband\u2019s income elsewhere on the form <em>(i.e., </em>listing $2195 as \u201ccontributions from spouse\u201d on Schedule I and $365.83 as spousal income from other sources on the Chapter 13 Statement of Current Monthly Income), he did not knowingly provide a false statement to the tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>The respondent cites two cases in support of his contention that the law regarding <em>disclosure </em>of a non-filing spouse\u2019s income is uncertain. Neither is persuasive of this proposition. In <em>In re Travis, 353 </em>B.R. 520 (Bankr. E.D. Mich. 2006), the court merely observed that \u201cthe <em>calculation </em>of current monthly income when there is a non-filing spouse is complicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525 (emphasis added). In fact, in <em>Travis, </em>the debtor fully disclosed his spouse\u2019s income; the dispute was limited to the proper mode of calculating her income for the purpose of identifying whether a presumption of abuse arose in a Chapter 7 case under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707(b). In <em>In re Boatright, </em>414 B.R. 526, 530-31 (Bankr. W.D. Mo. 2009), the court discussed the fact that a non-debtor spouse\u2019s \u201cCurrent Monthly Income\u201d (CMI) could potentially be captured under the definition of CMI contained within either 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(10A)(A) or 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(10A)(B), and concluded that the latter was the more appropriate vehicle for doing so. As in <em>Travis, </em>the issue in <em>Boatright </em>was to what extent a non-debtor spouse\u2019s income should be considered in determining whether a bankruptcy filing is abusive under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707(b). Notably, the court in <em>Boatright </em>stated at the outset of its opinion: \u201cCourts widely agree that a non-debtor spouse\u2019s income should be considered in determining whether a debtor\u2019s bankruptcy filing should be dismissed as abusive under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528. While we might agree with the respondent that <em>Boatright </em>offers support for the proposition that only the non-filing spouse\u2019s contributions to the debtor\u2019s household expenses, rather than his gross income, is included within CMI, neither that case nor <em>Travis </em>suggests that something less than full <em>disclosure </em>of the non-filing spouse\u2019s income is permitted. Indeed, the \u201cmarital adjustment\u201d section of the Statement of Current Monthly Income form is specifically designed to allow a debtor, <em>after making full disclosure of her spouse\u2019s income, </em>to explain why some or all of that income should not be considered because it was not available for the payment of the debtor\u2019s household expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Whether and how the court could <em>consider </em>Gaudreau\u2019s husband\u2019s income in determining her bankruptcy eligibility and plan has no bearing on whether the respondent knowingly made a false statement of fact to the court. The very first instruction on Schedule I states: \u201cThe column labeled \u2018Spouse\u2019 must be completed in all cases ... by every married debtor, whether or not a joint petition is filed, unless the spouses are separated and a joint petition is not filed.\u201d Thus, the column designated for spousal income was equivalent to the court asking the respondent, \u201cWhat is your client\u2019s spouse\u2019s income?\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By placing zeroes in that column when he knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Gaudreau\u2019s husband had income, the respondent made a false statement of fact to the tribunal, in effect telling the court that Gaudreau\u2019s husband had no income when in fact he did; thus, he violated Rule 3.3(a)(1). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To the extent that he listed <em>some </em>of Gaudreau\u2019s husband\u2019s income as \u201ccontributions from spouse\u201d on Schedule I under the column designated for Gaudreau\u2019s income (line 13 \u2014 \u201cother monthly income\u201d), the court could have interpreted such information to mean that the debtor had a spouse who made contributions to the debtor, but had no income. Similarly, although he listed $365.83 on the Statement of Current Monthly Income as the spouse\u2019s income, in reality Gaudreau\u2019s husband had significantly more income, the exact amount of which the court needed to know in order to dispose of Gaudreau\u2019s bankruptcy petition accurately and in line with the relevant statutory requirements. On the record before us, we are satisfied that the PCC could properly find by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent furnished the bankruptcy court with information he knew to be false.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Having concluded that the respondent violated Rule 3.3(a)(1), we now identify the applicable sanction. <em>Wolterbeek\u2019s Case, </em>152 N.H. 710, 714 (2005). As noted above, we retain the ultimate authority to determine the sanction for a violation of the rules. <em>Young\u2019s Case, </em>154 N.H. at 366. In determining a sanction, we are mindful that the purpose of attorney discipline is not to inflict punishment, but rather \u201cto protect the public, maintain public confidence in the bar, preserve the integrity of the legal profession, and prevent similar conduct in the future.\u201d <em>Richmond\u2019s Case, </em>152 N.H. 155, 159-60 (2005) (quotation omitted). We judge each attorney discipline case on its own facts and circumstances, taking into account the severity of the misconduct and any mitigating circumstances appearing in the record. <em>Id. </em>at 160. \u201cThe gravity of unprofessional conduct is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>determined solely by the number of rules broken or by the particular rules violated, but is determined largely with reference to the attorney\u2019s behavior.\u201d <em>Morgan\u2019s Case, </em>143 N.H. 475, 477 (1999) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">We look to the American Bar Association\u2019s STANDARDS FOR IMPOSING Lawyer Sanctions (1992) (Standards) for guidance. <em>Wolterbeek\u2019s Case, </em>152 N.H. at 714. The STANDARDS list the following factors for consideration in imposing sanctions: (a) the duty violated; (b) the lawyer\u2019s mental state; (c) the potential or actual injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct; and (d) the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors. STANDARDS \u00a7 3.0; <em>Wolterbeek\u2019s Case, </em>152 N.H. at 714. The first three factors are used as an aid in categorizing the attorney\u2019s misconduct and identifying a baseline sanction. <em>Grew\u2019s Case, </em>156 N.H. 361, 365 (2007). We then consider the effect, if any, of aggravating or mitigating factors in arriving at the ultimate sanction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">First, the respondent violated one of the most important duties of lawyers in our legal system \u2014 that of candor to a tribunal. \u201cThe confidence of judges to rely with certainty upon the word of attorneys forms the very bedrock of our judicial system.\u201d <em>Kalil\u2019s Case, </em>146 N.H. 466, 467 (2001) (quotation omitted). The oath of admission to the New Hampshire bar reflects this important duty, requiring new lawyers to swear to \u201cdo no falsehood, nor consent that any be done in the court.\u201d RSA 311:6 (2005). Second, at the very least, the respondent presented false information to the bankruptcy court knowingly: it is undisputed that he knew Gaudreau had an income-earning husband, and at the hearing before the PCC, he explained that his motivation in the proceeding was to help carry out Gaudreau\u2019s wish to avoid involving her husband\u2019s income in her case. While pursuing a client\u2019s wishes forcefully is normally a laudable quality in an attorney, doing so in a manner that violates the rules of professional conduct and misleads courts is intolerable in the legal profession; as an experienced attorney, the respondent should have known as much. Third, the respondent\u2019s misconduct both caused injury to Gaudreau and had the potential to adversely affect her interests and the integrity of the bankruptcy proceedings. <em>See </em>STANDARDS \u00a7 6.11. Gaudreau, a woman of modest means suffering financial difficulties, paid the respondent $2000 to represent her; due to his misconduct, arising from an erroneous belief that providing false information to the bankruptcy court as to Gaudreau\u2019s husband\u2019s income would allow her to qualify for Chapter 13 relief, she endured unnecessary expense and additional hardship. She also suffered potential exposure to criminal charges for filing a bankruptcy form containing false information about her husband\u2019s income. And there can be no doubt the integrity of the bankruptcy court suffered. Had the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>accepted as true that the debtor\u2019s spouse had little or no income, its decision in the case would have been predicated on a falsehood.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The seriousness of the respondent\u2019s behavior is further apparent in the Standards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">Disbarment is generally appropriate when a lawyer, with the intent to deceive the court, makes a false statement, submits a false document, or improperly withholds material information, and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a party, or causes a significant or potentially significant adverse effect on the legal proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">STANDARDS \u00a7 6.11. As we have stated before, \u201cThe privilege of practicing law does not come without the concomitant responsibility of truth, candor and honesty. Because no single transgression reflects more negatively on the legal profession than a lie, attorney misconduct involving dishonesty justifies disbarment.\u201d <em>Young\u2019s Case, </em>154 N.H. at 369 (quotation omitted). Given the absence of mitigating factors and the respondent\u2019s disciplinary history and substantial experience in the practice of law, we agree with the PCC\u2019s recommendation and order the respondent disbarred. We further order the respondent to reimburse the attorney discipline system for all expenses incurred in the investigation and enforcement of discipline in this case. SUR Ct. R. 37(19).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b212-9\">DALIANIS, C.J., and DUGGAN and HICKS, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-6\"> Insofar as respondent argues that the official bankruptcy forms are inconsistent with the Code in calling for the disclosure of more information than the Code requires, the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>manner of raising such a challenge to the forms would have been through the filing of an appropriate motion in the bankruptcy court, not by supplying false information on the forms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\"> The respondent\u2019s contention that his software did not allow him to explain, within the four corners of the form, the reasons for his entry of the spouse\u2019s income in the column designated for the <em>debtor\u2019s </em>income is without merit. If the respondent wanted to make a good faith legal argument, based on the mixed case law in other bankruptcy courts, that the court should not consider the spouse\u2019s actual income (rather than the amount of his income contributed to Gaudreau\u2019s household expenses), he could have made such a contention in a separately-written document including the spouse\u2019s actual income and explaining his reasoning for entering zeroes in the pertinent columns on the forms themselves. In that case, he would have disclosed that the spouse <em>had </em>a certain amount of income, thereby equipping the court to make further inquiry into the matter. Without having given the court any indication of the spouse\u2019s actual income, however, the respondent\u2019s act of placing zeroes in the column asking filers to provide the spouse\u2019s income constituted a false statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
