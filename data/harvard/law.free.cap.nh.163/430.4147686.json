McClammer, Jr., Trustee of the Profit Sharing Plan of the Connecticut Valley Environmental Services, Inc., appeals an order of the Superior Court <em>(Wageling, </em>J.), following a bench trial on the merits, ruling in favor of Michael W. O\u2019Hearne and Marie E. O\u2019Hearne on the parties\u2019 cross-petitions to quiet title and for injunctive relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">The parties own adjoining lots in the vicinity of the Little Sugar River in North Charlestown; McClammer owns the southerly lot, while the O\u2019Hearnes own the lot to the north. Historically, both lots were part of a larger parcel bisected by the river, which generally runs in an east-west direction at that point. In 1790, the larger parcel was subdivided by a deed conveying \u201call that part or parcel of land being and lying on the North side of Little Sugar River... [e]xcept three quarters of an acre of land that will best accommodate a Mill Spot.\u201d Title to the O\u2019Hearne lot is, ultimately, derived from this conveyance, while the McClammer lot was included in the land retained by the grantor of the 1790 deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">Prior to 1929, deeds within McClammer\u2019s chain of title referenced the river in describing the northern bound of his parcel. For instance, an 1872 deed contained the following legal description of the McClammer lot:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-15\">beginning near the south end of the South Bridge on Little Sugar River and running southwesterly on the highway ... to land of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>said P &amp; M Howard thence northerly on land of said Howard to the south bank of said river, thence easterly on said river to the place of beginning....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">A1907 deed within the McClammer chain, however, described the parcel\u2019s northern bound as running \u201cEasterly on said river <em>and land </em>of one Woodward.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201c[L]and of one Woodward\u201d included the O\u2019Hearne lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">In 1929, a deed to the McClammer parcel did not reference the river at all in describing the boundaries, and for the first time described the parcel by courses and distances between artificial monuments. Three of the monuments were located south of the river, at what McClammer described as \u201cthe edge of the river\u2019s flood plain\u201d along the northern portion of the parcel. Two of the monuments currently exist, while the easternmost monument, described in the deed as \u201cten (10) feet eight (8) inches from the southwesterly end of\u2019 the same bridge referenced in the 1872 deed, was removed by the New Hampshire Department of Transportation (DOT) when it replaced the bridge in the early 1980s.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Although early deeds within the O\u2019Hearne chain of title also appear to have referenced the river in describing the property, an 1882 deed described the southern boundary as running \u201cEasterly on ... land [owned by McClammer\u2019s predecessors] to the Highway\u201d without mentioning the river at all. Since 1936, the deeds within the O\u2019Hearne chain describe the southern boundary of the parcel as running \u201con land now or formerly of [McClammer\u2019s predecessor] to the highway (easterly),\u201d also without mentioning the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">McClammer acquired title to his lot in 1999 from the estate of Louise Hinchliffe, who had acquired her title upon the intestate deaths, in 1944 and 1957, of the grantees of the 1929 deed. The property description in McClammer\u2019s deed was identical to the description in the 1929 deed. The present dispute arose when McClammer began removing trees from the strip of land lying to the north of the monuments and to the south of the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">The O\u2019Hearnes filed a petition to enjoin McClammer from trespassing on their land, asserting that the parties\u2019 common boundary was established by the monuments. McClammer, in turn, filed his own petition to quiet title, claiming that his title ran either to the \u201cso-called thread or center of the river,\u201d or to its low water mark on \u201cthe south side of [its] main northerly channel.\u201d Thereafter, McClammer amended his petition, asserting that his title extended to the high water mark on the northern bank of the river, and included a 0.15 acre piece of land to the north of the river where, he claimed, the \u201cmill spot\u201d referenced in the 1790 deed was located. In their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>answers to McClammer\u2019s petition and amended petition, the O\u2019Hearnes claimed not only that they had record title to the areas in dispute, but that they had also acquired title by adverse possession and the doctrine of boundary by acquiescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The trial court consolidated the matters, and following a trial on the merits, ruled in favor of the O\u2019Hearnes. In its narrative order, the trial court declined to interpret the parties\u2019 deeds, but instead ruled that McClammer\u2019s claims were barred by the twenty-year statute of limitations set forth in RSA 508:2 (2010), which the court determined had been triggered either by the legal description of the O\u2019Hearne lot in the 1882 deed, or by the description in the 1929 deed to McClammer\u2019s predecessors. Alternatively, the trial court ruled that the O\u2019Hearnes had acquired title to the disputed areas through adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">With respect to adverse possession, the trial court found that \u201ctwo very important factors speak in [the] 0\u2019Hearne[s\u2019] favor.\u201d First, the trial court noted that the O\u2019Hearnes asserted ownership pursuant to \u201ca long-standing sequence of recorded deeds, which support [their] position that the boundary is defined by markers.\u201d Both the O\u2019Hearne and McClammer chains of title, according to the trial court, had described the parties\u2019 boundary with reference to the monuments since 1936. Second, the trial court found that McClammer\u2019s predecessor-in-title had actual notice that the disputed property was possessed by the O\u2019Hearnes. Specifically, the trial court noted: (1) McClammer\u2019s predecessor, Louise Hinchliffe, repeatedly walked the boundary claimed by the O\u2019Hearnes with Michael O\u2019Hearne (Michael), and otherwise \u201cacted in a way consistent with [the] 0\u2019Hearne[s\u2019] assertion that she did not consider the thread of the river to be the boundary\u201d; (2) Hinchliffe wrote a letter to the DOT in 1983 in connection with its replacement of the bridge that was consistent with the O\u2019Hearnes\u2019 claims concerning the boundary; and (3) Michael had, at Hinchliffe\u2019s request, maintained \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs on the portion of land under dispute, and cut down a tree in the disputed area that was overhanging Hinchliffe\u2019s property. These facts, according to the trial court, established that \u201cMcClammer\u2019s predecessor in interest abided by the exclusive boundary, as defined by the markers, and did so for over 20 years.\u201d As to the so-called \u201cmill spot,\u201d the trial court found no evidence that McClammer or Hinchliffe ever used it, and that the O\u2019Hearnes in fact used and improved it over a period exceeding twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">In addition to its narrative order, the trial court ruled on the parties\u2019 detailed requests for findings of fact and rulings of law. Relying upon <em>Mastroianni v. Wercinski, </em>158 N.H. 380, 383 (2009), and <em>Rauteriberg v. Munnis, </em>108 N.H. 20, 23 (1967), the trial court ruled that a boundary may be established by acquiescence and prevail over contrary descriptions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>deeds to the extent that the parties recognize the boundary as true for twenty years, and occupy their lots accordingly. The trial court then found and ruled that: (1) \u201cHinchliffe clearly acquiesced, for a period in excess of 20 years, that the boundary line separating the parties\u2019 property is the line claimed by the [O\u2019Hearnes]\u201d; and (2) the O\u2019Hearnes had established title \u201cby adverse possession both due to the acquiescence of the claimed boundary by Louise Hinchliffe and by their continuous use and possession of the land in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">McClammer moved for reconsideration, arguing that the trial court had improperly raised the statute of limitations <em>sua sponte. </em>Additionally, he challenged the trial court\u2019s rulings on the merits, arguing that it had erroneously found that the O\u2019Hearne chain of title referenced the monuments, that it improperly construed the relevant deeds, and that it ignored other evidence inconsistent with a finding of adverse possession. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that the O\u2019Hearnes had sufficiently raised the statute of limitations by pleading adverse possession, and that, because McClammer\u2019s claim was time-barred, he \u201clack[ed] standing to challenge [its] findings with respect to [the O\u2019Hearnes\u2019] ownership of the disputed strip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">This appeal followed. On appeal, McClammer argues that the trial court erred by: (1) ruling that his petition to quiet title was time-barred under RSA 508:2, and not allowing him a rehearing to submit evidence rebutting the ruling; (2) finding that the O\u2019Hearnes acquired title to the property in dispute by adverse possession or acquiescence; (3) relying upon the 1929 deed, which McClammer claims is ambiguous, to support its finding as to the location of the boundary; and (4) not finding that he had title to the \u201cthread,\u201d or center, of the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">At the outset, we note that the trial court relied upon RSA 508:2, adverse possession, and boundary by acquiescence as alternative grounds for ruling in favor of the O\u2019Hearnes. While McClammer claims he \u201cwas prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>ruling [that he was time-barred] as he was not provided an opportunity to present evidence on adverse possession,\u201d the record reflects that the O\u2019Hearnes raised adverse possession and boundary by acquiescence in their pleadings, that the parties presented evidence at trial relative to those theories, and that McClammer himself, in his request for rulings of law, sought a ruling that the O\u2019Hearnes had \u201cfail[ed] to satisfy the legal elements ... [of] either adverse possession or boundary by acquiescence.\u201d Even if the trial court erred by applying RSA 508:2, and by ruling, on reconsideration, that McClammer lacked standing to challenge its findings on adverse possession and boundary by acquiescence, we conclude that the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>ruling that the O\u2019Hearnes acquired title through Hinchliffe\u2019s acquiescence in the boundary. Accordingly, we need not address whether the trial court erred by applying RSA 508:2 or ruling that McClammer lacked standing to challenge its findings. <em>See Kessler v. Gleich, </em>156 N.H. 488, 494 (2007) (trial court will be upheld where error does not affect outcome, or where we can determine that no injury occurred).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">We also note that the parties in their briefs, and the trial court in ruling that the O\u2019Hearnes acquired title \u201cby adverse possession ... due to the acquiescence of the claimed boundary by Louise Hinchliffe,\u201d appear to conflate the theories of adverse possession and boundary by acquiescence. \u201cTo acquire title to real property by adverse possession, the possessor must show twenty years of adverse, continuous, exclusive and uninterrupted use of the land claimed so as to give notice to the owner that an adverse claim is being made.\u201d <em>Mastroianni, </em>158 N.H. at 382. Absent actual notice by the dispossessed party of the adverse possession of his or her land, \u201c[t]he law requires more than occasional, trespassory maintenance [of another\u2019s property] in order to perfect adverse title; the use must be sufficiently notorious to justify a presumption that the owner was notified of [the claim].\u201d <em>Blagbrough Family Realty Trust v. A &amp; T Forest Prods., </em>155 N.H. 29, 34 (2007); <em>see Mastroianni, </em>158 N.H. at 383-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">By contrast, \u201c[acquiescence may establish a boundary where the parties for twenty years or more have recognized a certain boundary as being the true one and have occupied their respective lots accordingly.\u201d <em>Rautenberg, </em>108 N.H. at 23; <em>see Mastroianni, </em>158 N.H. at 383. \u201cThe bound thus acquiesced in will prevail even over the description in the deeds.\u201d <em>Rautenberg, </em>108 N.H. at 23. To establish a boundary by acquiescence, a party generally must prove that: (1) the parties are adjoining landowners; (2) who have occupied their respective lots up to a certain boundary; (3) which they have recognized as the true boundary separating the lots; and (4) have done so for at least twenty years. <em>See id.; </em>9 R. POWELL, POWELL ON Real Property \u00a7 68.05[2], at 68-24 (Michael Allan Wolf ed., 2011). A boundary established by acquiescence is conclusive upon successors in title. <em>Lakeview Farm, Inc. v. Enman, </em>689 A.2d 1089, 1092 (Vt. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Although these doctrines, in practical application, may be similar, they are distinct theories that have developed independently from each other both in New Hampshire and elsewhere. <em>See, e.g., Spilinek v. Spilinek, </em>337 N.W.2d 122, 124 (Neb. 1983); <em>Walters v. Snyder, </em>570 N.W.2d 301, 303 (Mich. Ct. App. 1997); <em>see also </em>9 R. POWELL, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 68.05[3] (distinguishing boundary by acquiescence from doctrines of estoppel, adverse possession and post-conveyance agreement). While \u201cadverse possession developed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>from the statutes of limitation on actions for the recovery of land,\u201d <em>Hewes v. Bruno, </em>121 N.H. 32, 33 (1981), we long ago explained that boundary by acquiescence is grounded \u201cupon principles of public policy, [that preclude a party] from setting up or insisting upon a boundary line in opposition to one which has been steadily adhered to, upon both sides, for more than twenty years,\u201d <em>Richardson v. Chickering, </em>41 N.H. 380, 384 (1860).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In this case, although the parties and the trial court may not have carefully delineated the doctrines of adverse possession and boundary by acquiescence, the trial court correctly noted that a boundary may be established by the parties\u2019 mutual recognition of the boundary as correct, and consistent occupation of their lots, for twenty years. In context, we construe the trial court\u2019s determinations that Hinchliffe \u201cacquiesced, for a period in excess of 20 years,\u201d in the boundary claimed by the O\u2019Hearnes, and that the O\u2019Hearnes established title to the land in dispute through Hinchliffe\u2019s acquiescence, as a ruling that the O\u2019Hearnes satisfied the requirements of boundary by acquiescence. \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s legal rulings <em>de novo, </em>but defer to its findings of fact if supported by the record.\u201d <em>Mastroianni, </em>158 N.H. at 382 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The testimony at trial supports this ruling. Michael, who had lived on the O\u2019Hearne lot for sixty-eight years at the time of trial, testified that as a child, his father and predecessor-in-title, Walter O\u2019Hearne (Walter), would take him across the river and point out the boundary and boundary markers to him. Michael further testified that he and Hinchliffe, who had sole title to the McClammer lot from 1957 until her death in 1997, walked the boundary line together on multiple occasions throughout the years and identified the boundary markers. According to Michael, Hinchliffe herself told him that the monuments were \u201cboundary\u201d markers. Based upon this testimony, the trial court supportably found that Michael and Hinchliffe \u201cwalked the boundary line as [Michael] claims it to exist. . . many times over a period of time . . . exceeding] twenty years,\u201d and that they \u201cidentified the markers now identified on [Michael\u2019s] survey and . . . recognized the boundary shown in [his] survey as being the true boundary between the respective properties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Consistent with this testimony, the record reflects that in 1983, Hinchliffe wrote the DOT and advised it of her intention \u201cto meet [with Walter] and have a marker placed 10 ft. 8 inches from the concrete end of the bridge over Little Sugar River.\u201d Ten feet, eight inches from the end of the bridge is consistent with the location identified in the 1929 deed of the monument removed by the DOT in connection with its replacement of the bridge. Also in connection with the bridge replacement, both Hinchliffe and Walter deeded small portions of their land to the State in 1983; the deed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Walter included 0.02 acres of land both north and south of the river, bounded to the south \u201cby land... of... Hinchliffe,\u201d while Hinchliffe deeded 0.01 acres of land extending \u201c[n]ortherly to land ... of Walter.\u201d The DOT\u2019s survey of the bridge identifies the boundary between the McClammer and O\u2019Hearne lots as being south of the river. The trial court sustainably found this evidence to establish that both the O\u2019Heames and Hinchliffe recognized \u201cthat the true location of the now disputed boundary is consistent with the\u201d boundary claimed by the O\u2019Hearnes.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In addition to testimony establishing Hinchliffe\u2019s recognition of the monuments as boundary markers, the O\u2019Hearnes presented other testimony demonstrating their occupation of the area in dispute, and recognition of their occupation by McClammer\u2019s predecessors. For instance, Michael testified that in the early 1950s, Charles Elie, Hinchliffe\u2019s brother and a grantee of the 1929 deed, requested permission from Walter to run an irrigation line from the river and between two of the markers in order to irrigate strawberry beds on the McClammer lot. Michael also testified that Hinchliffe asked him to keep the area south of the river and north of the markers free of debris to prevent flooding onto her property, and that he would comply with her request by cutting wood in that area and clearing it of debris. He further testified that he removed a tree from the disputed area, again at Hinchliffe\u2019s request, because she was concerned that it would damage a garage on her property. Finally, Michael testified that he installed \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs in the disputed area in 1970, at Hinchliffe\u2019s specific request, because she was concerned that trespassers accessing the southern bank of the river in the area north of the monuments were encroaching upon her land to do so. Those signs remained there until McClammer removed them in approximately 2005. According to Michael, there had never been any kind of boundary dispute between his family and owners of the McClammer lot until McClammer acquired it.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">We conclude that there was more than ample support for the trial court to have found that the O\u2019Hearnes, their predecessors, and McClammer\u2019s predecessors mutually recognized the boundary marked by the monuments as the true boundary between the adjoining lots, and occupied the lots accordingly for a period in excess of twenty years. <em>Rautenberg, </em>108 N.H. at 23; <em>see Lakeview Farm, Inc., </em>689 A.2d at 1092 (boundary by acquiescence established where at least two generations of neighboring landowners accepted a fenced and blazed line as the common boundary, walked the fence line to confirm the boundary, and used their lots consistent with the boundary over a period exceeding requisite time frame under Vermont law). While the trial court may also have found that the O\u2019Hearnes\u2019 use of the property south of the river was \u201coccasional\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>\u201cshared\u201d with Hinchliffe, these findings are not inconsistent, under the circumstances of this case, with establishment of the boundary by acquiescence. <em>See Marja Corp. v. Allain, </em>622 A.2d 1182, 1185 (Me. 1993) (acquiring title by acquiescence does not require continuous or exclusive occupation but only occupation sufficient to provide notice of claim). Upon this record, we cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling that the O\u2019Hearnes acquired title to the area in dispute due to Hinchliffe\u2019s acquiescence in the boundary claimed by the O\u2019Hearnes was either unsupported by the evidence or erroneous as a matter of law. <em>See Mastroianni, </em>158 N.H. at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">To the extent the trial court incorrectly found that the O\u2019Hearne chain of title referenced the monuments, this finding cannot have affected the outcome of the case since the trial court\u2019s findings and rulings relative to Hinchliffe\u2019s acquiescence in the boundary are supported by the record and compel the result reached by the trial court. <em>See Kessler, </em>156 N.H. at 494. Similarly, any error in the trial court\u2019s purported \u201creliance\u201d upon the 1929 deed is harmless. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Finally, to the extent McClammer claims that the boundary found by the trial court is the high water mark of the river and, thus, that he has title to the \u201cthread\u201d of the river, <em>see Sheldon v. Sevigny, </em>110 N.H. 419, 422-23 (1970), the only part of the record that he cites in his brief to establish that he preserved this issue, <em>see </em>Sup. Ct. R. 16(3)(b), is a response he filed to an objection to his motion for reconsideration. While in his initial petition to quiet title McClammer claimed that his title extended to the thread of the river, he did so on the basis that the river, and not the artificial monuments, marked his boundary. Indeed, he claimed that the monuments were \u201cat the edge of the river\u2019s flood plain,\u201d that the O\u2019Hearnes wrongly claimed title to the \u201cupland lying in the flood plain along the <em>south </em>side of the [river] between [the] river and [his] land,\u201d and that, over time, the river had \u201cgradually migrated northward, accreting land onto the south bank\u201d and entitling him to the accretions. Nowhere in the petition or amended petition did McClammer allege that the monuments established his boundary at the high water mark of the river, entitling him to the disputed land as part of the river itself. In the response to the objection to his motion for reconsideration, however, McClammer asserted that the monuments in fact were located at \u201cthe ordinary high water line of the [river],\u201d an assertion inconsistent with the testimony of his expert, who claimed that they were not at the high water mark of the river, but at its \u201cflood mark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\u201cIssues must be raised at the earliest possible time, because trial forums should have a full opportunity to come to sound conclusions and to correct claimed errors in the first instance.\u201d <em>SNCR Corp. v. Greene, </em>152 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>N.H. 223, 224 (2005) (quotation and brackets omitted). Here, we conclude that McClammer did not timely raise this claim in a post-trial response to an objection to a motion for reconsideration. Even if he had timely raised the claim, however, the evidence at trial does not compel a finding that the boundary markers are located at the high water mark of the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b459-6\">DALIANIS, C.J., and CONBOY and LYNN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
