The petitioner argues that the trial court erred when it: (1) considered his federal veterans\u2019 disability benefits as income for alimony purposes; (2) treated any potential post-divorce distributions from his mother\u2019s trust as marital property subject to distribution; (3) ordered him to pay the respondent $47,000 from his trust distributions, even though he had dissipated most of it before the divorce; and (4) found him in indirect civil contempt for failing to pay temporary alimony to the respondent and for violating the trial court\u2019s anti-hypothecation order. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">The following facts derive from the record. The parties were married for thirteen years. They separated in May 2010, and their final decree of divorce was entered in April 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">The petitioner is totally and permanently disabled. He receives $962 in monthly social security benefits and approximately $2,578 in monthly federal veterans\u2019 disability benefits. He receives federal veterans\u2019 disability benefits because he has post-traumatic stress disorder from serving in Vietnam. The respondent also suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as other ailments. She receives approximately $200 in monthly food stamps and has no savings or other assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">The only marital asset is the petitioner\u2019s inheritance from a trust created by his mother. The petitioner is one of five beneficiaries of the trust; his sister is the trustee of the trust. The petitioner\u2019s mother died in March 2010. Between then and January 2011, the petitioner received $79,000 from the trust. Despite the trial court\u2019s November 2010 anti-hypothecation order, the petitioner spent all $79,000 by the time of the parties\u2019 final hearing in February 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">The petitioner used more than $30,000 to buy illegal narcotics. With the remainder, he bought himself a truck and a trailer, gave his children $9,000, and spent $6,000 on his daughter\u2019s wedding. The trustee estimated that the petitioner will receive an additional $15,000 from the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Although the trial court\u2019s temporary order required the petitioner to pay the respondent $1,250 in monthly alimony, he did not do so. As a result, the respondent was unable to pay the mortgage on the marital home. By the time of the final hearing, the home had gone into foreclosure, and the respondent was homeless and living in a shelter.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The trial court specifically found that the petitioner had \u201cno credibility.\u201d The trial court found that he lied at an August 2010 hearing when he testified that he had received, by that time, only $25,000 from the trust, when, in fact, he had received $41,000. The trial court found that he lied again a month later when he answered interrogatories indicating that, as of September 2010, he had only received $31,500 from the trust, when, in fact, he had received $51,000. The trial court found that the petitioner again lied in his December 2010 financial affidavit, which indicated that he had no cash, even though, in that month alone, he received $10,500 in cash from the trust, which he then spent on illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The parties\u2019 final divorce decree ordered the petitioner to pay the respondent one-half of his trust distributions, which the court calculated to be $47,000 ($79,000 received before divorce + $15,000 to be distributed after divorce = $94,000/2 = $47,000). The trial court also found the petitioner to be in indirect civil contempt for violating its temporary decree by not paying alimony as ordered and by hypothecating marital property. To purge himself of the contempt, the court ordered the petitioner to pay the alimony arrearage and to pay the respondent\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees associated with filing and prosecuting her contempt motions. The trial court authorized the respondent to perfect a lien against the petitioner\u2019s trailer and truck to secure the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">\u201cWe afford trial courts broad discretion in determining matters of property distribution, alimony and child support in fashioning a final divorce decree. We will not overturn the trial court\u2019s decision absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Crowe &amp; Crowe, </em>148 N.H. 218, 221 (2002) (citation omitted). \u201cIf the court\u2019s findings can reasonably be made on the evidence presented, they will stand.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Letendre &amp; Letendre, </em>149 N.H. 31, 36 (2002). We address each of the petitioner\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">\n<em>I. Veterans\u2019 Disability Benefits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The petitioner first argues that federal law precludes the trial court from counting his monthly veterans\u2019 disability benefits as income for alimony purposes. RSA 458:19 (Supp. 2011) authorizes a trial court to award alimony if: (1) the party in need \u201clacks sufficient income, property, or both, including property apportioned in accordance with RSA 458:16-a, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>provide for such party\u2019s reasonable needs, taking into account the style of living to which the parties have become accustomed during the marriage\u201d; (2) the party from whom alimony is sought \u201cis able to meet reasonable needs while meeting those of the party seeking alimony, taking into account the style of living to which the parties have become accustomed during the marriage\u201d; and (3) the party in need \u201cis unable to be self-supporting through appropriate employment at a standard of living that meets reasonable needs.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-3\">In determining the amount of alimony, a trial court must consider: the length of the marriage; the age, health, social or economic status, occupation, amount and sources of income, the property awarded under RSA 458:16-a, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities, and needs of each of the parties; the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income; the fault of either party as defined in RSA 458:16-a, 11(1); and the federal tax consequences of the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">RSA 458:19, IV(b). RSA 458:19, IV(c) expressly allows trial courts to \u201cconsider veterans\u2019 disability benefits collected by either or both parties to the extent permitted by federal law\u201d when \u201cdetermining amount and sources of income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The petitioner contends that 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301(a)(1) (2006) precludes the trial court from considering his veterans\u2019 disability benefits as income for alimony purposes. Section 5301(a)(1) provides that federal veterans\u2019 disability benefits \u201cshall be exempt from the claim of creditors, and shall not be liable to attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatever, either before or after receipt by the beneficiary.\u201d The petitioner argues that because \u201cthe amount of income available to [him]... from <em>alternative </em>sources is insufficient to cover the amount of the alimony payments,\u201d the trial court\u2019s alimony order effects an \u201cattachment, levy, or seizure\u201d of his veterans\u2019 disability benefits. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The petitioner\u2019s contention is contrary to the governing law. <em>See In re Marriage of Wojcik, </em>838 N.E.2d 282, 299 (Ill. Ct. App. 2005). \u201cAn overwhelming majority of courts have held that [federal veterans\u2019] disability payments may be considered as income in awarding spousal support.\u201d <em>Urbaniak v. Urbaniak, </em>807 N.W.2d 621, 626 (S.D. 2011) (quotation omitted). \u201cThese courts conclude that federal law does not prohibit an award of alimony against a spouse receiving military disability pay and, once alimony is awarded, federal law will not relieve the paying spouse from paying such alimony obligations, <em>even if most of the veteran\u2019s income consists of military disability </em>benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see Morales and Morales, </em>214 P.3d 81, 85 (Or. Ct. App. 2009); <em>Youngbluth v. Youngbluth, </em>6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>A.3d 677, 687 n.3 (Vt. 2010); Annotation, <em>Enforcement of Claim for Alimony or Support, or for Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs Incurred in Connection Therewith, Against Exemptions, </em>52 A.L.R.5TH 221, 372 (1997) (\u201cWith few exceptions, the cases hold that payments arising from service in the Armed Forces .. ., though exempt as to the claims of ordinary creditors, are not exempt from a claim for alimony, support, or maintenance . . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">In so concluding, courts have relied upon <em>Rose v. Rose, </em>481 U.S. 619 (1987). The issue in <em>Rose </em>was whether a state court had jurisdiction to hold a disabled veteran in contempt for failing to pay child support when federal veterans\u2019 disability benefits were the veteran\u2019s only means of satisfying his obligation. <em>Rose, </em>481 U.S. at 621-22. The veteran argued that federal law conflicted with and, thus, preempted state statutes that purport to give state courts jurisdiction over veterans\u2019 disability benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 625. The Court disagreed. <em>Id. </em>at 636. One of the federal provisions upon which the veteran relied was the precursor to section 5301(a). <em>Id. </em>at 630; <em>see Marriage of Strong v. Strong, </em>8 P.3d 763, 770 (Mont. 2000). \u201cAfter reviewing the legislative history\u201d of the provision, \u201cthe Court held that [veterans\u2019] disability benefits were never intended to be exclusively for the subsistence of the beneficiary.\u201d <em>Marriage of Strong, </em>8 P.3d at 770; <em>see Rose, </em>481 U.S at 634. Rather, they were intended to support \u201cthe veteran\u2019s family as well.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>481 U.S. at 634. Accordingly, to recognize an exception to the statute\u2019s prohibition against attachment, levy, or seizure in the child support context \u201cwould further, not undermine, the federal purpose in providing these benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court ruled, therefore, that \u201cregardless of the merit of the distinction between the moral imperative of family support obligations and the businesslike justifications for community property division,... [the statute] does not extend to protect a veteran\u2019s disability benefits from seizure where the veteran invokes that provision to avoid an otherwise valid order of child support.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Courts have used \u201cthe logic of <em>Rose\u201d </em>to hold that \u201ca state court is clearly free to consider post-dissolution disability income and order a disabled veteran to pay spousal support even where disability benefits will be used to make such payments.\u201d <em>Marriage of Strong, </em>8 P.3d at 770 (quotation and brackets omitted). \u201cThese courts have held that the anti-attachment provisions of section 5301(a)(1) do not shield a veteran\u2019s benefits from being considered in an alimony or maintenance proceeding because a spouse seeking maintenance is not a \u2018creditor\u2019 under the statute but is instead seeking family support.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Wojcik, </em>838 N.E.2d at 300. These authorities \u201cprovide a compelling basis for concluding that a trial court may consider a former spouse\u2019s present and anticipated disability benefits\u201d as income for alimony purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>The petitioner argues that <em>Mansell v Mansell, </em>490 U.S. 581, 594-95 (1989), requires a different result. We disagree. In <em>Mansell, </em>the court concluded that a different federal statute precludes state courts from \u201ctreat[ing] as property divisible upon divorce military retirement pay that has been waived to receive veterans\u2019 disability benefits.\u201d <em>Mansell, </em>490 U.S. at 587 n.6, 594-95. The petitioner\u2019s argument is based upon an overly broad interpretation of <em>Mansell. </em>\u201cThe federal question in <em>Mansell </em>was a narrow one: Whether federal law preempts the application of state community property laws to military retirement pay.\u201d <em>Morales and Morales, </em>214 P.3d at 85 (quotation, brackets, ellipsis and emphasis omitted). \u201cIn other words, <em>Mansell </em>limits a state court\u2019s ability to treat military retirement pay that a retiree has waived in order to receive veterans\u2019 disability benefits as <em>property </em>that can be divided on the dissolution of a marriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[N]early every state court that has addressed th[e] question has concluded that <em>Mansell </em>affects property division, <em>not </em>spousal support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The petitioner\u2019s argument conflates the consideration of disability benefits for property division purposes with their consideration to determine alimony. <em>Youngbluth, </em>6 A.3d at 687 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">\n<em>II. Trust</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The petitioner next asserts that the trial court erred by treating any potential post-divorce distributions from his mother\u2019s trust as marital property subject to equitable distribution. We review <em>de novo </em>a trial court\u2019s determination that a particular asset is marital property as defined by RSA 458:16-a, I (2004); <em>see In the Matter of Chamberlin &amp; Chamberlin, </em>155 N.H. 13, 16 (2007). Under RSA 458:16-a, I, marital property subject to equitable distribution includes \u201call tangible and intangible property and assets, real or personal, belonging to either or both parties, whether title to the property is held in the name of either or both parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The petitioner argues that his interest in any future distributions from his mother\u2019s trust is a mere expectancy, and, therefore, not a property interest subject to equitable distribution. <em>See In the Matter of Goodlander &amp; Tamposi, </em>161 N.H. 490, 495-98 (2011); <em>see also </em>RSA 564-B:8-814(b) (Supp. 2011).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">If a distribution to or for the benefit of a beneficiary is subject to the exercise of the trustee\u2019s discretion, whether or not the terms of a trust include a standard to guide the trustee in making distribution decisions, then the beneficiary\u2019s interest is neither a property interest nor an enforceable right, but a mere expectancy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-9\"><em>In the Matter of Goodlander &amp; Tamposi, </em>161 N.H. at 495 (quotation and brackets omitted); <em>see </em>RSA 564-B:8-814(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>The petitioner, however, has failed to provide a record sufficient for our review of this issue, which was his burden as the appealing party. <em>See Rix v. Kinderworks Corp., </em>136 N.H. 548, 553 (1992); <em>see also </em>SUP. Ct. R. 13. We have no way of determining, based upon the record before us, what the terms of the trust are, and whether the petitioner\u2019s interest in the future distribution from the trust is \u201cabsolute, fixed and certain\u201d or only a mere expectancy. <em>In the Matter of Goodlander &amp; Tamposi, </em>161 N.H. at 495 (quotation omitted). Absent a sufficient record, we must uphold the trial court\u2019s determination that the petitioner\u2019s interest in future distributions from his mother\u2019s trust is a property interest subject to equitable distribution. The amount of the future payment is not an issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\">\n<em>III. Order to Pay Respondent $17,000</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The petitioner next contends that the trial court erred when it ordered him to pay the respondent $47,000 from his trust distributions. He argues that because, by the time of the final hearing, he had \u201cin fact spent \u2014 or \u2018dissipated\u2019 essentially the entire amount\u201d of the distributions, they no longer constituted property that \u201cbelonged]\u201d to him, and, thus, could not be divided. RSA 458:16-a, I. He argues that \u201cthe record clearly shows [he] \u2018squandered\u2019 and no longer possessed\u201d the money the trial court divided. Because \u201cthis money was no longer ... among the \u2018tangible and intangible property and assets, real or personal belonging to\u2019 the petitioner, . . . [it] was not . . . \u2018property\u2019 subject to . . . equitable distribution.\u201d <em>See In the Matter of Chamberlin &amp; Chamberlin, </em>155 N.H. at 17-18 (corpus of irrevocable charitable trust established by spouses belonged to neither spouse and, thus, was not subject to equitable distribution; however, because parties retained right to receive distributions of interest from trust, this right was property subject to equitable distribution).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\"> We reject the petitioner\u2019s overly technical construction of RSA 458:16-a, I. Given the purpose of RSA 458:16-a (2004), which is to achieve equity, we hold that it would be contrary to legislative intent to \u201cpermit one spouse to squander marital property and render it impossible to make an equitable award of property.\u201d <em>Sharp v. Sharp, </em>473 A.2d 499, 505 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1984). \u201c[Consistent with the equitable purpose of distribution under statutes like [RSA 458:16-a], courts have held' that dissipated property must be distributed like any other,\u201d even though it no longer exists. <em>Herron v. Johnson, </em>714 A.2d 783, 786 (D.C. 1998); <em>see A.I.D. v. P.M.D., </em>408 A.2d 940, 943 (Del. 1979). Courts have ruled that when property is intentionally dissipated to avoid its inclusion in the property to be equitably distributed, \u201csuch intentional dissipation is no more than a fraud on marital rights.\u201d <em>Sharp, </em>473 A.2d at 505. In such a case, courts treat \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>dissipated assets ... as if they were existing marital property,\u201d and \u201cthen [either] constructively award[] [them] to the dissipating spouse as part of that spouse\u2019s share of the marital estate,\u201d or, if insufficient assets remain to compensate the innocent spouse, \u201corder the dissipating spouse to pay a monetary award.\u201d 2 B. TURNER, EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF Property \u00a7 6:105, at 553-54 (3d ed. 2005). In the instant case, w\u00e9 hold that, having found that the petitioner dissipated his trust distributions, the <em>only </em>marital asset, the trial court did not err when it ordered him to pay the respondent her share of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">\n<em>TV. Civil Contempt</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Finally, the petitioner challenges the trial court\u2019s contempt finding. \u201cContempt is an offense at common law \u2014 a specific and substantive offense that is separate and distinct from the matter in litigation out of which the contempt arose.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Kosek &amp; Kosek, </em>151 N.H. 722, 726 (2005). The difference between civil and criminal contempt is the character of the punishment. <em>Id. </em>at 727. In civil contempt, the punishment is remedial, coercive, and for the benefit of the complainant. <em>Id. </em>Civil contempt proceedings may result in fines payable to the complainant or an indeterminate jail sentence until the contemnor complies with the court order. <em>Id. </em>By contrast, the purpose of prosecution for criminal contempt is to protect the authority and vindicate the dignity of the court. <em>Id. </em>The criminal contemnor, unlike the civil contemnor, may be imprisoned for a determinate amount of time without the ability to purge the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Contempts are either direct or indirect. <em>Bonser v. Courtney, </em>124 N.H. 796, 808 (1984). Direct contempt is committed in the presence and immediate view of the court. <em>Id. </em>Each element of the contempt must be personally observed by the court. <em>Id. </em>Indirect contempt is committed outside the presence of the court and without the judge having full personal knowledge of every element of contempt. <em>Id. </em>It arises from events of which the presiding judge could not take judicial notice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Here, the court found the petitioner in indirect civil contempt for failing to comply with its temporary alimony order and for violating its antihypotheeation order. After so finding, the trial court imposed sanctions. Specifically, the court ordered the petitioner to pay the respondent the amount of temporary alimony then in arrears, $8,750, and to pay her attorney\u2019s fees. The court also allowed the respondent to perfect a lien against the petitioner\u2019s travel trailer and truck to secure this debt. The court ordered that if the petitioner failed to comply with the court\u2019s order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>on contempt, the respondent could enforce the lien and the petitioner would be responsible for any additional attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The petitioner argues that the trial court erred by finding him in indirect civil contempt without first finding that he had the ability to make the ordered payments. However, the record does not demonstrate that the petitioner ever made this argument in the trial court. Accordingly, it is not preserved for our review. <em>See In the Matter of Goodlander &amp; Tamposi, </em>161 N.H. at 506-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Alternatively, the petitioner contends that the trial court committed plain error. <em>See </em>Sup. Ct. R. 16-A. The plain error rule allows us to consider errors not raised before the trial court. <em>State v. Ortiz, </em>162 N.H. 585, 590 (2011). \u201cA plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the attention of the trial court or the supreme court.\u201d SUR Ct. R. 16-A. \u201cHowever, the rule should be used sparingly, its use limited to those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.\u201d <em>Ortiz, </em>162 N.H. at 590 (quotation omitted). To find plain error: \u201c(1) there must be an error; (2) the error must be plain; (3) the error must affect substantial rights; and (4) the error must seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We have looked <em>to </em>federal plain error analysis for guidance in applying our plain error rule. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">We find no error. We have held that \u201cthe inability to comply with [a] court\u2019s order, whether in civil or criminal contempt proceedings, is a defense and, therefore, should be raised by the [contemnor].\u201d <em>State v. Wallace, </em>136 N.H. 267, 271 (1992); see Annotation, <em>Pleading and Burden of Proof, in Contempt Proceedings, as to Ability to Comply with Order for Payment of Alimony or Child Support, </em>53 A.L.R.2D 591, 607 (1957) (noting that this represents the majority view). The petitioner never raised this defense. Accordingly, it was not error for the trial court to have failed to consider it. To the extent that the petitioner contends that the trial court may not incarcerate him before first finding that he has the ability to comply with its order, we observe that the trial court has not sought to do so. Therefore, this issue is not ripe for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b622-8\">Hicks, Conboy and LYNN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
