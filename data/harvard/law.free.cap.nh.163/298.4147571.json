We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The trial court found, or the record supports, the following facts. The defendant owns property located at 87 North River Road in Epping. On January 29, 2008, the Town of Epping Fire Department was called to the defendant\u2019s property because of a fire involving the home\u2019s hot water heater. Jason Antosz, a volunteer firefighter with the Epping Fire Department, was among the firefighters who responded to the call.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Mr. Antosz arrived at the scene of the fire, parked his vehicle on the street, and walked up the driveway to speak with the lieutenant on the scene. The lieutenant instructed him to walk back down the driveway and retrieve a fire extinguisher from a fire truck parked on the street. The driveway was covered with packed snow and ice, and as Mr. Antosz walked down it, he slipped and fell and was seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">The plaintiffs filed suit against the defendant. Mr. Antosz claimed negligence, alleging that the driveway was in an unsafe and unreasonable condition as a result of the defendant\u2019s failure to remove snow and ice from it, and that the condition of the driveway caused his fall and resulting injury. Ms. Antosz claimed loss of consortium. The defendant moved for summary judgment arguing that Mr. Antosz\u2019s claim is barred by RSA 507:8-h (2010) (setting forth the \u201cFireman\u2019s Rule\u201d). The plaintiffs objected, arguing that RSA 507:8-h does not apply to volunteer firefighters, or alternatively, that even if it does, under the statute\u2019s provisions, Mr. Antosz\u2019s negligence claim is not barred. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion. The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration, which the trial court denied. The plaintiffs now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we consider the affidavits and other evidence, and all inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Waterfield v. Meredith Corp., </em>161 N.H. 707, 709 (2011). We will affirm the grant of summary judgment only if our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>We review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">In granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court made two rulings. First, it determined that Mr. Antosz\u2019s volunteer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>status does not preclude the application of the Fireman\u2019s Rule. The trial court based this determination both upon Mr. Antosz\u2019s status as an \u201cemployee\u201d under the workers\u2019 compensation statute, <em>see </em>RSA 281-A:2,1, VII(a)(2) (2010), as well as the fact that the text of RSA 507:8-h does not expressly distinguish between paid firefighters and volunteer firefighters. Second, the trial court determined that confronting an ice and snow covered driveway at the scene of the fire was incidental to and inherent in Mr. Antosz\u2019s performance of normal duties and, therefore, the Fireman\u2019s Rule barred his negligence action.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The plaintiffs appeal both rulings. First, assuming that RSA 507:8-h applies to volunteer firefighters, we address the trial court\u2019s determination that as applied to this case, it bars Mr. Antosz\u2019s negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Resolution of this issue requires us to interpret RSA 507:8-h. In matters of statutory interpretation, \u201c[w]e are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Kenison v. Dubois, </em>152 N.H. 448, 451 (2005). We first look to the language of the statute and, where possible, ascribe to the language its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Appeal of Union Tel. Co., </em>160 N.H. 309, 317 (2010). We examine the statute\u2019s legislative history only if the statutory language is ambiguous. <em>See Sutton v. Town of Gilford, </em>160 N.H. 43, 54 (2010). We neither consider what the legislature might have said, nor add language that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>In the Matter of McArdle &amp; McArdle, </em>162 N.H. 482, 485 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">We first adopted the Fireman\u2019s Rule in <em>England v. Tasker, </em>129 N.H. 467, 468-72 (1987). In 1993, the legislature codified the rule as RSA 507:8-h, and in 1997 amended the statute. RSA 507:8-h now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">Firefighters . . . shall have no cause of action for injuries arising from negligent conduct which created the particular occasion for the [firefighter\u2019s] official engagement. However, this section does not affect such [firefighter\u2019s] causes of action for unrelated negligent conduct occurring during the [firefighter\u2019s] official engagement, or for other negligent conduct....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the statute does not bar Mr. Antosz\u2019s negligence claim because his injury, caused by a slip and fall on a snow and ice covered driveway, did not arise from the conduct which created the reason for his \u201cofficial engagement\u201d at the scene, a hot water heater fire. In response, the defendant contends that RSA 507:8-h bars a firefighter\u2019s suit \u201cbased upon negligence, even when independent of the cause of his presence at the premises, when he is injured in the course of the duties he is called upon and expected to perform.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>The trial court determined that the slip and fall \u201coccurred while [Mr. Antosz] was performing his duties as a firefighter.\u201d Citing a Rhode Island case that held that the Fireman\u2019s Rule barred a police officer\u2019s negligence action arising from a slip and fall on an icy walkway, the trial court stated: \u201cThe [Rhode Island] Court reasoned that... \u2018confronting a snow-and-ice-covered walkway at a potential crime scene is so closely connected to the purpose of [the officer\u2019s] enforcement presence on the property that it may be accurately described as incidental to and inherent in the performance of normal duties.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Day v. Caslowitz, </em>713 A.2d 758, 761 (R.I.1998).) Agreeing with this rationale, the trial court found that Mr. Antosz\u2019s fall was incidental to and inherent in the performance of his duties, and ruled that the statute bars his action. The trial court\u2019s conclusion, however, is not supported by the unambiguous language of our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Statutory grants of immunity that bar common law rights to recovery, such as that set forth in RSA 507:8-h, are strictly construed. <em>Cecere v. Loon Mt. Recreation Corp., </em>155 N.H. 289, 291 (2007). Contrary to the defendant\u2019s arguments and the trial court\u2019s ruling, the language of the statute does not bar all negligence claims based upon injury suffered during the performance of firefighting duties. Rather, the plain language of RSA 507:8-h bars only suits <em>\u201carising from </em>negligent conduct which <em>created </em>the particular occasion for the [firefighter\u2019s] official engagement.\u201d (Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\"> In support of her argument, the defendant relies upon the \u201cpublic policy and philosophical underpinning for the Firemen\u2019s Rule... expressed before the enactment of RSA 507:8-h.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Akerley v. Hartford Ins. Group, </em>136 N.H. 433, 437 (1992); <em>Tasker, </em>129 N.H. at 468, 471-72. However, we construe statutory language \u201caccording to its plain and ordinary meaning,\u201d <em>Appeal of Union Tel. Co., </em>160 N.H. at 317, and our previous discussions of the policy justifications for the judicial adoption of the Fireman\u2019s Rule cannot now be used to contradict the text of RSA 507:8-h. Under the plain language of the statute, the only relevant inquiry in determining whether a cause of action is barred is whether the negligently-created risk that caused the firefighter\u2019s injury was the reason for his presence on the scene. RSA 507:8-h.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Here, the parties do not dispute that the reason firefighters were called to the scene was a fire involving the home\u2019s hot water heater. Nor do they dispute that Mr. Antosz\u2019s injury occurred as a result of a slip and fall on the driveway, the condition of which was unrelated to the fire. Accordingly, because the injury giving rise to Mr. Antosz\u2019s claim did not arise from \u201cnegligent conduct which created the particular occasion for [his] official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>engagement,\u201d RSA 507:8-h, the defendant may not avail herself of the limited immunity conferred by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Nonetheless, the defendant contends that her position is supported by the language of RSA 507:8-h. She points to the provision that states that the statutory bar does not affect \u201ccauses of action for unrelated negligent conduct occurring <em>during </em>the [firefighter\u2019s] official engagement,\u201d <em>id. </em>(emphasis added), and argues that it necessarily follows that the statute bars claims for negligent conduct occurring <em>prior </em>to the firefighter\u2019s official engagement. According to the defendant, Mr. Antosz\u2019s claim is barred because the allegedly negligent conduct that led to the condition of the driveway occurred prior to his arrival on the scene. This argument, however, ignores what follows immediately in the subject sentence of the statute. In full, the sentence states: \u201cHowever, this section does not affect such [firefighter\u2019s] causes of action for unrelated negligent conduct occurring during the [firefighter\u2019s] official engagement, <em>or for other negligent conduct </em>\u2014\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The term \u201cother negligent conduct\u201d has no qualification. Thus, we hold that the plain language of the statute permits a firefighter to pursue causes of action for injuries arising from allegedly negligent conduct that did not create the occasion for his visit, regardless of whether that conduct occurs during or prior to the firefighter\u2019s official engagement on the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Mr. Antosz also briefly argues that the statute does not apply to volunteer firefighters at all, but rather applies only to paid firefighters. When confronted with this issue, courts in other jurisdictions have come to opposite conclusions. <em>Compare Buchanan v. Prickett &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>279 N.W.2d 855, 858-60 (Neb. 1979) (applying the Fireman\u2019s Rule to a volunteer firefighter and noting that volunteer firefighters \u201calthough uncompensated, undertake the same duties as paid [firefighters]\u201d), <em>with Roberts v. Vaughn, </em>587 N.W.2d 249, 251-53 (Mich. 1998) (declining to apply the Fireman\u2019s Rule to a volunteer firefighter and permitting the volunteer firefighter to pursue the cause of action). Because we conclude that the plain language of RSA 507:8-h does not bar Mr. Antosz\u2019s negligence claim, we need not decide whether the statute applies only to claims by paid firefighters. <em>See Dionne v. City of Manchester, </em>134 N.H. 225, 230 (1991) (declining to address parties\u2019 other arguments where holding on one issue was dispositive).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">We hold, therefore, that based upon the plain language of RSA 507:8-h, the trial court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b322-9\">Dalianis, C.J., and Hicks and LYNN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
