We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The relevant facts and procedural history of this case are undisputed. At trial, the State elicited testimony from the defendant\u2019s young stepdaughter that the defendant had subjected her to various types of sexual abuse. Her statements being the only evidence introduced by the State, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictments before putting on a defense, arguing that the mode of questioning was so suggestive that the State had failed \u201cto provide a rational jury with proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that he committed the elements of the charged crimes. The trial court agreed that the direct examination of the child contained leading questions but denied the motion, reasoning that the child\u2019s testimony was sufficient to submit the matter to the jury. After calling a single witness to the stand, the defense rested. The jury convicted, and the defendant appealed without making any post-trial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the weight of the evidence. The State responds that the defendant\u2019s argument has not been preserved for our review. A challenge to the weight of the evidence, according to the State, must be made in a motion to set aside the verdict <em>after </em>the verdict has been rendered \u2014 not in a motion to dismiss at the close of the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Our review of the record persuades us that the defendant has not preserved his challenge to the weight of the evidence. To prevail on a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the defendant must prove that no rational trier of fact, viewing all of the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Evans, </em>150 N.H. 416, 424 (2003). Because it is based on a hypothetical rational juror, a sufficiency challenge may be raised at the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief (as happened in the instant case), at the close of all the evidence, or after a jury conviction in a motion for a directed verdict. <em>See, e.g., State v. Moscone, </em>161 N.H. 355, 363 (2011) (motion for directed verdict); <em>State v. Ward, </em>134 N.H. 626, 628 (1991) (close of State\u2019s case-in-chief); <em>In re Three Video Poker Machines, </em>129 N.H. 416, 421 (1987) (close of all the evidence). When a sufficiency challenge is made at the close of the State\u2019s case, obviously only the evidence presented to that point in the trial can be examined in deciding the motion. However, if the trial court denies the motion and the defendant then offers evidence, \u201c[w]e review the entire trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>record because, even though the defendant is not required to present a case, if he chooses to do so, he takes the chance that evidence presented in his case may assist in proving the State\u2019s case.\u201d <em>State v. Littlefield, </em>152 N.H. 331, 349-50 (2005). In any of these circumstances, if the record contains insufficient evidence to permit a rational juror to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the remedy is acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">A successful challenge to the <em>weight </em>of the evidence, in contrast, does not result in acquittal. As we explained at length in <em>State v. Spinale, </em>156 N.H. 456, 465 (2007), in considering a motion to set aside the verdict based on the weight of the evidence, the trial court \u201csits as a \u2018thirteenth juror\u2019 and disagrees with the jury\u2019s resolution of the conflicting testimony.\u201d \u201cThe trial court\u2019s difference of opinion no more signifies acquittal than does a disagreement among the jurors themselves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). \u201cThus, a motion addressed to the weight of the evidence primarily presents a question of fact for the trial court, and the trial court has much more discretion when considering such a motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Unlike the remedy of acquittal for a suffieiency-of-the-evidence challenge, the remedy for a successful weight-of-the-evidence challenge is a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">As the foregoing discussion makes clear, the nature of a challenge to the weight of the evidence requires that it be raised as a motion to set aside a verdict <em>actually rendered. See id. </em>at 467 (\u201cA reversal based on the weight of the evidence . . . can occur only after the State both has presented sufficient evidence to support conviction and <em>has persuaded the jury to </em>convict.\u201d (emphasis added; citation omitted)); 3 C. WRIGHT, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal 4th \u00a7 582, at 442-43 (2011) (the trial court should invoke its power to grant a new trial \u201conly in exceptional cases, where the evidence weighs heavily against the verdict\u201d and where \u201ca miscarriage of justice may have resulted\u201d); <em>see also </em>6 W. LaFave ET AL., Criminal Procedure \u00a7 24.6(d), at 448 (3d ed. 2007); Super. Ct. R. 105 (\u201cA motion to set aside a verdict of guilty shall be filed within seven days after its rendition.\u201d). Because the defendant in this case <em>moved to dismiss </em>based on insufficient evidence at the close of the State\u2019s case and made no post-verdict motion to set aside the verdict based on the weight of the evidence, the issue has not been preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b416-8\">Dalianis, C.J., and HICKS, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
