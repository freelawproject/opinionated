We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">The pertinent facts are drawn from the record. In March 2010, Dean Eaton (Dean), the petitioner\u2019s brother, filed a petition for guardianship over their mother, Mary Louise Eaton. The petitioner objected to Dean\u2019s petition and filed his own petition. In June 2010, in a written settlement agreement, the petitioner and Dean agreed that their brother, Michael Eaton, the respondent, would be appointed guardian. Shortly thereafter, the trial court found Mrs. Eaton incapacitated and appointed the respondent guardian over her person and estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">Thereafter, the petitioner asked the court, pursuant to RSA 464-A:43, to order the respondent, as guardian of Mrs. Eaton\u2019s estate, to pay the attorney\u2019s fees he incurred during the proceedings. The respondent objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">The trial court denied the petitioner\u2019s motion, reasoning that under RSA 464-A:43, I, the statute providing for payment of guardianship costs, \u201cthe phrase \u2018fees for the counsel\u2019 refers to the counsel for the proposed ward,\u201d and not to the counsel for the petitioner. The court further found that no other justification existed to require payment of the petitioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees from the ward\u2019s estate. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">\u201cAn award of attorney\u2019s fees must be grounded upon statutory authorization, an agreement between the parties, or an established exception to the rule that each party is responsible for paying his or her own counsel fees.\u201d <em>Merrimack School Dist. v. Nat\u2019l School Bus Serv., </em>140 N.H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>9, 14 (1995) (quotation and ellipsis omitted). Here, the petitioner asserts entitlement to an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to RSA 464-A:43.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">We review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretation <em>de novo. State v. Bernard, </em>158 N.H. 43, 44 (2008). In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>When examining the language of a statute, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning to the words used. <em>Id. </em>We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>Id. </em>Further, we interpret a statute in the context of the overall scheme and not in isolation. <em>Id. </em>We do not consider legislative history to construe a statute that is clear on its face. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">RSA 464-A:43 provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">The costs incurred by the imposition of a guardianship or conservatorship pursuant to the procedures established in this chapter shall be distributed in the following manner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">I. Except in cases in which the petitioner filed the petition in bad faith, the court costs and <em>fees for the counsel </em>and resource person shall be borne by the proposed ward. In cases in which the petitioner acted in bad faith, he or she shall bear all costs of the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">II. If the proposed ward is indigent, the costs and fees of the proceeding shall be borne by the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">III. The costs incurred in the petition for a conservatorship shall be paid by the estate of the conservatee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">RSA 464-A:43 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">The petitioner argues that RSA464-A:43,1, mandates the payment of his fees from the ward\u2019s estate in the absence of bad faith on his part. The petitioner grounds his argument in: (1) a plain reading of the statute; (2) the legislative history of the statute; and (3) public policy. We address his arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">First, the petitioner argues that entitlement to his attorney\u2019s fees necessarily flows from the plain meaning of the phrase, \u201cfees for the counsel.\u201d The petitioner notes that the statute does not define or qualify the word \u201ccosts\u201d in the opening sentence, or the word \u201ccounsel\u201d in paragraph I, or otherwise specify that a petitioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees are not included. Further, the petitioner argues that because proposed wards do not incur court costs in guardianship proceedings, the phrase \u201ccourt costs,\u201d used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>paragraph I, cannot refer to a ward\u2019s court costs. He contends, therefore, that the phrase \u201ccourt costs and fees for the counsel\u201d necessarily refers to a petitioner\u2019s court costs and attorney\u2019s fees. The petitioner acknowledges that in other sections of the guardianship chapter, there are numerous references to the proposed ward\u2019s counsel. <em>See, e.g., </em>RSA 464-A:4-:6 (2004), :8 (2004), :11 (2004), :12 (Supp. 2011), :13 (2004), :25 (Supp. 2011), :43. He argues, however, that those specific references to the proposed ward\u2019s counsel support his position that the unqualified word \u201ccounsel,\u201d in subsection 43,1, dqes not exclude the petitioner\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In contrast, the respondent contends that the phrase \u201cfees for the counsel\u201d does not include a petitioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. He argues that the purpose of the chapter is to protect the rights of proposed wards. He notes that the chapter requires the court to appoint counsel for a proposed ward who does not have counsel, <em>see </em>RSA 464-A:6,1, but has no similar provision relating to a petitioner. He points out that the chapter refers to a proposed ward\u2019s counsel numerous times but never to a petitioner\u2019s counsel. Finally, he argues that a \u201cresource person\u201d acts on behalf of the proposed ward, not a petitioner. Therefore, he argues, the phrase \u201cfees for the counsel and resource person\u201d can only mean a proposed ward\u2019s counsel and the resource person.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s reasoning and hold that the statute\u2019s stated purpose and the statutory scheme indicate that the legislature intended the phrase \u201cfees for the counsel\u201d to refer to a proposed ward\u2019s counsel, not a petitioner\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The stated purpose of RSA chapter 464-A is to \u201cpromote and protect the well-being of the proposed ward.\u201d RSA 464-A:l (2004). In particular, the \u201cchapter is designed to provide procedural and substantive safeguards for civil liberties and property rights of a proposed ward.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These safeguards are needed considering the potentially adversarial nature of guardianship proceedings, <em>see, e.g., In re DeLucca, </em>121 N.H. 71, 72 (1981), and the significance of the liberties and rights at stake, <em>see, e.g., In re Gamble, </em>118 N.H. 771, 775 (1978) (\u201cA person who is legally declared incompetent is substantially deprived of liberty. An incompetent person is reduced to the status of a child . . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Prominent among the statutory safeguards are the proposed ward\u2019s right to counsel and the potential appointment of a guardian ad litem. RSA 464-A:6, I, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">The right to legal counsel for any person for whom a temporary guardian or guardianship of the person and estate, or person, or estate, is sought shall be absolute and unconditional. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>proposed ward does not have his or her own counsel, the court shall appoint counsel for the proposed ward immediately upon the filing of a petition for guardianship ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u201cThe guarantee of counsel now makes the proposed ward an active party in the very proceedings determining his <em>need </em>for a guardian, and <em>who </em>should be his guardian.\u201d <em>In re Snow Estate, </em>120 N.H. 590, 592 (1980) (quotation omitted). The role of counsel in guardianship proceedings is to, \u201cas far as reasonably possible, carry out the client\u2019s decisions,\u201d \u201c[e]ven when representing a client with a disability.\u201d <em>In re Guardianship of Henderson, </em>150 N.H. 349, 350 (2003). The statute further protects a proposed ward by permitting courts \u201cto appoint a guardian ad litem when it appears that the rights of the allegedly incapacitated person are not fully represented.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>RSA 464-A:41, I (Supp. 2011). The guardian ad litem is charged with reaching \u201can independent conclusion on what is in the best interest of the proposed ward.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>150 N.H. at 350 (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Representation by counsel and the potential for the appointment of a guardian ad litem assure protection of the proposed ward\u2019s desires and best interests and obviate the need for a petitioner to employ counsel on behalf of the proposed ward. Further, RSA 464-A:6, II protects proposed wards by mandating that a proposed ward\u2019s appointed counsel be compensated at a rate determined by this court. <em>See </em>RSA 464-A:6. That provision makes no reference to counsel fees incurred by a petitioner. <em>See id. </em>If a petitioner chooses to employ counsel, that counsel represents the <em>petitioner\u2019s </em>interests, which may be adverse to the proposed ward or another petitioner. To read the statute as requiring a proposed ward to pay a petitioner\u2019s discretionary attorney\u2019s fees, even if the petitioner\u2019s interests are adverse to the proposed ward\u2019s interests, would thus run counter to these legislative safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">While a petitioner is free to choose to employ counsel, nothing in the statute requires a petitioner to retain counsel to petition for guardianship. Moreover, guardianship procedures contemplate that petitions may be filed without the assistance of counsel. RSA 464-A:4 outlines the procedure by which \u201c[a]ny relative, public official, or interested person, or any individual in his or her own behalf\u2019 may file a petition for appointment of a guardian. RSA 464-A:4. Although the petitioner bears the burden of establishing the incapacity of the proposed ward, <em>see </em>RSA 464-A:8, IV, \u201c[t]he statute is not designed to erect procedural hurdles which only the most persevering and painstaking proposed guardians can overcome.\u201d <em>DeLucca, </em>121 N.H. at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>The petitioner asserts that to read the statute as limiting \u201cfees for the counsel\u201d to the proposed ward\u2019s counsel renders the last sentence in RSA 464-A:43, I, meaningless. That sentence provides, \u201cIn cases in which the petitioner acted in bad faith, he or she shall bear all costs of the proceeding.\u201d RSA 464-A:43,1. The petitioner argues that the statute should be read to preclude an award of attorney\u2019s fees to a petitioner only when the petitioner has acted in bad faith. He asserts that to construe the statute otherwise denies a petitioner his attorney\u2019s fees even when the petitioner acts in good faith. Our holding today, that the statute does not contemplate a ward\u2019s responsibility for payment of a petitioner\u2019s counsel fees, regardless of the petitioner\u2019s good or bad faith, is dispositive. We note, however, that the respondent\u2019s reading of the statute \u2014 that absent bad faith by a petitioner, the proposed ward is liable for her own attorney\u2019s fees, but when the petitioner acts in bad faith, the petitioner is liable for the proposed ward\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 gives meaning to the last sentence of RSA 464-A-.43,1, and is not inconsistent with our holding. Nonetheless, because there has been no assertion here that the petitioner filed the petition in bad faith, we need not decide whether bad faith by a petitioner would result in liability for the proposed ward\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, as part of \u201call costs of the proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Neither are we persuaded by the petitioner\u2019s two additional statutory arguments. The petitioner argues that RSA 464-A:26,1 (Supp. 2011), which provides that \u201c[t]he guardian of the estate shall apply the money and property for the support, care, and education of the ward,\u201d requires that a ward\u2019s estate pay a petitioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees because the fees are a necessary cost associated with a benefit to the proposed ward. The petitioner points out that he hired legal counsel \u201cafter repeated pleas from the (then) proposed ward that he seek to maintain her existing arrangements,\u201d and that the efforts of the legal counsel he hired \u201cwere solely for the benefit of [the ward].\u201d We decline to infer, however, that \u201cthe support, care, and education of the ward\u201d encompasses legal fees incurred by an unsuccessful petitioner for guardianship, particularly where the legislature has explicitly provided for appointment of counsel for the proposed ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In his final statutory argument, the petitioner asserts that because guardianships and conservatorships are similar, and because, pursuant to RSA 464-A:43, III, a conservatee\u2019s estate bears the costs incurred by the imposition of a conservatorship, RSA 464-A:43, I, must mean that a proposed ward is liable for a guardianship petitioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. We are not persuaded by the petitioner\u2019s analogy. Although there are some similarities between guardianships and conservatorships, the differences between the proceedings are too significant to sustain the petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>argument. A conservatorship proceeding is voluntarily initiated by the conservatee, <em>see </em>RSA464-A:13, and does not involve adversarial process or counsel other than counsel appointed for the conservatee. <em>See </em>RSA 464-A:13-:14 (2004). In contrast, a guardianship proceeding is a potentially adversarial proceeding in which the petitioner\u2019s counsel may argue, despite the proposed ward\u2019s objection, that a proposed ward\u2019s incapacity justifies the deprivation of significant rights and liberties. <em>See, e.g., DeLucca, </em>121 N.H. at 72; <em>Gamble, </em>118 N.H. at 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The petitioner also argues that the legislative history of RSA 464-A:43 supports his contention that the legislature intended proposed wards to be liable for petitioners\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees. \u201cWhen a statute is ambiguous we consider legislative history to aid our analysis.\u201d <em>AIMCO Props. v. Dziewisz, </em>152 N.H. 587, 590 (2005). The phrase \u201cfees for the counsel,\u201d standing alone, is ambiguous; however, the legislative history of the statute provides no guidance as to the intended meaning of the phrase. Nevertheless, as explained above, the stated purpose of the statute and the entire statutory scheme support our holding that the legislature intended the phrase \u201cfees for the counsel\u201d to refer to a proposed ward\u2019s counsel, not a petitioner\u2019s counsel. <em>See Bernard, </em>158 N.H. at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">As to the petitioner\u2019s public policy argument, he is joined by the New Hampshire Chapter of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys, acting as <em>amicus curiae. </em>They argue that the court\u2019s interpretation creates financial disincentives for petitioners to file guardianship petitions because they will be liable for their own attorney\u2019s fees. While we are not unsympathetic to this concern, \u201c[w]e reserve such matters of public policy for the legislature.\u201d <em>Eng Khabbaz v. Comm\u2019r., Social Sec. Admin., </em>155 N.H. 798, 805 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b413-8\">DALIANIS, C.J., and HlCKS and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
