On appeal, he contends that the Trial Court <em>(\"Wageling, </em>J.) erred in denying his motion for a mistrial or, in the alternative, for further curative instructions to the jury. He also argues that the trial court sentenced him based upon improper considerations. We affirm the conviction, but vacate the sentence and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">The jury could have found the following facts. The defendant was awarded custody of his daughter, J.H., when she was three years old. As J.H. grew older, she and the defendant developed a close bond. Their relationship deteriorated, however, after the defendant married his wife, Lori.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">In 1999, the defendant, Lori, the couple\u2019s two daughters, and J.H. moved to Lempster, where the defendant began molesting J.H., who at the time was fifteen years old. The sexual assaults occurred two to three times a week between July 1999 and July 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-13\">J.H. testified that she told Lori about the assaults on numerous occasions, but Lori did not believe her. She also testified that she confided in friends at school, but she believed they were too young to help her. Believing \u201c[n]obody was listening to [her],\u201d J.H. attempted suicide by taking prescription pills. Following this incident, she was sent to live with her paternal grandfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-14\">While living with her grandfather, J.H. was interviewed by a state trooper and a social worker from the New Hampshire Division for Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) about her allegations concerning the defendant. During the interview, she recanted her accusations of sexual assault. At trial, she testified that she did so because she was \u201cfed up\u201d with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u201ceverybody\u201d accusing her of lying, and because her grandfather was present in the room. J.H. testified that, after this meeting, her grandfather began sexually assaulting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Sometime later, J.H.\u2019s grandfather gave J.H. her mother\u2019s telephone number. J.H. contacted her mother, Irene, whom she had not seen since she was six years old. When J.H. and Irene subsequently met, J.H. \u201ctold her everything.\u201d Eventually, J.H. left her grandfather\u2019s house and moved in with Irene.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Irene helped J.H. obtain a restraining order against the defendant and her grandfather. J.H. was then interviewed by an officer from the Warner Police Department about her accusations against her father and grandfather. Later, however, the restraining order was vacated because J.H. again recanted her allegations of assault. Soon after moving in with her mother, J.H. and Irene began arguing, and Irene accused J.H. of lying about the assaults. J.H. testified that because her mother kept insisting she was lying, she \u201cagreed with her.\u201d Subsequently, J.H. moved out.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Several years later, J.H. agreed to visit the defendant at her cousin\u2019s home. Following this meeting, J.H. and her family regularly visited the defendant, Lori, and their daughters. Eventually, J.H.\u2019s and Lori\u2019s association evolved into \u201calmost... a mother/daughter relationship,\u201d such that J.H. provided Lori \u201cmoral support\u201d as she separated from and ultimately divorced the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">In 2008, J.H. met with State Trooper Eric Berube. Berube questioned J.H. about her earlier allegations against the defendant, and asked her to participate in one-party telephone interceptions of conversations with the defendant, to which she agreed. During the recorded telephone conversations, the defendant made \u201csome statements,\u201d but did not fully address the assaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Based on the results of his investigation, Berube arrested the defendant and took him to the Claremont police station, where Berube and another trooper interviewed him. Berube advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, <em>see Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), which the defendant acknowledged and waived. At the defendant\u2019s request, the interview was not recorded. During the interview, the defendant initially denied the allegations, but later, after the troopers informed him that they had the recorded telephone conversations between him and J.H. and offered to play them, the defendant admitted to sexually assaulting her. At trial, however, the defendant maintained his innocence, explaining he stopped \u201cdenying\u201d the accusations to the police because he was \u201c[frustrated\u201d and \u201cjust didn\u2019t want to be confronted... [and he] didn\u2019t want to fight about it.\u201d Ultimately, the defendant was convicted and sentenced to eight to twenty years in the New Hampshire State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>\n<em>1. Trooper Berube\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The defendant argues that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial or, in the alternative, to provide further curative instructions to the jury after the State elicited allegedly \u201chighly prejudicial and emotionally charged\u201d testimony from Berube. Specifically, the defendant argues that \u201c[v]iewed collectively, the disputed testimony and the court\u2019s instruction unambiguously conveyed to the jury that [he] had engaged in [other] conduct closely related to the conduct at issue in the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">During the State\u2019s direct examination of Berube, counsel inquired about his initial contact with J.H., and the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">[State]: All right. The \u2014 I want to direct your attention to the spring, specifically to March of 2008, and ask if you had occasion to become aware of and to have contact with a [J.H.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">[Trooper]: Yeah, I was investigating an unrelated matter for her sisters and then I became aware of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">Defense counsel objected and immediately moved for a mistrial. After a bench conference, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion and issued the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-10\">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I\u2019m striking the last answer that was just provided by Trooper Berube and I\u2019m instructing you to not consider his answer. The only matter that is before you today, and the only matter in existence in this case involves the allegations of [J.H.] against this defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">Later, defense counsel renewed his motion for a mistrial, or in the alternative, for \u201cstronger\u201d curative instructions that would make clear to the \u201cjury that there [were] no other investigations, that no other daughters made any allegations against [the defendant], [and] that there [were] no other charges out there against [the defendant] involving other daughters.\u201d Defense counsel maintained that without such instructions, the jury was \u201cleft with the impression that there may be other investigations out there.\u201d Again, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, finding that \u201c[t]here\u2019s no inference in this case, nor has there been any suggested by Trooper Berube or anybody else, that there\u2019s any other allegation against [the defendant] other than the matter before this jury.\u201d The court also declined to provide further curative instructions to the jury, noting that its \u201ccurative instruction did exactly what defense counsel [had] suggested need[ed] to be done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">Subsequently, during cross-examination of Trooper Berube, defense counsel asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>[Defense]: I just want to clear one thing up first. You testified yesterday, when asked about how you first became aware of [J.H.], that you had been involved in an unrelated investigation concerning her sisters?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\">[Trooper]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">[Defense]: That investigation did not result in any allegations of misconduct against [the defendant], correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">[Trooper]: No, there were no allegations of any criminal conduct against [the defendant] in that investigation at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s rulings were erroneous because: (1) \u201ccontrary to the court\u2019s recollection, it had not given the jury the instruction the defense requested\u201d; (2) \u201cthe evidence, together with the limited instruction . . . conveyed that [the defendant] had committed acts similar to the conduct at issue against his other daughters\u201d; and (3) although Trooper Berube\u2019s testimony on cross-examination lessened the prejudice, it was insufficient to cure the harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Mistrial is the proper remedy only if the evidence or comment complained of is not merely improper, but is so prejudicial that it constitutes an irreparable injustice that cannot be cured by jury instructions. <em>State v. Ellsworth, </em>151 N.H. 152, 154 (2004). Because the trial court is in the best position to gauge the prejudicial nature of the conduct at issue, it has broad discretion to decide whether a mistrial is warranted. <em>State v. Kerwin, </em>144 N.H. 357, 359 (1999). \u201cIt is well-settled that an incurable prejudice may result \u2018when the testimony of a witness conveys to a jury the fact of a defendant\u2019s prior criminal offense. The infusion of such evidence into a trial is probably only equaled by a confession in its prejudicial impact upon a jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360 (quoting <em>State v. Woodbury, </em>124 N.H. 218, 221 (1983) (citations and quotation omitted)). Thus, \u201c[t]he proper inquiry in this case, for determining whether the defendant was so substantially prejudiced that the remedy of mistrial was required, is whether the fact that the alleged prior acts were criminal in nature was unambiguously revealed to the jury.\u201d <em>State v. Carbo, </em>151 N.H. 550, 554 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Here, Berube\u2019s testimony did not unambiguously reveal evidence of prior criminal acts by the defendant. Rather, Berube testified that he had been \u201cinvestigating an <em>unrelated matter\u201d </em>involving J.H.\u2019s half sisters. (Emphasis added.) Berube\u2019s reference to another investigation was not specific and did not clearly convey criminal conduct by the defendant. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number><em>State v. Rogers, </em>138 N.H. 503, 505 (1994) (mistrial not required if challenged evidence is ambiguous as to inculpation). <em>Compare Kerwin, </em>144 N.H. at 361 (holding that statement that \u201cthat man raped some girl\u201d was highly prejudicial and warranted mistrial), <em>and State v. Ayotte, </em>146 N.H. 544, 548 (2001) (holding that testimony about prior fire was similar to charged offense and warranted mistrial), <em>with State v. Ellison, </em>135 N.H. 1, 5-6 (1991) (holding that a mistrial was not required in assault case where inadmissible testimony that the defendant previously fractured victim\u2019s nose could be viewed as an accident and thus was ambiguous as to criminal nature of conduct). Moreover, any inference that the unrelated investigation concerned criminal conduct by the defendant was dispelled by the trooper\u2019s testimony that \u201cthere were no allegations of any criminal conduct against [the defendant] in that investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\"> In addition, the trial court gave a curative instruction immediately following its ruling on the motion for a mistrial, directing the jury to disregard Berube\u2019s answer and focus on the \u201conly matter in existence .. . the allegations of [J.H.] against this defendant.\u201d The jury is presumed to follow the trial court\u2019s curative instruction. <em>State v. Gibson, </em>153 N.H. 454, 460 (2006). We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred because it did not give \u201cthe instruction the defense requested.\u201d Because the trial court is in the best position to gauge prejudicial impact, it has broad discretion to fashion the appropriate remedial action. <em>See Murray v. Developmental Servs. of Sullivan County, </em>149 N.H. 264, 268 (2003); <em>see also State v. Boetti, </em>142 N.H. 255, 259 (1997) (noting the trial court is granted \u201cconsiderable deference\u201d in instructing the jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\n<em>II. The Sentencing Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The defendant next contends that the trial court considered improper evidence in determining his sentence. At the sentencing hearing, the prosecution focused upon the defendant\u2019s \u201cgross lack of remorsefulness, a lot of denial, [and lack of]... empathy for [J.H.]\u201d as well as \u201chis efforts to avoid and evade responsibility and accountability for what he did to [J.H.].\u201d The prosecution observed that \u201cthroughout the course of this case, throughout the investigation part, and throughout the trial part, on a number of occasions, [the defendant] has come close, tried to come close maybe, to doing the right thing only always in the end to slip once again down that slope of denial.\u201d \u201cAt trial,\u201d the prosecution noted, \u201cthe defendant was solemnly in denial mode.\u201d Because of the \u201cnature of the offense and [his] chronic and persistent shifting of blame, . . . denial, [and] lack of getting it that this happened, [he] did it, [he] own[s] it,\u201d the prosecution proposed sentencing the defendant to no less than eight and no more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>twenty years in prison. The defendant objected to the factors upon which the prosecution relied, asserting that they violated his constitutional right to proceed to trial and to remain silent at sentencing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">[To] the extent that the State\u2019s recommendation in terms of sentencing is based on [the defendant] having a trial and/or remaining silent here today at the sentencing hearing, which is his intent... to the extent that the recommendation is driven by that, that. . . result would be prohibited by <em>State vs. Burgess </em>and the Supreme Court opinion in that case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Ultimately, the trial court adopted the State\u2019s recommended sentence, and before rendering sentence, made the following remarks, which the defendant challenges on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">And one of the things that I thought about as I read through all those notes is the fact that this defendant, like all defendants, absolutely is entitled to a trial and all the protections of the constitution. But there\u2019s a difference between making the State prove their case, prove whether or not the person is guilty or not guilty, and the type of defense that\u2019s lodged against those sorts of attacks by the State. And what this defendant did, in his choice, in terms of the defense he raised in this case and what he apparently continues to do in his interactions with his family is that he, by his behavior, by his choice, has chosen to destroy in any way he can this victim, not only by accusing her repeatedly of lying and coming up with a variety of reasons why she lied, accusing her in front of this jury of being promiscuous, and that is .. . that\u2019s the reason that there was a discussion of pregnancy in the one party, setting his family up to choose between him and [J.H.] by his actions. ... By his choices, he has set this victim up for destruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">The fact that the defendant in the face of the evidence against him has chosen to call [J.H.], in all intent, a whore, a liar, somebody who made such a terrible lie up simply because she was trying to help his ex-wife in a divorce, and those are the reasons that he provided to us for her lies, the fact that he would go to those extremes, the fact that he would set her family up against her in his effort to deny and his effort to not take responsibility, his total lack of remorse and empathy [for] the victim can be taken into consideration by this court because there is an impact on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>victim for Ms behavior. There is absoMtely no retribution coming back towards this victim. . . . She was the victim, and he is not taking responsibility. He is turning her family against her by his choices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The defendant argues that these comments demonstrate that the trial court penalized him for exercising his right to a trial and his privileges to testify on his own behalf and to remain silent at the sentencing hearing and, in so doing, violated his state and federal constitutional rights. <em>See </em>N.H. CONST, pt. I, arts. 15,18; U.S. CONST, amends. V, VI, XIV. Pointing to the trial court\u2019s references to the \u201ctype of defense\u201d he pursued at trial, he asserts that the court erred when it \u201ctook issue with [his] theory of defense, which had attacked the reliability and credibility of J.H.\u2019s allegations.\u201d The State and the dissent counter that these comments reflect that the trial court considered the defendant\u2019s false trial testimony and lack of remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\"> We first address the parties\u2019 arguments under the State Constitution and rely on federal law only to aid in our analysis. <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231, 233 (1983). The State Constitution requires the trial court to consider several objective factors before imposing any sentence, including whether the sentence imposed will meet the traditional goals of sentencing \u2014 punishment, deterrence and rehabilitation. <em>State v. Burgess, </em>156 N.H. 746, 751 (2008); <em>see </em>N.H. Const, pt. I, art. 18. \u201cAlthough a sentencing judge has broad discretion to choose the sources and types of evidence upon which to rely in imposing sentence, that discretion is not unlimited.\u201d <em>State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 295-96 (2001). \u201cIf improper evidence is admitted at sentencing, the sentence imposed must be reconsidered unless the trial court clearly gave that evidence no weight.\u201d <em>Burgess, </em>156 N.H. at 751-52 (quotation omitted). While we normally review a trial court\u2019s sentencing decision under our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard, where, as here, the defendant asserts that his constitutional rights have been violated as a result of the trial court\u2019s sentencing decision, we review that decision <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 752. In this case, because we cannot conclude on the record before us that the trial court \u201cclearly gave ... no weight\u201d to improper factors, we vacate the defendant\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 751-52 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">\n<em>A. \u201cType of Defense\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">We first consider the defendant\u2019s assertion that the court erred by considering the \u201ctype of defense\u201d he raised at trial. A defendant has a constitutional right to \u201cbe fully heard in his defense, by himself, and counsel.\u201d N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 15. This encompasses \u201cthe right to present a defense, the right to present the defendant\u2019s version of the facts as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>as the prosecution\u2019s to the jury so it may decide where the truth lies,\u201d as well as \u201cthe right to confront the prosecution\u2019s witnesses for the purpose of challenging their testimony,\u201d and the \u201cright to present [one\u2019s] own witnesses to establish a defense.\u201d <em>Washington v. Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19 (1967); <em>see State v. Guaraldi, </em>127 N.H. 303, 306-07 (1985). Here, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s comments imply that the court may have penalized the defendant for his <em>attorney\u2019s </em>trial strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">We have never before addressed the extent to which a court may penalize a defendant for his attorney\u2019s trial strategy and have found scant authority from other jurisdictions on this question. We find <em>State v. Gribble, </em>636 N.W.2d 488 (Wis. Ct. App. 2001), informative. The defendant in <em>Gribble </em>was convicted of first-degree homicide arising from the death of a twenty-month-old child resulting from severe head injuries caused by either \u201cshaken-baby syndrome\u201d or \u201cshaken-impact syndrome.\u201d <em>Gribble, </em>636 N.W.2d at 495. The defendant\u2019s defense at trial was that he did not inflict the fatal injuries on the child, but that the child\u2019s mother did so. <em>Id. </em>Toward this end, defense counsel attacked the mother\u2019s credibility and raised questions about her ability to care for her children. <em>Id. </em>The defense also elicited testimony to demonstrate that the mother had difficulty controlling her temper and had previously thrown and shaken her children. <em>Id. </em>The defendant testified at trial and, although he did not directly accuse the mother, his \u201ctestimony was the foundation of the defense strategy, because without it there was no evidence [the mother] had access to the child in the relevant time period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">When sentencing the defendant, the trial court explained that a \u201csignificant aggravating factor\u201d upon which it relied was that the defendant \u201chad pursued a defense of putting [the mother\u2019s] past life and troubles on trial and asserting that she killed her child. This, in the court\u2019s view, victimized [the mother] further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509. Specifically, the trial court stated that it was \u201csatisfied . . . that the line of defense offered by [the defendant] was false,\u201d although not \u201cperjurous per se.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). The court explained that it considered the defendant\u2019s defense as an aggravating factor because it \u201csubjected [the mother] and her family to essentially being further victimized and further aggravated] the nature of the offense which they suffered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court had improperly held him responsible for his counsel\u2019s trial strategy. <em>Id. </em>The appellate court disagreed, stating that it was satisfied based upon its review of the record that the trial court had properly considered the defendant\u2019s own testimony and \u201cconsidered the defense strategy only insofar as it was based on that testimony, which was within [the defendant\u2019s] control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>In the instant ease, some of the trial court\u2019s comments likewise suggest that the court merely considered the defendant\u2019s own testimony and actions. For instance, the trial court chided the defendant for choosing \u201cto destroy in any way he can this victim\u201d through \u201chis interactions with his family\u201d and \u201cby accusing her repeatedly of lying and coming up with a variety of reasons why she lied, accusing her in front of this jury of being promiscuous.\u201d The trial court focused, as well, upon the defendant\u2019s choice \u201cto sexually abuse [J.H.] in the very, very tender years of her adolescence\u201d and for allowing her \u201cto crash and burn as a teenager.\u201d The court also stated that the defendant chose \u201cto call [J.H.], in all intent, a whore, a liar, somebody who made such a terrible lie up simply because she was trying to help his ex-wife in a divorce, and those are the reasons that he provided to us for her lies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">However, other comments by the trial court suggest that the court was focusing upon the defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s trial tactics. For instance, the trial court stated: \u201cBut there\u2019s a difference between making the State prove [its] case, prove whether or not the person is guilty or not guilty, and the type of defense that\u2019s lodged against those sorts of attacks by the State.\u201d The trial court further referred to \u201cwhat this defendant did, in his choice, in terms of the defense he raised in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Based upon our review of the record, we are not satisfied that the trial court considered the defense strategy only insofar as it was based upon the defendant\u2019s own testimony. <em>See id,.; see also State v. Davenport, </em>941 So. 2d 629, 633 (La. Ct. App. 2006) (trial court erred in concluding that defense counsel\u2019s strategy of attempting to introduce evidence of victim\u2019s condition immediately before accident \u201cequated to a lack of remorse on the part of the defendant\u201d). Accordingly, to the extent that the trial court considered defense counsel\u2019s trial tactics in its sentencing determination, the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\n<em>B. False Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">We next address the assertion by the State and the dissent that the trial court\u2019s comments merely reflect the court\u2019s determination that the defendant testified falsely. We disagree that this is a supportable construction of the trial court\u2019s comments at the sentencing hearing. In its comments, the trial court never stated that it believed the defendant testified falsely. Although the trial court stated that it found \u201cthe testimony of [J.H.] to be quite credible,\u201d and implied that it found the defendant\u2019s testimony not to be credible, it did not state that it found the defendant\u2019s testimony to be false. In other words, it did not affirmatively find that the defendant <em>lied </em>on the stand. In this way, the trial court\u2019s comments in the instant case differ from the trial court\u2019s comments in <em>Gribble. </em>In <em>Gribble, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>the trial court specifically stated that it believed that the defendant\u2019s \u201cline of defense . . . was false.\u201d <em>Gribble, </em>636 N.W.2d at 509 (quotation omitted). Thus, we cannot conclude that the trial court based its sentencing decision upon a finding that the defendant testified falsely. <em>See United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87 (1993), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Wells, </em>519 U.S. 482 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\n<em>C. Lack of Remorse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Finally, we address the assertion by the State and the dissent that the trial court\u2019s comments at sentencing also reflect its determination that the defendant lacked remorse. Although we agree that the trial court\u2019s comments demonstrate that it considered the defendant\u2019s lack of remorse, we are concerned that the trial court may have done so unlawfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">We most completely addressed the circumstances under which a sentencing court may consider a defendant\u2019s lack of remorse in <em>Burgess, </em>156 N.H. 746. The question before us in <em>Burgess </em>was whether a trial court could presume from a defendant\u2019s silence at sentencing that he lacked remorse. <em>Burgess, </em>156 N.H. at 754. We began by acknowledging that it is unconstitutional for a trial court to consider a defendant\u2019s failure to admit guilt as a factor in sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 754-55. We then aligned ourselves with those courts that reject a distinction between failing to express remorse and refusing to admit guilt. <em>Id. </em>at 755-57 (citing cases); <em>see Com. v. Jones, </em>884 N.E.2d 532, 536-37 (Mass. App. Ct. 2008) (discussing split in jurisdictions). We explained that for a defendant to express remorse truthfully, he must to some degree acknowledge wrongdoing and guilt. <em>Burgess, </em>156 N.H. at 757. \u201cIn either case, the defendant must admit wrongdoing and jeopardize his post-trial remedies, testify falsely and risk a perjury conviction, or remain silent and risk obtaining a greater sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that just as it is unconstitutional to increase a defendant\u2019s punishment because he refuses to admit guilt, so too is it unconstitutional for a court to draw an adverse inference of lack of remorse from a defendant\u2019s silence at sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 754-55, 757-58. \u201c[B]ecause the only affirmative way for a defendant who maintains his innocence throughout the criminal process to express remorse at sentencing is to forego his right to remain silent,\u201d using a defendant\u2019s silence at sentencing to infer that he lacks remorse generally violates a defendant\u2019s constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 757-58, 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">In <em>Burgess, </em>we concluded that whether a sentencing court\u2019s inference of a lack of remorse from a defendant\u2019s silence at sentencing violates the privilege against self-incrimination depends upon the factual circumstances of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 760. When a defendant admits to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>committing the acts underlying the charged crime, but disputes that he had the requisite mental state or asserts a legal justification for committing those acts, his silence at sentencing \u201cmight, in certain instances, legitimately be considered as a lack of remorse.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">For instance, in <em>Burgess, </em>the defendant was convicted of attempted escape and possessing an implement for escape. <em>Id. </em>at 747. At trial, he admitted that he used a paper clip that he found on the floor of the holding cell to cut his shoelace, which he then used to keep the brace on his leg open. <em>Id. </em>at 748. The sheriffs department had placed a leg brace on the defendant while he was in the holding cell in the basement of the courthouse to prevent him from running. <em>Id. </em>at 747-48. The defendant testified that he disabled the lock on the brace only because the brace pinched him; he denied that he intended to escape. <em>Id. </em>at 748-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In light of his trial testimony, we held that the trial court permissibly considered the defendant\u2019s silence at sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 761. Given that he confessed to committing the acts underlying the crimes of which he was convicted, \u201chis right to remain silent was not implicated because he would not have risked incriminating himself or jeopardizing his post-trial rights by expressing remorse for his acts\u201d at sentencing. <em>Id. </em>The defendant\u2019s \u201casserted lack of intent to escape would not have conflicted with any feelings of remorse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we held that because the defendant could have expressed remorse at sentencing without waiving his right to remain silent, the trial court did not err when it denied him leniency based upon his silence at sentencing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">By contrast, when a defendant maintains his innocence throughout the criminal process and denies committing the predicate acts comprising the charged crime, his silence at sentencing may not be considered as a lack of remorse. <em>See id. </em>at 760. In such a case, a defendant \u201crisks incriminating himself if he expresses remorse at sentencing,\u201d and, thus, a sentencing court \u201cmay not draw a negative inference of lack of remorse\u201d from his silence at sentencing. <em>Id. </em>We applied <em>Burgess </em>in <em>State v. </em>Lamy, 158 N.H. 511 (2009), where we held that the trial court did not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights by concluding that he lacked remorse because he admitted committing the acts underlying the charged crimes, but maintained that the incident was an accident. <em>Lamy, </em>158 N.H. at 524-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Having recognized in <em>Burgess, </em>156 N.H. at 757, that there is no distinction between the failure to admit guilt and the failure to express remorse, we now hold that a defendant\u2019s failure to express remorse at trial may not be considered in sentencing. When, as in this case, a defendant has maintained his innocence throughout the criminal process, a trial court\u2019s consideration of a defendant\u2019s failure to affirmatively express remorse at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>trial offends his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. <em>See id. </em>at 756-57; <em>see also People v. Young, </em>987 P.2d 889, 894-95 (Colo. Ct. App. 1999) (when defendant invokes right to silence at trial and sentencing, he has \u201cno opportunity to express remorse\u201d); <em>Brake v. State, </em>939 P.2d 1029, 1033 (Nev. 1997) (sentencing court violated defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights when defendant had \u201cmaintained his innocence of the crime for which he was ultimately convicted and was unable to express remorse and admit guilt... without foregoing his right to not incriminate himself\u2019); <em>Brown v. State, </em>934 P.2d 235, 245-46 (Nev. 1997) (considering defendant\u2019s refusal to express remorse violated his Fifth Amendment right not to be compelled to be witness against himself; fact that he took stand at trial does not change analysis because he maintained his innocence). As we explained in <em>Burgess, </em>\u201csince contrition or remorse necessarily implies] guilt, it would be irrational or disingenuous to expect or require one who maintains his innocence to express contrition or remorse.\u201d <em>Burgess, </em>156 N.H. at 756 (quotation omitted). In such a case, the defendant cannot express remorse without risking incriminating himself. \u201c[T]he only affirmative way for a defendant ... to express remorse\u201d would be to waive his privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 757. We note that our holding \u2014 that a sentencing court may not consider a defendant\u2019s failure to express remorse at trial \u2014 does not preclude a court from considering other evidence that indicates a defendant\u2019s lack of remorse. <em>See id. </em>at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Here, the trial court\u2019s comments suggest that the court may have considered, at least in part, the defendant\u2019s failure to affirmatively express remorse, either at trial or at sentencing. Although the trial court stated that it \u201caccepted] as true ... that we shouldn\u2019t be staring down the face of [the defendant] looking for acceptance of responsibility and empathy [toward] ... the victim, as it relates to his rehabilitation and the likelihood of his recidivism,\u201d the court did not \u201caccept as true\u201d that his failure to accept responsibility or exhibit empathy toward the victim \u201cmean[t] nothing.\u201d The court stated that it specifically considered the defendant\u2019s \u201ceffort to not take responsibility, his total lack of remorse and empathy [toward] the victim . . . because there is an impact on this victim for his behavior.\u201d The court concluded: \u201cAnd that is an impact I will not tolerate. She did nothing wrong. She was the victim, and he is not taking responsibility.\u201d These comments suggest that the trial court may have impermissibly based its finding that the defendant lacked remorse either upon his failure to express remorse in his trial testimony or upon his silence at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Because we cannot conclude either that the trial court \u201cclearly gave ... no weight\u201d to the improper factors we have identified, <em>id. </em>at 752 (quotation omitted), or that it would have imposed the same sentence but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>for any improper factors that it may have considered, <em>see United States v. Onwuemene, </em>933 F.2d 650, 652 (8th Cir. 1991), we vacate the defendant\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. We must err on the side of protecting the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See State v. Parker, </em>155 N.H. 89, 92 (2007); <em>see also State v. Nichols, </em>247 N.W.2d 249, 256 (Iowa 1976) (any doubt as to whether trial court gave weight to fact that defendant exercised his constitutional rights when it sentenced him \u201cmust be resolved in favor of [the] defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">As the defendant prevails under the State Constitution, we need not reach his federal claims. <em>See Ball, </em>124 N.H. at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\n<em>Conviction affirmed; sentence vacated; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b567-7\">HlCKS, J., concurred; DALIANIS, C.J., concurred specially; Lynn, J., concurred in part and dissented in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b567-8\">DALIANIS, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A5em\">concurring specially. I concur in the majority opinion. I write separately to note that while the dissent focuses, at length, upon its view that the trial court permissibly considered the defendant\u2019s false testimony, the State barely mentioned this issue in its brief. To the extent that the State focused at all upon the defendant\u2019s allegedly false testimony, it did so solely with respect to the defendant\u2019s account of his confession to the police. Because neither the State nor the defendant makes much of this issue, in my opinion, the dissent\u2019s lengthy discussion, although eloquent, is unnecessary.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b567-9\">Lynn, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ASl\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. I agree with the majority opinion that the defendant\u2019s conviction should be upheld. I would also uphold the sentence imposed, however, because I believe the trial court sustainably exercised its discretion in considering the defendant\u2019s post-offense conduct and testimony at trial, as they are reasonably related to the purposes of sentencing. Therefore, I respectfully dissent as to the portion of the opinion vacating the sentence and remanding for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">The majority relies on three factors in asserting that a remand for resentencing is required: (1) the majority\u2019s inability to conclude from the record that the trial court <em>did not </em>improperly consider the \u201ctrial tactics\u201d of defense counsel as a sentencing consideration; (2) its inability to discern that the court <em>did </em>find that the defendant had testified falsely at trial; and (3) its inability to discern that the trial court <em>did not </em>consider the defendant\u2019s failure to affirmatively express remorse at trial or at sentencing. As explained below, I believe the record provides no reasonable grounds for suspecting the court based its sentencing decision on factor (1), which I agree would be an improper sentencing consideration, and contains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>clear grounds for concluding the court did find factor (2), which the majority concedes is a proper sentencing consideration. With respect to factor (3), I again believe the record provides no reasonable basis for suspecting that the court punished the defendant for failing to affirmatively express remorse at <em>sentencing, </em>and I also find the majority\u2019s legal analysis is unpersuasive insofar as it concludes that a potential deprivation of a defendant\u2019s constitutional privilege against self-incrimination can result from a defendant\u2019s failure to express remorse <em>at trial </em>in a case, such as this one, where the defendant does not remain silent at trial, but instead chooses to testify and flatly denies that he engaged in the charged criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\n<em>I. Sentencing Principles</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">A trial judge has broad discretion to choose the sources and types of evidence upon which to rely in imposing a sentence, and we review that sentencing decision under our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard. <em>State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 295-96 (2001).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Part I, Article 18 of the State Constitution states the wise principle that \u201c[a]ll penalties ought to be proportioned to the nature of the offense,\u201d and \u201crequires the trial court to consider all the relevant factors necessary to the exercise of its discretion,\u201d including \u201cwhether the sentence imposed will meet the traditional goals of sentencing \u2014 punishment, deterrence and rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Duquette v. Warden, N.H. State Prison, </em>154 N.H. 737, 746 (2007) (quotation omitted). A sentencing judge may consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the defendant\u2019s demeanor throughout trial, false testimony, and any other factor pertinent to the goals of sentencing. A defendant\u2019s lack of remorse for criminal conduct is pertinent to the goals of sentencing because it bears on a person\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation. <em>Cf. State v. Hammond, </em>144 N.H. 401, 408 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Of course, a sentencing judge\u2019s discretion is not unlimited; the judge may not consider the exercise of a constitutional right as a sentencing enhancement factor, both because it offends basic notions of fairness to punish a person for invoking something to which the person has a right, <em>see Bordenkircher v. Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 363 (1978), and because the exercise of one\u2019s rights does not reasonably bear on one\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">That said, it is well established that a sentencing judge may consider the defendant\u2019s false testimony as evidence of his capacity for rehabilitation without impermissibly interfering with the defendant\u2019s right to take the stand in his own defense. <em>See State v. Burgess, </em>156 N.H. 746, 754-55 (2008); <em>accord, e.g., United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94 (1993); <em>United States v. Grayson, </em>438 U.S. 41, 54-55 (1978); <em>State v. Carsten, </em>264 N.W.2d 707, 709 (S.D. 1978) (\u201c[A] defendant\u2019s lack of candor at trial or at sentencing is among the factors that a trial court may permissibly take into account in imposing sentence.\u201d); <em>State v. Olson, </em>359 N.W.2d 53, 54 (Minn. Ct. App. 1984) (\u201cOne who so vehemently denies his crime under these facts does not seem to be one who would be particularly amenable to treatment.\u201d). <em>See generally </em>Annotation, <em>Sentencing </em>\u2014 <em>Defendant\u2019s Perjury Considered, </em>34 A.L.R.4TH 888 (1984) (listing cases upholding consideration of perjury or false testimony at sentencing as it relates to rehabilitation). As the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Grayson, </em>\u201c[t]he right guaranteed by law to a defendant is narrowly the right to testify truthfully in accordance with the oath----There is no protected right to commit perjury.\u201d <em>Grayson, </em>438 U.S. at 54; <em>see Burgess, </em>156 N.H. at 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Against this background, the defendant argues that the trial judge impermissibly punished him for exercising his constitutional rights to present a defense at trial and to remain silent at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">The trial court stated the following in its sentencing order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">[T]his defendant, like all defendants, absolutely is entitled to a trial and all the protections of the Constitution. But there\u2019s a difference between making the State prove their case, prove whether or not the person is guilty or not guilty, and the <em>type of defense </em>that\u2019s lodged against those sorts of attacks by the State. And what this defendant did, in his choice, in terms of the defense he raised in this case and what he apparently continues to do in his interactions with his family is that he, by his behavior, by his choice, has chosen to destroy in any way he can this victim, not only by accusing her repeatedly of lying and coming up with a variety of reasons why she lied, accusing her in front of this jury of being promiscuous, and . . . that\u2019s the reason that there was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>discussion of pregnancy in the one party, setting his family up to choose between him and [the victim] by his actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Focusing on the trial court\u2019s reference to the \u201ctype of defense\u201d as a factor in its sentencing decision, the majority expresses concern that this could indicate the court increased the defendant\u2019s sentence because he exercised his constitutional right to trial. I do not believe that this is a reasonable construction of the trial court\u2019s statement. While it is certainly true that there can be situations in which it would be improper for the court to punish a defendant for the type of defense he presented at trial, it also is clear that there are many types of defenses that can properly be considered as aggravating factors in sentencing. For example, if a defendant decides that his \u201ctype of defense\u201d will include the presentation of false alibi evidence, there can be no doubt that the sentencing court could properly consider this as a basis for enhanced punishment. <em>See, e.g., Harris v. State, </em>749 N.E.2d 57, 61 (Ind. Ct. App. 2001); <em>State v. Harrington, </em>454 S.E.2d 713, 716 (N.C. Ct. App. 1998); <em>cf. State v. Charland, </em>35 A.3d 124, 129 (Vt. 2011) (rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that, \u201cbecause the attorney rather than the client is responsible for trial tactics, including calling witnesses, we cannot punish the client for the lawyer\u2019s decision to call a particular witness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The majority does not conclude outright that the trial court increased the defendant\u2019s punishment for exercising his constitutional rights. Rather, the majority believes the record is not sufficiently clear that the court did <em>not </em>do so. Nothing in the judge\u2019s sentencing soliloquy, however, indicates she was punishing the defendant for exercising his constitutional right to have a trial at which the State must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Instead, the record reflects the trial judge\u2019s belief that (1) the defendant\u2019s conduct toward the victim <em>before </em>trial indicated a particularly callous state of mind, and (2) the defendant\u2019s false and misleading statements under oath indicated a lack of remorse. Thus, I do not believe the majority\u2019s concerns are warranted here, and I would affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">\n<em>II. Textual Interpretation and Record Support for Sentencing Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Initially it must be noted that the judge prefaced her remarks by <em>expressly </em>affirming the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a trial and to the presumption of innocence. Apparently rejecting this statement, the majority reads the phrases \u201ctype of defense\u201d and \u201cthe defense he raised in this case\u201d to suggest that the court focused upon the defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s \u201ctrial tactics.\u201d In my opinion, this reading strains credulity. We have often stated that, when interpreting statutes, we do not read words in isolation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>but in the context of the overall statutory scheme. <em>State v. Stowe, </em>162 N.H. 464, 474 (2011). That principle applies with even greater force to spoken words delivered extemporaneously. The judge did not just refer to \u201cthe defense he raised in this case\u201d in isolation, as the majority suggests she did, but followed that phrase with \u201cand what apparently he continues to do in his interactions with his family.\u201d It would be implausible for the trial court to say that the supposedly impermissible considerations of trial tactics, such as the choice to cross-examine a witness, <em>also </em>apply to the defendant\u2019s interactions with his family; it only makes sense to read that passage to mean that the judge was considering <em>the defendant\u2019s mendacious behavior </em>both at trial and in his interactions with his family. Indeed, the evidence strongly supports the latter explanation because, as shown more fully below, the defendant repeatedly accused his daughter of lying about the assaults. Thus, the \u201cdefense he raised\u201d can only refer to the defendant\u2019s own behavior. And, if any doubt remains that the judge did not consider the defense\u2019s <em>trial tactics, </em>her other remarks referred specifically to the defendant\u2019s own actions \u2014 \u201cwhat this defendant did, in his choice\u201d; \u201che, by his behavior, by his choice\u201d \u2014 and went on to list the defendant\u2019s conduct that she was considering. So understood, and in combination with the express reference to the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, the judge\u2019s prior reference to the \u201ctype of defense\u201d must be similarly interpreted to refer only to the defendant\u2019s own conduct \u2014 not the defense generally or defense counsel\u2019s trial tactics.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">To my knowledge, this is the first time any court has rejected a trial judge\u2019s explicit statement that he or she was aware of and respectful toward a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights based simply on speculation that the judge may have considered improper evidence at sentencing. <em>Cf. State v. Silva, </em>158 N.H. 96, 102 (2008) (we assume trial court made all necessary findings to support its decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Moreover, the judge\u2019s comments subsequent to the passing reference to the \u201ctype of defense\u201d indicate that the judge limited her sentencing decision to permissible considerations of the nature of the offense, <em>see State v. Enderson, </em>148 N.H. 253, 259 (2002), the defendant\u2019s behavior toward the victim after the offense, and the defendant\u2019s false testimony at trial, <em>see Grayson, </em>438 U.S. at 54; <em>Hammond, </em>144 N.H. at 408. To fully understand the basis of the judge\u2019s sentencing decision, it is necessary to examine at some length the trial testimony as it relates to the explanation she gave for imposing the maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Much of the judge\u2019s explanation refers to the defendant\u2019s <em>conduct </em>after having molested his daughter during her youth. For example, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>By his choices, he has set this victim up for destruction. And what he did after he chose to sexually abuse her in the very, very tender years of her adolescence and the one person she should have been able to turn to for protection, he allowed her to crash and burn as a teenager . . . because of the ridiculous choices he forced her into, that corner he forced her into.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-3\">He sexually abused her and then left her no way out. And by his behavior, by his choices, he took away her childhood and potentially her adult life. She will never be the same. And he\u2019s now taking away her family by his choices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\">He allowed her to walk down the path of feeling that there is no choice but to take her life. To allow a teenager to die because of his selfishness is what he chose by his behavior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">These comments reflect the judge\u2019s reasonable assessment that the defendant\u2019s criminal acts \u2014 forcing his own daughter to have sex with him during her teenage years \u2014 and subsequent conduct \u2014 deflecting blame and accusing her of lying about the assaults, whatever the effects on her well-being \u2014 have caused his daughter extreme and lasting damage. In particular, these comments reflect testimony suggesting that his daughter struggled to regain a sense of stability in her life during and after the sexual assaults. She testified, for example, that she had a difficult and strained relationship with both her step-mother and her biological mother; that her grandfather also sexually abused her subsequent to her father\u2019s assaults; that, in the face of her step-mother accusing her of lying about the sexual assaults, she \u201cwanted to die\u201d; and that she was hospitalized after overdosing on antidepressant pills at school. These considerations are reasonably related to the nature and circumstances of the offense. <em>Cf. Burgess, </em>156 N.H. at 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The judge also commented on the defendant\u2019s attempt at trial to paint the victim as a liar and as sexually promiscuous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">The fact that the defendant in the face of the evidence against him has chosen to call [the victim], in all intent, a whore, a liar, somebody who made such a terrible lie up simply because she was trying to help his ex-wife in a divorce, and those are the reasons that he provided to us for her lies, the fact that he would go to those extremes, the fact that he would set her family up against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>her in his effort to deny and his effort to not take responsibility, his total lack of remorse and empathy on the victim can be taken into consideration by this court because there is an impact on this victim for his behavior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">This portion of the sentencing statement reflects the judge\u2019s proper consideration, reasonably bearing on the defendant\u2019s lack of remorse and prospects for rehabilitation, of: (1) the defendant\u2019s false testimony at trial; (2) the defendant\u2019s pattern of avoiding responsibility for his actions <em>before </em>trial; and (3) the defendant\u2019s willingness to paint the victim as sexually promiscuous when faced with the accusations against him. The State introduced two recorded telephone conversations in its case-in-chief, during which the victim asked the defendant what would have happened if he had gotten her pregnant and whether he owed her an apology. The defendant admitted on direct examination that the victim asked him the question about pregnancy \u2014 \u201cWhat would have happened if you\u2019d gotten me pregnant?\u201d \u2014 and that his response in the recording was, \u201cThat\u2019s a scary thought.\u201d On redirect examination, in response to his counsel asking him to explain what he thought the victim was asking about when she asked about pregnancy, the defendant stated, \u201cI knew she was sexually active at school\u2014 It\u2019s the way I heard it on the phone\u201d \u2014 the implication being that she was only asking him about pregnancy because of her sexual encounters with others while in school. Additionally, in response to his counsel asking what he thought she was asking about with respect to needing an apology, the defendant stated, \u201cI figured the way that I, you know, didn\u2019t listen to her about [her step-mother].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s characterization that he was merely asserting his rights to a jury trial and a presumption of innocence, these exchanges constitute an attempt by the defendant to discredit his daughter and her accusations by <em>lying </em>on the witness stand. Put simply, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>defendant knew that his daughter was not referring to her relationship with her step-mother or her sexual activity in high school in the recorded conversations. Lest there be any doubt, the evidence that he was lying about what he thought was the subject matter of those telephone conversations was overwhelming. He admitted on cross-examination, for example, that, in response to his daughter asking him for an apology, he told-her he had already apologized, and that \u201cthat stuff never should have happened.\u201d He also admitted, as noted above, that he said \u201cthat\u2019s a scary thought\u201d in response to her question about the possibility of his having gotten her pregnant. In addition, when confronted by the police at the station with the fact that they had set up and recorded the telephone calls, the defendant promptly confessed to the crimes. Needless to say, had the defendant <em>actually </em>thought that his daughter\u2019s questions were about being sexually active in high school and her relationship with her step-mother, he would have had no reason to confess to the crimes when confronted with the reality that those conversations had been recorded. Nor is it at all plausible that a conversation would take place many years after the events <em>as he portrayed them at trial </em>that meandered between such disconnected topics as him owing her an apology for not listening to her about his wife (for what, we do not know) and the possibility of her getting pregnant as a result of her sexual activity at school. In light of these facts, the judge sensibly concluded that the defendant concocted a false explanation on the witness stand when in reality he knew that he had sexually assaulted his daughter, and that she had asked him about what if <em>he </em>had gotten her pregnant, and whether he owed her an apology <em>for sexually assaulting her. </em>He also knew, given that he <em>in fact </em>committed the crimes, that her previous recantations when she was a teenager indicated, not a lack of truth to her accusations, but an attempt to put the matter behind her when no one believed her. Although the defendant has a right to confront witnesses against him and expose inconsistencies in their testimony, he has no concomitant right to preclude the judge from considering his deliberate in-court falsehoods as evidence of a lack of remorse for sentencing purposes. <em>See Burgess, </em>156 N.H. at 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Nor was this exchange the only testimony in which the <em>defendant </em>\u2014 not defense counsel through cross-examination based on prior inconsistent statements \u2014 said or suggested that his daughter was lying. In response to his counsel asking him how he felt when his daughter first accused him and his father of sexually assaulting her, he responded, \u201creally a lot of mixed emotions. It was \u2014 it\u2019s really hard to explain. As you know, you know, you couldn\u2019t have known.\u201d When asked about the \u201cother emotions\u201d he felt, the defendant responded: \u201cShocked, disbelief, depressed.... For her to come out and say stuff like that, that never happened.\u201d The implication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>of those statements is clear: his daughter was lying about the assaults, and it was difficult for him, emotionally, to cope with being <em>falsely accused. </em>But we know \u2014 as established by the jury\u2019s verdict and other evidence \u2014 that he was not falsely accused and that these emotions were concocted from whole cloth, thus explaining the trial judge\u2019s reference to the defendant\u2019s <em>choice </em>to paint the victim as a liar.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Later in the direct examination, during a discussion of the fact that the same accusations had been leveled in 2001 but dropped by the police after his daughter recanted, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">[Counsel]: Did you think about [those accusations]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">[Defendant]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">[Counsel]: Why didn\u2019t you continue to think about them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">[Defendant]: \u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s \u2014 really, it starting [sic] taking effect on the other two kids because I was withdrawing from them, and my wife just told me that, you know, for what she\u2019s caused you and you shouldn\u2019t take it out on the other kids.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">This was a particularly pointed confirmation of the defendant\u2019s willingness to portray his daughter as a liar when he knew she was not lying. If his wife did tell him \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t take it out on the other kids,\u201d it suggests that he had told his wife that his daughter was lying and that he was willing to pit her family against her in an effort to cover up his crimes. That his daughter subsequently moved in with her grandfather and, after she publicly accused both men of sexual abuse, the defendant did not see her for three to four years, only verifies that he was willing to let her relationship with her step-mother and sisters suffer if it meant avoiding responsibility for his crimes. In the judge\u2019s words, he \u201cset her family up against her in his effort to deny and his effort to not take responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">Still later in the testimony, another exchange took place that revealed the defendant\u2019s willingness to lie both on the stand and to the police. Discussing the conversation he had with the police that ultimately led to his arrest and indictment in this case, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-12\">[Counsel]: How were you feeling when you found out about those allegations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-13\">[Defendant]: Shocked, stunned, worried, scared, depressed, mixed emotions. It was just \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-14\">[Counsel]: Why were you shocked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>[Defendant]: For her even bringing up something that wasn\u2019t true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">[Counsel]: Why were you worried?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">[Defendant]: I was worried for her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">[Counsel]: Why were you depressed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">[Defendant]: I was depressed. I probably never got over the depression of everything that\u2019s gone on, and this probably just \u2014 rock-bottom depressed. It was \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">[Counsel]: Were you feeling anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">[Defendant]: Anger, sad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-11\">[Counsel]: Why were you angry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-12\">[Defendant]: Angry that she would ever have done this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-13\">[Counsel]: Why were you sad?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-14\">[Defendant]: For the same reasons. Why? For something that never really \u2014 never happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-15\">These statements, like the other falsehoods recited above, expose the defendant\u2019s ongoing willingness to concoct a story of lies to avoid taking responsibility for his actions. The defendant could not have been \u201cshocked ... for even bringing up something that wasn\u2019t true\u201d because he knew that her accusations were true. Nor could he be angry for that reason. Nor, indeed, does it make any sense that he was \u201cworried for her\u201d other than to imply he was worried that she was lying again (although she was not lying). Fairly read, the judge\u2019s reference to the \u201ctype of defense\u201d refers not to any attempt by the <em>defense (e.g., </em>defendant\u2019s counsel) to require the prosecution to meet its burden of proof, but an attempt by the <em>defendant </em>to deflect blame for his crimes by lying \u2014 \u201crepeatedly,\u201d in the judge\u2019s words \u2014 both on the witness stand and well before trial when the accusations had first been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-16\">Also justified was the judge\u2019s recitation of the defendant\u2019s willingness to paint his daughter as sexually promiscuous \u2014 \u201cin all intent, a whore,\u201d in the judge\u2019s words \u2014 as evidence of a lack of remorse. This is because the defendant told the police, after he confessed at the station, that his daughter had asked him to have sex with her and he only obliged because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>he would give his daughters anything they wanted. Implicit in that comment is that his daughter had been sexually promiscuous from a very young age \u2014 as if that negated his culpability for sexually assaulting her. Additionally, as noted above, he painted his daughter as sexually promiscuous on the \"witness stand when he said, in response to the question about the possibility of getting her pregnant, \u201cI knew she was sexually active at school.\u201d In addition to being a lie (the hypothetical question was about him \u2014 not another person \u2014 getting her pregnant), that explanation provided a basis for the judge to conclude that the defendant was seeking to discredit his daughter by painting her as promiscuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">While it is true that defense counsel sought to undermine the victim\u2019s credibility while she was on the stand in light of her recantations, the majority points to no portion of the trial judge\u2019s sentencing soliloquy that relies on that aspect of the defense \u201cstrategy\u201d \u2014 other than the isolated phrases \u201ctype of defense\u201d and \u201cdefense he raised\u201d \u2014 in determining the defendant\u2019s sentence. Nor can it, for the judge was referring in the entirety of her statement to <em>the defendant\u2019s own actions </em>on the stand and before trial. Thus, we <em>can </em>determine with confidence on the record before us that the judge did not give weight to the fact that the defense sought to test the victim\u2019s credibility by highlighting prior inconsistent statements and to put the prosecution to its burden of proof. Faced with overwhelming evidence of guilt, on the basis of which the jury returned a guilty verdict, the judge had ample grounds to believe that the defendant had lied under oath in order to explain away the evidence against him. Having decided to take the witness stand and make demonstrably false statements, the defendant assumed the risk that the sentencing judge would conclude, as happened here, that he lacks remorse for his offenses and therefore is not a good candidate for being rehabilitated.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Gribble, </em>636 N.W.2d 488 (Wis. Ct. App. 2001), is misplaced. In-that case, the sentencing court considered it an aggravating factor that the defendant had \u201cpursued a defense of putting [the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s] past life and troubles on trial and asserting that she killed her child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509. Notably, that decision actually <em>affirmed </em>the trial court\u2019s consideration of the defendant\u2019s false testimony insofar as it \u201cfurther victimized\u201d the victim and \u201cfurther aggravated] the nature of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Those facts are strikingly similar to the observation of the judge in the instant case that the defendant \u201chas chosen to destroy in any way he can this victim.\u201d If anything, the sentencing court\u2019s reference in <em>Gribble </em>to the defense having put the mother\u2019s life and troubles \u201con trial\u201d treaded far closer to the constitutional line than anything occurring in this case because, put simply, the defendant has a constitutional right to a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>The majority\u2019s statement that the sentencing judge \u201cdid not affirmatively find that the defendant lied on the stand\u201d is particularly perplexing. Although she did not use the exact words \u201cthe defendant lied on the stand,\u201d the judge\u2019s remarks clearly indicate that she was considering the defendant\u2019s false testimony. For example, the judge said the defendant has chosen to \u201cdestroy\u201d the victim \u201cby accusing her repeatedly of lying and <em>coming up with a variety of reasons </em>why she lied.\u201d \u201cComing up with a reason\u201d for something, in common parlance, means \u201clying.\u201d Moreover, implicit in the statement that the defendant has accused his daughter of lying is that that accusation itself was a lie; had the judge thought there was any truth to the defendant\u2019s accusation, she would not have cited that portion of his testimony as a basis for punishing him. The judge also referred disapprovingly to \u201cthe fact that he would go to those extremes\u201d of calling his daughter a liar; it would make little sense to read the reference to \u201cextremes\u201d other than to say that the judge was considering the fact that the defendant had himself lied \u2014 or, gone to the <em>extreme </em>of lying \u2014 by accusing his daughter of falsely accusing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Had the judge stated or implied that she believed the defendant\u2019s choice of making the State prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt merited an enhanced sentence, I would not hesitate to vacate the sentence. Viewed in the context of the entire sentencing statement, however, the judge\u2019s reference to the \u201ctype of defense\u201d is more fairly understood as an imprecise choice of spoken words than an attempt to impose a harsher penalty on the defendant for choosing to exercise his constitutional rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the majority\u2019s decision to vacate the sentence on the ground that the judge\u2019s comments \u201cdo not expressly state\u201d that \u201cthe defendant lied on the stand\u201d is not warranted here. As we have stated before, we assume that the trial court made all the findings necessary to support its decision. <em>See Silva, </em>158 N.H. at 102; <em>see also State v. Towle, </em>162 N.H. 799, 818 (2011) (Dalianis, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">\n<em>III. Lack of Remorse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The majority also expresses concern that the trial court may have considered the defendant\u2019s lack of remorse unlawfully. I believe the majority\u2019s concerns are unfounded for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">First, I agree that, under the circumstances of this case where the defendant\u2019s defense was a complete denial that he engaged in the criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>conduct charged, <em>Burgess </em>precludes enhancement of the defendant\u2019s punishment based upon his failing to affirmatively express remorse or his remaining silent <em>at sentencing. </em>But given the fact that the judge never referred to the defendant\u2019s conduct at the sentencing hearing, plus the ample evidence of the defendant\u2019s lack of remorse based upon his actions before and at trial, as recited above, the notion that the sentencing court gave weight to his decision to remain silent at sentencing is, in my view, not a plausible construction of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Second, the majority\u2019s suggestion that the trial court may have erred in considering the defendant\u2019s failure to affirmatively express remorse <em>at trial </em>is illogical given that what he did was just the opposite \u2014 he affirmatively expressed a lack of remorse through his false trial testimony. I have no quarrel with the general proposition that a defendant cannot be punished for staying silent during trial; this, indeed, is a well-established rule imposed to lend substance to a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. <em>See, e.g., Estelle v. Smith, </em>451 U.S. 454, 468 (1981). I cannot agree, however, that this is an appropriate case for extending the <em>Burgess </em>rule to a defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to express remorse at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">To begin with, we generally avoid addressing arguments not raised by the parties at trial or on appeal. <em>See State v. Belyea, </em>160 N.H. 298, 308-09 (2010); <em>cf. Town of Orford v. N.H. Air Resources Comm., </em>128 N.H. 539, 542 (1986) (\u201c[T]he judicial power ordinarily does not include the power to issue advisory opinions.\u201d). <em>Burgess </em>established a rule that a sentencing court may not enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence based upon his silence at sentencing. The defendant argues only that the judge punished him for remaining silent at sentencing, in violation of <em>Burgess </em>\u2014 an obviously meritless argument for the reasons stated previously. Yet the majority now holds that the <em>Burgess </em>rule applies to an entirely different situation in which the defendant takes the stand at trial and delivers false testimony, and it does so without the benefit of argument on this point developed through the normal adversarial process by which issues are channeled and sharpened. <em>Cf. Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962) (in federal standing context, asking whether appellants alleged such a personal stake in the outcome as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Beyond those foundational considerations of judicial economy and prudence, it is clear that, while the defendant cannot be punished for failing to <em>affirmatively express remorse (i.e., </em>\u201cI am terribly sorry for my actions.\u201d), if he has committed a crime and then takes the witness stand at trial and lies about having done so, such falsehoods are strong evidence that he is, in fact, not remorseful for his conduct, and are, therefore, pertinent to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>prospects for rehabilitation. <em>Cf. Grayson, </em>438 U.S. at 50; <em>Hammond, </em>144 N.H. at 408. Indeed, no case of which I am aware has held or even intimated that it is improper for a sentencing court to find a lack of remorse when a defendant has testified at trial and falsely denied he participated at all in the charged criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">\n<em>IV. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The majority opinion is in disharmony with the traditional deference owed to the sentencing judge, who is, after all, in the best position to evaluate the nature and severity of the crime and the likelihood that the offender will re-offend. Although I have little doubt that the immediate result of today\u2019s remand will be simply to have the trial judge reaffirm more solemnly than she has done already that she really and truly did not consider improper sentencing factors, the implications of this case for the future are unfortunate. By showing a willingness to single out what is, at most, an arguably imprecise word or phrase in the judge\u2019s remarks and subject it to the most exacting scrutiny for the mere possibility it could reflect improper sentencing factors, we have effectively sent a message to sentencing judges that \u201cthe less said, the better.\u201d Candor at the sentencing phase should not be so readily discouraged. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50 (2007) (\u201cAfter settling on the appropriate sentence, [district court] must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d); <em>Anglemyerv. State, </em>868 N.E.2d 482, 490 (Ind. 2007) (requiring \u201creasonably detailed recitation of the trial court\u2019s reasons for imposing a particular sentence\u201d); <em>State v. Stewart, </em>435 N.E.2d 426, 429 (Ohio Ct. App. 1980); <em>cf. State v. Hurlburt, </em>135 N.H. 143, 150 (1991) (Batchelder, J., concurring specially) (\u201c[T]he better practice is for trial judges to articulate specific reasons when they impose a second sentence harsher than the first.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">For the reasons stated above, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-7\"> The majority correctly cites <em>State v. Burgess, </em>156 N.H. 746 (2008), as stating that we review a sentencing decision <em>de novo </em>whenever a defendant has <em>alleged </em>a constitutional violation. Because the inquiry in this case is limited to whether the judge considered the defendant\u2019s exercise of his constitutional rights at sentencing, the result would be the same under either a <em>de novo </em>or an unsustainable exercise of discretion standard of review. However, the standard as articulated today and in <em>Burgess </em>is potentially misleading insofar as it suggests a defendant will receive a \u201cfresh look\u201d at the decision itself as long as a constitutional violation is alleged. The more accurate statement of the rule is that we review constitutional violations <em>de novo, </em>but still review the overall decision for an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>See, e.g., State v. Cain, </em>888 A.2d 276, 278 (Me. 2006) (\u201cOur standard of review as to <em>whether </em>there was a constitutional violation in the sentencing is <em>de novo. </em>Review of application of discretionary sentencing factors is under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d (citation omitted; emphasis added)); <em>State v. Woodruff, 151 P.3d </em>1086, 1087 (Wash. Ct. App. 2007) (\u2018We review constitutional challenges to a trial court\u2019s sentencing decision <em>de novo.\u201d). </em>By definition, of course, a sentencing court\u2019s consideration of evidence in violation of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights would amount to an unsustainable exercise of discretion justifying remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\"> Although these recordings \u2014 or a transcript of them \u2014 would assist us in determining how false or misleading these statements were, the defendant has not provided this court with them. As we have stated many times before, \u201cThe appealing party has the burden to provide this court with a sufficient record to decide his issues on appeal...\u201d <em>State v. Winward, </em>161 N.H. 533, 542 (2011); <em>Bean v. Red Oak Prop. Mgmt., </em>151 N.H. 248, 250 (2004). To the extent that the defendant argues that the sentencing judge improperly considered his mere exercise of his right to trial as a basis for a sentence enhancement, his failure to provide us with the recordings or a transcript of them makes it very difficult to understand fully the grounds of the sentencing judge\u2019s decision. Nonetheless, from the limited testimony made available to us, it is evident that the recordings contained various inculpatory statements made by the defendant in response to questions by the victim. The trial judge, having been present at trial and having listened to the recordings, could very well have relied on additional information gleaned from the recordings \u2014 not available to us on appeal \u2014 in explaining her decision. That the jury convicted makes it reasonable to infer that the recordings did not confirm the defendant\u2019s version of events at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b578-9\"> We should not ignore the fact that, as is normally the case, the judge\u2019s sentencing remarks were delivered orally (and likely extemporaneously) from the bench and thus may understandably have been less precise than would have been the case had she explained her sentencing decision in a written order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
