He argues that the Superior Court <em>(Mohl, </em>J.) erred by: (1) denying his motions <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence that he \u201ccontrolled\u201d the complainant; and (2) denying his request for a defense of property instruction. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">The jury could have found the following facts. In October 2009, the defendant and the complainant lived together. On October 11, they were both at work at the Olive Garden restaurant in Manchester when the defendant became upset because of an interaction between the complainant and a male manager. Consistent with their habit of \u201cbreaking] up every other day,\u201d the defendant broke up with the complainant. They nonetheless drove home together, napped together for about three hours, and then went to dinner together at a restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">After dinner, during which they both consumed some alcohol (the respective amounts of which are contested), the defendant and the complainant split payment of the bill, but the defendant paid a smaller portion. The defendant then drove the couple home, where they began to argue about money. The complainant insisted that they talk, attempting to speak to the defendant through a closed door and calling his cellular telephone number repeatedly. Later, when the defendant was sitting on a couch with his wallet and keys on a nearby table, the complainant grabbed the keys with the purpose of preventing the defendant from driving, and with them headed up the stairs. The defendant followed her. The complainant testified that during the ensuing struggle over the keys, the defendant grabbed her as she was halfway up the stairs and threw her into a wall; the defendant testified that he and the complainant fell together on the stairs. The accounts agree that the complainant ended up on her back at the bottom of the stairs with the defendant above her, and that his hand made contact with her face. The complainant testified that the defendant twisted her arm and told her he would break it. The defendant ultimately recovered the keys and went out to his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">The complainant followed the defendant and stood behind his car, blocking his departure. When she moved from the rear to the side of the car, calling the defendant repeatedly and knocking on his window, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>defendant put the car into reverse and pressed the accelerator. The side view mirror made contact with the complainant and was dislodged. The complainant reentered their home and locked the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">After realizing the mirror had been dislodged, the defendant returned to the home. He testified that when he pounded on the bolted door, the complainant opened it and let him in; she testified that the defendant pounded on the door before opening it with his key. The defendant then attempted to barricade himself in the bedroom. When the complainant insisted that he leave the bedroom, he knocked a hole in the bedroom door with either his fist or his elbow.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The following day, the complainant had a bruised eye, which she tried to conceal with makeup. After speaking with several people, she ultimately decided to go to the police. The defendant sent several \u201cangry\u201d and \u201cspiteful\u201d text messages to the complainant, including, \u201cI see u put makeup on u f***ing crazy slut. Who r u f***ing now?\u201d; \u2018Where the f*** r u\u201d; \u201cTELL ME WHERE YOU ARE\u201d; and \u201cU r full of sh**, tell me where u are.\u201d The defendant moved out of the home that afternoon. That evening, the defendant sent the complainant another text message, apologizing and telling the complainant, \u201cThe door will be taken care of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The defendant was charged with: three counts of simple assault stemming from the physical contact inside the apartment; criminal mischief, based upon damage to the bedroom door; reckless conduct, based upon the car\u2019s contact with the complainant; and criminal threatening, based upon the defendant\u2019s alleged threat to break the complainant\u2019s arm. The defendant was convicted of criminal mischief and the three counts of simple assault, but was acquitted of reckless conduct and criminal threatening. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The defendant first argues that the trial court erred in denying his two motions <em>in limine </em>seeking to exclude evidence under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 404(b) (regarding the inadmissibility of character evidence). The defendant\u2019s first motion <em>in limine </em>sought to exclude testimony tending to suggest that he was \u201ccontrolling\u201d and set rigid behavioral rules for the complainant, the admission of which, he argued, violated New Hampshire Rules of Evidence 401,402,403,404(a), 404(b), and 608, as well as his state and federal due process rights. The evidence included testimony that the complainant had previously sought a restraining order against the defendant; that the defendant had broken up with the complainant at work because she was speaking with a male manager; that he was controlling and jealous; that he did not allow her to speak with other males and rarely allowed her to wear makeup; that he was verbally cruel to her at work; and that he had previously assaulted her. The second motion asserted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>content of some of his text messages to the complainant, sent the day after the incident, was inadmissible under New Hampshire Rules of Evidence 401, 402, 408, and 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"> \u201cThe decision to admit \u2018bad acts\u2019 evidence lies within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion and will be overturned only if the defendant can show that the decision was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>State v. McGlew, </em>139 N.H. 505, 507 (1995). As to the criminal mischief conviction stemming from the damage to the apartment\u2019s bedroom door, the defendant appears to have conceded the facts underlying that conviction. <em>Compare </em>the charging document (alleging that defendant \u201cdid commit the crime of Criminal Mischief in that, having no right to do so nor any reasonable basis for belief of having such a right, the defendant recklessly damaged the property of another when he punched a hole in a door inside the apartment of [the complainant], contrary to the form of the Statute\u201d) <em>with </em>defendant\u2019s testimony at trial (stating that he damaged the door by putting a hole in it with his elbow because \u201c[he] was just upset.... [he]\u2019d had enough\u201d), <em>and </em>acknowledgement in his brief (\u201c \u2018Stressed\u2019 and aggravated that [the complainant] wouldn\u2019t stop yelling at him, [the defendant] elbowed the bedroom door, putting a hole in it.\u201d). <em>See </em>RSA 626:2, 11(c) (2007) (defining \u201c\u2018Recklessly\u2019\u201d); RSA 626:2, III (2007) (\u201cWhen recklessness suffices, the element is also established if the person acts purposely or knowingly.\u201d). Thus, as to this charge, the defendant cannot demonstrate that the court\u2019s rulings were \u201cclearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>Id.; see also State v. Stott, </em>149 N.H. 170, 172 (2003). We therefore affirm that conviction, and turn to the defendant\u2019s claims of error as to his simple assault convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Before and during trial, the defendant argued that the evidence of his controlling behavior was irrelevant, unfairly prejudicial, and constituted inadmissible \u201cpropensity\u201d character evidence. The State responded that it did not seek to admit evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior conduct to show that he acted in conformity therewith, but rather \u201cto show the defendant\u2019s <em>motive </em>and <em>intent </em>at the time.\u201d It argued that the defendant\u2019s \u201cstate of mind during the charged conduct [was] relevant,\u201d both for the purpose of establishing his motive for the charged conduct, and to counter his argument that he was acting only in defense of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">In ruling on the admissibility of the evidence of the defendant\u2019s allegedly controlling behavior, the trial court distinguished between opinions that the defendant was a controlling person, which it excluded as inadmissible character evidence, and \u201cfacts\u201d of the defendant\u2019s controlling behavior (including statements), which it found admissible to provide \u201ccontext.\u201d The trial court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>It\u2019s my view that in order to understand this case, the jury has to understand the context in which it is presented, and for that reason, statements that the defendant may have made in the recent time period of the alleged assaults are, in my view, that describe the relationship and his alleged controlling behavior, are admissible, because I think the jury has to understand the context in which this case is set. . . . [FJacts that demonstrate that behavior are admissible in my judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">With regard to the text messages, the court ruled that they were likewise relevant \u201c[t]o the extent [they] deal[t] with the question of controlling behavior.\u201d The court did not issue a limiting instruction concerning the purposes for which the jury could consider the evidence. The court further ruled that evidence of prior assaults would be excluded, unless the defense cross-examined the complainant as to her delay in reporting the charged conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">At trial, the defendant\u2019s \u201ccontrolling\u201d behavior was a central theme of the State\u2019s case, beginning with its opening statement and continuing throughout its witness examinations. The defendant maintains that evidence of his alleged \u201ccontrolling behavior\u201d was inadmissible under Rule 404(b), and that its admission prejudiced his case. He argues that the State failed to establish a clear and logical connection between the evidence of his alleged controlling behavior and the charged conduct, and failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that the alleged controlling behavior had occurred. He further asserts that the prejudicial effect of the evidence, which cast him as a domestic abuser, substantially outweighed any probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The State responds that Rule 404(b) does not apply because the evidence was in the form of the defendant\u2019s statements, which \u201cwere not, in and of themselves, bad acts.\u201d It asserts that his statements were admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(A) as statements of a party-opponent, and, therefore, the test of their admissibility is set forth in Rule 403 (regarding exclusion of relevant evidence). The State argues further that, even if the evidence were subject to a Rule 404(b) analysis, it was properly admitted as evidence of the defendant\u2019s motive and intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Assuming that the text messages constituted \u201cstatements,\u201d rather than prior \u201cbad acts,\u201d <em>but see, e.g., State v. Pepin, </em>156 N.H. 269, 275-79 (2007) (analyzing verbal threat under Rule 404(b)), we conclude that the \u201ccontrolling behavior\u201d evidence nonetheless consisted of intertwined statements and actions subject to analysis under Rule 404. <em>See, e.g., State v. Richardson, </em>138 N.H. 162, 164-65 (1993) (analyzing defendant\u2019s intertwined statements and behavior shortly preceding charged events under Rule 404(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>\u201cThe purpose of Rule 404(b) in a criminal trial is to ensure that the defendant is tried on the merits of the crime as charged and to prevent a conviction based on evidence of other crimes or wrongs.\u201d <em>McGlew, </em>139 N.H. at 509 (quotations omitted). \u201cThe concern that a defendant might be convicted because of his character is the gravamen of Rule 404(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in order for evidence to be admissible under Rule 404(b), it \u201cmust be relevant for a purpose other than proving the defendant\u2019s character or disposition; there must be clear proof that the defendant committed the act; and the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by its prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 507. Here, the defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s decision under all three prongs of the Rule 404(b) analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u201cTo meet the relevancy requirement, the other bad acts evidence must have some direct bearing on an issue actually in dispute, and there must be a clear connection between the particular evidentiary purpose, as articulated to the trial court, and the other bad acts.\u201d <em>State v. Kirsch, </em>139 N.H. 647, 654 (1995) (quotations, citations, and brackets omitted). To admit evidence over a defendant\u2019s Rule 404(b) objection, \u201cthe State is required to state the specific purpose for which the evidence is offered and articulate the precise chain of reasoning by which the offered evidence will tend to prove or disprove an issue actually in dispute, without relying upon forbidden inferences of predisposition, character, or propensity.\u201d <em>State v. Glodgett, </em>144 N.H. 687, 690 (2000) (quotations and ellipsis omitted). \u201cThe trial court then must articulate for the record the theory upon which the evidence is admitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690-91 (quotations omitted). \u201cWhether the court adopts the State\u2019s theory, a variation, or an alternative, the court must explain precisely how the evidence relates to the disputed issue, without invoking propensity.\u201d <em>McGlew, </em>139 N.H. at 510. Here, the State offered the evidence as proof of the defendant\u2019s motive and intent, and to counter his asserted justification defense. The trial court, however, admitted the defendant\u2019s statements and \u201cfacts that demonstrate\u201d the defendant\u2019s controlling behavior in order for the jury \u201cto understand the context in which this case is set.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u201cRule 404(b) does not specifically provide for the admissibility of other acts evidence to prove context, but it does allow such evidence to be admitted for any purpose other than to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.\u201d <em>State v. Melcher, </em>140 N.H. 823, 829 (1996) (quotations omitted). \u201cWe have indicated that context may be among these other purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[t]o be relevant, this evidence must still have some direct bearing on an issue actually in dispute, apart from its tendency to show propensity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>have previously held that the context of a relationship may be relevant if the State establishes an acceptable non-propensity purpose under Rule 404(b). <em>E.g., State v. Beltran, </em>153 N.H. 643, 648-49 (2006) (evidence of the defendant\u2019s abuse of his girlfriend, a prosecution witness, held admissible to explain her participation in criminal conduct, her delay in reporting, and her initial false statements to police); <em>State v. Roberts, </em>136 N.H. 731, 747 (1993) (in witness tampering prosecution, testimony of defendant\u2019s prior sexual relationship with witness involving exchange of drugs and money for sex was relevant to defendant\u2019s belief that the witness would testify in the underlying prostitution and drug conspiracy cases); <em>State v. Simonds, </em>135 N.H. 203, 207 (1991) (evidence of defendant\u2019s prior indictments for sexually assaulting the victim admissible as probative of his specific intent to touch her for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification rather than innocently); <em>State v. Gruber, </em>132 N.H. 83, 89 (1989) (in an insurance fraud case, evidence of defendant\u2019s relationship with the woman who \u201cstole\u201d his property admissible to show that he intended to deceive the insurance company).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Here, the defendant objected both before and at trial to admission of the evidence on the basis that it reflected only his propensity to commit the charged crimes. Before ruling that the evidence was relevant to establish the \u201ccontext\u201d of the case, the trial court asked defense counsel, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me why all this [evidence of the defendant\u2019s controlling behavior] is not relevant in a domestic \u2014 what appears to be a domestic violence case.\u201d The trial court also stated, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not propensity if it fits in the crime.\u201d The trial court then allowed admission of evidence of the defendant\u2019s controlling behavior, including the text messages and testimony that the complainant \u201ccould not talk to males, that she could not wear makeup, that [the defendant] called her names,\u201d and that he said he had control over her life \u2014 not, as the State had argued, for the purpose of establishing the defendant\u2019s motive and intent, but for the broader purpose of providing \u201ccontext.\u201d Because the court admitted the evidence for a broader purpose than the State had proposed, without limitation, the jury was apparently free to consider the evidence for any purpose \u2014 including propensity. \u201cThe purpose for giving... a limiting instruction is to explain the proper purpose or purposes for which the evidence may be used and thereby minimize the danger that the jury will draw impermissible inferences from the evidence of the defendant\u2019s other crimes.\u201d <em>State v. Hickey, </em>129 N.H. 53, 61 (1986); <em>see also State v. Smith, </em>125 N.H. 522, 526 (1984) (\u201cThe trial court, when giving <em>limiting </em>instructions, must take care that the instructions do indeed strive to limit the jury\u2019s consideration to the <em>narrow </em>purpose or purposes for which the evidence is being admitted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>The defendant argued to the trial court, in support of his motions <em>in limine, </em>that to permit such unlimited use of the evidence would allow the State to \u201ccouch[] these prior bad acts ... in the language and the buzz words typically used to describe domestic violence and the cycle of violence.\u201d Indeed, because the trial court allowed the \u201ccontext\u201d evidence without limitation, the State at trial seized the opportunity to portray the dynamic between the defendant and the complainant as that of a controlling perpetrator and controlled victim, and to characterize the defendant as \u201can abuser.\u201d \u201cContext, in this instance, [became] merely a synonym for propensity.\u201d <em>Melcher, </em>140 N.H. at 830 (quotation omitted); <em>see also Glodgett, </em>144 N.H. at 694; <em>State v. Bassett, </em>139 N.H. 493, 501-02 (1995). \u201cWhen, in this manner, an assumption based upon the defendant\u2019s propensity toward certain .action is the essential connection in the inferential chain supporting relevance, the evidence is inadmissible under Rule 404(b).\u201d <em>Glodgett, </em>144 N.H. at 695 (quotation omitted). The admission of the evidence was therefore erroneous because it was not limited to a non-propensity purpose. Since we reach this result on the relevance prong of the analysis, we do not address the two remaining prongs of the Rule 404(b) inquiry, <em>see, e.g., id. </em>at 690, or any Rule 403 analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Nor can we look to the State\u2019s proffered justifications as valid alternative grounds to support the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>See State v. Nightingale, </em>160 N.H. 569, 575-76 (2010). Because the trial court\u2019s ruling, that the evidence was relevant to \u201ccontext,\u201d allowed admission of a broader scope of evidence than would have been permissible for the narrower purpose of establishing motive or intent, we cannot parse the record after the fact to determine what items of evidence could have been admissible under the State\u2019s proffered purposes. Thus, by our decision today, we make no ruling on the potential admissibility of the text messages or other evidence of the defendant\u2019s controlling behavior upon retrial. Individually evaluated items of evidence may be admissible for non-propensity purposes \u201csuch as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\"> The admission of improper character evidence is inherently prejudicial. <em>See, e.g., Glodgett, </em>144 N.H. at 695; <em>Hickey, </em>129 N.H. at 61-62. Further, the State has neither asserted nor established that such error was harmless. <em>See State v. Marti, </em>140 N.H. 692, 695 (1996) (\u201cThe burden is on the State to prove harmless error, and this burden is met only if we can conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence did not affect the verdict.\u201d (quotations omitted)). Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant has established that the trial court\u2019s error was \u201cclearly untenable or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>McGlew, </em>139 N.H. at 507. The three simple assault convictions are therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In light of our reversal of the simple assault convictions, any error by the trial court concerning the jury instructions on those charges is moot. However, because the defendant\u2019s contention that he was entitled to a jury instruction on the use of force in defense of property may arise on remand, we consider it. <em>Cf., e.g., State v. White, </em>155 N.H. 119, 128 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u201cThe purpose of the trial court\u2019s charge is to state and explain to the jury, in clear and intelligible language, the rules of law applicable to the case.\u201d <em>State v. Hernandez, </em>159 N.H. 394, 400 (2009). \u201cWhen reviewing jury instructions, we evaluate allegations of error by interpreting the disputed instructions in their entirety, as a reasonable juror would have understood them, and in light of all the evidence in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe determine whether the jury instructions adequately and accurately explain each element of the offense and reverse only if the instructions did not fairly cover the issues of law in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhether a particular jury instruction is necessary, and the scope and wording of jury instructions, are within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we review the trial court\u2019s decisions on these matters for an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo show that the trial court\u2019s decision is not sustainable, the defendant must demonstrate that the court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Prior to trial, the defendant filed a notice of defense indicating that he would potentially rely upon RSA 627:8 (2007), the statute defining the justification of use of force in property offenses. At trial, the defendant requested a jury instruction on the defense of property based upon the complainant\u2019s having taken his car keys. The trial court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">I\u2019m satisfied that in raising the defense of justification in this case in defense of property, there has to be sufficient evidence from which the jury could make such a determination, certainly, some evidence from which a jury could consider the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">The question here is whether or not the defendant was facing a situation in which he observed or reasonably could have believed that there was an unlawful taking of his property. An unlawful taking, <em>essentially a theft, as defined by statute, </em>requires a person to deprive of the property permanently, or I think in the language of the statute, for such duration and time that reduces the economic value of the property in substance. And I don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s any evidence to support such a finding; and therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>it would be error for me to include a defensive justification to whatever charges that they may have relevance \u2014 certainly of the assaults, potentially of criminal defending [sic], although I have serious doubts about that. In any event, I decline to give that instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">(Emphasis added.) On appeal, the defendant argues that he was entitled to an instruction on defense of property, and that the trial court\u2019s ruling prejudiced his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">We consider only the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision \u2014 that the use of force in defense of property is justified only in cases of theft. \u201cThe interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we decide <em>de novo\u2019.\u2019 State v. McKeown, </em>159 N.H. 434, 435 (2009). In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole. <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>157 N.H. 421, 422 (2008). We construe the Criminal Code \u201caccording to the fair import of [its] terms and to promote justice.\u201d RSA 625:3 (2007). In doing so, we must first look to the plain language of the statute to determine legislative intent. <em>State v. Formella, </em>158 N.H. 114, 116 (2008). \u2018We can neither ignore the plain language of the legislation nor add words which the lawmakers did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>155 N.H. 590, 591 (2007) (quotation omitted). \u201cIf a statute is ambiguous, however, we consider legislative history to aid our analysis.\u201d <em>State v. Lamy, </em>158 N.H. 511, 515 (2009). \u201cOur goal is to apply statutes in light of the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting them, and in light of the policy sought to be advanced by the entire statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">RSA 627:8 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">A person is justified in using force upon another when and to the extent that he reasonably believes it necessary to prevent what is or reasonably appears to be an unlawful taking of his property, or criminal mischief, or to retake his property immediately following its taking; but he may use deadly force under such circumstances only in defense of a person as prescribed in RSA 627:4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">The plain language of the statute does not limit the use of force in defense of property to instances of \u201ctheft.\u201d Assuming that the complainant\u2019s undisputed actions in exerting control over the defendant\u2019s car keys did not constitute a theft, <em>but see </em>RSA 637:3,1 (2007) (\u201cA person commits theft if he obtains or exercises unauthorized control over the property of another with a purpose to deprive him thereof.\u201d), RSA 627:8 does not require that the taker act with any particular intent in order for the actor\u2019s use of force to be justified. The statute permits the use of force in response to what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number><em>\u201creasonably appears to be </em>an unlawful taking.\u201d RSA 627:8 (emphasis added). A taking may be unlawful without constituting a theft. <em>See, e.g., Rinden v. Hicks, </em>119 N.H. 811, 813 (1979) (\u201cAn action for conversion is based on the defendant\u2019s exercise of dominion or control over goods which is inconsistent with the rights of the person entitled to immediate possession.\u201d). The plain language of the statute thus supports the conclusion that the use of force is justified to defend against unlawful takings regardless of the intent of the taker. <em>See Appeal of Astro Spectacular, </em>138 N.H. 298, 300 (1994) (\u201cThe legislative intent is to be found not in what the legislature might have said, but rather in the meaning of what it did say.\u201d (quotation omitted)). The legislature\u2019s reference in RSA 627:8 to the crime of criminal mischief, <em>see </em>RSA 634:2 (2007) (amended 2009,2010), demonstrates that the legislature could have specifically limited \u201cunlawful taking\u201d to the crime of theft, if it were so inclined. <em>See City of Manchester v. Sec\u2019y of State, </em>161 N.H. 127, 133 (2010) (\u201cThe force of the maxim <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>is strengthened where a thing is provided in one part of the statute and omitted in another.\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">To the extent that there is any ambiguity in the term \u201cunlawful taking\u201d suggesting a requirement of theft, such is laid to rest by the Report of the Commission to Recommend Codification of Criminal Laws (Report). <em>See </em>Report \u00a7 572:8 cmts. at 26-27 (1969). In drafting the statute justifying the use of force in defense of property, the Commission explained, \u201cThe problem of the person in possession faced with a demand for the property based on a claim of right is also dealt with here by justifying the use of force against <em>any </em>taking that appears to be unlawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26. The Commission distinguished its draft from Michigan\u2019s draft statute, which was written \u201cin terms of preventing \u2018theft\u2019 which would seem to require the person in possession to stand aside when another seeks the property under a claim of right if the possessor knows that such a claim precludes criminal theft liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By contrast, the Commission\u2019s draft was consistent with <em>State v. Richardson, </em>38 N.H. 208 (1859), which held that the owner of property could not use force against a sheriff seeking to attach the property because the sheriff, whom the possessor knew to be \u201c \u2018duly appointed and authorized to serve the writ,\u2019 \u201d Report at 26 (quoting <em>Richardson, </em>38 N.H. at 208), did not engage in acts that would \u201creasonably appear to be an unlawful taking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Commission\u2019s report also explained that \u201cthe use of force that is justifiable to prevent an unlawful taking is also justifiable to accomplish an immediate recapture of the property,\u201d aligning itself with <em>State v. Elliot, </em>11 N.H. 540 (1841). Report at 27. In that case, we upheld the use of reasonable force to \u201crecapture\u201d property taken under a claim of right, where the possessor had to pursue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>the taker a short distance to forcefully retrieve his property. <em>Elliot, </em>11 N.H. at 544. The Commission\u2019s report thus explicitly illustrates the legislative intent behind RSA 627:8: the justified use of force in defense of property is not limited to instances of theft, but applies to any instance of what would \u201creasonably appear to be an unlawful taking,\u201d regardless of the taker\u2019s intent. Report at 26-27. We therefore conclude that the trial court erred in refusing to give the defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction on the basis of insufficient evidence that the complainant had committed a theft. We make no ruling on any other consideration affecting the defendant\u2019s entitlement to such a jury instruction upon retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b495-6\">Dalianis, C.J., and HICKS and LYNN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
