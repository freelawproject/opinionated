We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">These facts appear in the record. In August and September of 2010, the surety issued two bonds, on the defendant\u2019s behalf, for $5,000 and $6,000, respectively. The bonds guaranteed the defendant\u2019s appearance on November 8, 2010. Approximately one month before the defendant\u2019s scheduled appearance, he was arrested in Vermont and held in custody by the Vermont Department of Corrections pending trial there for offenses allegedly committed after the New Hampshire bonds were issued. The surety\u2019s representative then moved to revoke the defendant\u2019s bail. The trial court did not rule on this motion, however, until the defendant\u2019s ongoing incarceration prevented him from appearing as scheduled. At that point, it forfeited bail over the defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>The surety moved to vacate the forfeiture order and, when its motion was denied, filed two motions to reconsider, both of which were also denied. Although the trial court arguably erred when it delayed ruling upon the surety\u2019s motion to revoke bail until after the defendant\u2019s default, this issue is not before us. The only issues before us arise out of the trial court\u2019s order forfeiting the bonds and its denial of the surety\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Under the terms of most criminal bail bonds, the obligation of the surety is to produce the accused whenever necessary in the prosecution of the charges which have been made against him, or at any stage of the proceedings. <em>State v. Moccia, </em>120 N.H. 298, 301 (1980). If the defendant fails to appear, then under RSA 597:31 (2001), the bond \u201cshall be declared forfeited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">RSA 597:30 (2001), however, allows a surety to avoid forfeiture in certain circumstances. It provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">When the sureties in a recognizance, without their fault, are prevented from surrendering their principal by an act of God or of the government of the state or of the United States, or by sentence of law, the superior court, on petition and notice thereof to the county commissioners and state\u2019s counsel, may discharge them on such terms as may be deemed just.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">RSA 597:30.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">As an initial matter, the parties do not dispute that, notwithstanding the statute\u2019s language, it applies to the district courts as well as the superior court. We, therefore, assume without deciding that the district court can discharge a surety under the terms provided in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">To invoke RSA 597:30, \u201csureties must... ma[k]e it appear, not only that they were prevented from surrendering [the defendant] without their fault, but also that they were prevented by the act of God, or the government of the United States or of this state, or by sentence of law.\u201d <em>Lamphire v. State, </em>73 N.H. 463, 464 (1906) (interpreting a substantially identical prior version of the statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">Here, the surety does not contend that the defendant\u2019s incarceration in Vermont is an act of God, the United States, the state of New Hampshire, or a sentence of law. Rather, it argues that construing the statute to permit a discharge only under the listed circumstances \u201cconflict[s] with the clear import of the statute, which is to excuse the surety when surrendering the defendant is impossible based on an act of government authority.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>We interpret statutes in the context of the overall statutory scheme, not in isolation. <em>State v. McDonald, </em>163 N.H. 115, 126 (2011). We first look to the language of the statute, and construe it according to the common and approved usage of the language unless from the statute it appears that a different meaning was intended. <em>Id. </em>We will neither consider what the legislature might have said nor add language that it did not see fit to include. <em>Id. </em>We review the trial court\u2019s interpretation of a statute <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">In this case, the statute\u2019s plain language limits the defenses for sureties to those listed, each of which \u201cwould be a good defence at common law.\u201d <em>Lamphire, </em>73 N.H. at 464. The statute, thus, \u201cprovide[s] a convenient method of determining [sureties\u2019] liability\u201d by codifying common law defenses, but \u201cdoes not . . . introduce a new ground for releasing . . . sureties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At common law, acts of another state\u2019s government failed to excuse the surety\u2019s obligation to produce a defendant. <em>See Taylor v. Taintor, </em>83 U.S. 366, 371 (1872) (\u201cIf, after the [bond] is executed, the [defendant] is imprisoned in another State for violation of a criminal law of that State, it will not avail to protect him or his sureties.\u201d). Although some jurisdictions have supplanted this rule by statute or otherwise, many still deny a surety relief under such circumstances. <em>See </em>8A Am. JUR. 2d <em>Bail and Recognizance </em>\u00a7 169, at 483 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Thus, because the statute applies only in the enumerated situations, we cannot construe it to excuse the surety when another state\u2019s government prevents the defendant\u2019s appearance. To do so would \u201cintroduce a new ground for releasing... sureties\u201d that was unavailable at common law, and add language to the statute that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>Lamphire, </em>73 N.H. at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">We also reject the surety\u2019s argument that the trial court'treated the bonds as performance rather than appearance bonds. Although the court noted that the defendant\u2019s failure to appear resulted from his decision to travel to Vermont and commit crimes, the court\u2019s order makes clear that it forfeited the bonds because the defendant failed to appear, not because of his criminal activity. The bonds guaranteed the defendant\u2019s appearance, so this forfeiture was entirely appropriate. <em>See </em>RSA 597:31.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Finally, the trial court sustainably exercised its discretion when it declined to hold an evidentiary hearing. We will not disturb an order denying a request for an evidentiary hearing unless a party establishes that it was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of the party\u2019s case. <em>State v. Korean Methodist Church of N.H., </em>157 N.H. 254, 257 (2008). Here, the surety has failed to establish prejudice because, whatever a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>hearing might have revealed, the defendant\u2019s incarceration in Vermont would nonetheless fall outside the circumstances under which RSA 597:30 permits discharging a surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b608-6\">Hicks, Conboy and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
