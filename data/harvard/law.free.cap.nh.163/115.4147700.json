On appeal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>defendant argues that the Trial Court (Nicolosi, J.) erred by permitting the State to present certain lay opinion testimony, declining to give the defendant\u2019s requested self-defense jury instruction, and prohibiting the defense from referring to the aggravated felonious sexual assault statute in its closing argument. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The record supports or the jury could have found the following facts. The victim, Richard Wilcox, owned a three-bedroom home in Danville. Wilcox lived in the house, but rented out the two spare bedrooms. He also worked full time in Burlington, Massachusetts, and owned a 2008 Toyota Tacoma truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">In March 2008, McDonald moved into Wilcox\u2019s home and began renting one of the spare bedrooms. The other bedroom was occupied until late May, when the tenant renting it moved out. Shortly before McDonald moved in, he had only $220.05 in his checking account. By the end of May, his checking account had a deficit of $7.21. At trial, McDonald\u2019s ex-wife testified that he had lived in several places and frequently changed jobs. She also testified that since their divorce in 2000, McDonald never seemed to have any money.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">McDonald owned a Harley Davidson Ironhead motorcycle, but was interested in purchasing a Harley Davidson Shovelhead. He frequently inquired about purchasing a Shovelhead from Dan Glidden, the owner of a motorcycle repair shop. Glidden was reluctant to part with the motorcycle, and quoted a price of $6,500. According to Glidden, this price was well above what the motorcycle was worth. McDonald attempted to pay the $6,500 with a credit card, but Glidden declined because the card was not in McDonald\u2019s name. Glidden later informed McDonald that Dan Eighmey, the owner of a car sales and repair business, also owned a Shovelhead.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Eighmey testified that in mid-to-late May 2008, a man who identified himself as Richard Wilcox, but who was actually Paul McDonald, came to his dealership and inquired about purchasing the Shovelhead. Eighmey also testified that McDonald, posing as Wilcox, was enthusiastic about the motorcycle, and called and visited the dealership several times over the next few weeks to negotiate a purchase. Early during these negotiations, McDonald gave Eighmey the title to Wilcox\u2019s 2008 Tacoma. Eighmey testified that McDonald agreed to give him the 2008 Tacoma in exchange for the Shovelhead, a 1994 Tacoma, and $4,200. McDonald, however, repeatedly made excuses, and postponed completion of the transaction for several weeks. Around June 9, Eighmey told McDonald to complete the deal or else Eighmey would put the motorcycle up for sale again. McDonald again requested more time, and agreed to take $1,000 less if Eighmey would hold the motorcycle for another week. Eighmey agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>On June 12, McDonald, still posing as Wilcox, completed the transaction. He arrived at Eighmey\u2019s dealership a little after 8:00 a.m. and traded Wilcox\u2019s 2008 Tacoma for the 1994 Tacoma, the Shovelhead motorcycle, and $3,200. McDonald then went to the motorcycle repair shop and asked Glidden\u2019s son, David, to fix the motorcycle that week. David testified that when McDonald arrived, he had something wrapped around his bleeding hand. Some time after leaving the repair shop, McDonald drove to Vermont.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">On June 13, in response to a call from Wilcox\u2019s employer, Danville Police Sergeant Ryan Furman drove to Wilcox\u2019s home to check on his well-being. Finding the front door ajar, Furman entered the premises. Inside, he saw that the living room was orderly and noticed a plate of food on the kitchen counter. He then noticed a hole in the wall next to the counter and proceeded down the hallway. Furman found blood on the ceiling, floor, and walls of the hallway bathroom. He called for assistance. After another officer arrived, the two of them found pools of blood in one of the bedrooms and a towel soaked in blood. Eventually, they found bloody marks on the basement stairs, and blood that led to the corner of the basement, where they discovered the body of Richard Wilcox.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">On June 17, McDonald registered the 1994 Tacoma in his brother\u2019s name in Vermont. The next day, the police learned that he was staying with friends in Castleton, Vermont. New Hampshire State Police Sergeants Mark Armaganian and Scott Gilbert went there and McDonald agreed to speak with them at the Vermont Police barracks. Once there, Gilbert and Armaganian read McDonald his <em>Miranda </em>rights, <em>see Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), and he waived them. Gilbert and Armaganian then questioned him about Wilcox\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">At first, McDonald claimed that he had been gone and did not know anything about Wilcox\u2019s death. A short while later, he admitted that he killed Wilcox, but claimed he only attacked Wilcox because he \u201csnapped\u201d when he woke up with his pants around his ankles and felt Wilcox\u2019s mouth on his penis. He told the police that after he killed Wilcox, he panicked, attempted to clean up the blood, and left. He admitted to posing as Wilcox when negotiating the sale with Eighmey, but claimed that the murder was completely unrelated to the plan to steal Wilcox\u2019s truck, and described his plan to steal the truck as just a \u201cstupid\u201d idea. At trial, McDonald admitted to causing Wilcox\u2019s death. The only issue for the jury was whether he did so in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Before trial, the defendant moved to exclude certain opinion testimony from Gilbert and Armaganian regarding the police interrogation. The defendant argued that the officers\u2019 \u201cinterpretations and observations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>[his] demeanor and body language are inadmissible opinion evidence . . . [that] comment on the credibility of a witness.\u201d After a hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, ruling that testimony describing the defendant\u2019s body language and demeanor was admissible, as was opinion testimony regarding whether the defendant\u2019s emotional reactions appeared genuine.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">At trial, only Gilbert testified about the interrogation. During direct examination, the State asked Gilbert to \u201cexplain . . . what [he] observed during the course of the interview.\u201d Gilbert responded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">I observed how quickly he was able to turn his emotion on and off. He was succinct and clear to the point on certain questions, and then completely stammering nonsensical to other certain questions. He was able to turn his emotion on and off quickly and easily.... [H]is demeanor was ... his emotion to me seemed very feigned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">A few moments later, the State inquired of Gilbert</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">Q: All right. Did you make any observations about his body language throughout the interview?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">A: I thought everything was overly \u2014 his body motions \u2014 emotions were overly dramatic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">Q. Okay. Can you explain what you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">A: Well, if... I asked him a certain question and he says well, no, it would be a very flamboyant no, and he\u2019d \u2014 goodness, no. And it\u2019s very over exaggerated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-13\">Q: Okay. And since this is being recorded, you kind of raised your eyes and made a, sort of, exaggerated expression on your face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-14\">A: Yeah. There was a lot of, you know, a lot of eye rolling and the hands that go \u2014 I \u2014 how could you think that? No. That kind of reaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">The State then distributed a transcript of the interrogation and played a portion of the audio recording of the interview for the jury. The State later played the remainder of the recording for the jury. After playing the second portion of the audio recording, the State asked Gilbert to testify about the defendant\u2019s facial expression after Gilbert asked him whether the theft of the truck and the killing of Richard Wilcox were related. Gilbert explained, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>\u201c[T]here was a very, I thought, over exaggerated, shook [sic], his eyes bugged out like shock, like oh, my goodness. I never thought of that. How could you possibly think that type of expression.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred by allowing the State to present opinion testimony from Sergeant Gilbert about the genuineness of his body language and demeanor during the police interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The admissibility of evidence is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. White, </em>155 N.H. 119, 123 (2007). We will not reverse the trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>State v. Lopez, </em>156 N.H. 416, 420 (2007). In determining whether a ruling is a proper exercise of judicial discretion, we consider whether the record establishes an objective basis sufficient to sustain the discretionary decision made. <em>State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">A witness need not qualify as an expert to give testimony in the form of an opinion. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 701. The trial court may permit lay opinion testimony as long as the witness\u2019s opinion is \u201crationally based on the perception of the witness\u201d and helpful to the trier of fact. N.H. R. Ev. 701. However, it is the province and obligation of the jury to determine the credibility of witnesses. <em>State v. Reynolds, </em>136 N.H. 325, 328-29 (1992). Therefore, while witnesses may give lay opinion testimony on a variety of topics, they are not permitted to give lay opinion testimony regarding the credibility of a witness. <em>Id. </em>Such testimony invades the province of the jury. <em>Id. </em>This prohibition applies with equal force to testimony about a criminal defendant who does not testify as a witness at trial. <em>See State v. Stott, </em>149 N.H. 170, 173 (2003) (analyzing whether police officer\u2019s testimony about the police interrogation amounted to impermissible lay opinion on the defendant\u2019s credibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">The parties do not dispute that lay opinion testimony about the defendant\u2019s credibility would be inadmissible. Rather, they disagree about whether Gilbert\u2019s testimony actually constitutes an opinion about the defendant\u2019s credibility. The defendant argues that Gilbert\u2019s testimony, such as his statements that the defendant\u2019s \u201cemotion ... seemed very feigned\u201d and that the defendant\u2019s emotions were \u201coverly dramatic\u201d and \u201cover-exaggerated,\u201d is no different from testimony that the defendant seemed to be lying. The State, on the other hand, contends that Gilbert\u2019s testimony expressed only permissible lay opinions about the defendant\u2019s body language and demeanor, and did not express any opinion about the defendant\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Witnesses, including law enforcement officers, have been permitted to testify about their opinion on topics such as smell, <em>State v. Brooks, </em>126 N.H. 618, 621-22 (1985) (officer permitted to testify that a jacket smelled of kerosene), appearance, <em>State v. McCue, </em>134 N.H. 94, 107 (1991) (officer permitted to \u201copine\u201d that impressions at crime scene were \u201cdrag marks\u201d), and sound, <em>Heath v. Joyce, </em>114 N.H. 620, 622 (1974) (lay witness permitted to testify that a noise sounded \u201clike an engine running at fairly high speed\u201d). In limited circumstances, it is also permissible for a witness to characterize the defendant\u2019s demeanor. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 701; <em>see also Caudill v. Com., </em>120 S.W.3d 635, 663 (Ky. 2004) (permitting lay opinion testimony that the defendant was \u201claughing and using a mocking tone of voice\u201d); <em>State v. Stojetz, </em>705 N.E.2d 329, 340 (Ohio 1999) (permitting lay opinion testimony that the witness appeared \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cnot able to think\u201d). However, the \u201cState may not present evidence to preempt the jury\u2019s often difficult job of deciding which [parties and] witnesses are truthful and what evidence is trustworthy.\u201d <em>State v. Huard, </em>138 N.H. 256, 259 (1994). Accordingly, a witness may not characterize the defendant\u2019s demeanor when the characterization is tantamount to a comment on the defendant\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Undoubtedly, it would have been permissible in this ease for Gilbert to simply describe, without characterizing, the details of the defendant\u2019s actions to the jury. <em>See Stott, </em>149 N.H. at 173 (permitting testimony that \u201camounted] to nothing more than a detailed factual narration of [the police officer\u2019s] interview with the defendant\u201d); <em>State v. Kulas, </em>145 N.H. 246, 248-49 (2000) (finding that the witness\u2019s testimony was not an opinion on the victim\u2019s credibility where the testimony related solely to the facts of a discussion with the victim, and the steps taken after that discussion). For example, Gilbert could have testified, as he did, about \u201chow quickly [the defendant] was able to turn his emotion on and off\u2019 and that the defendant did \u201ca lot of . . . eye rolling\u201d and allowed the jury to determine the significance of those actions. <em>See State v. Griffin, </em>No.#C-020084, 2003 WL 21414664, at *8-9 (Ohio Ct. App. June 20, 2003) (permitting testimony that the defendant \u201cbegan to cry and sob, but there were no tears\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">However, Gilbert went further. He characterized the defendant\u2019s emotions as \u201cfeigned,\u201d and described the defendant\u2019s body language as over-exaggerated and overly dramatic. This testimony was a comment on the genuineness of the defendant\u2019s physical reactions, and was tantamount to a comment on the defendant\u2019s credibility. By characterizing the defendant\u2019s emotions and body language this way, Gilbert implied that he did not believe the defendant. In other words, Gilbert effectively testified that, in his opinion, the defendant\u2019s demeanor demonstrated that he was not being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>truthful. Allowing this testimony was an invasion of the province and obligation of the jury to determine credibility. <em>Huard, </em>138 N.H. at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The State argues that, if anything, Gilbert\u2019s testimony merely amounted to a comment on the credibility of the defendant\u2019s demeanor, which is permissible because \u201cthere is a distinction between comments on the credibility of a person\u2019s physical and emotional reactions while making statements and comments on the credibility of the statements themselves.\u201d The State reasons that because a person can feign or exaggerate body language even while telling the truth, commenting on the genuineness of that body language is not improper. The State\u2019s argument seems to rely upon the assumption that only a direct statement about the credibility of the defendant is impermissible. However, the prohibition on opinion testimony applies both to testimony that comments on credibility explicitly, as well as testimony that comments on credibility indirectly. <em>See State v. Viranond, </em>212 P.3d 1252, 1256 (Or. 2009) (explaining that a witness cannot make statements that are \u201ctantamount\u201d to a comment on credibility). Although Gilbert did not explicitly state that he believed the defendant\u2019s statements were false, his testimony communicated to the jury his doubts about the defendant\u2019s overall credibility. This testimony should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The State argues that even if the trial court erred in admitting the testimony, the error was harmless. The State bears the burden of proving that an error is harmless. <em>State v. Pseudae, </em>154 N.H. 196, 202 (2006). An error is harmless only if it is determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the verdict was not affected by the error. <em>Id. </em>An error may be harmless if the alternative evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is of an overwhelming nature, quantity or weight and if the inadmissible evidence is merely cumulative or inconsequential in relation to the strength of the State\u2019s evidence of guilt. <em>Id. </em>In determining whether an error was harmless, we consider the alternative evidence presented at trial as well as the character of the inadmissible evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">For the jury to convict the defendant of first-degree murder, the State had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant purposely caused Wilcox\u2019s death. <em>See </em>RSA 630:l-a, 1(a). At trial, the alternative evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. The State presented evidence of a motive for the murder: testimony from Eighmey that for weeks, the defendant posed as the victim and negotiated a sale of the victim\u2019s brand new Toyota Tacoma. Further, the defendant admitted to the police that he took the title to the Tacoma from the victim\u2019s office and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>gave it to Eighmey. The State also presented evidence of consciousness of guilt: the defendant attempted to conceal the death by hiding the victim\u2019s body in the basement, fleeing to Vermont and assuming his brother\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">After the defendant was apprehended in Vermont, he admitted to killing the victim. Although the defendant claimed that the homicide was unrelated to the plan to steal the Tacoma, and his defense was that he killed the victim in self-defense, the State presented extensive evidence to the contrary. For example,- the defendant alleged that the sexual assault occurred in the living room and that when he awoke to find his penis in the victim\u2019s mouth, a struggle ensued. However, the State presented evidence, including photographs and the testimony of a forensic crime scene expert, that there was no bloodshed or struggle in the living room and that the victim was probably face down when most of the wounds were inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Not only was the alternative evidence of guilt extensive, but the inadmissible evidence in this case was merely cumulative. Although Gilbert should not have been permitted to testify that the defendant\u2019s reactions were feigned and overdramatic, the entire audio recording of the interrogation was played for the jury. <em>See Fitzgerald v. Sargent, </em>117 N.H. 104, 107 (1977) (finding that improper admission of hearsay evidence was harmless error where the hearsay declarant testified at trial). Regardless of how Gilbert characterized the defendant\u2019s emotional responses at trial, the jury could assess the defendant\u2019s demeanor from the tape. Although with only an audio recording, the jury could not observe the defendant\u2019s physical behavior, they could evaluate his inflection and tone of voice, the volume and speed at which he spoke, and any hesitation in answering questions. Further, even if the inadmissible evidence had been excluded, the jury still would have had before it the admissible portions of Gilbert\u2019s testimony, including his statements that the defendant \u201cwas able to turn his emotion on and off\u2019 and that he did \u201ca lot of. . . eye rolling.\u201d <em>See Kulas, </em>145 N.H. at 248-49. We find, therefore, that any error the trial court made in admitting Gilbert\u2019s opinion testimony into evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">At trial, the defendant sought a jury instruction on self-defense. The self-defense statute, RSA 627:4,11(c), provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is justified in using deadly force upon another person when he reasonably believes that such other person . . . [i]s committing or about to commit kidnapping or a forcible sex offense ...\u201d RSA 627:4, 11(c) (2007). The defendant requested an instruction that explained the requirements of the statute, but omitted the words \u201cforcible sex offense.\u201d The defendant\u2019s proposed instruction stated: \u201cA person had the right to use deadly force on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>another person to defend himself if... [h]e actually believed that the other person was committing or about to commit the crime of aggravated sexual assault by performing fellatio on him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The State did not dispute that a self-defense instruction was required, but requested language different from that proposed by the defendant. The State\u2019s proposed instruction read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">A person is justified in using deadly force upon another person if he reasonably believed that the other person was committing or about to commit a forcible sex offense against him. It is not enough to constitute self-defense if the defendant merely believed that a non-consensual sexual act was about to be performed on him. In order for the defendant to be justified in using deadly force, he must reasonably believe that he is or was about to be the target of a non-consensual sexual act committed with actual force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The trial court decided to give an instruction that neither party proposed, but that included the phrase \u201cforcible sex offense.\u201d The court explained, \u201c[0]ur statute is clear. The language is not difficult for the jury to understand.\u201d The court declined to eliminate the statutory term \u201cforcible\u201d from its instruction because \u201c[fjorcible means something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The parties then gave closing arguments. In closing, the defendant argued before the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-9\">When someone is having sex with you, sexual penetration while you\u2019re sleeping, that is force. To put it bluntly, we all know that any uninvited sexual penetration, such as a mouth on a penis while sleeping, is forcible rape. And to support that, there are over 15 different ways somebody can be convicted of aggravated felonious sexual assault. That\u2019s the highest, most serious offense for rape. When an actor overcomes the victim through actual \u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">The State then objected to defense counsel reading only the section of the aggravated felonious sexual assault (AFSA) statute that describes AFSA by concealment or surprise. The court ruled that the self-defense statute \u201crelies on a finding that the aggressor was committing a forcible sex offense, which [does not] equate[] with the provision of AFSA, concealment or surprise\u201d and sustained the State\u2019s objection. In its instructions to the jury, the trial court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-11\">A person is justified in using deadly force upon another person if he reasonably believes that the other person is committing or about to commit a forcible sex offense against him. Even if the defendant actually believed that a forcible sex offense is being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>committed or is about to be committed, his belief must be reasonable. In other words, there must be reasonable grounds for the defendant to believe Mr. Wilcox was committing or about to commit a forcible sex offense against him when the deadly force was used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial court erred by denying his requested jury instruction and by prohibiting him from referring to the statute in his closing argument. The defendant argues that the phrase \u201cforcible sex offense,\u201d as used in the self-defense statute, must be read to encompass RSA 632-A:2, I(i), the provision regarding AFSA by concealment or surprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The trial court is not required to \u201cuse the specific language requested by the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>157 N.H. 404, 407 (2008). Rather, \u201cthe purpose of the trial court\u2019s charge is to state and explain to the jury, in clear and intelligible language, the rules of law applicable to the case.\u201d <em>State v. Littlefield, </em>152 N.H. 331, 333-34 (2005) (quotation and brackets omitted). Whether a particular jury instruction is necessary, and the scope and wording of that instruction, are within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Johnson, </em>157 N.H. at 407. When reviewing jury instructions, we determine whether they adequately and accurately explained the law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The jury instruction at issue raises a question of statutory interpretation, which we review <em>de novo. Kenison v. Dubois, </em>152 N.H. 448, 451 (2005). We interpret statutes in the context of the overall statutory scheme, not in isolation. <em>Appeal of Union Tel. Co., </em>160 N.H. 309, 317 (2010). We first look to the language of the statute, <em>Kenison, </em>152 N.H. at 451, and construe it \u201caccording to the common and approved usage of the language unless from the statute it appears that a different meaning was intended.\u201d <em>N.H. Resident Ltd. Partners of Lyme Timber v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Revenue Admin., </em>162 N.H. 98, 101 (2011) (quotation omitted). We will not consider \u201cwhat the legislature might have said nor add language that the legislature did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>State v. Lamy, </em>158 N.H. 511, 515 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The defendant argues that the phrase \u201cforcible sex offense do[es] not evoke a single, plain meaning\u201d and urges us to look beyond the language of the self-defense statute. In support of his position, the defendant contends that in light of the extensive reform to rape law in the last fifty years, and the focus in New Hampshire on the violent nature of AFSA, the term \u201cforcible sex offense\u201d must be read to include all variants of AFSA. In other words, the defendant asks us to replace the term \u201cforcible sex offense\u201d in the self-defense statute with the term \u201caggravated felonious sexual assault.\u201d However, the defendant\u2019s argument ignores the statutory scheme of the self-defense statute, and instead relies upon the legislative history and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>policies behind the AFSA statute. In contrast, the State argues that the term \u201cforcible sex offense\u201d must be construed in the context of the overall scheme of the self-defense statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">We agree with the State. <em>See Appeal of Union Tel. Co., </em>160 N.H. at 317. The self-defense statute permits a person to use force, sometimes deadly and sometimes non-deadly, in defending himself from various harms. RSA 627:4 (Supp. 2010). Deadly force is permitted in self-defense against \u201c[a person who] is committing or about to commit... a forcible sex offense.\u201d RSA 627:4,11(c) (2007). In construing the self-defense statute in the past, we have explained that deadly force is to be \u201cused only when, and to the extent, \u2018necessary\u2019 \u201d and \u201cshould not be excessive in relation to the harm threatened.\u201d <em>State v. Warren, </em>147 N.H. 567, 569 (2002); <em>see State v. Etienne, </em>163 N.H. 57, 75 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The legislature could have permitted the use of deadly force against any \u201caggravated felonious sexual assault\u201d by using that term in the self-defense statute. Indeed, the legislature has used the specific phrase \u201caggravated felonious sexual assault\u201d in other statutes. For example, in RSA chapter 135-E, the chapter regarding the involuntary civil commitment of sexually violent predators, the legislature specifically explained that the term \u201csexually violent offense\u201d includes aggravated felonious sexual assault. RSA 135-E:2, XI (Supp. 2010). In RSA chapter 193-D, the statute on safe school zones, the legislature similarly defined the phrase \u201c[a]ct of theft, destruction, or violence\u201d to include \u201c[a]ny ... aggravated felonious sexual assault under RSA 632-A.\u201d RSA 193-D:1, 1(c) (2007). However, in the self-defense statute, the legislature used the term \u201cforcible sex offense\u201d instead. The legislature has thrice amended the self-defense statute since the enactment of the AFSA statute, <em>see </em>Laws 1981, 347:1, :2 (effective Aug. 16, 1981); Laws 2010, 361:1 (effective Jan. 1, 2011); Laws 2011, 268:1 (effective Nov. 13,2011), yet did not replace the term \u201cforcible sex offense\u201d with the term \u201caggravated felonious sexual assault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">To construe the term \u201cforcible sex offense\u201d to mean any AFSA, as the defendant asks us to, would render the word \u201cforcible\u201d as used in the self-defense statute meaningless, and would require us to insert language the legislature did not see fit to include. It would also lead to the illogical result that a person could use deadly force to defend against any non-consensual sex act, but in all other circumstances, could only use deadly force to the extent necessary, and proportionate with, the harm threatened. <em>See Warren, </em>147 N.H. at 569. Such a result is contrary to the rest of the statutory scheme and we decline to adopt such an unreasonable interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>tation. <em>Petition of Poulicakos, </em>160 N.H. 438, 444 (2010) (\u201c[a]s between a reasonable and unreasonable meaning of the language used, the reasonable meaning is to be adopted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">We agree with the trial court that the term \u201cforcible\u201d means something. However, in light of the plain language of the statute and the overall statutory scheme, we need not set forth a technical meaning for the term \u201cforcible.\u201d <em>See State v. Dominguez, </em>128 N.H. 288, 289 (1986) (\u201cthe judge has no duty to explain non-technical terms or phrases that are readily comprehended\u201d). In RSA 627:9, the legislature specifically defined the terms \u201cdeadly force\u201d and \u201cnon-deadly force.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 627:9, II, IV (2007). It could have given the term \u201cforcible sex offense\u201d a technical legal definition, but chose not to. We assume the legislature intended the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cforcible\u201d to apply. <em>See N.H. Resident Ltd. Partners of Lyme Timber, </em>162 N.H. at 101; <em>Tovar v. State, </em>165 S.W.3d 785, 790 (Tex. App. Ct. 2005) (\u2018Words that are not statutorily defined are to be given their common, ordinary, or usual meaning.\u201d). The defendant concedes that the term \u201cforcible\u201d is commonly understood to mean \u201ceffected by force used against opposition or resistance: obtained by compulsion or violence.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 888 (unabridged ed. 2002). He points out, however, that the noun \u201cforce\u201d has a number of definitions. Despite these multiple definitions, the ordinary meaning of the word is unambiguous because each definition has in common the use of some amount of \u201cstrength\u201d or \u201cpower.\u201d <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>130 S. Ct. 1265, 1270 (2010) (finding that although the word force \u201chas a number of meanings,\u201d its \u201cordinary meaning refers to the application of strength [and] power\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The trial court is not required to define commonly understood terms to the jury. <em>Dominguez, </em>128 N.H. at 289; <em>see also State v. Hoffer, </em>383 N.W.2d 543, 548-49 (Iowa 1986) (holding that jury instructions need not define terms unless they have a technical legal meaning as distinguished from their ordinary meaning). In this case, the trial court properly explained the law of self-defense and used the exact language of the statute. The trial court was not required to further define the term \u201cforcible sex offense\u201d because the phrase has a commonly understood ordinary meaning, rather than a technical legal meaning. <em>Dominguez, </em>128 N.H. at 289; <em>see also People v. Powell, </em>716 P.2d 1096, 1100 (Colo. 1986) (\u201cWhere ... a jury properly is instructed that force is an element of the crime ..., there is no reason to require a further instruction on the commonly-used word \u2018force.\u2019 \u201d). We hold that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>For the reasons discussed above, we also find that the trial court did not err by prohibiting the defense from referring to the aggravated felonious sexual assault statute in its closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-5\">Dalianis, C.J., and Hicks, Conboy and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
