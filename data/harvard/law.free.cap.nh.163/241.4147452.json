We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">The trial court found or the record supports the following facts. Lachlan MacLearn and his wife, Wendy MacLearn, were married in 2004, and reside together. In 2006, Mrs. MacLearn purchased a 2006 Toyota Prius, which she insured through a GEICO insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">On October 16, 2008, Mr. MacLearn was driving the Prius when he was involved in a motor vehicle accident, seriously injuring Hutchings. At the time of the accident, Mr. MacLearn owned a 2000 Audi A6 that was insured under a policy (the policy) with Commerce. The policy declarations listed Mr. MacLearn as the named insured and listed only the Audi A6 as the insured\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">Hutchings sued Mr. MacLearn seeking damages for his injuries. Mr. MacLearn made demand upon Commerce for defense and indemnification. Commerce denied the claim, stating that coverage was barred by Exclusion B.2. That exclusion, as amended by an endorsement to conform the policy to RSA 259:61 (Supp. 2011), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-14\">B. We do not provide Liability Coverage for the ownership, maintenance or use of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-16\">2. Any vehicle, other than \u201cyour covered auto\u201d, which is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A53\">a. Owned by you; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>b. Furnished for your regular use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The denial letter noted that the policy defined \u201cYour covered auto\u201d to mean \u201cAny vehicle shown in the Declarations\u201d or a \u201cnewly acquired auto.\u201d It also noted the specific meanings of \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour,\u201d which the policy define as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">A. Throughout this policy, \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d refer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">1. The \u201cnamed insured\u201d shown in the Declarations; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">2. The spouse if a resident of the same household.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">The letter then stated that \u201c[n]o coverage exists for the 2006 Toyota Prius based on the policy language referenced above since Commerce Insurance does not provide liability coverage for a vehicle, other than \u2018your covered auto\u2019 which is owned by you or your spouse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">Mr. MacLearn filed a petition for declaratory judgment seeking a declaration that Commerce was obligated to defend and indemnify him. Hutchings intervened in the proceedings and Mr. MacLearn assigned his rights and interests in the declaratory judgment action to him. Both Hutchings and Commerce moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">The trial court granted Commerce\u2019s motion and denied Hutchings\u2019, finding that Exclusion B.2 barred coverage. The court rejected Hutchings\u2019 argument that coverage was provided by an exception to Exclusion B.3 and found it unnecessary to address Commerce\u2019s alternative argument that Mr. MacLearn was not entitled to coverage because he misrepresented his marital status on his insurance application. The appellants then filed a motion for reconsideration, which the trial court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">On appeal, the appellants contend that the trial court erred in denying Hutchings\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granting Commerce\u2019s motion. They argue that coverage is not barred by Exclusion B.2 because Mr. MacLearn does not own the Prius and Mrs. MacLearn \u201cis not seeking coverage for her use of the Prius\u201d (bolding omitted). They alternatively argue: (1) if the policy language is found to be ambiguous it should be construed against Commerce; and (2) if coverage is barred by Exclusion B.2, it is nevertheless provided under an exception to Exclusion B.3. Finally, they assert that Mr. MacLearn did not make material misrepresentations in procuring insurance from Commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts in its summary judgment ruling.\u201d <em>Brickley v. Progressive N. Ins. Co., </em>160 N.H. 625, 627 (2010) (quotation omitted). \u2018We consider all of the evidence presented in the record, and all inferences properly drawn therefrom, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, then we will affirm the grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Resolution of this case requires us to interpret exclusions in the policy, which \u201cis ultimately an issue for this court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cWe construe the language of an insurance policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based upon a more than casual reading of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Colony Ins. Co. v. Dover Indoor Climbing Gym, </em>158 N.H. 628, 630 (2009). \u201cAlthough an insurer has a right to contractually limit the extent of its liability, it must do so through clear and unambiguous policy language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u201cFor exclusionary language to be considered clear and unambiguous, two parties cannot reasonably disagree about its meaning.\u201d <em>Miller v. Amica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>156 N.H. 117, 120 (2007). \u201cIf more than one reasonable interpretation is possible, and an interpretation provides coverage, the policy contains an ambiguity and will be construed against the insurer.\u201d <em>Brickley, </em>160 N.H. at 627 (quotation omitted). \u2018Where the terms of a policy are clear and unambiguous, we accord the language its natural and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Concord Hosp. v. N.H. Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Assoc., </em>137 N.H. 680, 683 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">We first address the appellants\u2019 argument that Exclusion B.2 does not bar coverage. They argue that \u201cthe language \u2018you\u2019 and \u2018your\u2019 as defined in the policy is unambiguous and means either the named insured exclusively <em>or </em>a resident spouse exclusively.\u201d They cite, as the \u201c[t]he primary case in support of this position,\u201d <em>Barclay v. State Auto Ins. Companies, </em>816 N.E.2d 973 (Ind. Ct. App. 2004), asserting that it stands for the proposition that when the defined terms \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d refer to one spouse, they cannot simultaneously refer to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The appellants then substitute their meaning of the terms \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d into Exclusion B.2 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">B. We do not provide Liability Coverage for the ownership, maintenance or use of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">2. Any vehicle, other than \u201cyour [Mr. MacLearn\u2019s] covered auto\u201d <em>[i.e., </em>the Audi A6], which is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">a. Owned by you [Mr. MacLearn]; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-12\">b. Furnished for your [Mr. MacLearn\u2019s] regular use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">Because the Prius is not owned or regularly used by Mr. MacLearn, the appellants argue, coverage is not barred by Exclusion B.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>We disagree. As an initial matter, \u201cyour covered auto\u201d is a defined term. We are not persuaded to accept the appellants\u2019 premise that the word \u201cyour\u201d within that defined term requires further definition. The appellants have cited no case to support that construction and we note that the \u201cprimary case\u201d upon which they rely made no such substitution in an identically-worded exclusion. <em>See Barclay, </em>816 N.E.2d at 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Furthermore, to the extent <em>Barclay </em>could be read to support the appellants\u2019 interpretation of the policy, we decline to follow it. Rather, we conclude that the correct interpretation of the policy language at issue is that reached by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Hacker v. Dickman, </em>661 N.E.2d 1005 (Ohio 1996): \u201c[I]n defining \u2018you,\u2019 the policy specifically uses the words \u2018Throughout this policy \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d refer to ...,\u2019 which allows for the reading of the alternatives that follow as being just that, alternatives. If either alternative is applicable, the exclusion must be applied.\u201d <em>Hacker, </em>661 N.E.2d at 1007. We agree with the <em>Hacker </em>court that this is \u201c[t]he only reasonable interpretation of the exclusion language with the policy\u2019s definition of \u2018you\u2019, \u201d <em>id., </em>and we therefore find that language unambiguous. We also note that this construction advances the policy behind such exclusions, which are designed to \u201cprevent the insured from purchasing an insurance contract to cover the risk of operating one vehicle, and obtaining coverage on another vehicle that is regularly used in the household.\u201d <em>Sheldon v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>189 P.3d 695, 699 (N.M. Ct. App. 2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Application of this construction here, by inserting the operative alternative definition, results in exclusion under both B.2.a and B.2.b, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">B. We do not provide Liability Coverage for the ownership, maintenance or use of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">2. Any vehicle, other than \u201cyour covered auto\u201d [the Audi A6], which is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">a. Owned by you [Mrs. MacLearn]; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">b. Furnished for your [Mrs. MacLearn\u2019s] regular use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s findings that coverage is barred on both grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">We note that numerous courts have interpreted the B.2 exclusion to bar coverage for an insured\u2019s use of a noncovered auto owned by his or her resident spouse. <em>See, e.g., Hillman v. Grace, </em>498 So. 2d 1108, 1110 (La. Ct. App. 1986); <em>Sheldon, </em>189 P.3d at 698-99; <em>Sunshine Ins. Co. v. Sprung, </em>452 N.W.2d 782, 784 (S.D. 1990). We now join these courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>The appellants contend, however, that even if Exclusion B.2 bars coverage, an exception to Exclusion B.3 nevertheless provides it. Exclusion B.3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-3\">B. We do not provide Liability Coverage for the ownership, maintenance or use of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\">3. Any vehicle, other than \u201cyour covered auto\u201d, which is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">a. Owned by any \u201cfamily member\u201d, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">b. Furnished for the regular use of any \u201cfamily member.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">However, this Exclusion (B.3) does not apply to you while you are maintaining or \u201coccupying\u201d any vehicle which is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">a. Owned by a \u201cfamily member\u201d; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">b. Furnished for the regular use of a \u201cfamily member.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">The policy defines \u201c \u2018Family member\u2019 \u201d to \u201cmean[] a person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household. This includes a ward or foster child.\u201d It further defines \u201c \u2018Occupying\u2019 \u201d to \u201cmean[] in, upon, getting in, on, out or off.\u201d The appellants contend that because Mrs. MacLearn is a \u201cfamily member,\u201d Mr. MacLearn is covered while \u201coccupying\u201d Mrs. MacLearn\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">We note a lack of agreement among other jurisdictions as to whether a resident spouse meeting the definition of \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d in a policy can also be a \u201cfamily member.\u201d <em>Compare Barclay, </em>816 N.E.2d at 977 (where wife is \u201cyou,\u201d husband is a \u201cfamily member\u201d and vice versa), <em>with Hillman, </em>498 So. 2d at 1110 (\u201c[P]ersons who fall within the definition of \u2018you\u2019 are not included among the persons who fall within the definition of \u2018family member\u2019.\u201d), <em>and Sunshine Ins. Co., </em>452 N.W.2d at 785 (same). We need not decide this issue, however, because it makes no difference whether or not the exception to Exclusion B.3 applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">The exception relied upon, by its terms, addressed only whether Exclusion (B.3) applies. Here, Commerce did not deny coverage under Exclusion B.3. Rather it determined that coverage is barred by Exclusion B.2, a conclusion with which both we and the trial court have concurred. Whether or not the exception prevents Exclusion B.3 from also barring coverage is of no consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">In light of our conclusion that the unambiguous language of Exclusion B.2 bars coverage, we need not address either the appellants\u2019 argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>that the policy\u2019s ambiguity must be construed against Commerce or their contention that Mr. MacLearn made no misrepresentation in his application for insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b267-6\">Dalianis, C.J., and CONBOY and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
