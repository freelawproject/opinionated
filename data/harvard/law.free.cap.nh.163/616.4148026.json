We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">The record supports the following undisputed facts. In 2006, the defendant was convicted of conspiracy to possess a controlled drug with intent to sell, for which he received a sentence of one to five years at the New Hampshire State Prison, stand committed. On April 25, 2007, he was paroled to a drug counseling halfway house.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">On July 8,2007, the defendant was arrested on a parole violation warrant for various parole violations unrelated to the instant charges. At the time of his arrest, he was also a suspect in a June 24 burglary at the A-l Gas Station in Goffstown. That same day or shortly thereafter, he was formally arrested on charges arising out of the burglary and he was unable to post bail. On July 25, a second parole violation warrant was issued in relation to the burglary charges. On July 27, the defendant waived his right to a preliminary parole violation hearing pending resolution of the burglary charges. Following his July 8 arrest, the defendant was initially housed at the Hillsborough County House of Corrections; however, at some point, he was transferred to the New Hampshire State Prison as a result of the parole violation warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">For reasons that are unnecessary to recount here, the burglary charges were not adjudicated until September 9, 2010. The parties agree that, at this point, the defendant had been incarcerated for 1,154 days. On June 25, 2009, he filed a motion seeking pretrial confinement credit toward any sentence on the burglary charges for the entire period of his incarceration following his arrest on July 8,2007. The defendant argued that since he had not yet had a parole revocation hearing, his parole had not been revoked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>and, thus, the entire period of his incarceration constituted pretrial confinement on the burglary charges rather than any other sentence of confinement. <em>See </em>RSA 651-A:23. The State objected, and the trial court held a hearing on September 8, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">At the hearing, the executive assistant to the adult parole board testified that, while the defendant has been incarcerated, he \u201chas been credited all along . . . day for day. . . . He\u2019s continued to serve the maximum of [his underlying] sentence.\u201d He explained that the parole board \u201c[u]sually\u201d gives a parole violator credit against his original underlying sentence for time spent incarcerated \u201cfrom the date of arrest\u201d on a parole violation warrant until his parole revocation. However, he further indicated that, were a defendant to receive pretrial confinement credit on a new charge, \u201c[m]ost of the time\u201d the parole board takes the \u201cposition that [it] would be double dipping\u201d to give the defendant the same credit on his underlying charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, ruling that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">the prison is giving [the defendant] credit on the sentence on which ... the parole warrant was issued, and ... [he is] receiving credit towards that. . . maximum sentence for each day that he spends at the New Hampshire State Prison, so that he is already receiving credit, as [RSA 651-A:19] provides, and . . . any additional credit would, in essence, be double credit, which the New Hampshire Supreme Court has said is inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">That same day, the defendant pleaded guilty to the charges in this case as part of a plea agreement. Under the plea agreement, the defendant was sentenced on each charge to three and a half to seven years, stand committed, with all but six months of the minimum sentence suspended. The sentences run concurrent with one another but consecutive to any \u201cparole setback.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">The defendant argues that the trial court improperly relied upon RSA 651-A:19 (2007) (amended 2010, 2011) and erred in denying him 1,154 days of pretrial confinement credit toward his burglary sentences pursuant to RSA 651-A:23. The defendant \u201cdoes not argue that he is entitled to apply the 1,154-day credit toward both the sentence on the underlying charge and the burglary sentence.\u201d Rather, he contends that \u201c[t]he mandate of RSA 651-A:23 is clear\u201d that \u201c[s]o long as a criminal defendant is incarcerated prior to sentencing and not under a sentence of confinement, the sentencing court must grant credit for the confinement.\u201d He maintains that here, he \u201cwas not under a sentence of confinement because his parole had not been revoked and he had not been recommitted to the prison\u201d; thus, \u201cat the time of his September 9, 2010 sentencing on the burglary indictments, he was entitled as a matter of law to the award of that time toward that sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>We review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretation <em>de novo. Gentry v. Warden, N. N.H. Correctional Facility, </em>163 N.H. 280, 282 (2012). We are the final arbiters of legislative intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>\u2018We construe provisions of the Criminal Code according to the fair import of their terms and to promote justice.\u201d <em>State v. Burke, </em>162 N.H. 459, 461 (2011) (quotation omitted); RSA 625:3 (2007). When interpreting a statute, we first look to the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe the language according to its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Gentry, </em>163 N.H. at 282 . We do not read words or phrases in isolation, but in the context of the entire statutory scheme. <em>Id. </em>When the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we do not look beyond it for further indications of legislative intent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The allocation of pretrial confinement credit is governed by RSA 651:3 (2007) and RSA 651-A:23. <em>See State v. Mwangi, </em>161 N.H. 699, 702 (2011). RSA 651:3, I, provides in pertinent part: \u201cAll the time actually spent in custody prior to the time [the defendant] is sentenced shall be credited in the manner set forth in RSA 651-A:23 against the maximum term of imprisonment that is imposed and against any minimum term authorized by RSA 651:2 or 6.\u201d RSA 651-A:23 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">Any prisoner who is confined to the state prison, any house of correction, any jail or any other place shall be granted credit against both the maximum and minimum terms of his sentence equal to the number of days during which the prisoner was confined in jail awaiting and during trial prior to the imposition of sentence and not under any sentence of confinement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">We have said that credit statutes stem principally from the recognition that presentence detention is often the result of indigency. <em>State v. Edson, </em>153 N.H. 45, 49 (2005). A principle underlying the credit statutes is that an indigent offender unable to furnish bail should serve neither more nor less time in confinement than an otherwise identically situated offender who succeeds in furnishing bail. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">We construe our credit statutes to mandate that a prisoner is to receive credit for all jail time \u2014 neither more nor less \u2014 served before sentencing which relates to the criminal episode for which the prisoner is sentenced, but does not receive credit greater than the number of days of his presentencing confinement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-9\"><em>State v. Decker, </em>127 N.H. 468, 471 (1985) (quotation omitted) (holding that, where the defendant was held on several charges prior to trial, he was not entitled to pretrial confinement credit toward <em>each </em>of the three consecutive sentences imposed). While it is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to allocate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>pretrial confinement credit, <em>Mwangi, </em>161 N.H. at 702, the trial court\u2019s allocation must reflect an application of the credit statutes that ensures the equal treatment of those confined prior to trial due to indigency, and those who are able to post bail, <em>Edson, </em>153 N.H. at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Here, there is no dispute that, following his arrest, the defendant remained incarcerated, at least in part, as a result of the parole violation warrants. Indeed, there is no evidence that, had the defendant been able to post bail, he would not have remained incarcerated on the parole violation warrants. Even on appeal, the defendant acknowledges that he was detained on the parole violation warrants. Certainly, had the defendant been incarcerated solely as a result of his inability to post bail on the burglary charges, he would have been entitled to pretrial confinement credit for time spent awaiting resolution of those charges. <em>See </em>RSA 651-A:23; <em>Edson, </em>153 N.H. at 49. In this case, however, the defendant was also incarcerated as a result of the parole violation warrants. Thus, his incarceration was not exclusively related to the criminal episode for which he was sentenced. <em>Cf. Edson, </em>153 N.H. at 49 (pretrial confinement credit statutes mandate that a prisoner receive credit for all jail time \u201cserved before sentencing which relates to the criminal episode for which the prisoner is sentenced\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court was not mandated to grant pretrial confinement credit in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The defendant argues that it was improper for the trial court to rely upon RSA 651-A:19 in denying him pretrial confinement credit. Although he acknowledges that \u201c[ajfter being convicted of the burglary charges, [his] parole would have been revoked by operation of law, thereby obviating the right to a revocation hearing,\u201d he maintains that because his \u201cburglary sentencing took place before his parole revocation . . . the triggering condition had not yet occurred.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Under the parole statutes, once a parolee is arrested he is entitled to a preliminary hearing, <em>see </em>RSA 504-A:5 (2010), and then a revocation hearing before the parole board, RSA 651-A:17 (Supp. 2011); <em>Mwangi, </em>161 N.H. at 702. The parole board shall revoke parole for a parolee who is convicted of a felony. RSA 651-A:18,11(a) (2007); <em>Mwangi, </em>161 N.H. at 702, 705. Once parole is revoked, the parolee \u201cshall be recommitted to the custody of the commissioner of corrections,\u201d RSA 651-A:17, and \u201c[t]he time between the return of the parolee to prison after his arrest and revocation of parole shall be considered as time served as a portion of the maximum sentence.\u201d RSA 651-A-.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">In this case, the defendant pleaded guilty to the burglary charges and the judge accepted and entered his plea, thereby convicting him of those charges. <em>See </em>BLACK\u2019S Law DICTIONARY 384 (9th ed. 2009) (defining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>\u201cconviction\u201d in relevant part as \u201c[t]he act or process of judicially finding someone guilty of a crime; the state of having been proved guilty\u201d). It follows that parole revocation became mandatory. <em>See </em>RSA 651-A:18,11(a); <em>cf. Mwangi, </em>161 N.H. at 705 (\u201cA jury found [the defendant] guilty of felony robbery beyond a reasonable doubt and the law required revocation of his parole based solely upon that conviction.\u201d). Consequently, under RSA 651-A:19, the time between the defendant\u2019s return to prison after his arrest on the parole violation warrant and his conviction on the burglary charges, which effectively constituted revocation of his parole, \u201cshall be considered as time served as a portion of the maximum sentence.\u201d RSA 651-A:19; <em>cf. Gentry, </em>163 N.H. at 282 (finding that in \u201caddressing how to apply credit for time served post-arrest/pre-revocation, . . . the legislature intended this credit to be applied solely to reduce the maximum sentence and not to reduce the recommitment period\u201d). Although the court denied the defendant\u2019s request for pretrial confinement credit prior to his guilty plea and sentencing, under the circumstances, we see no problem with its conclusion that the time spent incarcerated before sentencing on the burglary charge would be allocated to the defendant\u2019s underlying sentence pursuant to RSA 651-A:19 and not as pretrial confinement on the burglary charges under RSA 651-A:23.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Other jurisdictions that have addressed this issue have come to similar conclusions. <em>See Ali v. District of Columbia, </em>612 A.2d 228, 230 (D.C. 1992) (finding that \u201cif the parole violation warrant was validly executed while appellant was being held for the new offense, he would not be entitled to receive credit in the new case for time spent after the warrant was executed\u201d because that time would be credited to the sentence for which he was on parole); <em>State v. Blondin, </em>665 A.2d 587, 592 (Vt. 1995) (holding that \u201cwhen a defendant is incarcerated based on conduct that leads both to revocation of probation or parole and to conviction on new charges, the time spent in jail before the second sentence is imposed should be credited toward only the first sentence if the second sentence is imposed consecutively\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Finally, the defendant argues that \u201cthe court\u2019s reliance on RSA 651-A:19 produces the untenable rule that a criminal defendant who at the time of sentencing is detained by dint of both bail and parole violation warrant is never entitled to pretrial confinement credit.\u201d We disagree. Like the defendant in this case, such defendants will in all likelihood receive credit for the time served against their maximum sentences for which they were on parole. Thus, \u201cin neither case is the time served awaiting a subsequent conviction not credited.\u201d <em>People v. Johnson, </em>769 N.W.2d 905, 910 (Mich. Ct. App. 2009) (finding that defendant who committed new offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>while on parole was not entitled to pretrial confinement credit on those offenses for time served awaiting trial because the time served was credited against his prior conviction for which parole was revoked). In addition, we note that although RSA 651-A:23 does not <em>require </em>a sentencing court to award pretrial confinement credit in circumstances where the defendant also is being held in custody for a parole violation, nothing in the statute <em>prohibits </em>the court from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Moreover, we note that the defendant had a statutory right to a parole revocation hearing within forty-five days of his arrest on the parole violation warrant, <em>see </em>RSA 651-A:17. However, he waived that right and chose to wait for the burglary charges to be resolved before having a hearing before the parole board on the parole violation charges. Had the defendant chosen to have a parole revocation hearing within forty-five days, he may have received a punishment for violating parole that he could have served pending resolution of the burglary charges. Any remaining time spent incarcerated before resolving the burglary charges would then have been allotted as pretrial confinement credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b642-7\">Dalianis, C.J., and Conboy and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
