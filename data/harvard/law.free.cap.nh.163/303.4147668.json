On appeal, he argues that the Trial Court <em>(Tucker, </em>J.) erred in denying his motion to suppress inculpatory statements he made to an informant. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">On January 2, 2007, Aaron Kar was shot to death while standing with friends outside an apartment building in Manchester. The Manchester police suspected that the defendant was involved and questioned him about the incident on several occasions shortly after the shooting. During the following year, the police continued to investigate the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">Between October 1 and November 8,2007, an undercover officer with the New Hampshire Drug Task Force purchased crack cocaine from the defendant six times as part of an ongoing investigation into the defendant\u2019s drug trafficking. However, the defendant was not arrested or charged with these crimes at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">Subsequently, on November 24, a sergeant with the Manchester Police Department received information from the informant, an inmate at the Hillsborough County House of Corrections, that he knew something about the January 2 shooting. Over the next few weeks, members of the Manchester Police Department met with the informant to discuss what he knew. The informant offered, in exchange for leniency on his pending charges, to provide the police with information about who shot Kar and the person who provided the murder weapon. The informant then provided the police with specific details about the shooting, including that he knew the defendant and that the defendant had claimed to be the person who shot Kar.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>On February 4, 2008, the informant met with police and prosecutors to discuss recording a conversation between himself and the defendant. The police planned for this conversation to occur at the Hillsborough County House of Corrections after the defendant\u2019s arrest on drug charges. During this meeting, the police suggested ways in which the informant could get the defendant to talk about the murder. They also specifically told the informant not to talk to the defendant about the drug charges for which he was to be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">On February 7, 2008, the defendant was arrested for the sale of controlled drugs and detained at the Hillsborough County House of Corrections. He was arraigned the next day and counsel was appointed for him on February 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">On February 11, an assistant attorney general authorized a one-party intercept to make an audio recording of a conversation between the informant and the defendant that day. <em>See </em>RSA 570-A:2,11(d) (2001). While the authorization stated that there was \u201creasonable suspicion that evidence of the crime of drug sales and/or homicide w[ould] be derived from this interception,\u201d the assistant attorney general later testified that the language referring to the crime of drug sales was \u201ca typo\u201d and the authorization \u201cwas intended to only be issued for the homicide.\u201d She further stated that she \u201cwas very clear\u201d that during the conversation the informant was \u201cnot to go near the drug sales for which the [defendant was . . . incarcerated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">After obtaining the authorization, the police arranged to have the informant and the defendant placed in the same cell. They met with the informant once more and reiterated the instruction that he not discuss the defendant\u2019s drug charges. Upon being placed in the cell together, the defendant and the informant began conversing. Notwithstanding the explicit instructions to the contrary, the informant began discussing the defendant\u2019s drug charges and intermittently discussed them throughout the conversation. As the conversation continued, the defendant made statements implicating himself in Ear\u2019s murder, including admitting that he was the shooter. On February 13, the Manchester Police Department obtained an arrest warrant for the defendant for the charge of first-degree murder; he was indicted on the murder and attempted first-degree assault charges on May 16, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress the recorded statements, arguing that any statements he made in response to the informant\u2019s questions about the drug charges were elicited in violation of his right to counsel on those charges. He contended that any statements made after this violation, including statements about the shooting, were the fruit of that violation and, therefore, must be suppressed as the \u201cfruit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>poisonous tree.\u201d He further argued that \u201c[t]he [S]tate\u2019s conduct in this case was fundamentally unfair and thus a violation of due process.\u201d (Bolding omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The State conceded that the defendant\u2019s right to counsel had attached with respect to the drug charges and, thus, any discussion between the informant and the defendant relating to the drug charges would be inadmissible at a trial on those charges. The State later represented that it would not introduce any portions of the conversation related to the drug charges at trial on the charges related to the shooting. The State maintained, however, that because the defendant\u2019s right to counsel had not yet attached on the charges related to the shooting, there had been no violation of his right to counsel on those charges and the statements related to the shooting were admissible. The State also argued that its actions did not constitute a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Following a hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The court found that the defendant\u2019s right to counsel had attached on the drug charges and, \u201c[a]s a result, [the informant\u2019s] inquiries constituted impermissible interrogation with respect to that case.\u201d Nevertheless, the court found that when the defendant spoke with the informant, he was not charged with any crime related to the shooting and, \u201csince the right to counsel is \u2018offense specific,\u2019 the right to counsel had not attached in connection with the murder charges.\u201d (Citation omitted.) The court further found that the defendant\u2019s statements to the informant were not involuntary and that \u201cthe investigative tactic used in this case did not violate the defendant\u2019s state or federal rights to due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\u201cWhen reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they lack support in the record or are clearly erroneous. Our review of the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions, however, is <em>de novo.\u201d State v. Matey, </em>153 N.H. 263, 268 (2006) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The defendant argues on appeal that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. He asserts that the informant\u2019s questions about his pending drug charges violated his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution, and that his statements about the shooting should have been excluded as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d He further argues that \u201c[a]llowing the State to intentionally violate the constitutional rights of an accused in order to elicit incriminating statements is fundamentally unfair and violates due process.\u201d We first address the defendant\u2019s claims under the State Constitution, <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231 (1983), and cite federal opinions for guidance only. <em>Id. </em>at 231-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>The Sixth Amendment provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d U.S. CONST, amend. VI; <em>McNeil v. Wisconsin, </em>501 U.S. 171, 175 (1991). The State counterpart of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">Every person held to answer in any crime or offense punishable by deprivation of liberty shall have the right to counsel at the expense of the state if need is shown; this right he is at liberty to waive, but only after the matter has been thoroughly explained by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">N.H. Const, pt. I, art 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">A criminal defendant\u2019s right to counsel under both the State and Federal Constitutions attaches when adversary proceedings have commenced through a formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment. <em>State v. Jeleniewski, </em>147 N.H. 462, 467-68 (2002); <em>Brewer v. Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 398 (1977). This right is designed to give a defendant the benefit of legal advice when making important decisions regarding his case. <em>Jeleniewski, </em>147 N.H. at 468; <em>United States v. Gouveia, </em>467 U.S. 180, 188-89 (1984) (recognizing \u201cthat the core purpose of the counsel guarantee is to assure aid at trial, when the accused is confronted with both the intricacies of the law and the advocacy of the public prosecutor\u201d (quotations and brackets omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Once the right has attached, the assistance of counsel is provided at critical stages of criminal proceedings in order to preserve a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, <em>Jeleniewski, </em>147 N.H. at 468; <em>Maine v. Moulton, </em>474 U.S. 159, 170 (1985), and absent a waiver of this right by a defendant, any knowing government interrogation of a defendant after attachment, without the presence of counsel, is improper, <em>see State v. Bruneau, </em>131 N.H. 104, 108 (1988); <em>Moulton, </em>474 U.S. at 176. This rule applies equally to direct and \u201cindirect and surreptitious interrogations as well as those conducted in the jailhouse\u201d through the use of informants. <em>United States v. Henry, </em>447 U.S. 264, 273 (1980) (quotation omitted); <em>see Bruneau, </em>131 N.H. at 108. Thus, \u201c[b]y intentionally creating a situation likely to induce [a defendant] to make incriminating statements without the assistance of counsel, the Government violate[s]\u201d a defendant\u2019s right to counsel. <em>Henry, </em>447 U.S. at 274. This is so \u201ceven where the government expressly instructs its informant not to initiate any conversations with the accused and not to question him regarding the pending charges.\u201d <em>United States v. Terzado-Madruga, </em>897 F.2d 1099, 1109 (11th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>The Supreme Court has made clear, however, that \u201cthe Sixth Amendment right [to counsel] is \u2018offense specific.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matey, </em>153 N.H. at 269 (quoting <em>Texas v. Cobb, </em>532 U.S. 162, 164 (2001)); <em>McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 175. While we have implicitly held that the right to counsel under Part I, Article 15 is also \u201coffense specific,\u201d <em>see Matey, </em>153 N.H. at 269-71, we now explicitly adopt, under our constitution, the \u201coffense specific\u201d nature of the right to counsel. This means that the right to counsel attaches only to offenses for which prosecution has commenced and \u201ccannot be invoked once for all future prosecutions.\u201d <em>McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 175. Thus, a \u201cdefendant\u2019s statements regarding offenses for which he [has] not been charged [are] admissible notwithstanding the attachment of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel on other charged offenses.\u201d <em>Matey, </em>153 N.H. at 270 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Nevertheless, there may be times when interrogation on uncharged offenses \u201cmight encroach on the defendant\u2019s rights concerning the pending charges.\u201d <em>Thompson v. State, </em>93 S.W.3d 16, 24 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001). This issue was recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Moulton. </em>There, the Court \u201cconsidered the constitutional implications of a surreptitious investigation that yielded evidence pertaining to two crimes. For one, the defendant had been indicted; for the other, he had not.\u201d <em>Moran v. Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 431 (1986) (discussing Moulton). The Court held that the defendant\u2019s right to counsel was violated by the admission of incriminating statements he made to his codefendant, who was acting as a government informant, concerning the crime for which he had been indicted, even though the police had recorded the meeting with the informant to gain information on a separate uncharged crime. <em>Moulton, </em>474 U.S. at 176-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\"> In so doing, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">The police have an interest in the thorough investigation of crimes for which formal charges have already been filed. They also have an interest in investigating new or additional crimes. Investigations of either type of crime may require surveillance of individuals already under indictment. Moreover, law enforcement officials investigating an individual suspected of committing one crime and formally charged with having committed another crime obviously seek to discover evidence useful at a trial of either crime. In seeking evidence pertaining to pending charges, however, the Government\u2019s investigative powers are limited by the Sixth Amendment rights of the accused. To allow the admission of evidence obtained from the accused in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights whenever the police assert an alternative, legitimate reason for their surveillance invites abuse by law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>enforcement personnel in the form of fabricated investigations and risks the evisceration of the Sixth Amendment right recognized in <em>[Massiah v. United States, </em>377 U.S. 201 (1964)]. On the other hand, to exclude evidence pertaining to charges as to which the Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached at the time the evidence was obtained, simply because other charges were pending at that time, would unnecessarily frustrate the public\u2019s interest in the investigation of criminal activities. Consequently, incriminating statements pertaining to pending charges are inadmissible at the trial of those charges, notwithstanding the fact that the police were also investigating other crimes, if, in obtaining this evidence, the State violated the Sixth Amendment by knowingly circumventing the accused\u2019s right to the assistance of counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-5\"><em>Moulton, </em>474 U.S. at 179-80. The court noted in a footnote that \u201c[i]ncriminating statements pertaining to other crimes, as to which the Sixth Amendment right has not yet attached, are, of course, admissible at a trial of those offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180 n.16. The Court reaffirmed this reasoning in <em>Moran </em>when it explained that <em>Moulton </em>\u201cmade clear . . . that the evidence concerning the crime for which the defendant had not been indicted \u2014 evidence obtained in precisely the same manner from the identical suspect \u2014 would be admissible at a trial limited to those charges.\u201d <em>Moran, </em>475 U.S. at 431; <em>see McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"AHd\">There is no dispute that the defendant\u2019s right to counsel had attached with respect to the drug charges and that this right was violated by the informant\u2019s questioning of the defendant about those charges. Indeed, the State concedes that \u201cduring any proceedings on the drug charges, the evidence that the informant elicited could not be used.\u201d However, because judicial proceedings had not yet commenced against the defendant with respect to the shooting, his right to counsel had not attached as to those charges. Accordingly, the informant\u2019s questioning of the defendant regarding the shooting did not violate his right to counsel and his statements as to the shooting were admissible at the trial on those charges. <em>See McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 176; <em>State v. Kilgus, </em>128 N.H. 577, 593-94 (1986) (finding no violation of the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel when informant elicited statements from the defendant about uncharged attempted murder even though defendant was already charged with witness tampering).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Nonetheless, the defendant maintains that \u201c[t]he statements about the shooting followed [the informant\u2019s] numerous references to the drug charges\u201d and, as a result, \u201conly occur[red] though [the] violation of [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>defendant\u2019s] right to counsel\u201d on those charges. Thus, he urges us to apply the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine and hold that his statements concerning the shooting should have been suppressed. In making this argument, he relies upon a number of cases. <em>See, e.g., Missouri v. Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600 (2004); <em>Fellers v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 519 (2004); <em>Nix v. Williams, </em>467 U.S. 431 (1984); <em>Henry, </em>447 U.S. 264; <em>Gilbert v. California, </em>388 U.S. 263 (1967); <em>Hoffa v. United States, </em>385 U.S. 293 (1966); <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471 (1963); <em>State v. Panarello, </em>157 N.H. 204 (2008); <em>State n Roache, </em>148 N.H. 45 (2002); <em>State v. Gravel, </em>135 N.H. 172 (1991); <em>State v. Baillargeon, </em>124 N.H. 355 (1983). None of these cases, however, stands for the proposition that statements regarding uncharged offenses, elicited at the same time as statements regarding charged offenses for which there was a violation of a defendant\u2019s right to counsel, constitute a \u201cfruit\u201d of that violation. And we decline to adopt such a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">This decision is consistent with \u201cthe general rule that remedies should be tailored to the injury suffered from the constitutional violation and should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests.\u201d <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>449 U.S. 361, 364 (1981). The Supreme Court\u2019s approach in addressing violations of the Sixth Amendment has \u201cbeen to identify and then neutralize the taint by tailoring relief appropriate in the circumstances to assure the defendant the effective assistance of counsel and a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365. Accordingly, the Court has looked to whether \u201cthe constitutional infringement identified has had or threatens some adverse effect upon the effectiveness of counsel\u2019s representation or has produced some other prejudice to the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAbsent such impact on the criminal proceeding, however, there is no basis for imposing a remedy in that proceeding, which can go forward with full recognition of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel and to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The defendant\u2019s right to counsel in this case was violated on the drug charges. The appropriate remedy for this constitutional violation was to exclude evidence obtained from this violation from trial on those charges. However, there was no violation with respect to the shooting charges. Accordingly, \u201c[t]here is no effect of a constitutional dimension which needs to be purged to make certain that [the defendant] has been effectively represented and not unfairly convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Citing <em>Gilbert, </em>the defendant argues that \u201c[t]he offense-specific rule does not affect application of the exclusionary rule: statements taken in violation of the right to counsel are not admissible in any case.\u201d The simple answer to this argument is that, as discussed above, there was no right-to-counsel violation with respect to the statements concerning the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The defendant argues that we should find the State Constitution more protective than the Federal Constitution under these circumstances. He maintains that the above-quoted provision of Part I, Article 15 is \u201cmore broadly-worded than the federal constitution\u201d and that we have \u201ctaken a more protective view of the right to counsel under the state constitution\u201d with respect to custodial interrogations and the right against self-incrimination. He further contends that we have implemented the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine \u201cin a more protective manner than the Supreme Court.\u201d We do not disagree. However, we have never construed the state constitutional right to counsel as arising earlier than the Sixth Amendment right to counsel; nor have we found that the use of an informant, in and of itself, violates our constitution. We decline to do either in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Finally, the defendant argues that \u201c[sjanctioning the State\u2019s actions here would permit a knowing violation of the law for the purpose of eliciting incriminating statements from a suspect,\u201d and that \u201c[s]uch a holding would not comport with due process.\u201d The New Hampshire Constitution guarantees every citizen due process of the law. <em>State v. Damiano, </em>124 N.H. 742, 746 (1984); N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 15. The standard for determining whether a law or procedure violates due process is whether it is fundamentally fair. <em>State v. Barnett, </em>147 N.H. 334, 336 (2001). Fundamental fairness requires that the government conduct conform to the community\u2019s sense of justice, decency and fair play. <em>State v. Mwangi, </em>161 N.H. 699, 703 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The defendant contends that, under the decision in this case, \u201cthe State . . . has every incentive to intentionally violate a suspect\u2019s right to counsel on one charge in order to elicit inculpatory statements about an uncharged crime\u201d and \u201cmay decide that foregoing use of a defendant\u2019s statements in violation of the right to counsel is a small price to pay in order to purchase the defendant\u2019s trust in an informant on a different charge.\u201d Undoubtedly, the informant\u2019s conduct in this case violated the defendant\u2019s right to counsel with respect to the drug charges. We do not find, however, that these facts demonstrate \u201cthe kind of misbehavior that so shocks the sensibilities of civilized society\u201d as to constitute a due process violation. <em>Moran, </em>475 U.S. at 433-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Moreover, the State\u2019s use of an informant does not constitute a <em>per se </em>constitutional violation. <em>See Hoffa, </em>385 U.S. at 311 (\u201cthe use of secret informers is not <em>per se </em>unconstitutional\u201d); <em>State v. Lewis, </em>129 N.H. 787, 798 (1987) (same). As we have previously stated, \u201cfundamental unfairness does not occur for purposes of the due process clause simply because a defendant places himself at a disadvantage under circumstances in which there are no substantive constitutional violations.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>129 N.H. at 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>As the Federal Constitution offers the defendant no greater protection than does our State Constitution under these circumstances, <em>see Matey, </em>153 N.H. at 271; <em>Barnett, </em>147 N.H. at 336; <em>McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 175; <em>Moran, </em>475 U.S. at 432-34, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b333-6\">DALIANIS, C.J., and CONBOY and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
