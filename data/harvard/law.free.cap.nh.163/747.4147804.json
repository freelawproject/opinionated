He argues that the trial court erred when it adopted an appraisal valuing his business at $1,274,000 for the purposes of the final distribution of property. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The trial court found, or the record supports, the following facts. After a twenty-three year marriage, the parties separated in February 2009 and divorced in February 2011. The petitioner, Carolyn P. Cottrell, DDS, was a practicing dentist until 1994 and, at the time of the divorce, worked as a clinical associate professor of dentistry at Tufts University. The respondent is also a dentist and operates a successful dental practice in Concord.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The divorce trial required the court to determine the fair market value of the respondent\u2019s dental practice. The company hired by the petitioner, Brayman, Houle, Keating, and Albright, PLLC, rendered a report opining that the fair market value was $1,274,000 as of December 31,2009. Anthony Albright testified in support of that report, which was based upon a formula that seeks to determine the present value of the business by estimating its ability to generate future earnings \u2014 the \u201ccapitalization of earnings\u201d approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">The respondent\u2019s expert, Dr. Stanley L. Pollock, estimated the business\u2019s value to be $156,000. To arrive at this figure, Pollock acknowledged at trial that he did not value the business based upon its transferable value because he knew that the respondent did not intend to sell the business. Thus, his estimate reflected only the business\u2019s net tangible asset value, including the value of the equipment and furniture used in the dental practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">The trial court adopted the petitioner\u2019s estimate. Among other reasons for doing so, the court was \u201cincredulous\u201d of the testimony that the business was worth only $156,000 because the respondent paid $410,000 for it in 1996 and it had generated substantial income for him ever since. The court also noted that Albright\u2019s appraisal disregarded the respondent\u2019s highest earning years (tending to lower the value) and, unlike Pollock\u2019s appraisal, accounted for the \u201csubstantial goodwill as a business entity.\u201d The respondent appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">RSA 458:16-a, I (2004) defines the property subject to division in a divorce as \u201call tangible and intangible property and assets, real or personal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>belonging to either or both parties, whether title to the property is held in the name of either or both parties.\u201d We have previously defined the fair market value of property as \u201cthe price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller when the former is not under any compulsion to buy and the latter is not under any compulsion to sell, both parties having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Watterworth &amp; Watterworth, </em>149 N.H. 442, 447 (2003) (quotations omitted). The valuation of a professional practice is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court based upon the particular facts and circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 450; <em>see In the Matter of Chamberlin &amp; Chamberlin, </em>155 N.H. 13, 16 (2007) (\u201c[Determining the value of any given asset is left to the sound discretion of the trial court\u201d). Also a question of fact is the determination of the existence and value of goodwill. <em>Watterworth, </em>149 N.H. at 450. We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s findings in this regard unless they are unsustainable on the record. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The respondent argues that the trial court erred by attributing a value to his practice that included \u201cprofessional goodwill\u201d \u2014 the intangible value of the dental practice that he asserts would not be transferable upon sale because it is attached to the respondent\u2019s own education and reputation. He concedes that the court was free to consider the value of the \u201cpractice goodwill\u201d \u2014 the goodwill that is severable from the professional reputation of the respondent and therefore transferable to a willing buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">On the record before us, we conclude that the trial court sustainably exercised its discretion in adopting the petitioner\u2019s valuation of the business. The trial court was presented with two expert opinions to aid in its determination of the business\u2019s value. The court found that the respondent\u2019s expert, Pollock, vastly underestimated the fair market value of the business, especially in light of his concession that he limited his analysis to its net tangible assets only. When pressed on the value of the business were the respondent to sell it, Pollock stated that he would receive no more than $400,000, but did not arrive at a precise figure. Thus, it was clear that Pollock made no calculation of goodwill in his appraisal. Both Pollock\u2019s estimate of $156,000 and his alternative estimate of $400,000 were further undermined by the fact that the respondent paid $410,000 for the business in 1996 and had run an unusually successful dental practice ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">In contrast, the court found that the petitioner\u2019s expert, Albright, accurately assessed the business\u2019s fair market value. Instead of considering only the business assets, Albright employed an appraisal method based upon how the business assets are used to generate income over time. Albright\u2019s method discounted for the business\u2019s lack of marketability given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>its \u201cliquidity issue\u201d and disregarded the respondent\u2019s highest earning years, but accounted for the practice\u2019s \u201csubstantial goodwill as a business entity.\u201d The court noted that Albright believed the practice was \u201ccompletely transferrable despite Respondent\u2019s extensive education and reputation.\u201d Thus, the court adopted Albright\u2019s estimate and distributed the marital property accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Having lost the battle of the experts, the respondent argues that the trial court\u2019s decision \u201cfailed to subtract the portion attributable to professional goodwill\u201d and, therefore, the matter must be remanded for an adjustment. The respondent contends that, because Albright did not determine the portion of his estimate attributable to professional goodwill, separate from practice goodwill, the trial court should have adopted a middle ground discounting for professional goodwill. The respondent cites no authority, however, to support the proposition that in a divorce proceeding the trial court must, on its own initiative, both determine the value of professional goodwill and discount it from the overall valuation of a business. Here, we need not decide the legal question of whether professional goodwill is marital property subject to equitable division in a divorce under RSA 458:16-a, for neither expert assigned a precise value, if any existed, to the professional goodwill of the respondent\u2019s practice. <em>Cf. Chamberlin, </em>155 N.H. at 16. Had the respondent presented a plausible estimation of the value attributable to his reputation, the trial court could have accorded such evidence its due consideration \u2014 further underscoring the factual nature of setting a value to a professional practice. Without having done so, the respondent ran the risk that the court would accept Albright\u2019s appraisal in its entirety. <em>Cf. Tzimas v. Coiffures By Michael, </em>135 N.H. 498, 501 (1992) (The trial court \u201cis free to accept or reject an expert\u2019s testimony in whole or in part, when faced with conflicting expert testimony.\u201d (quotations omitted)). The court\u2019s decision, therefore, did not constitute an unsustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Equally unavailing is the respondent\u2019s argument that the court erred in adopting Albright\u2019s appraisal on the grounds that it included a hypothetical covenant not to compete in its determination as to the fair market value of the dental practice. As noted above, the fair market value is what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller. Notably, both experts agreed that non-compete covenants routinely accompany the sale of professional practices, and New Hampshire law recognizes such contracts as long as they are reasonable. <em>ACAS Acquisitions v. Hobert, </em>155 N.H. 381, 388 (2007). The trial court was therefore entitled to rely upon both experts in considering that, were the respondent to sell his practice, the price would likely include an agreement not to compete.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">We have reviewed the respondent\u2019s remaining arguments that the trial court should have made adjustments to Albright\u2019s appraisal based upon a misapplication of the approach he used, and we conclude that they warrant no extended consideration. <em>See Vogel v. Vogel, </em>137 N.H. 321, 322 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b771-6\">Dalianis, C.J., and HlCKS and CONBOY, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
