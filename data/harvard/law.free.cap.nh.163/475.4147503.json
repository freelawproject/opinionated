He contends that the Superior Court <em>(McNamara, </em>J.): (1) violated New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 615 and RSA 632-A.-6, IV (2007) by failing to sequester the minor victim\u2019s mother; (2) erroneously denied his motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>disqualify a juror without first conducting a <em>voir dire </em>of the juror; and (3) erroneously denied his motion to dismiss the AFSA charge. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The jury could have found the following facts. The assaults in this case occurred in February 2006, when the victim was approximately ten and one-half years old. The defendant, who was her aunt\u2019s boyfriend, put his hand under the victim\u2019s shirt, then slid it under her underwear and rubbed her buttocks. He then touched her genitals over her underwear and asked if he could touch her vagina. When she said, \u201c[n]o,\u201d he moved his hand back to her buttocks. The victim reported the assaults immediately to her mother and, later that day, to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\n<em>I. Sequestration of Victim\u2019s Mother</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The defendant first argues that the trial court violated RSA 632-A:6, IV and Rule 615 when it denied his request to sequester the victim\u2019s mother during the victim\u2019s testimony. Rule 615 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">At the request of a party the court <em>shall in criminal cases </em>and may in civil cases order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses, and it may make the order of its own motion. This rule does not authorize exclusion of (1) a party who is a natural person or a victim of the crime, or (2) an officer or employee of a party in a civil case which is not a natural person designated as its representative by its attorney, or (3) a person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the party\u2019s cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">(Emphasis added.) RSA 632-A:6, IV similarly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">At the request of a party the court <em>shall, </em>in cases under RSA 632-A [Sexual Assault and Related Offenses], order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses, and it may make the order of its own motion. This does not authorize exclusion of a party who is a natural person or a victim of the crime, or a person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the party\u2019s cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">(Emphasis added.) The defendant argues that Rule 615 and RSA 632-A:6, IV mandate that the court sequester a witness in a criminal trial upon request. The defendant contends that the trial court violated both the rule and the statute when it denied his request to sequester the victim\u2019s mother, and that this error requires automatic reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">Rule 615 and RSA 632-A:6, IV \u201ccodified a well-established common law tradition of sequestering witnesses as a means of discouraging and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>exposing fabrication, inaccuracy, and collusion.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>60 F.3d 128, 133 (2d Cir. 1995) (quotation omitted; discussing Federal Rule of Evidence 615); <em>see </em>N.H. R. Ev. 615 Reporter\u2019s Notes. The Supreme Court has observed that this practice, which is \u201cpart of our inheritance of the common Germanic law,\u201d serves two purposes: (1) \u201c[i]t exercises a restraint on witnesses \u2018tailoring\u2019 their testimony to that of earlier witnesses\u201d; and (2) \u201cit aids in detecting testimony that is less than candid.\u201d <em>Geders v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 80, 87 (1976) (quotation omitted); <em>see Jackson, </em>60 F.3d at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">For the purposes of this appeal, we assume, without deciding, that the trial court erred when it denied the defendant\u2019s request to sequester the victim\u2019s mother. <em>But see Government of Virgin Islands v. Edinborough, </em>625 F.2d 472, 474-75 (3d Cir. 1980) (trial court has discretion to allow parent of young witness to remain in courtroom under exception for witnesses who are \u201cessential\u201d to presentation of party\u2019s case); <em>Com. v. Bonner, </em>601 N.E.2d 32, 34, 35 (Mass. App. Ct. 1992) (no error to allow mother of fourteen-year-old victim to remain in courtroom during victim\u2019s testimony). However, we decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to rule that this error mandates reversal without further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">To support his argument, the defendant relies upon <em>People v. Dixon, </em>177 N.E.2d 206 (Ill. 1961), <em>State v. DiModica, </em>192 A.2d 825 (N.J. 1963), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Czachor, </em>413 A.2d 593 (N.J. 1980), and <em>Vaughn v. State, </em>479 S.W.2d 873 (Ark. 1972), none of which stand for the <em>per se </em>rule of reversal that the defendant advances. Finding little support for the defendant\u2019s <em>per se </em>reversal rule, we turn to other jurisdictions, which have addressed the standard of review of a trial court\u2019s sequestration decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Federal courts construing Federal Rule of Evidence 615, which is similar to New Hampshire Rule 615, have decided that \u201c[although exclusion of witnesses [in a criminal trial] is mandatory, ... a trial court\u2019s violation of [Federal] Rule 615 ... is grounds for reversal . . . <em>only </em>if the party requesting exclusion was substantially prejudiced by the error.\u201d Annotation, <em>Exclusion of Witnesses Under Rule 615 of Federal Rules of Evidence, </em>181 A.L.R. Fed. 549, 568 (2002) (emphasis added). \u201cSome courts have placed the burden of showing prejudice on the party requesting exclusion, ... but a number of courts have taken the view that prejudice resulting from a trial court\u2019s violation of [Federal] Rule 615 is presumed and the burden is on the party opposing sequestration to show that the violation was not prejudicial or was harmless error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the Third, Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Circuit Courts of Appeals, the burden of proof is on the party requesting exclusion of witnesses. <em>See Edinborough, </em>625 F.2d at 476; <em>United States v. Green, </em>293 F.3d 886, 891-92 (5th Cir. 2002); <em>William L. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>Comer Family Equity Pure Trust v. C.I.R., </em>958 F.2d 136, 140-41 (6th Cir. 1992); <em>Hollman v. Dale Electronic, Inc., </em>752 F.2d 311, 313 (8th Cir. 1985). By contrast, in the Second, Fourth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals, prejudice from the failure to exclude witnesses is presumed, and the burden is on the party opposing sequestration to show that any error was harmless. <em>See Jackson, </em>60 F.3d at 136-37; <em>United States v. Farnham, </em>791 F.2d 331, 335 (4th Cir. 1986); <em>United States v. Seschillie, </em>310 F.3d 1208, 1214-17 (9th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">State courts are similarly divided upon this question, with some state courts placing the burden of proving prejudice upon the party seeking sequestration, <em>see, e.g., State v. Morgan, </em>797 A.2d 616, 632 (Conn. App. Ct. 2002), and others presuming prejudice and placing the burden of proving harmless error upon the party opposing sequestration, <em>see, e.g., Stafford v. State, </em>736 N.E.2d 326, 331 (Ind. Ct. App. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In a criminal case, \u201c[w]e believe the correct view is that the burden to demonstrate lack of prejudice, or harmless error, properly falls on the party that had opposed sequestration.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>60 F.3d at 136. \u201cFirst,... placing the burden of persuasion on the movant virtually demands the impossible; only with 20/20 hindsight could a party demonstrate what would have been said had a witness been sequestered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cMoreover, placing the harmless error burden on the party that had opposed sequestration is consistent with Rule 615\u2019s express presumption in favor of sequestration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has aptly explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">[W]e understand the mandatory, unambiguous language of the rule to reflect the drafters\u2019 recognition that any defendant . . . would find it almost impossible to sustain the burden of proving the negative inference that [the non-sequestered witness\u2019s] testimony would have been different had he been sequestered. A strict prejudice requirement of this sort would be not only unduly harsh but also self-defeating, in that it would swallow a rule carefully designed to aid the truth-seeking process and preserve the durability and acceptability of verdicts. Rule 615 thus reflects an <em>a priori </em>judgment in favor of sequestration, and the exceptions should be construed narrowly in favor of the party requesting sequestration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-8\"><em>Farnham, </em>791 F.2d at 335. Accordingly, we hold that when, in a criminal trial, a trial court has violated Rule 615 and RSA 632-A:6, IV by failing to sequester a witness, a new trial is in order unless the State proves that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Jackson, </em>60 F.3d at 137 (applying federal harmless error standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Applying this analysis, we conclude that in the case before us any presumption of prejudice has been rebutted. <em>See id. </em>To establish that an error was harmless, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect the verdict. <em>State v. </em>Peters, 162 N.H. 30, 36 (2011). An error in failing to sequester a witness may be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if, even without the non-sequestered witness\u2019s testimony, the other evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is of an overwhelming nature, quantity, or weight and the non-sequestered witness\u2019s testimony is merely cumulative or inconsequential in relation to the strength of the State\u2019s evidence of guilt. <em>See id.; see also Jackson, </em>60 F.3d at 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The defendant was charged with one count of felonious sexual assault, specifically \u201cintentionally touching\u201d the victim\u2019s buttocks with his hand. He was also charged with one count of AFSA, specifically \u201cintentionally touching the [victim\u2019s] genitalia with his hand over her clothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Here, as in <em>State v. Gonzalez, </em>150 N.H. 74, 79 (2003), and <em>State v. Lemieux, </em>136 N.H. 329, 331-32 (1992), the evidence most damaging to the defendant was the victim\u2019s detailed description of the assaults. At the trial, which began less than a month before the victim\u2019s fifteenth birthday, the victim was able to recall events that had occurred as many as four years earlier. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>150 N.H. at 79. She testified that the assaults occurred at the home her Aunt Cassie shared with the victim\u2019s grandmother and uncle. The night before the assaults, the victim had slept in Cassie\u2019s bedroom at her grandmother\u2019s home. The defendant was Cassie\u2019s boyfriend, and he too had stayed the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">On the morning of the assaults, the victim\u2019s parents had \u201cdropped off\u2019 the victim\u2019s sisters at the grandmother\u2019s house, and the victim and her sisters had gone to Cassie\u2019s bedroom to watch a movie with Cassie and the defendant. The victim testified that her sisters soon became bored and that they and Cassie went upstairs to play cards, leaving the victim and the defendant alone in Cassie\u2019s bedroom. The victim and the defendant were on Cassie\u2019s bed when he asked the victim \u201cto scoot over.\u201d When she did, he put his arm around her and began rubbing her back under her shirt. The defendant then \u201cslid his hand down to [the victim\u2019s] butt. . . under [her] underwear.\u201d The victim testified: \u201cHe kind of went under the underwear \u2014 I mean over the underwear and slid his hand over to the pants and asked if \u2014 or patted down and asked can I touch this, which was my vagina.\u201d She testified that at this point, his hand was over her underwear, and when she told him that he could not touch her vagina, he \u201cwent back over to my butt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">In addition to the victim\u2019s testimony, the jury heard from Cassie, who testified that she saw the victim run up from the bedroom, \u201cupset... [and] shaking.\u201d The victim told Cassie: \u201cAuntie, I don\u2019t think [the defendant is] the guy for you.\u201d The victim\u2019s father also testified that when he arrived at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the grandmother\u2019s house that morning, he saw that the victim\u2019s face was \u201ctotally red,\u201d and he could tell that she had been crying. He expressed concern because \u201c[s]he had totally been crying. Her face was bloody red.\u201d The victim\u2019s older sister also testified that she was upstairs playing cards while the victim was downstairs in Cassie\u2019s bedroom with the defendant. After she finished her card game, she saw the victim come upstairs in tears.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The victim\u2019s mother did not testify about the assaults. Her testimony was cumulative of testimony the jury had already heard regarding what happened when she arrived at Cassie\u2019s house on the morning of the assaults, and the victim\u2019s contacts with the police. However, the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony \u201cwas not a mere echo\u201d of the victim\u2019s testimony. <em>Bonner, </em>601 N.E.2d at 34. For instance, the victim testified that she told her mother that the defendant had \u201churt\u201d her; her mother said that the victim told her that the defendant had \u201ctouched\u201d her. Additionally, the victim testified that when her mother arrived at the house, the defendant was in the bathroom. The victim\u2019s mother testified that when she arrived at the house, she walked downstairs to Cassie\u2019s bedroom, where she saw the victim lying on the bed with Cassie and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Because the defendant\u2019s conviction is supported by other substantial evidence, and because the evidence does not support a conclusion that the victim\u2019s mother tailored her testimony to the victim\u2019s testimony, we hold that any error in failing to sequester the victim\u2019s mother was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 34-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\n<em>II. Voir Dire of Juror</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">The defendant next asserts that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to disqualify a juror without first conducting <em>voir dire </em>of the juror. After closing arguments and the charge to the jury, the defendant raised concerns about the juror\u2019s behavior:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It was brought to my attention that juror No. 4 was \u2014 and I noticed a little of it \u2014 but was rolling her eyes, laughing, gesticulating during my closing argument. I think she\u2019s evidenced that she has already made up her mind in this case, quite clearly by how she reacted to me during my closing argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">Specifically, it\u2019s been brought to my attention that she was laughing at me at one point. I hope that\u2019s not a reflection on my abilities, but the evidence as she believes it, but I feel it\u2019s revealed that she has not remained, to this point, fair and impartial, as she\u2019s required to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And I understand that the law presumes the jurors are going to follow the instructions. However, I think by her actions she\u2019s evidenced that she hasn\u2019t done that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">THE COURT: Well, I think it\u2019s very difficult to make a presumption based on a juror\u2019s body language. I\u2019ll also say I was watching the jury, and I did not observe anything that led me to believe that the juror had so clearly made up her mind that she would not follow the instructions. I think the law is I have to presume she\u2019ll follow the instructions, so I am going to \u2014 I assume it\u2019s a motion to disqualify a juror.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, it is, Your Honor. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">THE COURT: I\u2019m going to deny that \u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">On appeal, the defendant contends that because he articulated a sufficient basis to suspect that the juror was biased, the trial court was required to <em>voir dire </em>the juror. This argument is not preserved for our review because, as the defendant concedes, he never asked the trial court to <em>voir dire </em>the juror. The defendant argues that preservation is not necessary because the trial court had an independent duty to question the juror. To support this argument, he relies upon cases concerning the trial court\u2019s role in investigating \u201ca colorable claim that a jury may be biased or tainted by extrinsic contact or communication,\u201d <em>State v. Rideout, </em>143 N.H. 363, 365 (1999). When such a colorable claim is made, the court \u201cmust undertake an adequate inquiry to determine whether the alleged incident occurred and, if so, whether it was prejudicial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This line of cases is inapplicable when, as here, there is <em>no </em>allegation of any extrinsic contact or communication. <em>See State v. Bader, </em>148 N.H. 265, 279 (2002). Because the defendant did not preserve this argument for our review, we decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">\n<em>III. Conviction on AFSA Charge Against Weight of Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">Finally, the defendant argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to disihiss the AFSA charge because the jury\u2019s verdict on the AFSA charge was against the weight of the evidence. However, the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was made at the close of the State\u2019s case, and at that juncture was, and could only have been, a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. As we recently clarified in <em>State v. Hill, </em>163 N.H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>394 (2012), such a motion does not preserve an objection to the jury verdict based upon the weight of the evidence. Accordingly, because the defendant\u2019s argument is not preserved for our review, we decline to address it substantively.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b503-6\">Hicks, Conboy and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
