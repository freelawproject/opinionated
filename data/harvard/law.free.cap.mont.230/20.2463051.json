On the conviction of Sexual Intercourse Without Consent, as alleged in Count I, the sentence shall be twenty (20) years with five (5) suspended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">2. As to the conviction of Theft, set out in the sentence, shall be ten (10) years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Both sentences shall be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">It is the consensus of the Court, with Judge Harkin dissenting, that the sentence should be amended as indicated for the reasons that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">(1) The 20-years sentence imposed does not indicate what portion thereof was applicable to the sex crime and what portion was applicable to the crime of Theft;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-11\">(2) It appears that the Defendant did not understand that he was not entitled to \u201cgood time\u201d on a sentence to the hospital at Warm Springs; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-12\">(3) The Court\u2019s majority notes the Defendant\u2019s lack of any prior criminal record, a fact that the sentencing judge may have overlooked. The amended and adjusted sentence in the opinion of the majority seems fair and in a measure corrects an obvious misunderstanding.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b569-13\">HONORABLE DOUGLAS HARKIN</author>\n<p id=\"Ae9\">DISSENTING: I would affirm the sentence of the trial court. The applicant receive a sentence consistent with his plea bargain.
