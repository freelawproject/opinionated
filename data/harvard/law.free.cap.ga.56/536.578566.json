The principle arrived at seems to be that, as between the plaintiff and defendant, any record facts which go to show that the judgment creditor was active, particularly if his want of activity during any of the time was caused by the act of the defendant, would operate to save the judgment from the operation of the act, such as claiming money in court, in the case in 3 <em>Kelly, </em>and any <em>official action </em>upon the public dockets so as to notify the world that the plaintiff claimed that his judgment was subsisting, as in 41 <em>Georgia Reports, </em>133. We think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>this case comes within the principle ruled in those cases: 3 <em>Kelly, </em>274; 41 <em>Georgia Reports, </em>133; 19 <em>Ibid., </em>517; 25 <em>Ibid., </em>274; 42 <em>Ibid., </em>213; and that this judgment is not dormant, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
