R. Peabody testified thatC. C. King, the father of Mrs. Hines, had been her general agent for the management of (he estate of her intestate, D. P. Hines; that he stated to witness that the Hodgkiss\u2019 Scott &amp; Company claim had been arranged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>by Mrs. Hines giving her note, as administratrix, for the amount; that said King was now dead; that the consideration of the debt was merchandise, most of which was sold after the death of intestate, and the proceeds turned over to his administratrix or her agent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-5\">T. H. Hodgkiss testified that the note was taken in settlement of an account for goods; that many of the articles were on hand at the time of intestate\u2019s death, and were in the possession of his administratrix; that the consideration of the debt inured to the benefit of intestate\u2019s estate; that witness was senior member of the firm of Hodgkiss, Scott &amp; Company, the payees of the note; that he has no pecuniary interest in this suit, the note having been transferred to Poole.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b643-6\">Fleming &amp; Rutherford; Gurley &amp; Russell, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b643-7\">Whiteley <em>&amp; </em>Donaldson, by Z.

P. Hines, with an averment that said note was given in payment of an account due by the intestate and for the benefit of his estate. On the trial of the case, the jury, under the charge of the court, found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $566 46, principal, with interest. The defendant made a motion for a new trial on various grounds, which was overruled by the court, and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">Many of the questions made by the plaintiff in error, were settled when this case was before this court on a former occasion: See 52 <em>Georgia Reports, </em>500.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">1. There was no error in admitting the evidence of Peabody as to the sayings of King, the defendant\u2019s general agent in the management of her intestate\u2019s estate, the agent, King, being dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>2. There was no error in admitting the evidence of Hodgidss, as against the defendant, because her intestate was dead; the witness was only offered to prove that the account for which the note was given inured to the benefit of the estate, and not to prove any contract made with the intestate. In view of the evidence contained in the record, there was no error in the charge of the court to the jury, or in refusing to charge as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Let the judgment of the court below, overruling the motion for a new trial, be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
