(West 2000)). The answer to that question determines whether the amendment tells the Illinois Gaming Board (Board) it must grant Emerald Casino, Incorporated\u2019s (Emerald) application to renew its license and relocate its gambling business to Rosemont.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b39-6\" pgmap=\"39\">FACTS</p> <p id=\"b39-7\" pgmap=\"39\">Illinois\u2019s Riverboat Gambling Act authorizes the Board to issue 10 licenses for riverboat gambling, the first four of them for gambling on the Mississippi River. 230 ILCS 10/7(e) (West 2002). In 1992, the Board issued one of the Mississippi River licenses to HP, Incorporated, now known as Emerald Casino. The license was renewed for one year in 1995 and again in 1996.</p> <p id=\"b39-8\" pgmap=\"39\">In April 1997, Emerald applied for a license renewal; however, instead of remaining on the Mississippi, Emerald wanted to relocate to Rosemont. The Board refused Emerald\u2019s application two months later. Emerald pursued an administrative appeal. While the administrative appeal was pending in July 1997, Emerald stopped operating its casino.</p> <p id=\"b39-9\" pgmap=\"39\">The administrative law judge (ALJ) issued an order agreeing with the Board\u2019s denial. The ALJ denied both of Emerald\u2019s motions for reconsideration.</p> <p id=\"b39-10\" pgmap=\"39\">Before Emerald\u2019s administrative appeal went back to the Board, the legislature added section 11.2 to the Act, effective June 25, 1999. 230 ILCS 10/11.2(a) (West 2002). In part, the section reads as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"AE\" pgmap=\"39(55) 40(23)\">\u201c(a) A licensee that was not conducting riverboat gambling on January 1, 1998[,] may apply to the Board for renewal and approval of relocation to a new home dock location authorized under section 3(c) and the Board shall grant the application and approval upon receipt by the licensee of approval from the new municipality or county, as the case may be, in which the licensee wishes to relocate pursuant to section 7(j).\u201d 230 ILCS 10/11.2(a) (West 2002).</blockquote> <p id=\"b40-3\" pgmap=\"40\">Only Emerald fit that description, then and now.</p> <p id=\"b40-4\" pgmap=\"40\">Once section 11.2(a) passed, the Board declared the ALJ\u2019s previous order moot and allowed Emerald to file a new application for renewal and relocation under the new section. On July 7, 1999, the board of trustees of Rosemont approved Emerald\u2019s request to dock in Rosemont. Emerald submitted its revised application to the Board on September 24, 1999.</p> <p id=\"b40-5\" pgmap=\"40\">On January 30, 2001, the Board announced its intent to deny Emerald\u2019s request for renewal and relocation. On March 6, 2001, the Board issued its written notice of denial in addition to a five-count disciplinary complaint seeking to revoke Emerald\u2019s existing license. Emerald requested a hearing on the denial of its application and answered the Board\u2019s disciplinary complaint. The record provides no specific reason why the revocation proceedings linger without resolution.</p> <p id=\"b40-6\" pgmap=\"40\">On May 21, 2001, Emerald filed a complaint in the circuit court of Cook County seeking declaratory relief and a writ of mandamus ordering the Board to approve Emerald\u2019s application for renewal and relocation. Subsequently, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, disputing whether the Board had the authority to deny Emerald\u2019s application even though Emerald met the two criteria set forth in section 11.2(a) of the Act.</p> <p id=\"b40-7\" pgmap=\"40\">Before the trial court ruled on the summary judgment motions, the Village of Rosemont (Rosemont) filed an emergency motion to intervene and join Emerald\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Board and denied Emerald\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court did not address Rosemont\u2019s motion to intervene.</p> <p id=\"b40-8\" pgmap=\"40\">Rosemont filed a renewed motion to intervene. Rosemont also filed a motion requesting the court to vacate the previous summary judgment order and grant summary judgment in favor of Emerald based on the legislative history of section 11.2(a). The trial court granted Rosemont\u2019s request to intervene, but denied the motion to vacate its previous order.</p> <p id=\"b40-9\" pgmap=\"40\">Emerald and Rosemont now appeal the orders granting the Board summary judgment. We reverse and remand.</p> <p id=\"b40-10\" pgmap=\"40\">DECISION</p> <p id=\"b40-11\" pgmap=\"40\">I. Standard of Review</p> <p id=\"b40-12\" pgmap=\"40(11) 41(128)\"> Generally, a trial court\u2019s decision to deny declaratory relief or a writ of mandamus will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is against the manifest weight of evidence. Villarreal v. Village of Schaumburg, 325 Ill. App. 3d 1157, 1160, 759 N.E.2d 76 (2001); see State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Leverton, 314 Ill. App. 3d 1080, 1083, 732 N.E.2d 1094 (2000). However, this appeal arises from a grant of summary judgment. \u201cIn all cases involving summary judgment, we review the evidence in the record de novo.\u201d West American Insurance Co. v. J.R. Construction Co., 334 Ill. App. 3d 75, 80, 777 N.E.2d 610 (2002) (applying de novo standard when reviewing summary judgment that denied declaratory relief); see also Villarreal, 325 Ill. App. 3d at 1160 (conducting de novo review of summary judgment denying writ of mandamus).</p> <p id=\"b41-3\" pgmap=\"41\">II. Procedural Issues</p> <p id=\"b41-4\" pgmap=\"41\">There are three procedural issues that must be addressed. They are directed to whether this court should entertain this appeal.</p> <p id=\"b41-5\" pgmap=\"41\">The first issue was raised by this court during oral argument. We asked whether there has been a sufficient determination by the Board to warrant judicial consideration. That is, since there was no final Board action, is there a controversy \u201cripe for adjudication\u201d? See Bio-Medical Laboratories, Inc. v. Trainor, 68 Ill. 2d 540, 545-46, 370 N.E.2d 223 (1977).</p> <p id=\"b41-6\" pgmap=\"41\">The Board contends we have no jurisdiction to proceed, relying entirely on National Marine, Inc. v. Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, 159 Ill. 2d 381, 639 N.E.2d 571 (1994). The issue in National Marine was whether the circuit court properly dismissed National Marine\u2019s complaint challenging the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) issuance of a section 4(q) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 111\u00bd, par. 1004(q)) notice that informed the plaintiff it may be potentially liable for a release of a hazardous substance. The court, observing that the section 4(q) notice was only the first step in a long enforcement proceeding that might never take place, held the plaintiffs complaint was premature and was correctly dismissed. That is, \u201c[pjlaintiffs complaint requested] [the] court to render an advisory opinion concerning future events.\u201d National Marine, 159 Ill. 2d at 390. In addition, the preenforcement judicial review of the section 4(q) notice issuance \u201cwould completely undermine the statutory scheme established by the General Assembly as well as the legislative purpose of the Act.\u201d National Marine, 159 Ill. 2d at 391. The court did not use the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d anywhere in its opinion.</p> <p id=\"b41-7\" pgmap=\"41(37) 42(68)\">We do not see how National Marine has much to do with this case, where we are called on to determine whether the legislature imposed a mandatory duty on the Board when it enacted section 11.2(a). No further investigation need take place. The Board, when it issued a notice of denial on March 6, 2001, more than 17 months after Emerald\u2019s application was filed, made clear its belief section 11.2(a) grants it discretion to refuse Emerald\u2019s application or to delay it to death. All we have to do in this appeal is read the statute for legislative intent. We know how to do that.</p> <p id=\"b42-3\" pgmap=\"42\"> There is a basic rationale for the ripeness doctrine as it relates to judicial intervention in administrative actions:</p> <blockquote id=\"b42-4\" pgmap=\"42\">\u201c \u2018to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.\u2019 \u201d Bio-Medical Laboratories, 68 Ill. 2d at 546, quoting Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-49, 18 L. Ed. 2d 681, 691, 87 S. Ct. 1507, 1515 (1967).</blockquote> <p id=\"b42-5\" pgmap=\"42\">In Bio-Medical Laboratories, the Director of the Illinois Department of Public Aid (Department) had informed the plaintiff he intended to forthwith suspend it from the public aid program. The Department\u2019s auditors agreed, but the Department had not acted. The court found \u201ca sufficient final determination to warrant judicial consideration.\u201d Bio-Medical Laboratories, 68 Ill. 2d at 546.</p> <p id=\"b42-6\" pgmap=\"42\">Relying on Bio-Medical Laboratories, the court in Alternative Fuels, Inc. v. Director of the Environmental Protection Agency, 337 Ill. App. 3d 857, 864, 786 N.E.2d 1063 (2003), appeal allowed, 205 Ill. 2d 575 (2003), held an agency\u2019s threat of action that could prove detrimental to a party may warrant judicial consideration. There, the EPA issued a violation notice to Alternative Fuels, Incorporated, threatening prosecution if the company did not comply with permit procedures. Ripe enough for judicial consideration of a declaratory judgment, held the court.</p> <p id=\"b42-7\" pgmap=\"42\">We were faced with a ripeness challenge in Peoples Energy Corp. v. Illinois Commerce Comm\u2019n, 142 Ill. App. 3d 917, 492 N.E.2d 551 (1986). There, the circuit court granted injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment that stopped the Illinois Commerce Commission (Commission) from asserting its authority to halt a planned corporate reorganization of Peoples Energy. The Commission had begun a hearing, but gave no indication of how long the proceedings would take. We held the issues were clearly defined, not abstract or hypothetical, sufficiently ripe for judicial action. Peoples Energy, 142 Ill. App. 3d at 934.</p> <p id=\"b42-8\" pgmap=\"42(21) 43(54)\"> We find the straightforward issue of legislative intent now placed before us is clearly defined and ripe for decision. If section II. 2(a) imposes a mandatory duty on the Board, a legislative directive is being ignored. Emerald does not seek a review of any discretionary decisions or Board findings. Deciding this case would not undermine the General Assembly\u2019s statutory scheme \u2014 it would explicate it. This is fertile ground for mandamus and declaratory judgment action.</p> <p id=\"b43-3\" pgmap=\"43\">The second procedural issue is the Board\u2019s contention on appeal that Emerald is barred from seeking relief from the courts because it failed to exhaust its administrative remedies.</p> <p id=\"b43-4\" pgmap=\"43\"> Emerald claims the Board waived the exhaustion issue when it failed to raise it in the trial court. It did not. An appellee, the Board in this case, may urge the exhaustion issue on appeal, even though not directly ruled on by the trial court, \u201c \u2018so long as the factual basis for such point was before the trial court.\u2019 \u201d Beahringer v. Page, 204 Ill. 2d 363, 370, 789 N.E.2d 1216 (2003), quoting Shaw v. Lorenz, 42 Ill. 2d 246, 248 (1969). We will consider the exhaustion issue.</p> <p id=\"b43-5\" pgmap=\"43\"> There are three basic reasons for requiring a litigant to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial review: (1) exhaustion allows full development of the facts before the agency; (2) it allows the agency an opportunity to use its expertise; and (3) the aggrieved party-may succeed before the agency, rendering judicial review unnecessary. Illinois Bell Telephone Co. v. Allphin, 60 Ill. 2d 350, 358, 326 N.E.2d 737 (1975).</p> <p id=\"b43-6\" pgmap=\"43\">There are established exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine. The doctrine is not a bar to judicial determination when the issue \u201cis one of statutory and case law interpretation, and therefore it falls within the scope of our particular expertise and not the State Board\u2019s.\u201d Office of the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney v. Illinois Local Labor Relations Board, 166 Ill. 2d 296, 306, 652 N.E.2d 301 (1995); see also Getto v. City of Chicago, 77 Ill. 2d 346, 356-57, 396 N.E.2d 544 (1979) (circuit court properly exercises jurisdiction when \u201c[t]he sole issue presented here is one of statutory interpretation, and there is no question which requires the [agency\u2019s] expertise\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b43-7\" pgmap=\"43\">Determining the scope of an agency\u2019s power and authority is a judicial function, not a question for the agency itself to answer. County of Knox ex rel. Masterson v. Highlands, L.L.C., 188 Ill. 2d 546, 554, 723 N.E.2d 256 (1999). In addition, exhaustion is not required where the administrative remedy is inadequate or futile, or where the litigant will be subjected to irreparable injury due to lengthy administrative procedures that fail to provide interim relief. Peoples Energy, 142 Ill. App. 3d at 932; see also General American Realty Co. v. Greene, 107 Ill. App. 3d 1011, 1014-15, 438 N.E.2d 540 (1982).</p> <p id=\"b43-9\" pgmap=\"43(26) 44(54)\">In fact, if the Board has no authority to do anything other than fulfill a legislative directive, its refusal to do so does not constitute a decision subject to administrative review. See McCoy v. Stackler, 38 Ill. App. 3d 1012, 1015, 350 N.E.2d 197 (1976); see also People ex rel. Simpkins v. Village of Kincaid, 26 Ill. App. 2d 68, 167 N.E.2d 698 (1960) (mandamus is proper remedy where village\u2019s board did not have discretion to refuse to issue permits).</p> <p id=\"b44-3\" pgmap=\"44\"> The exceptions are a firm fit in this case \u2014 no facts to develop before the agency, not a matter for use of agency expertise, an issue of statutory and case law interpretation, lengthy procedures that cause substantial harm to the applicant, and a clear signal from the agency that exhausting administrative remedies would be patently useless. See Beahringer, 204 Ill. 2d at 378; Village of Maywood Board of Fire &amp; Police Commissioners v. Department of Human Rights, 296 Ill. App. 3d 570, 577, 695 N.E.2d 873 (1998) (exhaustion not required where issue of statutory interpretation, not fact, was presented, no agency expertise was involved, and irreparable harm would result from further pursuit of administrative remedies). Exhaustion was not necessary in this case.</p> <p id=\"b44-4\" pgmap=\"44\">\u20227 Finally, the Board contends summary judgment was proper because Emerald\u2019s action in the trial court was untimely. The Board says Emerald should have sought declaratory relief immediately after the legislature enacted section 11.2(a) in June 1999, instead of waiting until the Board denied the renewal and relocation application in 2001. The Board fails to support its position with pertinent legal authority or persuasive reasons. Nor can we find any of either. We\u2019reject the Board\u2019s contention that Emerald\u2019s complaint was untimely.</p> <p id=\"b44-5\" pgmap=\"44\">We conclude Emerald has chosen the correct remedies in pursuit of its claim of entitlement. Declaratory judgment is an appropriate method for determining controversies relating to construction or interpretation of a statute. Office of the Lake County State\u2019s Attorney v. Illinois Human Rights Comm\u2019n, 200 Ill. App. 3d 151, 155, 558 N.E.2d 668 (1990). As for mandamus, if Emerald is right about the meaning of \u201cshall,\u201d it has a \u201cclear right to the relief requested,\u201d there is a \u201cclear duty of the respondent to act,\u201d and there is \u201cclear authority in the respondent to comply with the writ.\u201d Cf. Noyola v. Board of Education of the City of Chicago, 179 Ill. 2d 121, 133, 688 N.E.2d 81 (1997).</p> <p id=\"b44-6\" pgmap=\"44\">It is time to consider the merits of Emerald\u2019s view of section II. 2(a).</p> <p id=\"b44-8\" pgmap=\"44\">III. Statutory Interpretation</p> <p id=\"b44-9\" pgmap=\"44(35) 45(21)\">The dispute in this case centers on section 11.2(a) \u2014 the Board \u201cshall grant the application\u201d for renewal and relocation of a license after approval by the new locality. 230 ILCS 10/11.2(a) (West 2002). If \u201cshall\u201d is directory, the statute gives the Board the discretion it claims. If it is mandatory, no discretion. The license issues.</p> <p id=\"b45-3\" pgmap=\"45\"> When interpreting a statute, a court must ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature. Palos Community Hospital v. Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board, 328 Ill. App. 3d 336, 339, 765 N.E.2d 1187 (2002). If possible, the proper way to determine the legislature\u2019s intent is to apply the plain meaning of the statute\u2019s language. Midstate Siding &amp; Window Co. v. Rogers, 204 Ill. 2d 314, 320, 789 N.E.2d 1248 (2003).</p> <p id=\"b45-4\" pgmap=\"45\"> Generally, \u201cshall\u201d indicates a mandatory intent. People v. O\u2019Brien, 197 Ill. 2d 88, 93, 754 N.E.2d 327 (2001). However, the word\u2019s meaning is not fixed or inflexible, and courts sometimes interpret it as directory. Andrews v. Foxworthy, 71 Ill. 2d 13, 21, 373 N.E.2d 1332 (1978); Brennan v. Illinois State Board of Elections, 336 Ill. App. 3d 749, 759, 784 N.E.2d 854 (2002). The meaning of \u201cshall\u201d is \u201cgrounded on the \u2018nature, objects and the consequences which would result from construing it one way or another.\u2019 \u201d Andrews, 71 Ill. 2d at 21, quoting Carrigan v. Illinois Liquor Control Comm\u2019n, 19 Ill. 2d 230, 233, 166 N.E.2d 574 (1960). That is, when a statute prescribes the performance of an act by a public official or a public body, \u201cthe question of whether it is mandatory or directory depends on its purpose.\u201d Andrews, 71 Ill. 2d at 21. Here, as we examine a sampling of the cases, we keep in mind the legislature\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d in enacting section 11.2(a).</p> <p id=\"b45-5\" pgmap=\"45\">A. Cases interpreting \u201cshall\u201d as mandatory</p> <p id=\"b45-6\" pgmap=\"45\">Some decisions interpret \u201cshall\u201d as mandatory because the statute was directed at more than technicalities of official proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b45-7\" pgmap=\"45\">For example, in Pace v. Regional Transportation Authority, 346 Ill. App. 3d 125, 139 (2003), the statute stated the Regional Transportation Authority Board (RTA) \u201cshall approve\u201d a proposed Pace budget if it met the listed criteria. The court held \u201cshall\u201d was mandatory, even though the statute did not contain any consequences for the RTA\u2019s failure to follow it. Pace, 346 Ill. App. 3d at 140.</p> <p id=\"b45-8\" pgmap=\"45\">In Simmons v. DuBose, 142 Ill. App. 3d 1077, 1080, 492 N.E.2d 586 (1986), the Election Code said a candidate\u2019s name \u201cshall not appear on the ballot if the requirements for filing nominating petitions are not satisfied.\u201d Because the purpose of the statute was to guard against fraud and unfairness to other candidates, and was not a mere technicality, the court held the direction was mandatory. Simmons, 142 Ill. App. 3d at 1081.</p> <p id=\"b45-9\" pgmap=\"45(38) 46(60)\">Some decisions interpret \u201cshall\u201d as mandatory to protect a right or benefit. For example, in People v. Jennings, 3 Ill. 2d 125, 128, 119 N.E.2d 781 (1954), a section of the Revenue Act of 1939 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1949, ch. 120, par. 584) stated \u201cthe appropriate officer \u2018shall publish the assessment of personal property in full\u2019 in some public newspaper on or before July 10.\u201d The court held the purpose of the provision was to protect taxpayers and not merely to guide tax officials in their duties. Therefore, \u201cshall\u201d was mandatory. Jennings, 3 Ill. 2d at 130-31.</p> <p id=\"b46-3\" pgmap=\"46\">Jennings was relied on in Andrews, where the Revenue Act stated the supervisor of assessments \u201cshall publish\u201d certain information regarding assessed properties on or before a certain date. The court held the publication requirement was mandatory because the legislative purpose was to benefit and protect taxpayers. Andrews, 71 Ill. 2d at 20-21.</p> <p id=\"b46-4\" pgmap=\"46\">In Citizens Organizing Project v. Department of Natural Resources, 189 Ill. 2d 593, 596-97, 727 N.E.2d 195 (2000), the plaintiff requested fees in accord with the statute that said: \u201cIn any case in which a party has any administrative rule invalidated by a court for any reason ***, the court shall award the party bringing the action the reasonable expenses of litigation, including attorney\u2019s fees\u201d (5 ILCS 100/10\u2014 55(c) (West 1998)). The court held a mandatory reading of \u201cshall\u201d best served the purpose of the statute \u2014 to encourage parties to challenge invalid administrative rules. Citizens Organizing Project, 189 Ill. 2d at 598-99.</p> <p id=\"b46-5\" pgmap=\"46\">Legislative desire to protect a citizen\u2019s rights and benefits required mandatory readings of \u201cshall\u201d in Newkirk v. Bigard, 109 Ill. 2d 28, 34, 485 N.E.2d 321 (1985) (mining board order integrating mineral rights \u201cshall\u201d provide an unwilling interest owner alternatives to participating in the costs and risks of drilling or mining); Cole v. Department of Public Health, 329 Ill. App. 3d 261, 263-65, 767 N.E.2d 909 (2002) (Water Well and Pump Installation Contractor\u2019s License Act (225 ILCS 345/16 (West 2000)) provided the Public Health Department \u201cshall\u201d notify a license holder of a revocation hearing within 10 days of the hearing and allow the holder an opportunity to be heard); and Armstrong v. Hedlund Corp., 316 Ill.

The State contended the defendant could not seek the credit on appeal because he did not ask for it in the trial court. The court, after examining the purpose of the amendment, held the per diem credit was a mandatory right and the defendant could apply for it on appeal.

To save constitutionality, \u201cshall\u201d was held to be directory in People v. Flores, 104 Ill. 2d 40, 46-48, 470 N.E.2d 307 (1984) (where defendant in a criminal trial wilfully absents himself from court for two successive days, \u201cthe court shall proceed with trial\u201d (Ill.

For example, in Carrigan v. Illinois Liquor Control Comm\u2019n, 19 Ill. 2d 230, 232, 166 N.E.2d 574 (1960), a section of the Liquor Control Act of 1934 provided when a licensee files an application for rehearing of a revocation finding, the Commission \u201cshall receive and consider such application for a rehearing within twenty (20) days from the filing thereof\u2019 (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1957, ch. 43, par. 154). The court held the provision was directory because the licensee\u2019s rights were not injured by the board\u2019s failure to act within 20 days. Carrigan, 19 Ill. 2d at 235-36. And in Cooper v. Hinrichs, 10 Ill. 2d 269, 272, 140 N.E.2d 293 (1957), the court held the child\u2019s best interests required a discretionary reading of the statute that provided: \u201cThe court in entering a decree of adoption shall, whenever possible, give custody through adoption to a petitioner or petitioners of the same religious belief as, that of the child\u201d (Ill.

Cases interpreting \u201cshall\u201d as mandatory and directory</p> <p id=\"b49-5\" pgmap=\"49(152) 50(21)\">Construing the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, courts have interpreted \u201cshall\u201d as both mandatory and directory. In People v. Ross, 339 Ill.

Then we examined section 122 \u2014 2.1(a)(2) (725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 2.1(a)(2) (West 2000)), which provides an order of dismissal \u201cshall be served upon the petitioner by certified mail within 10 days of its entry.\u201d Ross, 339 Ill.

These are our reasons.</p> <p id=\"b50-5\" pgmap=\"50\">A. The purpose of the amendment</p> <p id=\"b50-6\" pgmap=\"50\">We look to the \u201c \u2018essence of the thing to be done.\u2019 \u201d People v. Cox, 136 Ill. App. 3d 623, 626, 483 N.E.2d 422 (1985), quoting 1A A. Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7 25.03, at 300 (1984). We understand \u201cthe question of whether it is mandatory or directory depends on its purpose.\u201d Andrews, 71 Ill. 2d at 21. When we consider the meaning of a statutory amendment, we consider the circumstances surrounding the enactment, as well as the need for the amendment and the purpose it serves. Woodard, 175 Ill. 2d at 444.</p> <p id=\"b50-7\" pgmap=\"50\">As demonstrated by the dissent in this case, section 11.2(a) is capable of being understood by reasonably well-informed persons in two or more different ways (People v. Jameson, 162 Ill. 2d 282, 288, 642 N.E.2d 1207 (1994)), so we consider the statute\u2019s legislative history and Emerald\u2019s history in the gambling casino business at the time section 11.2(a) was enacted.</p> <p id=\"b50-8\" pgmap=\"50\">In June 1999, Emerald was the only one of 10 licensees not conducting riverboat gambling. By then, the Board had refused Emerald\u2019s April 1997 application for renewal of license and relocation to Rosemont. Emerald had stopped operating its casino in July 1997. Emerald\u2019s administrative review languished until May 5, 1999, when an administrative law judge agreed with the Board\u2019s refusal. Legislative debate on proposed section 11.2(a) began later in May, leading to enactment of the amendment.</p> <p id=\"b50-9\" pgmap=\"50\">Section 11.2(a) applies only to Emerald. It does not fit any other licensee. It is clear in the legislative discussions that lawmakers knew they were dealing only with Emerald, the tenth license, \u201csitting unused.\u201d 91st Ill. Gen. Assem., House Proceedings, May 21, 1999, at 206 (statements of Representative Brunsvold).</p> <blockquote id=\"b50-10\" pgmap=\"50\">\u201cScott: Okay. And so, when the bill refers to a licensee that wasn\u2019t conducting riverboat gambling, you\u2019re talking about the East Dubuque license.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b50-11\" pgmap=\"50\">Brunsvold: One license.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b50-12\" pgmap=\"50\">Scott: Okay.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b50-13\" pgmap=\"50\">Brunsvold: We\u2019re talking about one license.\u201d 91st Ill. Gen. Assem., House Proceedings, May 21, 1999, at 206 (statements of Representatives Scott &amp; Brunsvold).</blockquote> <p id=\"b51-2\" pgmap=\"51\">In addition, the Illinois Attorney General had issued a formal opinion stating Emerald could not relocate its license away from the Mississippi. 1995 Ill. Att\u2019y Gen. Op. No. 95 \u2014 Oil. Rosemont had agreed to accept the Emerald casino back in 1997, and it was still waiting for Board approval.</p> <p id=\"b51-3\" pgmap=\"51\">We cannot construe a statute in a way that deprives it of legislative purpose. One obvious purpose of the amendment was to resurrect the tenth license after nearly two years of inactivity, to begin producing much-needed revenue for the state, as well as meeting the Act\u2019s stated purpose of \u201cassisting economic development and promoting Illinois tourism.\u201d 230 ILCS 10/2(a) (West 1998).</p> <p id=\"b51-4\" pgmap=\"51\">If the legislature intended \u201cshall\u201d to mean \u201cmay,\u201d nothing much, if anything, would have been accomplished by the amendment. It was obvious the Board was not disposed kindly toward Emerald\u2019s application for renewal and relocation. It had been pending for two years and two months, the Board rejecting it at every opportunity, including denial of two motions for reconsideration, before a final ruling could be made. Then came section 11.2(a), effective June 25, 1999. The application process started again, but this time Emerald was armed with the new statute, along with Rosemont\u2019s invitation, the prerequisite for Board approval.</p> <p id=\"b51-5\" pgmap=\"51\">We believe that when the legislature chose to enact a statute that applied only to Emerald it thought it was providing a remedy for a moribund license, not creating yet another round of delay and rejection. Our supreme court reached a similar conclusion in Fumarolo v. Chicago Board of Education, 142 Ill. 2d 54, 566 N.E.2d 1283 (1990), where the question was whether the mayor was required to choose board members from a slate presented by the nominating commission. The statute: \u201c \u00a3[T]he commission shall submit to the mayor a slate of 3 different candidates for each vacant or new board position ***. *** [Tjhe mayor shall select one of the 3 candidates as board member from the slate.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added and in original.) Fumarolo, 142 Ill. 2d at 95, quoting Ill. Rev. Stat. 1989, ch. 122, par. 34 \u2014 3.1.</p> <p id=\"b51-6\" pgmap=\"51\">The court held the mayor must choose from the Board\u2019s slate. No discretion. Before the statute was amended, the mayor had complete discretion in appointing Board members. If the legislature intended the mayor to retain that discretion, said the court, a nominating commission would not have been necessary. \u201cWe will not assume that the legislature engaged in a meaningless act.\u201d Fumarolo, 142 Ill. 2d at 97. Neither will we.</p> <p id=\"b51-7\" pgmap=\"51(33) 52(55)\">The Board suggests a mandatory reading of the amendment might invite an attack on the grounds that section 11.2(a) runs afoul of the constitutional prohibition of special legislation. But that has not been made an issue for us to decide. Our task is to determine legislative intent, not legislative wisdom. \u201cIt is the dominion of the legislature to enact laws and it is the province of the courts to construe those laws.\u201d Shields v. Judges\u2019 Retirement System of Illinois, 204 Ill. 2d 488, 497, 791 N.E.2d 516 (2003).</p> <p id=\"b52-3\" pgmap=\"52\">The Board reminds us it has a duty to protect the public from unsavory and duplicitous licensees. So it has, a duty imposed on it by the legislature when it enacted the Riverboat Gambling Act. Nothing in section 11.2(a) prevents the Board from moving to revoke Emerald\u2019s license. In fact, the Board began revocation proceedings on March 6, 2001, obviously with something less than dispatch. The May 1999 legislative debates show us the legislature did not intend to tinker with the Board\u2019s authority to revoke Emerald\u2019s license:</p> <blockquote id=\"b52-4\" pgmap=\"52\">\u201cMoore, A: I guess, what I\u2019m trying to determine because the Gaming Board\u2019s authority is so restricted in 11.2. I mean they are told that they have to issue the license.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b52-5\" pgmap=\"52\">Brunsvold: That\u2019s all.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b52-6\" pgmap=\"52\">Moore, A: However ...</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b52-7\" pgmap=\"52\">Brunsvold: This is after the license is issued.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b52-8\" pgmap=\"52\">Moore, A: ... if the terms of the Act are not complied with, completely, then the Gaming Board does have the authority to revoke the license.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b52-10\" pgmap=\"52\">Brunsvold: Any *** violation of this act can be *** grounds for revocation of the license.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b52-11\" pgmap=\"52\">Moore, A: And that will be the Gaming Board\u2019s authority?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b52-12\" pgmap=\"52\">Brunsvold: Exactly.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 91st Ill. Gen. Assem., House Proceedings, May 21, 1999, at 221-22 (statements of Representatives Moore &amp; Brunsvold).</blockquote> <p id=\"b52-13\" pgmap=\"52(166) 53(22)\">We are aware of the \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d principle that statutory language should not be construed to produce an absurd result. People v. Hanna, 207 Ill. 2d 486 (2003). But there is no point to concocting hypothetical scenarios of absurdity in this case. The legislature knew what the result of its amendment would be \u2014 renewal and relocation for a licensee who had held a license since 1992, had operated a gambling casino in Illinois for nearly five years, and had received one-year renewals of that license in 1995 and 1996. Emerald was not an unknown quantity or a new entity. Wise or not, good policy or not, there was nothing absurd about it. It was time to put the license to work. We do not stop to question the legislature\u2019s judgment when it enacted section 11.2(a). \u201cUnder our system of government, courts may not rewrite statutes to make them consistent with their own ideas of orderliness and public policy.\u201d Lawrence v. Regent Realty Group, Inc., 197 Ill. 2d 1, 11, 754 N.E.2d 334 (2001), citing People v. Wright, 194 Ill. 2d 1, 29, 740 N.E.2d 755 (2000).</p> <p id=\"b53-3\" pgmap=\"53\">The claim of absurdity was made and rejected in Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 57 L. Ed. 2d 117, 98 S. Ct. 2279 (1978). There, the Secretary of the Interior, following the terms of the Endangered Species Act, stopped the near completion of the Tellico Dam and declared the area the critical habitat of the snail darter. The Court affirmed the decision of the Secretary:</p> <blockquote id=\"b53-4\" pgmap=\"53\">\u201cConcededly, this view of the Act will produce results requiring the sacrifice of the anticipated benefits of the project and of many millions of dollars in public funds. But examination of the language, history, and structure of the legislation under review here indicates beyond doubt that Congress intended endangered species to be afforded the highest of priorities.\u201d Tennessee Valley Authority, 437 U.S. at 174, 57 L. Ed. 2d at 134, 98 S. Ct. at 2292.</blockquote> <p id=\"b53-5\" pgmap=\"53\">We believe our conclusion is consistent with the cases we have cited. To summarize, we make three observations.</p> <p id=\"b53-6\" pgmap=\"53\">First, most importantly, legislative purpose, considered in light of history and circumstances, is affirmed by our reading of section 11.2(a). Cf. Woodard, 175 Ill. 2d at 444.</p> <p id=\"b53-7\" pgmap=\"53\">Second, this is not the kind of situation reflected in the decisions that hold a statutory \u201cshall\u201d is directory. That is, section 11.2(a) does not require a public officer or body to do or not do something within a particular period of time. Cf. Brennan, 336 Ill. App. 3d 749. The amendment does not rest on mere technicalities. Cf. Simmons, 142 Ill. App. 3d 1077. A directory reading is not required by some societal interest. Cf. In re Armour, 59 Ill. 2d 102. This is not a case where legislative purpose would be frustrated by a mandatory reading. Cf. Advanced Imaging, 335 Ill. App. 3d 746. Nor is the constitutional separation of powers doctrine at issue. Cf. Flores, 104 Ill. 2d 40.</p> <p id=\"b53-8\" pgmap=\"53\">Third, a mandatory reading protects the rights and benefits the legislature intended to extend to Emerald. Cf. Newkirk, 109 Ill. 2d 28.</p> <p id=\"b53-9\" pgmap=\"53\">B. The wording of the amendment</p> <p id=\"b53-10\" pgmap=\"53(102) 54(42)\">The Board is correct when it says a mandatory reading of \u201cshall\u201d in section 11.2(a) would create an exception to the license renewal requirements of section 7 of the Act (230 ILCS 10/7 (West 2002)). The question for us is whether that is what the legislature intended to do when it added section 11.2(a). Generally, when the legislature uses certain words in one instance and different words in another, different results were intended. Costello v. Governing Board of Lee County Special Education Ass\u2019n, 252 Ill. App. 3d 547, 558, 623 N.E.2d 966 (1993). Here, section 11.2(a) consists of one sentence. The words \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cshall\u201d are separated by 23 words. The legislature used \u201cmay\u201d for the nonoperating licensee\u2019s authority to apply for renewal and relocation, and it used \u201cshall\u201d for the Board\u2019s obligation to grant the application. That indicates a purposeful selection of words.</p> <p id=\"b54-3\" pgmap=\"54\">In addition, section 11.2(a) refers specifically to sections 3(c) and 7(j) of the Act, but makes no reference to section 7(g), a seeming rebuttal to the Board\u2019s claim that the legislature could not have intended to disregard standards for renewal and relocation contained in other parts of the Act.</p> <p id=\"b54-4\" pgmap=\"54\">We also note the legislature twice used \u201cshall\u201d in section 11.2(b) of the Act when establishing requirements for levels of minority and female ownership. It is apparent to us that there is nothing permissive about those requirements. Section 11.2(b) was enacted at the same time as section 11.2(a).</p> <p id=\"b54-5\" pgmap=\"54\">C. Legislative debates</p> <p id=\"b54-6\" pgmap=\"54\">Parsing legislative debates is a risky business. Here, each side finds some solace in the debates. Probably the most telling exchange took place during the questioning of Representative Brunsvold, the House sponsor:</p> <blockquote id=\"b54-7\" pgmap=\"54\">\u201cScott: Okay. Well, there\u2019s language, and I believe it\u2019s Section 11.2, that says that, \u2018the Gaming Board shall grant the application.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t sound like they have much, as much authority there.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b54-8\" pgmap=\"54\">Brunsvold: As long as they follow the regulations and the license pathway to obtaining that license, yes, then the Gaming Board will approve it.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b54-9\" pgmap=\"54\">Scott: The Gaming Board will approve it. So, if they meet those two conditions that you talked about, then the Gaming Board has to approve it.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b54-10\" pgmap=\"54\">Brunsvold: Yes. Yes.\u201d 91st Ill. Gen. Assem., House Proceedings, May 21, 1999, at 208 (statements of Representatives Scott &amp; Brunsvold).</blockquote> <p id=\"b54-11\" pgmap=\"54\">The statements of a bill\u2019s sponsor matter when discerning legislative intent. Illinois Federation of Teachers v. Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board, 278 Ill. App. 3d 954, 959, 664 N.E.2d 107 (1996).</p> <p id=\"b54-12\" pgmap=\"54\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b54-13\" pgmap=\"54(40) 55(12)\">Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s order granting the Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment, reverse the trial court\u2019s order denying Emerald and Rosemont\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and remand to the circuit court with instructions to enter summary judgment in favor of Emerald and Rosemont and proceed in accordance with this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b55-3\" pgmap=\"55\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p> <p id=\"b55-4\" pgmap=\"55\">BURKE, J., concurs.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b39-11\" pgmap=\"39\">Most people who aren\u2019t lawyers think \u201cshall\u201d has a mandatory meaning. The dictionary, for example, defines \u201cshall,\u201d when addressed to another, as \u201cdetermination, compulsion, obligation, or necessity.\u201d Webster\u2019s Deluxe Unabridged Dictionary 1666 (2d ed. 1979). Certainly, the biblical injunctions that until recently graced the rotunda of the Alabama supreme court building ordinarily are not thought of as suggestions.</p> </footnote> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b55-5\" pgmap=\"55\">JUSTICE CAHILL,</author> <p id=\"AL\" pgmap=\"55\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b55-6\" pgmap=\"55\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that exhaustion of remedies does not apply in this case. The flaw I see in the majority opinion is a failure to distinguish between an agency\u2019s clear power to construe a statute it is charged with administering, and its lack of power to construe its own statute in such a way that exceeds its authority.</p> <p id=\"b55-7\" pgmap=\"55\">It is not a fair reading of Illinois law to say that whenever the question is one of pure statutory construction, with no issues of fact involved, the circuit court may entertain a declaratory judgment action to construe the statute. If that were the case, the exception would devour the rule. Whenever a party felt aggrieved by an agency\u2019s anticipated interpretation of a statute it is charged with administering, the party could abandon administrative review in mid-course and seek a declaratory judgment to correct the agency\u2019s anticipated blunder. That is, in fact, what happened here.</p> <p id=\"b55-8\" pgmap=\"55\">A party to an administrative proceeding may always file a declaratory judgment action challenging the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d or authority of the administrative agency to render an anticipated decision. See County of Knox ex rel. Masterson v. Highlands, L.L.C., 188 Ill. 2d 546, 553, 723 N.E.2d 256 (1999) (defining an agency\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to include an element of statutory authority). If the agency is without authority, the court may proceed. If, on the other hand, the agency has the authority to make the decision, the failure to exhaust administrative remedies must result in the dismissal of the action and remand to the agency. Here, neither the majority nor the circuit court asked the question: Does the Illinois Gaming Board (Board) have the authority to decide the meaning of section 11.2(a) of the Riverboat Gambling Act (the Act) (230 ILCS 10/11.2(a) (West 2002))? A review of the majority\u2019s own citations makes clear that our supreme court has invoked a \u201cpure statutory construction\u201d exception only when the ultimate issues in the case turn on the authority of the agency to make the challenged interpretation.</p> <p id=\"b55-9\" pgmap=\"55(34) 56(85)\">In Knox County, the court applied the statutory construction exception where the agency\u2019s authority to define a hog facility under the Counties Code (55 ILCS 5/1 \u2014 1001 et seq. (West 1998)) was attacked. Knox County, 188 Ill. 2d 546. At issue was whether a hog facility fell within the \u201cagricultural purposes\u201d exemption from zoning regulation. Knox County, 188 Ill. 2d at 556. Our supreme court intervened to block the zoning board\u2019s anticipated interpretation after finding, in reliance on the plain meaning of \u201cagricultural purposes\u201d gleaned from sources outside the Counties Code, that the phrase could never be construed to give the board authority to regulate a hog facility. Knox County, 188 Ill. 2d at 556-57.</p> <p id=\"b56-3\" pgmap=\"56\">Similarly, in Office of the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney v. Illinois Local Labor Relations Board, 166 Ill. 2d 296, 652 N.E.2d 301 (1995), the court set aside the exhaustion rule where the anticipated interpretation of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act (5 ILCS 315/1 et seq. (West 1992)) by the Labor Relations Board would place assistant State\u2019s Attorneys within the board\u2019s authority to regulate. At issue was whether assistant State\u2019s Attorneys were nonmanagerial employees entitled to engage in collective bargaining. Cook County, 166 Ill. 2d at 300. The court found the board\u2019s expertise was not implicated because the issue could be resolved by relying on the statute granting power to the State\u2019s Attorney and case law describing the position of the assistant State\u2019s Attorney. Cook County, 166 Ill. 2d at 305-06. The court concluded that assistant State\u2019s Attorneys were managerial employees as a matter of law, and that the board would exceed its authority if it found otherwise. Cook County, 166 Ill. 2d at 302.</p> <p id=\"b56-4\" pgmap=\"56\">The court in Getto v. City of Chicago, 77 Ill. 2d 346, 396 N.E.2d 544 (1979), concluded the exhaustion rule did not apply where the agency lacked authority to grant the relief requested by the aggrieved party. The plaintiff sought to enjoin collection of an invalid tax by the City of Chicago. Getto, 11 Ill. 2d at 352. The court held exhaustion would not provide the plaintiff with an adequate remedy because the Illinois Commerce Commission, while having authority to grant a refund, lacked authority to suspend the tax. Getto, 77 Ill. 2d at 356-57.</p> <p id=\"b56-5\" pgmap=\"56(117) 57(83)\">These cases do not support application of the statutory construction exception here, where the statute under consideration is one that the Board administers and its anticipated interpretation, while arguably incorrect, does not implicate the Board\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction\u201d or authority under the statute. It is undisputed that the Board is charged with the exclusive jurisdiction to administer the Act, including section 11.2(a). It is also undisputed that the Board has \u201cjurisdiction\u201d or authority to consider and ultimately grant or deny an application under section 11.2(a). The precise issue is whether the Board has discretion to deny an application where the applicant has shown: (1) it was not conducting riverboat gambling on January 1, 1998; and (2) there has been approval from the municipality or county in which the applicant wishes to relocate. As the majority points out, this is an issue involving the construction of section 11.2(a). But this is also an isr sue that involves the Board\u2019s particular expertise to construe its own statute. See People ex rel. Birkett v. City of Chicago, 202 Ill. 2d 36, 48-49, 779 N.E.2d 875 (2002). The statutory construction exception to the exhaustion rule does not fit under these facts.</p> <p id=\"b57-3\" pgmap=\"57\">I also find troubling the majority\u2019s alternative finding that exhaustion would be futile and cause Emerald Casino, Inc. (Emerald), substantial harm. The majority has not explained, nor does the record indicate, the basis for this conclusion. Even assuming there were clear indications that the Board would ultimately deny Emerald\u2019s application, this is not enough to avoid the exhaustion requirement. See Castaneda v. Illinois Human Rights Comm\u2019n, 132 Ill. 2d 304, 328, 547 N.E.2d 437 (1989). While Emerald suggests that the Board is dragging its feet and has shown it intends to delay a decision \u201cto death,\u201d these allegations are conclusory. It is unfair to say that the Board has delayed action in deciding Emerald\u2019s application where there has been an ongoing investigation into alleged misconduct by Emerald. The Board has the right under the Act to suspend or revoke a license as it sees fit. 230 ILCS 10/5(11), (15) (West 2002). Nothing in the Act directs the Board to address an application for renewal and relocation under section 11.2(a) before revocation is addressed.</p> <p id=\"b57-4\" pgmap=\"57\">While I believe this case should have been dismissed in the circuit court on exhaustion principles, I will comment briefly on the majority\u2019s analysis of section 11.2(a). The majority opinion assumes that the interpretation of section 11.2(a) turns on the meaning of the word \u201cshall.\u201d Of course \u201cshall\u201d means \u201cshall.\u201d But our inquiry does not end there. We must consider \u201cshall\u201d in context, and decide what our legislature intended when it said the \u201cBoard shall grant the application.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 230 ILCS 10/11.2(a) (West 2002). To avoid an absurd result, \u201capplication\u201d should be construed to mean an application free from substantive defects enumerated in the Act. If an admitted convicted felon filed an application under section 11.2(a), the Board has a statutory (and perhaps under their oath as Board members, a constitutional) duty to deny the application. Under Emerald\u2019s analysis, with which the majority agrees, the Board must disregard this duty and award the license. The majority dismisses this absurd result with a vague reference to a case involving snail darters. Citing only the legislative history (and conceding that \u201ceach side finds some solace in the debates\u201d), the majority concludes that the Board must grant Emerald\u2019s license without regard to the regulatory provisions of the Act. 346 Ill. App. 3d at 36-37. This cannot be what the legislature intended.</p> <p id=\"b58-2\" pgmap=\"58\">In fact, the legislature codified its intent in section 2 of the Act, saying: \u201cWhile authorization of riverboat gambling will enhance investment, development and tourism in Illinois, it is recognized that it will do so successfully only if public confidence and trust in the credibility and integrity of the gambling operations and the regulatory process is maintained.\u201d 230 ILCS 10/2(b) (West 2002). To serve this purpose, the \u201cregulatory provisions of this Act are designed to strictly regulate the facilities, persons, associations and practices related to gambling operations.\u201d 230 ILCS 10/2(b) (West 2002).</p> <p id=\"b58-3\" pgmap=\"58\">A reading of section 11.2(a) that does not offend the express legislative intent is one that interprets \u201cshall\u201d to mean \u201cshall\u201d but only where the application complies with all other provisions of the Act. These provisions require a truthful, candid application from anyone seeking a gaming license in Illinois. As summarized by the Board in its motion to dismiss Emerald\u2019s complaint, Emerald\u2019s application was defective in the following ways:</p> <blockquote id=\"b58-4\" pgmap=\"58\">\u201c(1) Emerald failed to truthfully and accurately disclose the facts and circumstances surrounding Emerald\u2019s selection of Rosemont as its relocation site;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b58-5\" pgmap=\"58\">(2) Emerald failed to truthfully and accurately disclose the facts and circumstances surrounding various meetings between Emerald management and prospective Emerald shareholders, including Marvin Davis and Richard Duchossois;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b58-6\" pgmap=\"58\">(3) Emerald failed to truthfully and accurately disclose the degree of involvement of Kevin Flynn in various Emerald activities;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b58-7\" pgmap=\"58\">(4) Emerald failed to truthfully and accurately disclose certain agreements relating to the construction of a casino in Rosemont and ownership interests in Emerald; and</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b58-8\" pgmap=\"58\">(5) Emerald failed to conduct usual and customary due diligence regarding any prospective shareholders, resulting in, among other problems, Emerald and Donald Flynn entering into agreements to sell shares in Emerald to individuals who are associated with persons who have been identified as members and associates of organized crime.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b58-9\" pgmap=\"58\">I cannot believe it was the intent of the legislature that a request for renewal and relocation of a gaming license based on an application saddled with these allegations must he granted by the Board before those allegations are aired and resolved. The reading mocks the heightened scrutiny built into the Act and casts a cloud over an industry that the legislature clearly intended to be closely regulated.</p> <p id=\"b58-10\" pgmap=\"58\">The order of the circuit court should be reversed and the case remanded with directions to dismiss the complaint.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
