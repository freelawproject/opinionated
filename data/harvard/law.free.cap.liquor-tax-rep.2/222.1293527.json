No such requirement is contained in section 28 of the Liquor Tax Law, under which this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>proceeding is brought. Subdivision 2 of that section provides that any citizen of the State may institute such a proceeding as this.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The other questions have been decided adversely to the claim of the holder of the certificate by the Appellate Division of this department.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">An order may be entered revoking and cancelling the liquor tax certificate, with costs to the petitioner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
