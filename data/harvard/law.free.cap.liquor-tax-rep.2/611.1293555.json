It appears that the respondent carried on business in the place for which he had paid the liquor tax, namely, the northwest corner of the Bowery and Stratton\u2019s Walk, but he had not paid the liquor tax. for a trafficking in liquors on the premises on the northeast corner of the Bowery and Schweickert\u2019s Walk and hence, the selling of liquors in that place, as testified to by petitioner\u2019s witnesses, was a violation of the provisions of the Liquor Tax Law; it was another room, in another building.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">The proof is sufficient and calls for the conclusion that there was, likewise, a violation in the trafficking in liquor on Sunday, September 1st, 1901.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">Motion for final order as prayed for in the petition is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
