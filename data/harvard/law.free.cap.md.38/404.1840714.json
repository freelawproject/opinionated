We suppose it is true, that it is the duty of an insurance company, if it intends to object to defects in the proofs of loss, to call for further and better proofs as soon as the defective proofs are furnished, and that the authorities treat its failure to notify the insured of such defects in his proofs as a waiver of objection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-8\">But this waiver cannot be extended to embrace substantial defects in the proofs <em>not known to the company </em>when the proofs were furnished.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-9\">In this case it is proved by one of the plaintiffs that he procured the affidavits of Smouse, Shields and Topper to the proofs of loss, <em>and that none of them ivere agents of the plaintiffs.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-10\">It was also proved, that this fact was not known to the defendant until it was proved at the trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-11\">It will be observed that although Boblitz, who was an agent of the plaintiffs, signed the proofs of loss, <em>he did not swear to them, </em>nor did B. E. Deford, altho\u00fcgh he was present when'the affidavits were made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-12\">There was not merely <em>a neglect </em>to comply with the 15th by-law, but a-deliberate violation without any apparent reason, unless the agent and the'principal were'unwilling to swear' to the statement, and preferred to put that responsibility upon others. <em>Reynolds vs. Mutual Fire Ins.

Co., </em>5 <em>Denio, </em>326.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-5\">At the time the policy was signed, the plaintiffs <em>had no other insuranceon the building, </em>nor was there any insurance on it to the amount stated in the application of $7000. There was a policy of $4000 on the building held by Appold <em>&amp; </em>Deford, trustees of Jones <em>&amp; </em>Son, to cover their interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-6\">There was at the time the defendant\u2019s policy was issued, and at the date of the application, a policy of $5000 in the Union Eire Insurance Company of Baltimore, dated May 2nd, 1871, but running from May 1st 1871.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b421-7\">The application does not state this insurance. The warranty was thus broken, and consequently the policy was void. <em>Flanders on Ins., </em>205 <em>&amp; </em>92; <em>State Mu. Ins.

It was signed, as is apparent upon its face, by an agent of the company, was verified by affidavit, and was sent to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>defendant within thirty days after the fire occurred. If there were any defect in the preliminary proof, the facts proved, and set forth in the plaintiffs\u2019 prayer, clearly establish a waiver of the requirements of the policy. <em>Citizens\u2019 Fire Ins.

The application was drawn up by Pole, the company\u2019s own agent, and is to be construed most strongly against the company. As there was $4000 of insurance on the same building in the name of the trustees, and as Pole, who was Treasurer of the Planters\u2019 Mutual Company, had agreed for $3000 of insurance on that building in the last named company, the statement in the application was strictly true; and the proof in regard to these items does not contradict, vary, or add- to, but only explains the terms of the application. <em>Plumb vs. Cataraugus Ins. Co., 18 N. Y., </em>392; <em>Rowley vs. Empire Ins. Co., </em>36 <em>N. Y., </em>550; <em>North Amn. F. I. Co. vs. Throop, </em>22 <em>Mich., </em>146; <em>Mince vs. Phoenix Ins.

J., </em>86.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-8\">2. The application did not become part of the policy. The language of the policy should rather be construed to make the <em>description of the property, </em>as contained in the application, a part of the policy. <em>French vs. Chenango </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number><em>Mut.

The question of a substantial compliance depends upon the materiality of the representation, which is a question for the jury. That it is not material in this case is very clear.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-6\">3. Even if the meaning of the policy is that the application was made part of it, it does not follow that all its statements are warranties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-7\">Policies of insurance are to be construed like other contracts, and all parts of the instrument are to be considered, to ascertain the intention. The provision in the written part of the <em>policy </em>\u2014 \u201d <em>All other insurances permitted without notice,\u201d </em>\u2014 conclusively shows that the statement referred to was not meant to be a warranty. <em>Flanders on Ins., </em>43; <em>Kimball vs. Howard Ins.

Co., </em>8 <em>Gray, </em>36.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-9\">The defendant\u2019s fifth prayer assumes, that the statement in the plaintiffs\u2019 application, that they proposed \u201can insurance of $4000 on leather and hides tanned and in process of tanning, in addition to $-now on same in other Companies,\u201d was a warranty incorporated in the policy, to the effect that there would be no insurance in other Companies, on the stock, at the time when the said application might reach the defendant; and charges as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>bread} of 'the warranty the insurance on stock made with the Union Company, on the day of the date of said application.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-4\">The defendant\u2019s seventh prayer charges that the obtaining an insurance on the stock in the Union Company, on the same day as that on which the application was dated, avoided the policy in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-5\">The statement of \u201c$-now on same in other Companies,\u201d-does not necessarily import that there was no insurance on stock in other companies, but is more properly to be construed as meaning, in this case, that the amount is immaterial, under .the agreement made between the parties, allowing \u201cother insurance without notice.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b424-7\">Robinson, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AL8\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The plaintiffs, in their application, ffiated May 2nd, 1871. state:</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">\u201cWe propose an insurance in your company on the following described property, * * * to wit: one thousand dollars on Bottle Run Tannery, in addition to the seven thousand dollars on same now in other offices,\u201d * * * also \u201can insurance of $4000 on leather and hides tanned- and in process of tanning,-in addition to $-(dollars) on same in other companies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">On the 6th of May following, the defendant issued the policy on which this suit was brought, and in the printed body of the same was the following written clause:</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\"><em>\u2018c Other insurances permitted without notice, </em>but all other provisions of by-laws retained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">It was proved at the trial, that on the 2nd May, 1871, a policy of $5000 on the stock of leather and hides tanned and in process of tanning, was issued by the U\u00fcion Fire Insurance Company of Baltimore. The defendant\u2019s fifth prayer assumes that the application by the terms of the policy became incorporated into and formed a part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>same, and is to be construed as a warranty of the truth of the facts therein stated as of the day when the policy attached, and if the jury should find' that <em>prior </em>to the acceptance of the defendant\u2019s policy the plaintiffs had insured the stock in the Union Company, they are not entitled to recover. Apart from the question as to whether the application is to be construed as a warranty, the prayer is based upon the general rule that the insured, by his warranty, contracts that whatever may be the state of the facts when the <em>application is </em>made, they shall be as warranted on the day when the <em>policy is accepted.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Mow, conceding for the purposes of this case, that the application is to be construed as a warranty, a question we are not to be understood as deciding; and further, that it attached to the policy as of the day when it was accepted by the plaintiffs, we are of opinion that it does not come within the principle of the rule thus relied on.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The application, it will be admitted, was nota warranty when it was signed and delivered to the defendant, and if it became so afterwards it was by the terms of the policy which the plaintiffs accepted. When it was, however, accepted, there was a written clause in the body of the same, providing, that <em>\u201c other insurances permitted without notice. </em>\u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Ordinarily the insurer requires notice of other insurances, both <em>prior </em>and <em>subsequent </em>\u2014 prior, in order that he may determine whether the insured has any such substantial interest in the property as will guarantee on his part vigilance and care in the preservation of the same, and subsequent,-in order to prevent an over-insurance after the policy is issued. This is a condition, however, which the insurer may waive, and whenever a clause is inserted in the body of the policy, in these words, <em>\u201cother </em>insurances permitted without notice,\u201d we take the rule to be, that the language thus used, is to be construed as applicable to <em>prior </em>as well as <em>subsequent </em>insurances. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>words are general and must be understood as having a general application, unless there is some other clause, showing the parties intended them to be understood in a restricted sense. If the intention be to include only <em>prior </em>or <em>subsequent </em>insurances, then these words ought to be used, in order that it may clearly appear to which of the two reference is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">When the policy of the defendant was accepted and the application of the plaintiffs became thereby a warranty, there was an express provision waiving all notice of either prior or subsequent insurances. What was the necessity, then, of notifying the defendant of an insurance subsequent to the application, but prior to the issuing of the policy? Whatever may have been the duty of the plaintiffs, apart from the terms of such a clause, it cannot be held that such notice was necessary in the face of a <em>waiver </em>so <em>direct </em>and <em>explicit. </em>Then, again, we cannot overlook the fact, that this clause was inserted in writing in the printed body of the policy, thus showing that whatever might have been the requirements of the bylaws in regard to notice of other insurances, it was the purpose of the defendant to waive such requirements, in so far as they affected the plaintiffs ; and as a protection against over-insurance to rely upon the by-law, which provided that the policy should be null and void, if the plaintiffs insured the property above <em>three-fourths </em>of its value. The defendant may have looked upon this provision as affording ample security against over-insurance, and it was therefore unnecessary.to require notice of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The seventh prayer was also properly refused, not only for the reasons above stated, but also because although the policy of the Union Eire Insurance Company was issued on the 2nd May, it does not follow that it was issued prior in point of time to the application signed by the plaintiffs'on the same day\\ It may have been issued at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>a subsequent hour, and the representation of a blank insurance strictly true.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In regard lo the proof of loss, conceding it to be defective, we think the plaintiffs have waived the right to object to it on any such grounds. It was signed by Henry Boblitz, the general agent of the plaintiffs, and if it was not verified by his oath, such defect was apparent on the face of the paper, and it was the duty of the defendant to have notified the plaintiffs of such defect within a reasonable time, in order that they might correct the same. No objection, however, was made to the proof of loss, on this ground, but the record shows that the denial of liability under the policy was placed upon other <em>distinct </em>and <em>independent grounds.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The plaintiffs in their application stated, that they proposed an insurance of one thousand dollars in addition to the <em>seven thousand </em>dollars already on the building in <em>other Companies. </em>It appears there was an insurance at that time of \u00a74000 on the building in the name of Deford &amp; Appold, trustees of Jones, who liad a lien upon the same for unpaid purchase money, and that the plaintiffs had signed an application to the Planters\u2019 Mutual Insurance Company of Washington County, for an insurance of \u00a73000 and had delivered the application to the <em>agent of the Company </em>who was also the <em>agent </em>of the defendant,\u2014 the insurance of the trustees and the proposed insurance thus making seven thousand dollars. The nature and character of the insurance of the trustees was known by the agent, or at least there was evidence offered to show that he was duly informed in regard thereto, and the application to the Washington County Insurance Company was of course known to him, having been made through him, and it also appears that the application was written by him and signed by the plaintiffs. The defendant\u2019s fourth prayer, asked the Court to instruct the jury, if they should find that there was at the time said appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>cation was sent, less than <em>seven thousand </em>dollars of other insurances on the building <em>or the interest </em>of the plaintiffs, they were not entitled to recover, and that the insurance of Deford <em>&amp; </em>Appold, trustees, offered in evidence is not such an insurance as could he considered. In other words, that the statement of seven thousand dollars insurances is to be considered as a warranty that there was insurances on the plaintiffs\u2019 interest to that amount, and not as a statement of the amount of insurances generally on the property \u2014 and further that in ascertaining what the plaintiffs meant, evidence in regard to the insurance of the \u25a0trustees of Jones, was not to be considered. We are of opinion that evidence in regard to the insurance by the trustees, was admissible, and that in determining the question as to whether the plaintiffs meant to represent the insurances of seven thousand dollars as <em>on their interest, </em>or as a statement <em>of the insurances generally on the property, </em>in order that the defendant might judge whether the value of the same was fully covered by policies already issued, this evidence was to be considered by the jury. The grounds on which this evidence was admissible are stated at length under the defendant\u2019s sixth prayer in The Planters\u2019 Mutual Insurance Company of Washington County <em>vs. </em>Deford <em>&amp; </em>Co., ante, 387, and it is unnecessary to repeat them here.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b428-7\">(Decided 2nd July, 1873.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">For these reasons we think the defendant\u2019s fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth prayers were properly refused, and the judgment below will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
