Woollet, of Baltimore, having died in June, 1872, intestate, a hill was filed in July following for the sale of his real estate, for the purpose of making distribution among his heirs; a decree was passed on the 6th of August, 1872, directing the sale to be made, and appointing the appellant trustee for that purpose. In pursuance of this decree, the trustee advertised the pro- \u25a0 perty for sale, representing the title as indisputable, and the appellee, Thomas Fryer, became the purchaser of a lot of ground with the improvements,, on Fayette Street, part of said property. On the 22nd of October, 1872, the sale was finally ratified and confirmed. The title of John P. Woollet to the property sold by the appellant as trustee, was founded on a deed from Asenatk Woollet his wife, dated the 1st of December, 1870. There was nothing in the deed to indicate that the grantor and grantee, were husband and wife. Mrs. Woollet died before her husband. On the 24th of January, 1873, the appellee, Fryer, filed his petition alleging the filing of the bill for the sale of Woollet\u2019s real estate, the passing of the decree, and the sale of the property thereunder, and that he became the purchaser of the lot aforesaid, and had complied with the terms of sale, by paying one-third of the purchase money in cash, and giving his two notes for the balance, payable in six and twelve months, with security to the satisfaction of the trustee; that having so complied with the terms of sale, he had taken possession of the property so purchased by him, and believing his title thereto to be good, had commenced to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>make improvements thereon, and in making such, had expended about one hundred and fifty dollars ; it was further alleged, that the claim of title to said property by the said John P. Woollet, was under and by virtue of the deed of the 1st of December, 1870; that it was represented to the petitioner, that Asenath Woollet, at the time of the execution of said deed, was the wife of the said John P. Woollet, the grantee; that the petitioner was threatened with an action of ejectment on behalf of the heirs of the said Asenath, to recover said property and that he was advised that by reason of the coverture of said Asenath, at the time of making said deed, she was not legally capable of conveying the title to any real estate held by her in her own right, and that a legal title to said property could not be conveyed by the trustee under the decree in this cause. The petitioner therefore prayed that the sale made to him might bo rescinded, and the trustee required to refund to him the purchase money, and to pay him the amount expended by him in making improvements, together with the taxes and insurance. The trustee demurred to the petition; the demurrer was overruled, and the Court (Pinkney, J.,) passed an order rescinding the order of ratification, and annulling the sale, but dismissing that part of7 the petition which related to the claim for improvements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">From this order, the petitioner appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b235-6\">The cause was argued before Bartol, C.

Woollet, by deed of 17th October, 1831.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">That during the coverture of the said John P. Wool-let and Asenath, his wife, the said Asenath, on the 1st of December, 1870, executed the deed purporting to convey the property to John P. Woollet. That both husband and wife are dead, and their respective heirs are now the claimants of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">The heirs and representatives of the husband are the only parties to this proceeding, the heirs of the wife, not having been made parties, the complainants relying upon the deed of the 1st of December, 1870, from Asenath Woollet, as vesting a perfect title in her husband, John P. Woollet, and his heirs. In this State, prior to the Acts of 1715, ch. 47; 1752, ch. 8, and 1766, ch. 14, no other mode of conveying the real estate of a <em>feme covert, </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>recognized, except the forms known to the common law, by fine or common recovery; and as to any separate interest in personal chattels, belonging to the wife, it was totally unknown to the common law.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b237-14\">(Decided 25th June, 1873.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The above named statutes \u2019were intended to supply a better and less cumbersome method of conveyance of her estate. <em>Lawrence vs. </em>Heister, 3 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>376.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The statute of 4 William 4, ch. 74, had abolished the common law modes in England. There is no doubt the rights and capacities of the wife have been greatly extended since the passage of these Acts, and by the provisions of the Code, the <em>feme covert </em>has been still further relieved of much of her antecedent disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Her powers over her property, not only as to its security and protection, but as to her disposal of the same, whether real or personal, are much enlarged, and the form of conveyance thereof simplified.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The wife may eonvey her property absolutely by a joint deed with her husband, or encumber it by mortgage, and she may execute and acknowledge the deed, mortgage, or bill of sale, as other grantors or bargainors, without private examination, as formerly required of her, and may relinquish her mere dower, by deed, with or without her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Notwithstanding this enlargement of her powers by the provisions of the Code, they still expressly require that her husband shall join in the deed for the conveyance of her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">These statutory directions cannot be disregarded by the Courts, and the deed of December 1st, 1870, from Asenath Woollet, at that time the wife of John P. Woollet, not having been executed in conformity with the law authorizing the conveyance of her property, cannot vest in the husband her estate in the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">The order of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">7 <em>Order affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
