E. Co., in the construction of its bridge across the Potomac river at Harper\u2019s Perry, made an embankment or precipice twenty feet deep, extending from the end or abutment of the bridge along the river, and near the highway leading to the bridge. The embankment was supported by a wall erected by the company, the top of which was on a level with the highway and the contiguous ground; there was no railing or guards at and along the wall, or light to indicate the entrance to the bridge, or watchman for the protection of travellers. A person who had paid the toll collected by the company, in attempting to walk upon the bridge for the purpose of crossing about 9 o\u2019clock at night, missed his way and fell over the embankment or precipice, sustaining serious injury. Between the highway leading to the bridge, and the retaining wall or edge of the precipice, there was a space of ground belonging to the Eailroad company over which the person had to pass before he reached the place from which he fell, which was about ten or fifteen feet from the entrance to the bridge. The whole surface of the ground about the highway, up to the entrance to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>bridge, and out to the edge of the retaining wall, or verge of the precipice was levelled off smooth; there was nothing to indicate the location or line of the highway, or to distinguish it from the contiguous ground on the west side, and a deviation of a few steps in that direction precipitated the person over the wall. In an action by the injured person against the Railroad company, the latter contended that inasmuch as the accident did not happen upon the highway or the bridge, but on the private property of the defendant where, as it was alleged, the plaintiff had no right to be, he was not entitled to recover. Held :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b581-5\">1st.

That under the law it was the duty of the defendant in constructing its bridge and making the lateral embankments adjoining the highway, so to construct them as not to render the approach to the bridge along the highway dangerous for passengers by day or night; and a failure to perform this duty subjected it to liability for the consequences; provided the party thereby injured had used reasonable and ordinary care to avoid the danger.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b581-7\">On the trial of an action to recover damages for injuries sustained by the plaintiff from an accident caused by the alleged negligence of the defendant, where the facts are numerous, it is not proper to separate a few from their connection with others by which their force and meaning are, or may be materially modified, and ask the Court to instruct the jury that these enumerated facts are evidence to show a want of ordinary care on the part of the plaintiff in avoiding, and the exercise of due care by the defendant in preventing the accident by which the plaintiff was injured.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b581-8\">On the trial of an action to recover damages for injuries sustained by the plaintiff falling over an embankment, in consequence of the alleged negligence of the defendant, it is not competent for the latter, to enable the jury to ascertain the loss suffered by the plaintiff, and the amount of compensation to which he was entitled, to show that for a long time prior and up to the time of tire injury, and since, he was a man of intemperate habits, and when intoxicated was unable to transact business, and by his excessive intemperance had greatly abused himself.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-9\">Appeal from the Circuit Court lor Washington County.

The defendant then proved by W. S. Brashears that he had known the plaintiff for twenty-five years, and knew his habits ; that on the night of the accident he saw him about seven o\u2019clock, in a barber\u2019s shop at Harper\u2019s Ferry, very much intoxicated \u2014 he was quarrelling with a stranger then being shaved. The defendant then offered to prove by said witness that the plaintiff was a most intemperate man for a long time before, and up to the time of the injury; was an habitual drunkard during all that time, and would become intoxicated whenever he could get the liquor; that he often went to Harper\u2019s Ferry, andnever went there without becoming intoxicated if he had money to get the liquor, and when intoxicated was unable to attend to any business whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-5\">To the proof so -offered, the plaintiff objected, and the Court, (Motter and Pearre, J.,) sustained the objection, and the defendant thereupon excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-6\"><em>Defendant\u2019s Second Exception. </em>\u2014 The defendant, further to maintain the issue on its part joined, offered to prove by several witnesses that the plaintiff since his injury, and up to the trial, had continued to be a very intemperate man, often getting very drunk, and under the influence of liquor whenever he could get it, and by his excessive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>intemperance had greatly abused himself.

The defendant further proved by Mr. Woods, that during the spring following the accident, he asked the plaintiff how it happened, and he replied, fihe could not tell anything about it; he did not know anything about it.\u201d Other evidence adduced at the trial will be found in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-6\">The plaintiff offered eight prayers ; the third, fourth, seventh and eight, of which the Court granted, the others it rejected.

If the jury find from the evidence in the cause, that the plaintiff, at the time he received the injury sued for, was seeking to pass from the Galt House, by a common highway, to the entrance of the carriage and foot-way upon the defendant\u2019s -bridge at Harper\u2019s Ferry, in the night time, and when it was dark, and could, by the use of ordinary care on his part, have avoided the injury, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>he cannot recover, even though they shall find that the place at which he fell over was one dangerous to persons passing along said highway in the night time, provided the jury shall find that but for the want of such ordinary care the injury would not have happened.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-5\">2. If the jury shall find from the evidence that the defendant, in erecting its bridge over the Potomac river, at Harper\u2019s Ferry, and its connecting works and protections, erected the wall over which the plaintiff fell and was injured, and by such erection created and made a place so near to the said highway as to be dangerous to persons passing along said highway, in the nighttime, and exercising ordinary care and caution, and that the plaintiff, while endeavoring to pass along said highway to the entrance of the foot and carriage-way on the defendant\u2019s bridge, in the night time, and when it was' dark, and while capable of and in the exercise of ordinary caro and caution, walked over said wall at a part thereof so near to the said highway as to be dangerous to persons passing along said highway in the night time, and exercising ordinary care or caution, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover ; provided they shall find that such place was made dangerous as aforesaid by the defendant, <em>after </em>said highway was established leading to the entrance of said way over said bridge : hut if the jury find that such highway, leading to said bridge, was not established until after the said bridge was built, then there was no obligation on the part of the defendant to put guards at such place to prevent accident to persons passing along said highway and seeking to enter said bridge ; and the plaintiff is not entitled to recover for an accident which may have happened to him for the want of such guards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-6\">To the rejection of its prayers as above indicated, and to the second instruction given by the Court, the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Yerdict was rendered for the plaintiff for $3000, and judgment was entered accordingly.

Hamilton, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-7\">The ruling of the Court was wrong in rejecting the evidence offered hy the defendant in its first and second exceptions. In assessing compensation to the plaintiff, \u201cthe jury are to consider what, before the injury complained of, was the health, and physical and mental ability of the plaintiff to maintain himself, as compared with his condition in those particulars, after and up to the institution of the suit, in consequence of the injury complained of, and how far it is permanent in its results, as well as the physical and mental suffering he has sustained by the injury.\u201d <em>Stockton vs. Frey, </em>4 <em>Gill, </em>406; 2 <em>Greenleaf\u2019s Ev., sec. </em>254, note; <em>Lincoln vs. Saratoga and Sch\u2019y R. R. Co., </em>23 <em>Wendell, </em>425.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-8\">, The evidence offered by the defendant and rejected hy the Court, shows that the plaintiff was an habitual drunkard, and that by reason of his intemperate habits he possessed neither physical nor mental ability to support himself before he sustained the injury, and that his incapacity to support himself, from the same cause, continued after the injury. This evidence was admissible on the question of damages, to show that from habitual drunkenness the physical and mental ability of the plaintiff had been so impaired that he was utterly incapable of making a living, and that his pecuniary loss, and the injury to his business, amounted to nothing. <em>Sherman and Redfield on Negligence, </em>663, <em>note </em>1, <em>sec. </em>606; <em>Wade vs. Leroy, </em>20 <em>Howard, </em>34.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-9\">It is to be observed, that the plaintiff was not a passenger on the Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road, hut a trav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>eller on the highway, and the defendant is not sited for injuries received on the railroad, but on the bridge ; and the evidence shows, that the place where the injury was received, is beyond the limits of the highway, above and beyond the bridge and its approaches, and above the abutment of the bridge, on ground not occupied and used by the public, but the ground on which is constructed the Y track of the Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Company. The question arises, is it the duty of the defendant to erect railing for miles along the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers, and also along the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, to prevent a drunkard from travelling out of the highway? A traveller on a highway who, without necessity, diverges from the travelled path, cannot recover for injuries received while travelling outside such path. <em>Sherman &amp; Redfield on Negligence, </em>sec. 384; <em>Howard vs. Inhabitants of North Bridgewater, </em>16 <em>Pickering, </em>189 ; <em>Sparhawk vs. City of Salem, </em>1 Allen, 30 ; 2 <em>Hilliard on Torts, </em>397; <em>Rice vs. Town of Montpelier, </em>19 <em>Vermont, </em>470 ; <em>Farnum vs. </em>Concord, 2 <em>N. H., </em>392 ; <em>Howland vs. Vincent, </em>10 <em>Metc., </em>371.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-5\">The plaintiff was twice warned of the danger of crossing the bridge, and twice desisted, but finally started from the Galt House, crossed the Winchester track, and the highway (leading to the bridge) to the private grounds of the defendant, and walked over the wall of the defendant, at a considerable distance beyond the entrance to the bridge. He <em>voluntarily </em>put himself in peril against the protestations of the defendant, and then makes a claim upon the defendant for compensation for the injuries he sustained. He was the author of his own misfortunes \u2014 \u25a0 the heedless instrument of his own injury. Besides being warned of the danger, he well knew it himself. He was frequently in Harper's Ferry, and was well acquainted with the locality. <em>Tisdale vs. Inhabitants of Norton, </em>8 <em>Mete., </em>392 ; <em>Saunders on Negligence, by Hooper, </em>25 ; <em>Shepardson vs. Inhabitants of Colorain, </em>13 <em>Metcalf, </em>55.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>If the facts set forth in the seventh and eighteenth prayers are true, they show, as matter of law, that the plaintiff did not exercise that ordinary care and diligence which will entitle him to recover. They further show, that the defendant used due care in preventing accidents, by reason of any defect in and about the bridge or wall. How far the owner of a bridge is responsible for accidents, in attempting to cross a bridge obviously unsafe or dangerous, or in fording a stream, in such case, are mainly questions of law, calling for special instructions from the Court. See 2 <em>Hilliard on Torts, </em>896, <em>sec. </em>14, <em>and </em>393 <em>and </em>394, <em>sec. </em>11; <em>Rice vs. Montpelier, </em>19 <em>Vermont, </em>470 <em>and </em>476 ; <em>Farnum vs. Concord, 2 N.

R. R. vs. Shipley, </em>31 <em>Md., </em>368; <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. vs. Fitzpatrick, </em>35 <em>Md., </em>46; <em>B. &amp; O. R.

If he was a trespasser at all, in view of the license to the public to walk there, yet he was not a wilful or <em>voluntary </em>trespasser. He was not a wrong doer.

There were numerous and complicated facts from which that question was to be decided ; and this is not one of the class of cases where Courts will take upon themselves the obligation and responsibility of saying, that certain facts, if found, constitute negligence.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_-\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">This suit was brought by the appellee to recover damages for injuries sustained by him, from an accident caused by the alleged negligence of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">The ground of the action is that the Railroad Company in the construction of its bridge across the Potomac, at Harper\u2019s Perry, had made an embankment or precipice twenty feet deep, extending from the end or abutment of the bridge along the river, so near to the highway as to be dangerous to persons approaching the bridge at night; and the plaintiff in attempting to walk upon the bridge for th-e purpose of crossing, missed his way and fell over the precipice. The accident occurred in November, 1867, at about 9 o\u2019clock at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">The embankment is supported by a wall erected by the defendant, the top of which is on a level with the highway and the contiguous ground ; and the alleged negligence consisted in not providing railing or guards at and along the wall, a light to indicate the entrance to the bridge, or a watchman for the protection of travellers.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">On the west side of the bridge next to the retaining wall, there is a highway for common travel, the entrance to which between the columns, is ten feet wide, and by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>the side thereof, between the carriage way and the railroad tracks of the Winchester branch on the west, is a foot-way for travellers; the bridge being designed for ordinary travel in carriages and on foot, as well as for the railways ; the defendant received toll from per sods crossing, and toll was paid by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">There is a space of ground between the highway leading to the bridge, and the retaining wall or edge of the precipice, belonging to the defendant, over which the plaintiff must have passed before he reached the place from which he fell, which according to the testimony, and as indicated on the plat used at the argument, was about ten or fifteen feet from the entrance to the bridge. It thus appears that the accident did not happen upon the highway or the bridge, but outside thereof, on the private property of the defendant, upon which it is alleged the plaintiff had no right to be, and it is contended that this fact deprives him of the right to recover ; and for this proposition we have been referred to <em>Howard vs. Inhabitants of North Bridgewater, </em>16 <em>Pick., </em>189 ; <em>Rice vs. Montpelier, </em>19 <em>Verm., </em>470 ; <em>Farnum vs. Concord, 2 N. H., </em>392, and <em>Howland vs. Vincent, 10 Met., </em>371.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Without stopping now to consider the particular points ruled in those cases, it may be conceded as a general principle that\u00a3\u00a3a traveller who without necessity diverges from the travelled path, cannot recover for injuries received while travelling outside such path.\" But the facts of this case do not bring it within that general principle. It appears from the proof that the whole surface of the ground about the highway, up to the entrance to the bridge, and out to the edge of the retaining Avail or verge of the precipice was levelled off smooth; there was nothing to indicate the location or line of the highway, or to distinguish it from the contiguous ground on the west side, and a deviation of a few steps in that direction precipitated the plaintiff over the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Under such circumstances we hold the law to be clear, both upon reason and authority, that the accidental deviation from the highway such as occurred in this instance, does not necessarily deprive the plaintiff of the right of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The law imposed the duty upon the defendant in constructing its bridge, and making the lateral embankment adjoining the highway ; so to construct them as not to render the approach to the bridge along the highway dangerous for passengers by day or night; and a failure to perform this duty subjects it to liability for the consequences ; provided the party thereby injured has used reasonable and ordinary care to avoid the danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">This proposition is supported by <em>Barnes vs. Ward </em>67 <em>Eng. C. L. R., </em>392, and was affirmed by the Court of Exchequer in <em>Hardcastle vs. S. Y. R. Way, 4 Hurl. &amp; Nor., </em>67. The same principle was decided in <em>Coggswell vs. Inhabitants of Lexington, 4 Cush., </em>307 ; <em>Norris vs. Litchfield, </em>35 <em>N. H., </em>271 ; <em>Davis vs Hill, </em>41 <em>N. H </em>, 329 ; <em>Vale vs. Bliss, </em>50 <em>Barb., </em>358, and <em>Alger vs. City of Lowell, </em>3 Allen, 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">In the case last cited, the Court say, \u201cthe true test is not whether the dangerous place is outside the highway, or whether some small strip of ground, not included in the way, must he traversed in reaching the danger; hut whether there is such a risk of a traveller, using ordinary care, in passing along th\u00e9 street, being thrown or falling into the dangerous place, that a railing is requisite to make the way itself safe and convenient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">It follows from what has been said, that there was no error in refusing the <em>first, second, third, fifth, </em>and <em>seventeenth </em>prayers of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">There was evidence in the case that the plaintiff had often crossed the bridge, and was well acquainted with the place and the contiguous grounds and premises, and that on the evening of the accident, at about 7 o\u2019clock, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>and afterwards, at about 8 o\u2019clock, being about to cross, lie was warned by defendant\u2019s watchman of the danger of crossing the bridge, and that he was intoxicated at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The defendant by its <em>eighteenth </em>prayer, asked an instruction to the jury, that if they found the plaintiff was intoxicated at the time of the accident, and also found that he was admonished of the danger of crossing the bridge, that <em>\u201c </em>these facts were evidence to show a want of .ordinary care to be exercised by the plaintiff, and also to show that the defendant was upon that occasion using due care in preventing accidents by reason of any defect in and about said bridge or said wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Unquestionably the facts enumerated in the prayer were proper to be considered by the jury in connection with all the other facts in the case, in passing upon the question of negligence ; but it has- often been decided by this Court, that it is not proper to separate a few facts from their connection with others, and make them the basis of an instruction of this kind. Such a course would tend to mislead the jury; and if the practice were sanctioned, each separate fact might be made the basis of a similar instruction. It maybe added, that by the <em>txoelfth </em>prayer which was granted, the defendant had the benefit of an instruction, that the intoxication of the plaintiff at the time of the accident, if the jury so found, was a circumstance to be considered by them upon the question of the care exercised by him in avoiding the accident. And so far as the eighteenth prayer related to the warning given to the plaintiff, it was not supported by the evidence; for that showed that the only warning given related to the danger arising from the condition of the bridge, and had no reference to the danger that actually befel him. For these reasons we think the eighteenth prayer was properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The question whether the plaintiff had exercised ordinary and reasonable care to avoid the accident, was one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>for the jury to decide upon all the evidence in the cause ; and there was therefore no error in rejecting defendant\u2019s <em>seventh </em>prayer which asked the Court to take that question from the jury and to decide it as a conclusion of law from the facts therein stated. These were not of such a character as to authorize the Court to withdraw the question from the jury, and to declare that they constituted negligence in law.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b599-9\">(Decided 10th July, 1873.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Upon a careful examination of the whole case, we find no error in the rulings of the Court below upon the prayers. In granting the <em>third </em>and <em>fourth oi </em>the plaintiff and the eight, ninth, tioelfth, <em>fifteenth </em>and <em>sixteenth </em>of the defendant, and in the two instructions given by the Court, the law of the case was clearly and correctly stated to the jury for their direction. It is not material to notice the other prayers of the defendant. These, so far as they stated correct propositions of law were substantially granted in the instructions given to the jury. Their rejection therefore can furnish no ground for reversing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">It remains only to consider the appcdlant\u2019s <em>first </em>and <em>second </em>bills of exception ; and we are of opinion that the evidence therein stated was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">It is contended that it was admissible on the question of damages, to enable the jury to ascertain the loss suffered by the plaintiff, and the amount of compensation to which he was entitled: but evidence that he was a man of intemperate habits, and when intoxicated was unable to transact business could not tend to elucidate that question, and was not admissible for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
