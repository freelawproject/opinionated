To sustain this position he caused the patent of \u201cDixon\u2019s Lot\u201d to be located, and in the location, as made and returned by tlie surveyor to the Land Office, the tenth line of the patent, \u201c S. 54 perches \u201d was omitted.

The caution money was duly paid. On the 11th of May, 1871, the appellee filed a caveat, objecting to the issuing of a patent for the land in question for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-7\">1st. Because the land sought to be patented was included within the limits of an elder patent, issued to the caveator\u2019s ancestor, Thomas Dixon, on the 10th of November, 1695, under the name of \u201cDixon\u2019s Lot.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-8\">2nd. Because the caveator and those under whom he claims, have held exclusive adversary possession of the land in question, for more than twenty years, claiming it under the patent for \u201cDixon\u2019s Lot,\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-9\">3rd. Because all the land covered by the return of the surveyor, is included in the patent for \u201cDixon\u2019s Lot,\u201d and the caveator and those under whom he claims,-have since the 10th of November 1695, been in the possession of it, and claimed the exclusive right to use the same to the present time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-10\">On the 2nd of August, 1871, an order was passed assigning a day for the hearing of the caveat, and authoriz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>ing the surveyor of Somerset county, to lay down any lands which hy either party he might be directed to lay down, to illustrate the matter in dispute ; and leave was given to take depositions before a justice of the peace upon notice. Depositions were taken, and together with the plats were returned to the Land Office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-5\">On the 24th of May, 1872, the Commissioner of the Land Office passed an order ruling the caveat good ; from this order the present appeal is-taken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-6\">The cause was submitted on briefs to Bartol, C. J., Stewart, Bowie, Brent, Miller and Robinson, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-7\"><em>William S. Waters, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-8\"><em>John H.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ASq\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">This appeal is taken from a decision of the Commissioner of the Land Office, sustaining the caveat of the appellee, against the issuing of a patent for a parcel of land lying in Somerset county, called \u201c Whealton\u2019s Defeat,\u201d which had been surveyed and returned as vacant, under a special warrant obtained by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">The caveator contends that the land sought to be patented, is included within the limits of an elder patent, issued to <em>Thomas Dixon, </em>on the 10th day of November, 1695, under the name of <em>\u201c Dixon\u2019s Lot.\u201d </em>To sustain this position he caused the patent of <em>\u201cDixon\u2019s Lot,\u201d </em>to be located, and the plats with the testimony were returned to the Land Office. From, an examination of these it appears that the appellee has failed to make a true location of \u201cDixon\u2019s Lot,\u201d as described in the patent. In the location actually made as returned by the surveyor, the tenth line of the patent \u201c <em>S. </em>54 <em>Perches,\u201d 'was </em>omitted. There is a variance of ten perches in the ninth line, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>which according to the patent is <em>N, </em>55\u00b0 <em>W. </em>44 perches, in the surveyor\u2019s return, it is stated as 54 perches. The nineteenth line of the patent is N. 32\u00b0 E. 180 perches, in the location this is the eighteenth line and is stated to he N. 52\u00b0 E. 180 perches, but this variance in the course may not be material, as this line calls for \u201cthe mouth of a creek issuing out of the sound called Flat-Cap. Creek,\u201d which- call, if established by proof, would control the course as indicated in the patent.- <em>Wilson vs. </em>Inloes, 6 <em>Gill, </em>121.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The entire omission of the <em>tenth </em>line of the patent, in the location made by the surveyor, however, is fatal to the case of the appellee, and compels us to reverse the decision of the commission But \u2019 the case will be remanded in order that the caveator may have an opportunity to cause \u201cDixon\u2019s Lot,\u201d to be correctly located according to the patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In a petition filed in this Court on behalf of the appellee, it has-been stated that the Commissioner upon discovering the variance between the patent and the location, proceeded to ascertain, by protracting the lines on the plat returned, the true outlines of the patent courses to the end of the 12th course, and determined that the error in the location \u201cmade ho substantial difference, so far as the subject-matter in controversy was concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">We are not called upon now to decide in what manner and under what circumstances it would be in the power of the Commissioner to cause corrections to be made in the plats returned to his .office, for the purpose of showing the true locations ; it does not appear in this case that any such corrections were made, he has not so certified in the record, by which alone this Court must be guided.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">On the question of costs, the appellee represents that the errors in locating <em>\u201cDixon\u2019s Lot,\u201d </em>were caused by an incorrect copy of the patent having been furnished to him from the Land Office, and the - erroneous copy has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>filed with the petition. It appears, however, from the record that a correct copy of the patent was filed in the case before it was decided belotv, there is no good reason therefore, why the costs of this appeal should not be paid by the appellee. The costs of the proceedings in the Land Office will abide the ultimate decision of the case.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b97-5\">(Decided 22nd May, 1873.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\n<em>Order reversed and came remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
