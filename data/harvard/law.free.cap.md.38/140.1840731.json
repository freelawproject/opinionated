Before Crone was allowed to testify, he was at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>instance of the prisoner\u2019s counsel examined as to the circumstances under which the confession was made, for the purpose of ascertaining whether any promise or threat or inducement to confess, had been made to the prisoner which would render the confession inadmissible, and proved that it had been made voluntarily and without being induced by any promise or threat whatsoever. At the instance of the prisoner\u2019s counsel leave was given by the Court for further testimony on the subject to be offered on both sides; and Thomas Nicholson on the part of the prisoner, testified that he was present at the interview between the prisoner and the witness Crone at which the confession was made, and that Crono sat down by the prisoner and said to Mm: \u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake if yon know any tiling about this case, let it out before Hollohan squeals: for if you do not, he will squeal before you, and you will get the worse of it,\u201d and that this was said by Crone before any statement or confession was made by the prisoner. John English, who was present at the same interview, testified that \u201cneither before the confession was made by the prisoner, nor at any other time during the interview, did Crone say to the prisoner the words testified to by Thomas Nicholson, or any thing whatever to the like import.\u201d Crone was then re-called and contradicted Nicholson, and swore that \u201che did not before the statement was made by the prisoner, or at any other time make use of, or say to him, the words or expressions testified to by the witness Thomas Nicholson.\u201d Both Crone and English testified substantially to the same facts. They both stated that just after they entered the room of the station house, where the prisoner was confined, Thomas Nicholson being' with them, the prisoner spoke first to Crone and said <em>\u201cIwant to tell you all about this ease.\u201d </em>Crone then said to him <em>\u201cJosh! let it be the truth; and let it be of your own free will and consent;\u201d </em>or according to the recollection of English, Crone\u2019s answer was, <em>\u201cthen I 'want yon to tell me the truth about this </em>thing, <em>and malee a clean breast of it;\u201d </em>and the prisoner then went on to make his statement.

The indictment was in the usual form of an indictment for murder. The prisoners were arraigned in the said Criminal Court on the 31st of March, 1873, and severally .pleaded not guilty ; and on the same day, upon their suggestion and affidavit, that they could not have a fair and impartial trial in said Criminal Court, the Court ordered and directed the record and proceedings in said cause to be transmitted to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel county for trial; which was accordingly done. The case was tried before a jury duly empannelled in the said Circuit Court for Anne Arundel county, on the 7th of May, 1873, at the April Term of said Court. The prisoners were jointly tried, and on the 9th of May, 1873, the jury rendered a verdict of \u201cguilty of murder in the first degree,\u201d against each of the prisoners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-7\"><em>Exception. </em>\u2014 At the trial of this cause, the State, after having introduced other evidence tending to establish the guilt of the accused, called to the stand <em>William Grone, </em>a competent witness, and proved by him that he was Chief of the Detective Department of the Police Force of Baltimore city, and that his assistants had arrested both the prisoners on the 30th of January, 1873; that Nicholson was brought to the Middle District Station-House, and that Hollihan was taken to the station-house of the Eastern District. Witness then stated that he had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>conversation with Nicholson on the night of the 30th of January, the day of his arrest, at the Middle District Station-House ; that Thomas Nicholson, a brother of the prisoner, came down from, his room, and told witness the prisoner wanted to see him, and witness then went to his room, where there were present, besides witness and the prisoner, Thomas Nicholson, the prisoner\u2019s brother, and John English ; that just after witness entered the room, the prisoner arose from his seat, and said to witness, \u201cI want to tell you all about this case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-5\">At this stage of his examination, and before the witness was allo-wed to detail the statement or confession then made to him by the prisoner, his counsel interposed, and proposed to examine the witness as to whether, before the statement was made by the prisoner, any promise, or threat or inducement to confess was made to him, which would render his confession inadmissible in evidence, and the Court permitted this to he done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">The witness being then examined on this point before the Court and jury, testified, that he never had had any previous interview or conversation with the prisoner, and had never made to him any promise, or threat or induce\u2022ment to confess whatever; that he had not seen the prisoner to talk with him before this time; that he did not tell bis brother, Thomas Nicholson, to deliver any message from witness to the prisoner; that he went from Ms office to the station-house with Thomas Nicholson and John English, the latter walking with witness, and the former most of the way a little in advance; that when thus walking along, Thomas Nicholson said he was sorry about the case, and be, witness, might have then said I am sorry your brother has got into trouble ; that he gave Thomas Nicholson permission to see his brother, the prisoner, and I may have said, if Joshua, the prisoner, wants to see me, I will come to see Mm; that he never sent for Thomas Nicholson, nor did he send English for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>him, nor does he know that he was sent for; and witness swears emphatically, that up to the period of this interview and before the confession then made, he had made no promises or threats to the prisoner, nor had he held out any inducements to him to make a confession. The Court was thereupon of opinion, that the statement or confession proposed to be proven was admissible, but the counsel for the prisoner, asked leave to introduce other testimony as to the fact, whether any such threats, ' promises or inducements were made to the prisoner, before the witness should be permitted to detail the confession; and the Court thereupon, and against the objection of the State\u2019s Attorney, decided that it would permit further testimony on this subject, both on the part of the accused and on the part of the State, before the latter should be allowed to give in evidence the proposed confession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-6\">The counsel for the prisoner then called to the stand <em>Thomas Nicholson, </em>a competent witness, who testified, that on the 30th of January, John English sent for him, and they went to Crone\u2019s office ; that English called Crone out, and they, witness, English and Crone walked to the station-house side by side, and while so walking along,Crone said to him, witness, this is a hell of a scrape and he was sorry for it, and said he had had Joshua, the prisoner, in his private office, and he had tried to get something out of him, but could not; that Crone then told me I ought to try and get Joshua to say something, that I was the only one that could get anything out of him : that he then told me that promises had been made to him by the State\u2019s Attorney of Baltimore city, if they could get him, the prisoner, to squeal; that when they arrived at the station-house, witness was allowed to see his brother, and he afterwards called Crone up to his room; that Crone came in, drew up a chair, and sat down by the prisoner, and said to him, ccfor Christ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>sake, if you know anything about this case, let it out before Hollihan squeals, for if you do not, Hollihan will squeal before you, and you will get the worse of it,\u201d and this was said to him by Crone, before any statement or confession was made by the prisoner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-5\">The State then called to the stand <em>John English, </em>a competent witness, who testified that he was present at the interview spoken of by the other witnesses, at the station-house ; that he accompanied Crone and Thomas Nicholson from Crone's office to the station-house, the three of us walking together, Crone in the middle ; that while they were thus on their way to the station-house, no such conversations occurred between Crone and Thomas Nicholson, as the latter had testified to, nor did Crone make any such statements to said Thomas Nicholson while thus on their way, as the said Thomas had testified to ; that when they arrived at the station-house, Thomas Nicholson went up in to the prisoner's room, and Crone and witness remained down stairs ; that said Thomas Nicholson afterwards came down, and said to Crone, that Joshua wanted to see him, and all three of us then went up stairs, and into the prisoner\u2019s room, and prisoner thereupon spoke first to Crone, and said to him, \u201cI want to tell you everything about this case,\u201d and Crone then said to him, \u201cthen I want you to tell me the truth about this thing and make a clean breast of it,\u201d and the prisoner then went on to make his statement; that neither before this statement was made, nor at any other time during the interview, did Crone say to the prisoner the words testified to by Thomas Nicholson, or anything whatever to the like import.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-6\">The State then recalled <em>Crone, </em>who testified, that while on their way to the station-house, he did not use the words or expressions attributed to him by Thomas Nicholson in his testimony, or anything like them ; that after he weut into the prisoner\u2019s room at the station-house, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>and after the prisoner had said to him, <em>\u201c </em>I want to tell you all about this case,\u201d witness said to him, \u00a3\u00a3 Josh, let it be the truth, and let it be of your free will and consent;\u201d and does not think he said, \u201c Make a clean breast of it;\u201d and he positively swears he did not, before the statement was made by the prisoner, or at any other time, make use of, or say to him, the words or expressions testified to by the witness, Thomas Nicholson ; that after the prisoner had begun his statement, Thomas Nicholson, his brother, said to him, \u201c That\u2019s right, Josh, tell the truth.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-6\">The aforegoing being all the testimony offered on this question by either side, the Court thereupon ruled and decided, that nothing in said testimony of the witnesses Crone and English, or either of them, rendered the proposed confession inadmissible in evidence, but instructed the jury, that if they believed the words and expressions testified to by Thomas Nicholson, viz: \u00a3iEor Christ\u2019s sake, if you know anything about this case, let it out before Hollihan squeals, for if you do not, Hollihan will squeal first, and you will get the worse of it,\u201d were used and said to the prisoner before the confession, about to be given in evidence, was made, then the same was inadmissible, and they must not regard it as evidence before them affecting the prisoner ; but on the other hand, if they believe that such words or expressions were not spoken or made to him, as testified toby Thomas Nicholson, and that nothing was- said to him except what has been testified to by the witnesses, Crone and English, then said confession is admissible in evidence, and they must regard and consider it as evidence before them; and having thus clearly and distinctly instructed the jury, the Court permitted the witness, Crone, to detail to the jury the statement and confession of the prisoner, made to him at the said station-house on the said night, of the 30th of January, 1873, and the confession then made was given in evidence to the jury by said witness under and subject to the aforesaid instructions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>The counsel for the prisoner, Nicholson, thereupon, and before the witness detailed to the jury said confession, excepted to so much of the aforegoing ruling of the Court as decided that nothing in the testimony of Crone and English, or either of them, rendered the proposed confession inadmissible in evidence, and the verdict being against the prisoner, he prosecuted this appeal, under the Act of 1872, ch. 316.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b159-5\">The cause was argued before Bartol, O.

The question is, whether it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>shown <em>with </em>certainty, <em>beyond </em>doubt, that, no inducement had been offered, and to determine that, all the evidence submitted on this preliminary point ought to have been passed upon <em>by the </em>Court, without leaving to the jury to settle the question as to the admissibility of the confession, according to their estimate of the testimony.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-5\">It is the peculiar province of the Court to decide such questions before the proposed evidence can be put in, and there would seem to be no more difficulty in criminal than in civil cases. The <em>Judge </em>must be satisfied, and in case <em>of any doubt, </em>the confession will be rejected. 1 <em>Taylor\u2019s Ev., sec </em>796, <em>ante sec. </em>22; <em>Regina vs. Warringham,2 Den. C. C., </em>448; 1 <em>Phillips\u2019 Ev., </em>543.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-6\">There is the strongest reason against submitting the question to the jury. The very design of requiring the State to show that the confession was voluntary, is to keep it from the jury, unless proved to be free from inducement of <em>any hind. </em>But this purpose is frustrated if the jitry is to pass upon the preliminary proof; which is nothing less than to decide whether the confession is admissible or not. 1 <em>Taylor\u2019s Ev., sec. </em>22.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-7\">Besides, the question of admissibility of a confession is one of law and not of fact. . Erom every decision of this kind the party is entitled to an appeal, but if the Court, without deciding the question, submits it to the jury, the right of appeal is denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-8\">It cannot be said that the accused is benefitted by leaving the question to the jury, for, besides depriving him of the right of appeal, the necessary effect is to have detailed to the jury, the very matters which it is his interest to have excluded from their hearing, and constituted as juries are, it is difficult for them, in deciding the question of admissibility, not to be influenced by the confession itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-9\">This view of the case is embraced by the ruling of the Court, as to the testimony of Crone and English, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>fully as if there had been a specific exception to the instruction given as to the evidence of Nicholson, because the opinion was confined to the evidence of the two former, not embracing that of the latter; whereas the prisoner was entitled to the judgment of the Court upon <em>all </em>the evidence in this preliminary investigation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-5\">There are cases in which the Court may submit a doubtful matter or point as to-evidence to the jury, but this does not apply to cases of confession, which are <em>never </em>admitted, unless as a condition precedent, the State shows <em>affirmatively </em>there was no inducement. <em>Trasher vs. Everhart, </em>3 <em>G. &amp; J </em>, 34 ; <em>Funk vs. </em>Kincaid, 5 <em>Md., </em>404.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b162-6\"><em>James Revell, State\u2019s Attorney, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-7\">To exclude a confession, there must be a <em>threat'of harm or a promise of worldly advantage </em>employed by a <em>person in authority. Wharton\u2019s Crim. </em>Law, <em>sec. </em>685 ; <em>Regina vs. Baldry, </em>2 <em>Denison\u2019s Crown Cases, </em>430.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-8\">Was there any <em>threat </em>or <em>promise </em>in this case ? Crone and English both swear, that the <em>first words </em>spoken wore <em>uttered by the prisoner, </em>who said to Crone, <em>\u201c I want to tell you all about this case.\u201d </em>Crone swears his reply was, <em>\u201c JoshI let it be the </em>truth, <em>and let it be of your free will and consent f \u2019 </em>a.nd that after the prisoner had commenced his statement, Tom Nicholson said, <em>\u201cThat\u2019s right, </em>Josh, <em>tell the truth.\u201d </em>English swears that Crone\u2019s reply was, <em>\u201c Then 1 want you to tell me the truth about this thing and make a clean breast &lt;f it. \u2019 \u2019</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-9\">There is certainly nothing in these expressions which, by any contortion of language, could be construed with a threat of harm or promise of advantage. Notwitstanding Courts have gone, <em>unreasonably </em>far in excluding confessions, no authority can be found to the extent, now claimed by the appellant. Moreover, the ruling and tendency of the Courts of late years have been to relax the old rules of exclusion, for, as has well been said, <em>\u201cit </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>has loo often happened that justice and common sense have been sacrificed on the shrine of mercy.\u201d </em>1 <em>Taylor on Evidence, sea. </em>807 ; <em>Regina vs. Baldry, </em>2 <em>Den. C.

Law, sec. </em>687; 2 <em>Russ. on Crimes, </em>845 ; <em>Rex vs. Thomas, </em>7 <em>C. &amp; P., </em>345 ; <em>U.

The bill of exception shows, that before the witness <em>Crone </em>was allowed to detail the confession made to him by the prisoner, he was at the instance of the prisoner\u2019s counsel, examined as to the circumstances under which the confession was made; for the purpose of ascertaining whether any promise or. threat or inducement to confess, had been made to the prisoner, which would render the confession inadmissible ; and proved that the confession had been made voluntarily, and without being induced by any promise or threat whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Thereupon, at the instance of the prisoner\u2019s counsel, leave was given by the Court for further testimony on this subject to be offered, both on the part of the accused and of the State; and Thomas Nicholson was called on the part of the prisoner, and testified, that he was present at the interview between the prisoner and Crone, at which the confession was made, and stated, that Crone sat down by the prisoner and said to him, \u201cfor Christ\u2019s sake, if you know anything about -this case, let it out before Hollihan squeals, for if you do not, Hollihan will squeal before you, and you will get the worse of it,\u201d and that this was said by Crone before any statement or confession was made by the prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">John English, who was present at the same interview, testified that \u201c neither before the confession was made by the prisoner, nor at any other time during the interview, did Crone say to the prisoner the words testified to by Thomas Nicholson, or anything whatever to the like import.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Crone was then recalled and contradicted the witness Thomas Nicholson, and swore that \u201che did not before the statement was made by the prisoner, or at any other time, make use of or say to him, the words or expressions testified to by the witness Thomas Nicholson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Both Crone and English testified substantially to the same facts. They both stated that just alter they entered the room at the station house, where the prisoner was confined, Thomas Hicholson, the witness being with them, the prisoner spoke first to <em>Grone </em>and said, <em>\u201c1 </em>want <em>to tell you all about this case.\u201d </em>Crone then said to him, <em>\u201cJosh let it be the truth, and let it be of your free will and consent\u201d </em>\u2014 or according to English\u2019s recollection, Crone\u2019s answer was, <em>\u201c then I want </em>you to tell me the truth about this thing, and make a clean breast of it,\u201d and the prisoner then went on to make his statement. Upon a most careful consideration of the whole testimony on this point, after an examination of the authorities cited in the argument; we are all of opinion that the statement and confession of the prisoner was admissible, and competent evidence to be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Without undertaking to lay down any general rule on this subject, or attempting to define the nature and character of the inducements held out to a prisoner, which would render his confession inadmissible ; for this must necessarily depend very much upon the particular circumstances of each case; it is very clear upon all the authorities, that if the confession of the appellant had been induced by any threat of harm, or promise of worldly advantage held out to him by Crone, or by his authority, or in his presence and with his sanction, it ought to be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The law is also well settled that the <em>onus </em>is upon the prosecutor, to show affirmatively, that the confession proposed to be offered was not made in consequence of an improper inducement. 1 <em>Taylor, sec. </em>796. In the language of Baron Parke in <em>Queen vs. Warringham, the Court must be satisfied </em>that the confession sought to be used in evidence against the prisoner, \u201c was not obtained from him by improper means.\u201d 2 <em>Den. C. C., </em>448, <em>note.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>According to the testimony of Crone and English, there was neither promise nor threat employed in this case; the statement of the prisoner was made by him voluntarily. Thomas Nicholson testifies to the contrary; but it is'impossible to give credence to his statement, he is not only positively contradicted by both of the other witnesses; but his whole testimony is improbable in the extreme. Not only does he put in the mouth of Crone, words which Crone himself positively states were not used by him, and which English, a disinterested witness who was present and heard all that occurred, positively contradicts; hut his other statements as to what he alleges Crone had previously said to him, while on their way to the station house, are not supported by any other testimony, and are positively disproved by both Crone and English. And when it is remembered that this witness is a brother of the prisoner, naturally moved by the strongest bias in his favor, and testifying under the influence of that bias; we cannot escape the conviction that the true account of what occurred at the interview with the prisoner, and of the circumstances under which he made the confession, is to he found in the testimony of Crone and English. There was no error therefore in allowing the confession, to be given in evidence to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We have thought it our duty in a case of such serious and vital importance, to express our judgment on this question, without stopping to inquire whether it is technically presented by the exception as it is set out in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Without regard to the form of the exception, it is evident that the material and important question in the case, is whether the confession of the prisoner, made under the circumstances shown by the proof, was properly allowed to go to the jury. The determination of this question in the affirmative, is conclusive of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>It appears that the Circuit Court, after the preliminary testimony was heard, showing the circumstances under which the confession was made, permitted it to go to the jury, instructing them substantially, that it was admissible and competent evidence, and proper for them to consider, if they believed the facts testified to by Crone and English, or either of them. But if they believed the testimony of Thomas Nicholson to be true, <em>\u201c </em>then it was admissible, and they must not regard it as evidence affecting the prisoner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The point has been made in this Court, and argued by the appellant\u2019s counsel, that the preliminary question of the admissibility of the confession was for the Court to determine, and that it ought not to have been left to the jury to decide upon the credibility of the witnesses, bearing on that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">This point is not material or important in this case; the Court below virtually passed upon the question, by allowing the confession to go to the jury ; and as we are all of opinion that the confession was admissible and proper evidence, the ruling of the Circuit Court on that question must be affirmed. The only effect of the instruction given to the jury, was to afford the prisoner\u2019s counsel an opportunity of arguing before them\", that the testimony of Thomas Nicholson was entitled to their belief, and consequently that the confession of the prisoner ought to bo discarded 1'rom their consideration. The appellant was not therefore injured by the course pursued by the Court in this respect, and cannot be entitled to a reversal for that cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The question is however, an interesting and important one in practice; and although its decision cannot for the reasons stated, affect the decision of the present case, we consider it proper to express our judgment upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">The general proposition stated by the appellant\u2019s counsel, is undoubtedly correct. The question of the admissibility of testimony, is always fo'r the Court; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the rule, is where the confession of a prisoner on trial is offered against him, the Court, and not the jury, are to determine whether it is admissible. The rule is thus stated in <em>Taylor on Evidence, sec. </em>22, \u201cIf,\u201d says the author, \u201cthe question be whether a confession should be excluded on account .of some previous threat or promise, the judge must decide <em>first, </em>whether the threat or promise was really made; and <em>secondly, </em>whether if made, it was sufficient in law to warrant the exclusion of the evidence.\u201d We refer also to <em>section </em>796. This rule is conformable to reason, and is supported by the authorities. It was departed from in <em>King vs. </em>Woodcock, decided in 1789, <em>Leach\u2019s C. C., </em>500, where an analogous question arose. Eyre, C. B., being in doubt upon the preliminary testimony, whether a statement of a party offered in evidence as a dying declaration, had been made,-when the declarant was under the apprehension of death, left that question to the jury, instructing them, that if they so believed, the declarations were admissible; but if .they believed the contrary, they were not admissible. This decision was expressly overruled in <em>Thomas Johns\u2019 </em>case-,,decided in 1790, in which all 'the judges were of opinion, \u201cthat it ought not to be left to the jury to decide whether the deceased thought she was dying or not; for that must be decided by the judge before he receives the evidence.\u201d This last decision was followed in the case of <em>Henry Welhorn, </em>decided 1792, 1 <em>East. C. L., </em>359, 360. These cases are reported in <em>Leach\u2019s C. C., </em>503, 504, <em>(notes.) </em>. We refer also to <em>King vs. Hucks, </em>1 <em>Starkie\u2019s R </em>, 521, (2 <em>Eng. C. L. R., </em>495) <em>and note, </em>and also to the case cited by Parke, B., in his opinion in <em>Bartlett vs. Smith, </em>11 <em>Mees. &amp; W., </em>485. As very well said in Starkie\u2019s note to <em>King vs. Hucks, </em>(2 <em>Eng. C. L., </em>495,) \u201cit is clearly inconsistent with principle, to leave such evidence to the jury, to be acted upon, or rejected, according to their decision upon that which is clearly matter of law:\u201d and we may add that very great injustice might in some cases, be done to</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b169-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>(Decided 6th June, 1873.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"AA7\">the prisoner, by allowing a confession made by him, to be given in evidence, before the Court is satisfied that it was voluntarily made; for as suggested in the appellant\u2019s brief, it would be difficult for the jury in deciding the question of admissibility, not to be influenced by the confession itself, which they ought not to hear, unless its admissibility is first clearly established to the satisfaction of the Court. Of course, the credibility of the witness who testifies to the confession, is a question for the jury to decide, in the same manner as they pass upon the credibility of other witnesses in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In civil cases, the rule of practice is different, as evidenced by the cases of <em>Trasher vs. Everhart, </em>3 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>234; <em>Dement vs. Stonestreet, </em>1 <em>Md., </em>123; <em>Funk vs. Kincaid, </em>5 <em>Md., </em>404.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">In those cases it was held, that where the preliminary question upon which the admissibility of evidence depends <em>is one of fact only, </em>it may be left to the jury to be decided by them, under hypothetical instructions from the Court. That course may properly be pursued, where the evidence upon which the preliminary question depends, is doubtful, in such case, the Court may decline to decide it, and submit it to the jury. That rule cannot apply to a\u2019 criminal case, for in passing upon the preliminary question of the admissibility of a confession made by a prisoner., if the Court considers it doubtful whether it ought to be admitted, it should be rejected. The law is so stated by <em>Taylor, vol. </em>1, <em>sec. </em>796, on the authority of <em>Queen vs. Warringham, </em>2 <em>Den. C. C., </em>447.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">In this case however, as we have before said, the confession of the appellant offered in evidence, was clearly admissible according to the proof; and there is no ground therefore, upon which the ruling of the Circuit Court ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">\n<em>Ruling affirmed, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
