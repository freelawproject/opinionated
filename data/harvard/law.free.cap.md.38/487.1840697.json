Davis, and by him endorsed to the plaintiffs for value, and which was unpaid by the bank. The defendant denied any indebtedness. The evidence showed that the check was drawn and endorsed as alleged; that it was never paid by the defendant; that it was never presented to the bank for payment, because the bank about the time the check was given had been removed, and by reason of the civil war at the time and the consequent interruption of mail communication between Baltimore and Phillippi, where the bank was located, the check could not be presented; that the check was given in payment of a debt due by the defendant\u2019s brother, of whom the defendant was executor with assets. There was no proof that the bank had not resumed business after the close of the war, and might not have paid the eheck, and no evidence that the plaintiffs ever afterwards presented the check to the bank, or that the defendant had no funds there to meet the check; nor was there any proof that notice of any sort was given to the defendant of its non-payment.

Issues were joined on the first and second pleas, and the plaintiffs moved to strike out the plea of limitations. This motion was granted by the Court, and the plea was stricken out. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-6\"><em>Plaintiffs' Exception. </em>\u2014 At the trial of the cause the plaiptiffs, to, support the issues on their part joined, offered certain, evidence,, which is sufficiently stated in the opinion of the Court, and then rested their case. The defendant thereupon, at the suggestion of the Court, (Scott, <em>J:,) </em>prayed the Court to instruct the jury that there was no evidence in the case upon which the plaintiffs could <em>recover. </em>This prayer the Court granted; and the plaintiffs \u00e9xc\u00e9pted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-7\"><em>u-'Ee/er^a,ani\u00bfs \u00c9xceptipn.-ff\u00fche </em>defendant excepted to the ruling of the Court in striking qut his plea \u00f3f limiiatiohs.

Even admitting the personal responsibility of the defendant, the plaintiffs must show affirmatively that the defendant has sustained no loss by his negligence. <em>Little vs. Phoenix Bank, </em>2 <em>Hill, </em>425 ; <em>Bradford vs. Fox, </em>39 <em>Barbour, </em>204.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-9\">The check is not sufficient \u201cevidence of debt\u201d under the attachment.

Davis, or order, and by him endorsed to the plaintiffs, for value, and which was unpaid by the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The defendant denied any indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">There was evidence that the check was drawn and endorsed, as alleged, and that the same was never paid by the defendant; that it was never presented to the Bank for payment, because the Bank, about the time the check was given, had been removed, and that by reason of the civil war at the time and the interruption of mail communication between Baltimore and Phillippi, the check could not be presented \u2014 that the check was given in payment of a debt due by the defendant\u2019s brother, of whom he was said to be executor, with assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">There was no proof that the Bank had not resumed business after the termination of the war, and might not have paid the check, but there was no evidence that the plaintiffs ever afterwards made any presentation of the check to the Bank, or that the defendant had no funds there to meet the check; nor was there any proof that notice of any sort was given to the defendant of the nonpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">In <em>Moses vs. Franklin Bank of </em>Baltimore, 34 <em>Md., </em>574, it was decided that a check of this description possesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>properly certain incidents of an inland bill of exchange, and could be protested for non-payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Notice.of non-acceptance and non-payment is required to be given that the drawer may take any necessary steps to protect his interest, under the circumstances, and if notice be not given, it is the presumption of lav? that he is injured by the omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In the application of the principle Courts must enquire into the liabilities of the respective parties to the check, for the purpose of ascertaining whether this injury, either actual or presumptive, could take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The drawer who has no effects in the hands of the drawee, is not entitled to notice. <em>Clopper s Adm\u2019r vs. The Union Bank of Maryland, </em>7 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>102; <em>Eichelberger vs. Finley &amp; Van Lear, </em>7 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>381.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The general rule is, that the holder in order to charge the drawer, is bound to present the check for payment, and to give notice to the drawer, within a reasonable time, unless these requisites are waived. <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>379.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">If due diligence is not used by the holder of a check, and loss ensues, it falls on the holder, by whose <em>laches </em>it has occurred. <em>Story on Prom. Notes, sec. </em>493. If the plaintiff's could not present the check during the war, they might have presented it afterwards, or shewn some reasonable excuse for not doing so, and have given notice to the <em>drawer. </em>\u2014 Lex <em>non cogit ad impossibilia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">If a bill cannot be presented in due time from some inevitable accident not involving the holder in any blame, as the occupation of the country in which the bill is drawn, by an enemy, rendering the presentment an impossibility, the delay will be excused; but the earliest possible presentment must be made when the impediment ceased, <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>53.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">Assuming that the circumstances relied upon in the proof were sufficient to excuse the plaintiffs for uon-pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>sent\u00e1tion of the check, certainly it was but just that they should give the defendant notice of the non-payment in reasonable time, before they brqught their action, or to \u25a0have shown that the .defendant sustained no injury in consequence.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b504-8\">(Decided 2nd July, 1873.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In the case stated in <em>Woods vs. Schroeder, </em>4 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>276, although the drawers of the .check had given notice to the Bank not to pay the check ; from abundant caution and to guard against any inference of <em>laches </em>against the holders, it was alleged that the \u00a1drawers wqre notified of the dishonor of the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The case of <em>Eichelberger vs. </em>Finley, 7 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>381, very distinctly recognized the necessity of notice of the non-payment of the check to the drawer, unless some sufficient excuse .be shown for dispensing with it, as if the drawer at the time when presentment should be made, had no effects in the hands of the drawee, or having such effects, should withdraw them before presentment, and should have no reasonable grounds to expect that his bill would be honored. The .plaintiffs\u2019 case-was fatally defective in failing to furnish the material evidence-to. show the defendant\u2019s liability, and we therefore find no error in the instruction given by the Baltimore City Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
