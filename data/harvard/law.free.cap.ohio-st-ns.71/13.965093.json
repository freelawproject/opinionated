St., 381.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-6\">This universal rule, concerning which Judge Dan-forth said was \u201cso uniformly asserted by writers of \u2022approved authority and the courts.that fresh discussion would be superfluous,\u201d was, in our opinion, clearly and unmistakably departed from by the decision of this court in the late case of <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Alexander, Treas., </em>69 Ohio St., 75.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-7\">It is left in doubt whether Hull\u2019s unpaid delinquent taxes or those of any other delinquent, where it has not been carried forward, can now be carried forward and entered on the present duplicate; for,' it is hinted in the last statement of Judge Burket\u2019s \u25a0opinion that whether it can be done \u201cat this late day\u201d by the auditor is not decided. In view of the universal principle hereinbefore stated, that time works no bar against the state\u2019s rights, why this lonely word \u201clate\u201d should make its appearance for the first time in the face of this well-settled rule, is not apparent to us; of course, the opinion of a case is not accredited as being the pure law.of a case, while the syllabus is.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>There is a clear and distinct recognition by this court that Mr. Hull has never paid his taxes due the-state, and it is conceded in this case that neither his-nor the other delinquent taxes mentioned in the petition have been paid. And' it is to be noted from the facts that these delinquent people have not \u201cso arranged their taxes either by payment or otherwise as to have the charge removed from the duplicate.\u201d'</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-5\">It is Judge Burket\u2019s opinion in the Hull case that people can arrange their taxes by payment or otherwise as to have the charge removed from the duplicate. \"We know of no such law; but if it is lawful the arrangement would have to be made with the-state\u2019s collecting officer, the county treasurer, while-the duplicate is in his hands for collection, and with the state\u2019s taxing officer, the county auditor, when the duplicate has been returned to him between the-semi-annual settlement in August and September 15th. It would necessarily follow from that opinion that <em>any </em>arrangement made by a taxpayer with the-state\u2019s taxing or collecting officer <em>uas to have the charge removed from the </em>duplicatewould be binding on the state, notwithstanding the opinion of all the text-writers and authorities to the contrary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-6\">We think the auditor\u2019s refusal is not in accord with the opinion of this court in the Hull case, and that he has no valid excuse for not performing the duty prayed for in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-7\">It is admitted that all the auditors have failed and omitted to do the duty as the state\u2019s taxing officer in carrying forward and rewriting the names of the-delinquents and the amount of their unpaid taxes, from one delinquent duplicate to the following yearly delinquent duplicate. In any event, the omission of former county auditors to perform such duty \u201ccan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>not control the duty imposed by law upon their successors, \u2019 \u2019 as was decided by Judge Spear in 46 Ohio State; and this rests upon the grounds that laches cannot be imputed to the state, that its rights cannot be prejudiced by the neglect of its officers, and that as against the state time does not bar its rights, as was held in 16, 31 and 58 Ohio State. And this suit being by the state to compel its taxing officer to perform an imposed duty, it is therefore clear that the state is entitled to the peremptory mandamus in this case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-6\"><em>Mr. A. 8. Leuthold, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-7\">The circuit court still cling to their decision they made in <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Alexander, Treasurer, </em>48 O. L. B., 935, that the taxes once entered are not discharged until paid, and that the taxes are collectible on the old duplicate without rewriting the entire list, and that the auditor cannot be compelled to rewrite and enter on a new duplicate what already was once entered and put on a duplicate and now is on the duplicate, and he cannot be compelled to do what a former county officer should have done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-8\">First: We claim on behalf of the respondent that the relatoras petition for a writ of mandamus is not such, due regard being had to the rules of pleading, as will entitle him to such writ. It is bad, not only for duplicity, but for multifariousness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b59-9\">What is mandamus <em>1 \u2018 \u2018 </em>Mandamus is a writ issued in the name of the state to an inferior tribunal, a corporation, board or person commanding the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station. \u2019 \u2019 Section 6741, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>We desire to state here that the relator\u2019s petition does not state any fact that constitutes a failure of the auditor to perform any act which the law specifically enjoins on him as a duty resulting from his office. The pleader, in his own language, characterizes in a general way innumerable instances, mostly on the part of the respondent\u2019s, predecessors, without giving time, place-or person, or specific facts by which the court can determine whether he is at fault or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-4\">Mandamus requires him to perform <em>an act </em>which the law <em>specially </em>enjoins as a duty resulting from his office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-5\">It must be <em>specific </em>and directed to a <em>single </em>act, which he refuses. If there are unlimited numbers of acts which he refuses, they cannot be grouped in one action in mandamus, and he directed generally to go and do them all, and be the judge of which ones fall within the command.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-6\">We desire to call the attention of the court to some of the elementary rules of pleading as summarized in Gould\u2019s excellent work on the subject, and to asseverate that relator\u2019s petition does not comply with them in any particular; Chapter 1, sec. 4, sec. 20 XXX; Chap. 3, secs. 1, 28, 51 and 60; Chap. 4, sec. 86; Ohio Code, sec. 5062.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-7\">Relator\u2019s petition alleges perhaps more than fifty different acts, which he claims should be performed by the auditor, no two of them pointed out to be alike, yet he asks one order to cover them all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-8\">Second: What do the Revised Statutes of Ohio provide? Nowhere in the Revised Statutes of Ohio is any law to be found directing the present auditor to perform this duty; nowhere in the statutes can it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>be found that this auditor must do what a former county auditor should have done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-6\">The county auditor must perform the duties prescribed for him to do in the statutes, and certainly; if there is no section of law requiring him to do this, and no section of law giving him any compensation to do this work that he is now asked to do by the plaintiffs in error, he' cannot be compelled to do what h\u00e9 is asked to do in the plaintiff\u2019s petition herein.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-7\">The remedy that the plaintiffs in error are here seeking is with the legislature, and that body should be asked for relief and not the county auditor, as the county auditor performs the duties that are prescribed by the legislature, and when that body is asked for relief it will also provide for adequate compensation for what he must perform and is asked to perform as any one who performs labor for an individual.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-8\">While section 2855, Revised Statutes, says that he must \u201cmpke a tax list and duplicate thereof of all the taxes and personal property remaining unpaid as shown by the treasurer\u2019s books,\u201d it does not say that he must go back for a period of thirteen years and perform a duty that had been neglected by a former official, or undo what has been the uniform practice in the state of Ohio, which mode of keeping the auditor\u2019s duplicates was and has been prescribed by the auditor of the state of Ohio, as found in section 1041, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-9\">Section 1041, Revised Statutes, certainly prescribes the manner of placing taxes on duplicates and prescribes the forms of tax lists and duplicates; and that authority is granted to the auditor of state and he is the officer that prescribes the manner and form of keeping tax lists and duplicates for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>county auditor, and when the legislature delegated that authority to the state auditor, it follows that the county auditor must conform to the wishes and methods of keeping his duplicates as prescribed by the auditor of the state of Ohio. The uniform practice cannot be changed by the courts of this state, and hence it follows that if the manner of keeping the tax duplicates is not satisfactory and a change is needed, the legislature must be asked to make that change by proper instructions to the auditor of state as to how and in what manner the duplicates shall be kept in the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-5\">To grant a peremptory writ of mandamus against the auditor compelling him to rewrite all the taxes for thirteen years in plain view of what the Supreme Court of this state has said in <em>Wasteney </em>v. <em>Schott, </em>58 Ohio St., 410, would certainly be a departure of the well settled law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-6\"><em>Messrs. Harris &amp; Sears, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-7\">\u201cMandamus is a writ issued'in the name of the state to an inferior tribunal, a corporation, board or person, commanding the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station.\u201d Section 6741, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-8\">. We assert that relator\u2019s petition does not state any fact that constitutes a failure of the auditor to perform any act which the law specifically enjoins on him as a duty resulting from his office. The pleader, in his own language, characterizes in a general way innumerable instances, on the part of the respondent\u2019s predecessors, without giving time, place or person, or specific facts by which the court can decide that defendant is at fault.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Mandamus requires Mm to perform <em>an act </em>which the law <em>specially </em>enjoins as a duty resulting from <em>his </em>office; not that he shall perform duties that were enjoined on his predecessors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-6\">In the petition, not a single instance- of neglected duty is specified. Each act refused should be described with the same particularity prescribed for other pleadings, because the code pleadings are applied in mandamus. Section 6741, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-7\">The relator is hound to set forth facts sufficient to entitle him to the relief prayed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-8\">The principle which seems to lie at the foundation of this writ and its use, is, that wherever a legal right exists, the party is entitled to a legal remedy, and when all others fail, the aid of this writ may he invoked. <em>People </em>v. <em>Mayor of N. Y., </em>10 Wend., 396; 3 <em>Burr, 267; People v. Albany (Supvrs.), </em>12 Johns., 415.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-9\">When the legal right is doubtful, a writ of mandamus can not rightfully issue. <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>United States, </em>12 Pet., 613; <em>Oneida Common Pleas Judges </em>v. <em>People, </em>18 Wend., 89; 5 Burney, 103; <em>Nelson Ex parte, </em>1 Cow., 423; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chenango Co. (Supvrs.), </em>1 Kernan, 563.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-10\">Relator\u2019s petition alleges perhaps more than fifty different acts of omission on the part of the former auditors, which he claims should he performed by the present auditor, no two of them pointed out to he alike, yet he asks one order to cover them all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b63-11\">He knew, and this court knows, that statement to be untrue. The record of the Hull case, in which the relator was counsel, shows that Hull\u2019s taxes were settled, a receipt reciting a partial abatement given, and the balance paid and receipted in full by the treasurer, and no part of the taxes were subsequently carried forward on delinquent tax duplicates.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>We may properly remark at this point by way of parenthesis, that if it was a duty specifically enjoined on any officer to bring the remainder of said taxes forward on the delinquent duplicates, it was the former auditors against whom a mandamus should have issued. It is difficult to perceive any provision of the law of mandamus, which will compel the present auditor to perform a duty that was enjoined on his predecessor, and not on himself. <em>Selby, Aud. </em>v. <em>State, </em>63 Ohio St., 541.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-5\">The duty of a county auditor, with respect to making out a tax list and duplicate, is prescribed by statute, and his duty and authority, with reference to entering delinquent taxes on the duplicate, are also prescribed by statute; and as we contend it is not within the province of a court, by judicial legislation, to supply any authority that may not have been conferred upon the auditor by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-6\">The section 2855, Revised Statutes, contains the authority, and the only authority, conferred by the legislature upon county auditors, with respect to entering delinquent taxes upon the tax duplicate, and it manifestly has reference to taxes appearing delinquent upon the last preceding tax duplicate and the treasurer\u2019s books. If the former auditors failed to comply with the statute, there is an adequate remedy by due course of law to sue them on their official bonds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-7\">There certainly can be no more potent argument suggested, why an auditor should run back for a long period of time to hunt up the old tax duplicate, upon which taxes appear to be charged and unpaid, and enter the same upon the current duplicate, than could be urged in favor of the contention, that such old duplicate might itself afford a basis for an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>by a county treasurer against the taxpayer, under section 2859, Revised Statutes, and the latter proposition was directly decided by this court in the case of <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>69 Ohio St., 75.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b65-6\">Crew, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac\">The respondent in this ease, J. I. Smith, as county auditor of Crawford county, Ohio, in the answers filed by him to relators\u2019 petition and the amendment thereto, admits the truth of the allegations of said petition and amendment, and pleads by way of justification, and as matter of excuse, for the nonperformance by him of the acts, performance of which it is sought to compel by mandamus, that: \u201che ought not to be required to enter the unpaid and delinquent taxes of former years on the delinquent tax duplicate of said (Crawford) county for the year 1903, for the reason that said treasurer can proceed to collect said taxes by civil action without the same being entered and placed on the delinquent duplicate of 1903.\u201d This court having decided in the case of <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Alexander, Treasurer, </em>69 Ohio St., 75, that: \u201cThe action by the county treasurer for the collection of delinquent personal taxes authorized by section 2859, Revised Statutes, must be for taxes standing charged on the duplicate of the current year, or the delinquent duplicate,\u201d it follows that these \u00e1nswers tender no issue with the allegations of relators \u2019 complaint, and as defenses are wholly insufficient in law. This case therefore stands in this court as if upon a general demurrer to relators \u2019 complaint, and the sole question presented on this record for our consideration is, does relators\u2019 petition, as amended, state facts sufficient in law to entitle them to a peremptory writ of mandamus, as prayed for in said petition? This we think must be answered in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>negative. It must now be accepted as a thoroughly well settled rule, that a peremptory writ of mandamus will not, in any case, be granted, unless the right of the relator thereto be clear, and the act, performance of which is desired, be one of absolute obligation on the part of the person or officer sought to be coerced; and before such writ will be allowed the relator must show not only a clear legal right to have done the specific act desired, but to have it done by the particular person or officer sought to be coerced; and a plain dereliction of duty must be established against such person or officer before the writ will be awarded. In <em>Selby, Auditor, </em>v. <em>The State ex rel. King, </em>63 Ohio St., 543, Shauck, C. J., says: \u2018 \u2018 Thevoffice of the writ of mandamus is clearly indicated by the definite terms of section 6741 of the Revised Statutes. The writ is there defined in accordance with the view taken by the courts at the time of the adoption of the constitution, and the vesting of jurisdiction of the action. The writ may issue to command \u2018the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station.\u2019 It may not issue to compel the performance of an act not so enjoined.\u201d Section 2855, Revised Statutes, provides as follows: \u201cImmediately after the semi-annual settlement in August, the county auditor shall, annually, make a tax-list and duplicate thereof of all the taxes on personal property remaining unpaid, as shown by the treasurer\u2019s books, and the delinquent record as returned by him to the auditor, which tax-list and duplicate shall contain the name, valuation, and amount of personal property taxes due and unpaid, and ten per centum penalty added to the said taxes; and he shall deliver said duplicate to the treasurer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>on the fifteenth day of September, annually. \u2019 \u2019 This section prescribes when, how and from what, the delinquent duplicate shall be made up by the county auditor, and it contains the only authority conferred, and the only obligation or duty imposed, by law upon county auditors with respect to the entering of delinquent personal taxes upon the tax duplicate. By the provisions of this section such delinquent duplicate is to be made up by the \u00e1uditor by entering thereon \u201call the taxes on personal property remaining unpaid, <em>as shown by the treasurer\u2019s boohs and the delinquent record as returned by him to the auditor.\u201d </em>It will be observed that by the provisions of this section this delinquent duplicate is to be made up by the county auditor annually, immediately after the .semi-annual settlement with the county treasurer in August of each year, and is required to contain only such unpaid delinquent taxes on personal property as shall be shown by the treasurer\u2019s books and the delinquent record returned by him to said auditor. This statute, in terms, only requires, and we think was only intended to require, the county auditor when making up such delinquent duplicate in any year, to. place and enter thereon for the current year such taxes on personal property as remain due and unpaid as shown by the treasurer\u2019s books and the delinquent record then (at the time of such settlement) returned by the treasurer to said auditor. This statute \u2014 section 2855 \u2014 has been in force substantially in its present form for almost thirty years, and it is conceded by counsel for relators that the uniform practical construction placed upon said statute by the officers charged with its execution, has been that the same imposes upon county auditors, in the making up of said delinquent duplicate the ob-\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>ligation or duty to carry into such duplicate only the taxes upon personal property appearing as due and unpaid upon the last preceding tax duplicate as returned by the treasurer to the auditor at the time of his semi-annual August settlement immediately preceding the time of making up such delinquent duplicate. While the practical construction thus adopted cannot be admitted as absolutely controlling, it is nevertheless, we think, deserving of consideration and should, perhaps, be regarded as decisive in a case of doubt, or where the obligation imposed or the duty enjoined is not plain and specific. <em>Union Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Hoge, </em>21 Howard, 35; <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Shores, </em>24 Ill., 27; <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Cartersville, </em>41 Gra., 157; 26 Encyclopedia of Law, 635. The duties of the county auditor with respect to making up the delinquent tax duplicate are such only as are prescribed by statute, and a court is without right to require of' him the performance of any service in that behalf not specifically enjoined upon, or required of him by law. If it be granted that by section 2855, the duty is imposed upon the county auditor in making up the delinquent duplicate, to carry forward onto such duplicate all of the taxes on personal property theretofore charged in any previous year and remaining unpaid, regardless of whether such delinquencies are shown by the treasurer\u2019s books as returned by him to the auditor at the time of his semi-annual settlement in August next preceding the time of the making up of such delinquent duplicate, then and in that event, it became and was the duty of the predecessors in office of the respondent herein, J. I. Smith, who became auditor of Crawford county, October 20, 1902, in making up the delinquent duplicate for' the years previous to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>the year 1902, to enter thereon all over-due and unpaid taxes on personal property charged on any and all delinquent duplicates prior to said year 1902, and while the omission of the several auditors in previous years, to so make up such delinquent duplicates, and (to enter thereon such unpaid personal taxes, would not excuse or relieve the present auditor, J. I. Smith, from the performance of any duty specifically imposed upon him in that behalf, yet before he can be compelled by mandamus to make a new or additional duplicate for the year 1903, and bring forward and enter thereon all delinquent taxes on personal property from the year 1890 to the year 1902, a service which if required at all, w*as one imposed by law upon his predecessors in office, his obligation so to do must be <em>clear </em>and the duty one \u201cwhich the law specifically enjoins,\u201d otherwise the relief, if any is to be had, must come from the legislature and not from the courts. In this case it is not claimed by relators in their petition that the respondent, J. I. Smith, as auditor of Crawford county, in making up the delinquent tax duplicate of said county for the year 1903, omitted therefrom any taxes on personal property that were shown to be due and unpaid by the treasurer\u2019s books or the delinquent record as returned to said auditor at the time of the semi-annual settlement in August, 1903. The only complaint on the part of relators being that said auditor neglected, and now refuses, to carry into said delinquent duplicate for 1903, the delinquent personal taxes omitted to be carried forward by former auditors for the years, from 1890 to the year 1902. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the particular service which it is sought to compel the respondent in this case to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>perform, is not one which the statute \u201cspecifically enjoins upon him as a duty resulting from his office,\u201d and the right of relators to the relief asked not being clear, a peremptory writ of mandamus was properly refused by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b70-6\">Speak, C.
