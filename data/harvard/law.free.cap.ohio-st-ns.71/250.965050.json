The allegations of the petition with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>spect to the company\u2019s obligation are in substance that on or about the eleventh day of February, 1888, the village for the purpose of protecting the property of the citizens against fire and causing them to be furnished with a sufficient quantity of water passed an ordinance authorizing the defendant to lay mains and pipes and to convey water thereby in and through the village and it was provided by the ordinance that the defendant was authorized to lay and maintain a system of pipes, conduits and hydrants along the streets and alleys of the village to supply the village and its inhabitants with water suitable for domestic, manufacturing and fire purposes. The company assumed the obligation to furnish machinery having power and capacity sufficient for fire protection and to maintain an adequate and efficient system. By the terms of the contract as alleged fifty-six frost proof hydrants of approved pattern and workmanship having double delivery were to be furnished by the water company; that the compensation therefor was to be derived by the village from a tax levied upon the taxable property of the city including that of the plaintiff; that the damage to the plaintiff resulted from the failure of the water company to comply with its said contract. The company demurred to the petition and in the court of common pleas the demurrer was sustained. On petition in error the judgment of the court of common pleas was affirmed by the circuit court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b279-5\"><em>Mr. James A. D.

Rep., 725) the court held the water company liable to the citizen and refused to overrule the holding in that state, not upon the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>ground of the correctness of the former holding, but upon the sole ground that the contract was made with reference, to the law as it then obtained in that state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-5\">We do not dispute the correctness of the holdings ^n the Ohio cases cited by counsel for plaintiff in error in their brief, but assert that they are not applicable to the. case at bar. \u201cIt is not every contract for the benefit of a third party that confers upon such third party the right to sue thereon.\u201d <em>The Akron W. W. Co. </em>v. <em>Brownless, </em>5 Circ. Dec., 1; 10 C. C. R., 620.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-6\">A third person who is only indirectly and incidentally benefited by a contract has no right of action thereon. <em>Howsmon </em>v. <em>Trenton W. Co., </em>41 Am. St. Rep., 654.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-7\">The petition in the case at bar seems to have been drafted with reference to the North Carolina case of <em>Gorrell </em>v. <em>Water Supply Co., </em>70 Am. St. Rep., 598, and great reliance is placed thereon by counsel for plaintiff in error in argument. This case was decided by a divided court, Faircloth, C. J., and Furches, J., dissenting, and the opinion therein, is based upon the ground, that the contract, though made between the city and the water company, was for the benefit of the citizen and taxpayer, and for that reason such citizen and taxpayer could recover thereon; that if it were not so the taxpayer is without remedy \u2014\u201csustains damage for which there is no redress\u201d \u2014 and that this is a complete <em>\u201cReduotio ad absurdum. \u2019 \u2019</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-8\">We answer that if this view is correct, then the holdings of the Supreme Court of this state, in numerous cases, leads to the same result; and as closely bearing upon this question, we cite: <em>Western </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>College </em>v. <em>City of Cleveland, </em>12 Ohio St., 375, and <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>City of Cincinnati, </em>19 Ohio, 19.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-4\">' If the reasoning in the North Carolina case, <em>supra, </em>is correct, then the application of the principles \u25a0enunciated in these Ohio authorities would lead to the same <em>\u201cBeductio ad absurdum.\u201d </em>The taxpayer pays taxes to the municipality where the municipality owns and operates the water works, and yet he Is without the remedy of recovery against the municipality, because in relation to the construction .and operation of water works its acts are discretionary, legislative and governmental.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-5\">We are unable to discern any reason to change this rule in a case like the one at bar, where the municipality, under the authority of the statute, contracts with the water company for a water supply. By such a contract the municipality delegates its authority to the water company for the consideration agreed to be paid, acts in its stead in furnishing and supplying public fire hydrants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-6\">Again the public good and public necessity requires that a municipality should not be held liable to the individual for damages in case of fires, as the \u25a0expense incurred would render provisions for the \u25a0extinguishment of fires impracticable if not impossible <em>; </em>and for the same reason water companies are \u2022not liable. <em>Akron Water Works Co. </em>v. <em>Brownless, </em>5 Circ. Dec., 1; 10 C. C. R., 620.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-7\">This is clearly an action <em>ex contractu, </em>and not an \u2022action <em>ex delicto. </em>The charge of negligence as made in the petition is a mere conclusion, and no facts are therein set out constituting of showing negligence on the part of the defendant company, aside from its .alleged failure to perform its contract. They .amount to an allegation that the defendant com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>pany failed to perform its contract, and that such failure constituted negligence on its part.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-5\">We maintain the law to be that the breach of duty of a party in failing to perform an express contract is not negligence in the legal sense, and that the remedy therefor, if any exists, is for breach of contract and not in tort.

They are nearly, if not entirely, in accord with the judgment of the circuit court in the present case. Those in which a different view of the subject has been taken will receive \u2018 sufficient attention if, following the suggestion of counsel for the plaintiff, we give due consideration to the principles involved in the inquiry. Their reliance is upon the proposition that an agreement made \u00f3n a valuable consideration by one person with another to perform an obligation to a third may be enforced by . such third person in his own name, as was held by this court in <em>Crumbaugh et al. </em>v. <em>Kugler et al., </em>3 Ohio St., 544, and other cases following it. But an obligation to. the inhabitants of a municipality as distinct from that to the municipality itself arising out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>of contracts of. this character has been frequently asserted by the inhabitants and nearly as frequently denied by the courts. These cases proceed upon the familiar principle that contracts bind only the parties who have executed them and those who are in privity with them. The cases relied on by counsel for the plaintiff concede the principle stated, and they were supposed to be decided consistently with it. They are without exception cases in which a legal obligation rested upon the promisee in the contract sued upon towards the third person bringing the suit, and such obligation is indispensable to the application of the doctrine. The view upon which such obligation is thought to meet the requirements of the rule as to privity, is thus expressed in <em>Vrooman </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>69 N. Y., 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u201cA legal obligation or duty of the promisee to him (the plaintiff) will so connect him with the transaction as to be a substitute, for any privity with the promisor, or.the consideration of the promise, the obligation of the promisee furnishing an evidence of the intent of the latter to benefit him, and creating a' privity by substitution with' the promisor. A mere stranger cannot intervene and claim by action the benefit of a contract between other parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">That such legal obligation from the promisee to the plaintiff is wanting in the present case is made clear by <em>Wheeler v. Cincinnati, </em>19 Ohio St., 20, where it is decided that the municipality is not liable to individuals for failure to furnish apparatus for extinguishing fires. If a stranger to a contract were held entitled to secure the benefits which might incidentally result to him. from its performance, not only would an established rule of the law be violated, but parties entering into, contracts could not deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>mine the extent of their obligations nor the numbers of those to whom they might be incurred. The view of the subject urged on behalf of the plaintiff finds even less support in the reasons involved than it does in the decided cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"A14\">Davis, Price, Crew and Summers, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
