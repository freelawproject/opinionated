Abraham, 151 N. Y. 186, 45 N. E. 455); but I think the plaintiff has hardly done this. The first cause of action is clearly for assault and battery, and the second cause of action would be clearly for false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>imprisonment had not the complaint (subdivision XI) stated the accusation of slander. But the statement is not the principal one, and I think that it was properly pleaded to show the pretense of the arrest and maybe the malice of the actors. The false imprisonment was continuing when the words were used, and their utterance was a part of the res gestae.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">In subdivision XII the pleader states the fact of the plaintiff\u2019s innocence, and her declaration thereof to the wrongdoers, and their persistence in their wrongdoings, and then continues the history of her detention; and subdivision XIII takes up and continues the description of the violence and the circumstances of her imprisonment. It is true that subdivision XIV states \u201cthat by reason of the said willful and unlawful accusations and actions,\u201d etc., plaintiff was subjected to great indignities; but the false imprisonment is obviously the central cause of harm charged, and'subdivision XV continues and emphasizes this.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">The interlocutory judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
