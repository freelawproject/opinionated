It is further alleged in the complaint that, among the assets so transferred, was a half interest in a certain patented process and a license to use the same, and that appellant has disposed of the same to his own profit. The defendant denies so much of the complaint in this regard as charges him with liability to account for the proceeds of the use of the patent and license. These denials raise an issue of fact which must be decided before an account of such proceeds can be required. The interlocutory judgment appoints a referee to take and state the defendant\u2019s accounts, and then contains this clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-16\">\u201cOrdered and adjudged that all further issues In this action, including ail matters relating to the scope of the aforesaid accounting, be and .the same hereby are referred to said referee to hear and determine the same.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-17\">The apparent purpose of this clause is to refer to the referee the question whether or not the appellant is required to account for the matters concerning which he denies his liability to account. So much of the judgment was unauthorized. It is the duty of the court, in the 'first instance, to determine the issues affecting the scope of the accounting, and send to a referee only the duty of taking the account within the lines laid down by the court. There is nothing to show that the issue whether or not appellant can be required to account for the proceeds of the patented process and license is one which\u2019 cannot prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>erly and conveniently be tried by the court, although, doubtless, if such an accounting should be ordered, it may require the assistance of a referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The order and judgment appealed from must therefore be reversed, with costs and disbursements, and the action remitted to the Special Term for appropriate action. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
