The complaint alleges that the defendant\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-3\">\u201cunder and pursuant to an oral agreement with the plaintiffs, on or about the 21st day of October, 1907, shipped to himself, notify Scott and Kleinhans, one car load of potatoes, said car load purporting to amount to 685V o bushels, at $0.56 per bushel, according to defendant\u2019s invoice mailed to the plaintiffs, said goods to become the property of the plaintiffs upon arrival in New York City, and notification of arrival of said goods received by plaintiffs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">It is then alleged that the goods arrived, but were found to be deficient in weight to the extent of 108 bushels, the value of which, stated at $60.48, the plaintiffs seek to recover. \u2022 There are similar allegations as to a' second shipment. It is apparent that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover is primarily dependent upon the contract pursuant to which the potatoes were shipped. It is alleged that there was an agreement; but it is not set forth, either in exact words or in substance. The allegations that under the agreement the potatoes were to become the property of the plaintiffs upon arrival in New York City does not help, because that allegation, if anything more than a conclusion of law, is entirely consistent with the idea that the potatoes were sent as a gift, in which case plaintiffs would scarcely have an action for damages because the gift was not so large as they had expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">It is not alleged, as, however, the fact probably was, that plaintiffs paid for the potatoes when received at 56 cents per bushel, according to the number of bushels shown on the invoice, and upon reweighing found that they had paid for a greater quantity than they had received. Not only was this state of facts not alleged, but as to only one shipment was thebe any evidence that plaintiffs had paid for the potatoes. Even this evidence was inadmissible under the pleadings, and was received-under objection. Furthermore, it was erroneous to admit evidence that defendant had paid shortage claims on former shipments.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
