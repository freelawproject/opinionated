At the time of the sale the wife was living apart from her husband, which fact was known to the plaintiff, and he so avers in his complaint. The goods were sold to the wife in 1905, and the undisputed evidence shows that the husband\u2019s net income during that year was $4,951, out of which he paid his wife during that time the sum of $2,533.28; regular agreed-upon payments of $40 each week having been made, and various sums at other times, in all aggregating said amount. Under such proof the husband cannot be held liable, nor is the fact that the husband testified that in addition to said weekly sum \u201cthere was extras,\u201d and that at times he had paid for dresses, etc., purchased by her, sufficient to support the theory of the plaintiff that there was authority conferred upon the wife to purchase necessaries upon the husband\u2019s credit, or that the provision so made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>for her was inadequate, or not commensurate with his means and her station in life.
