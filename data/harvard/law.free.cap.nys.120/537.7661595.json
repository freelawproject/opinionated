It is this act that it is Sought to restrain.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-16\">The plaintiff held a liquor tax certificate issued for the term from May 1, 1908, to September 30, 1908. During that time, and on or about September 27, 1908, \u2018one of his employ\u00e9s was arrested upon a charge of having violated the liquor tax law. Plaintiff obtained a certificate for the period from October 1, 1908, to September 30, 1909, and during this period, and on or about November 29, 1908, another employ\u00e9 was arrested charged with a violation of the liquor tax law. On June 25, 1909, Andre, the employ\u00e9 first arrested, was tried and convicted of the offense for which he had been arrested on September 27, 1908. Three days later, on June 28, 1909, Hoffman, the employ\u00e9 secondly arrested, was tried and convicted of the offense for which he had been arrested on November 29, 1908. Thus there is presented the case of two convictions, both within the lifetime of one certificate., for two offenses, one committed during the lifetime of one certificate, and the other committed during the lifetime of another certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-17\">The appellant contends that the statute should be read as if it provided that two violations of the liquor tax law by employ\u00e9s of the holder, if committed during the lifetime of the same certificate, shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>work a forfeiture. The only argument in favor of such a reading is that to construe the act as it is written would in this particular case Work a hardship. That is not a sufficient reason for disregarding the plain language of the statute. Matter of Hering, 133 App. Div. 293, 117 N. Y. Supp. 747. What the statute plainly says is that two convictions shall work a forfeiture. The language is too plain to require construction, and, even if we are to assume that these two convictions must be had during the lifetime of a single certificate, that necessity is satisfied by the facts of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The order is affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">INGRAHAM, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b563-7\">CLARKE, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-Sa\">I concur on the ground that these two convictions occurred during the life of one certificate.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b563-8\">LAUGHLIN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A11\">(dissenting). I am of opinion that the court erred in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion for an injunction. The only circumstances under which the action of the State Commissioner of Excise and of his deputy and of the sheriff would be warranted are where, as prescribed in subdivision 3 of section 36 of the liquor tax law, the liquor tax certificate has been forfeited because there have been \u201ctwo convictions of clerks, agents, employ\u00e9s or servants of a holder of a liquor tax certificate for a violation of any provision\u201d of the liquor tax law, for certified copies of such convictions are made the basis of the right of the sheriff to seize the liquor tax certificate to restrain which this action is brought. Subdivision 8, \u25a0\u00a7 36, Liquor Tax Law. Where there have been two such convictions, then, by virtue of the provisions of said subdivision of section 36 of the liquor tax law, the certificate is forfeited, and it may lawfully be taken from the holder thereof by the sheriff on being duly authorized by the State Commissioner of Excise, or his deputy. If there have not been two convictions within the statute, then it cannot be maintained that the commissioner should be allowed to take the law into his own hands and attempt to seize the certificate for any other violation of law without a judicial determination of the question as to whether or not the certificate has been forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">I am of opinion that the two convictions to which the Legislature in this subdivision refers must be two convictions during the life of the particular certificate sought to be seized, for, otherwise, there is no limit of either time or place to the application of the statute, and neither conviction need be had during the life of the certificate which it is claimed has been thus forfeited, but both may have been had before the certificate was issued or on account of offenses committed pri- or to the issuance thereof and in any other place within the state. The statute I think has reference to the relation of master and servant, or principal and agent, during the life of the particular certificate, the possession of which is sought to be obtained. Unless this be so, it is not material that the other violations were in the same premises or under the certificate for that or any prior year. The statute, in my opinion, must be construed as relating to violations during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>life of the certificate and with respect to the business authorized by the particular certificate, or there is no limitation of time or place,, excepting, perhaps, the boundaries of the state within which or where the -violations may have occurred. It is reasonable to suppose that the Legislature might require that the holder of a liquor tax certificate,, on discovering that one employ\u00e9, acting in the course of his employment, had violated the liquor tax law, or that a claim to that effect was made, and that the employ\u00e9 was convicted thereof, should exercise particular care to see that no other violation occurred during the life-of-that certificate; but it should require clear language to indicate-a legislative intent that the holder should be debarred from the right to traffic in liquor for the period of three years, if 25 or 50 years after the first conviction any of his employ\u00e9s should happen to be convicted of a violation of the law committed in his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">There has been only one violation of the liquor tax law during the-life of the certificate in force at the time this action was brought. The-conviction of an employ\u00e9 does not establish the guilt of the principal,, and we have held that it does not establish the violation of the liquor-tax law as against the holder of the liquor tax certificate, although on due proof of a violation by either the holder or the employ\u00e9 the-certificate may be revoked and canceled. Subdivision 2, \u00a7 27, Liquor-Tax Law. The Legislature has provided that two convictions of anemploy\u00e9 work a forfeiture of the certificate, and I think that this shows that violations under that certificate only are intended to work such forfeiture. Liquor Tax Law, \u00a7 36, subd. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">I am of opinion, therefore, that the order should be reversed, and! motion for injunction granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">HOUGHTON, J\u201e concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
