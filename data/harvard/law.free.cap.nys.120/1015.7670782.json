The action is to recover damages for a breach of a contract to remove certain buildings. The answer is in effect a general denial. The proposed supplemental answer pleads that the defendant sued the plaintiff in the Municipal Court for work, labor, and services incident to the removal of the buildings, on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to perform the contract on his part, that after trial the defendant recovered a judgment, that such judgment is a bar, and that the doctrine of res adjudicata applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-13\">This action was b\u00e9gun on December 24, 1908, and issue was joined on January 13, 1909. It appears that the action in the Municipal Court, was begun on December 28, 1908. Issue was joined, trial was had, and judgment was rendered in October, 1909. The judgment, then, was rendered after this action was begun, and if it was that of a competent court, determining the matters in controversy, or a part thereof, it is the subject of a supplemental answer. Section 544, Code of Civil Procedure. Upon such an application the court does not forestall the trial court to determine the effect of the proposed plea. It but decides whether the plea should be tried by the trial court. Conried v. Witmark, 73 App. Div. 185, 76 N. Y. Supp. 690; Silver &amp; Co. v. Waterman, 122 App. Div. 373, 106 N. Y. Supp. 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-14\">We cannot say that the plea is bad or frivolous, for it appears that the adjudication in the Municipal Court deals with the subject-matter of this action and touches the point of the contract. And the affidavit of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney shows that the plaintiff sought to stay the Municipal Court action, to the end that all the matters in dispute be adjudicated in this action. The judgment of the Municipal Court could not be available as a defense in this action unless pleaded, and hence it was necessary that the defendant apply for a supplemental pleading. Lytle v. Crawford, 69 App. Div. 273-281, 74 N. Y. Supp. 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-15\">The learned counsel for the respondent contends that the motion was not meritorious, because a stipulation was made for extension of the defendant\u2019s time to amend its answer until February, 1909, and that an amended answer was not served. But the judgment which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>defendant would set up was not rendered until October, 1909. And it is also argued that the practice of the defendant is indicative of bad faith. We see nothing more than tactics which are frequently employed, and, on the other hand, it appears that the application to plead the judgment was made within a very short time after it was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-3\">We think that a proper exercise of discretion requires the granting\" of the motion, and hence we reverse the order, with $10 costs apd disbursements, that the Special Term may dispose of it in accord with, this opinion. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
