At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that this action was commenced for violation of chapter 667, p. 1471, of the Laws of 1900, and this law was repealed in February, 1909. Laws 1909, c. 49 (Consol. Laws, c. 45). Decision was reserved, and the defendant then rested. The trial justice thereafter rendered judgment dismissing the complaint on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Upon this appeal the respondent practically concedes that by section 31 of the statutory construction law (Laws 1892, p. 1491, c. 677), and sections 93 and 94 of the general construction law (Laws 1909-, c. 27 [Consol. Laws, c. 22]), the right to maintain an action for a penalty which accrued before the Consolidated Laws went into effect was saved, and may be asserted, enforced, and prosecuted thereafter. The statute is absolutely clear on this point. The respondent, however, claims that there is no plaintiff in existence to maintain the action; that the Board of Pharmacy created by Laws 1900, p. 1471, c. 667, went out of existence upon the enactment of the public health law of 1909 (Laws-1909, <em>c. </em>49 [Consol. Laws, c. 45]). This contention is absolutely untenable. The law of 1909 was practically a re-enactment of the law of 1900. Section 230 of the law of 1909 evidently contemplated, not the formation of a new board, but the legal continuation of the old board. There was no change of personnel, of organization, or of substantial powers. It specifically provides for the election of-members only \u201cat the expiration of the terms of the members of the State Board of Pharmacy now in office.\u201d Moreover, the Legislature has carefully guarded against any possible interpretation of the statute as now contended for by the respondent by section 95 of the general construction law and by chapter 596, p. 1797, of the Laws of 1909.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs absolute to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
