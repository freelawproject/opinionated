Patrick, so convicted, be stricken from the rolls of attorneys. The respondent filed an answer to this petition, in which he denies that he has ever been duly convicted of murder, or any other felony, or by a court having constitutional authority to convict him (a) as constituted, or (b) on the proceedings had.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">There is no denial that the respondent is the person named in the record attached to the petition. The Court of General Sessions having jurisdiction to try the respondent for the crime of murder, in the absence of an allegation that the court did not have jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, or that the respondent was not the person named in the record, the record is conclusive. The regularity of the proceeding which resulted in the conviction of the respondent cannot be inquired into in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-10\">Subdivision 3 of section 88 of the judiciary law (chapter 35, Laws 1909 [Consol. Laws, c. 30]) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-11\">\u201cWhenever any attorney and counselor at law shall be convicted of a felony, there may be presented to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court a certified or exemplified copy of the judgment of such conviction, and thereupon the name of the person so convicted shall, by order of the court, be stricken from the roll of attorneys.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-12\">This provision is mandatory, and, where there is presented to the court a certified or exemplified copy of the judgment of such conviction of an attorney and counselor at law of a felony, the court is required to order his name to be stricken from the rolls of attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-13\">The facts alleged by the respondent in his answer and cross-petition are entirely irrelevant to this proceeding, and! justify no judicial action by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-14\">The motion will therefore be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
