This record contained no recital nor proof that process of any sort in that action was ever served upon the defendant, or that he appeared in such action. It was therefore error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>for the trial justice to refuse to allow the defendant to prove that he was never served with any papers in that action. The New Jersey record shows that the defendant was not at the time of the rendition of the judgment a resident of the state of New Jersey, and that he did not appear in the action. The only way, then, that the plaintiff could have obtained a personal judgment there, which would have been binding upon the defendant in this state, was by personal service of the process within the state of New Jersey. N. Y. L. Ins. Co. v. Aitkin, 125 N. Y. 660, at pages 674, 675, 26 N. E. 732; and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">In this New Jersey action certain property was seized by writ of attachment and sold as belonging to the defendant; but, since it does not appear that he was served with process, the judgment is effectual to bind only such property of the defendant as was found within the jurisdiction. It can form no basis for a personal judgment. Ward v. Boyce, 152 N. Y. 191, 195, 46 N. E. 180, 36 L. R. A. 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
