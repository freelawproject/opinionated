While the allegations of the complaint are indefinite, and while the defendant may not thereby be so apprised of the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim that he can safely go to trial, nevertheless the plaintiff has pleaded facts, and not conclusions of law, and the complaint is not demurrable in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-21\">The cases relied upon by* the defendant are not in point, because in all these cases the allegation was merely that strict performance was \u201cwaived,\u201d and the court held that this was not a statement of facts, but a legal conclusion. Pope Mfg. Co. v. Rubber Goods Mfg. Co., 110 App. Div. 341, 97 N. Y. Supp. 73; Grant v. Cobre Grande Copper Co., 126 App. Div. 750, 111 N. Y. Supp. 386. In the latter case the allegation of performance or waiver was in the alternative, and the Appellate Division held that such a statement was insufficient. This case was reversed by the Court of Appeals (193 N. Y. 306, 316, 86 N. E. 34, 38) upon a different question; but the court was evidently in doubt whether even such an allegation is demurrable, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-22\">\u201cIt must be conceded that the allegations of performance on the part of the Cobre Grande Company of the requirements of the optional contracts, so called, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>as above quoted, are in the alternative, and that the effect is to allege payment or waiver or settlement. But, passing the question as to whether the complaint would be demurrable for this reason, under our modern practice, or <em>whether the parties should move to malee the complaint more definite and certain, </em>we shall proceed to the consideration of another phase of the question.\u201d (Italics are mine.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The defendant has also demurred to paragraph <em>2 </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s reply. The same considerations apply to this demurrer; but the demurrer is also bad in form, since a demurrer to a paragraph of the reply is not authorized. New Jersey Steel &amp; Iron Co. v. Robinson, 60 App. Div. 69, 69 N. Y. Supp. 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed, and the demurrers of the defendant to the first cause of action of plaintiff\u2019s complaint and to paragraph 2 of plaintiff\u2019s reply should be overruled, with costs in this court and in the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
