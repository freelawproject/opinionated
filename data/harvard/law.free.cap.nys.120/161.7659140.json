The power to issue such licenses, now vested in the police commissioner, was formerly vested in and exercised by the mayor. Sections 1998-2000, c. 410, p. 1, Laws 1882. Such power is discretionary, and not controllable by mandamus. People ex rel. Worth v. Grant, 58 Hun, 455, 12 N. Y. Supp. 879; Matter of Armstrong v. Murphy (No. 1) 65 App. Div. 123, 72 N. Y.

This rule is varied only when the action of the board or person vested with the power of issuing a license is arbitrary, tyrannical, or unreasonable, or is based upon false information.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">The record before us discloses a wise and commendable exercise of the discretion vested in the respondent, and the order must be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
