The answer, alleges as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-21\">\u201cAnd for a third defense, and in justification of the statements contained in the letter complained of, defendant alleges (6) that the matter complained of, although never published or circulated by this defendant, was and is substantially true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-22\">And it then proceeds to set up certain parts thereof as true. This is pleaded as a complete defense, and the truth is a defense in an action for libel, and justification means a plea of the truth; but the plea of justification is a plea of confession and avoidance, and must admit the publication of the alleged defamatory words. This the defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>does not do, but specifically alleges \u201cthat the defendant never published or circulated\u201d the alleged libel. The defense is, therefore, bad; and it is also bad because the justification is not as broad as the libel. The demurrer thereto was, therefore, improperly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">Nor is the defense saved because in the seventh paragraph of the answer it is alleged that in mitigation of any damages to which plaintiff might otherwise appear entitled, because of the publication of the alleged libelous matter set forth in the complaint, this defendant repeats and renews all and singular the matter stated under the third defense herein, and will give evidence thereof as a partial defense in mitigation of damages, as well as in justification, because, while not numbered as a fourth and partial defense, that is what it is as matter of fact and law, and as by the language of the seventh paragraph the pleader has characterized the sixth paragraph as the third defense, the court must treat it as he has, as a complete defense in justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">It follows, therefore, that the interlocutory judgment appealed from should be modified, .by sustaining the demurrer to the third defense, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs to either party, with leave to the defendant to serve an amended answer within 20 days after the service of the order to be entered hereon, on payment of costs in the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
