If this had been all that the plaintiff offered to prove,' the dismissal of the complaint might have been proper, upon the theory that fire escapes are provided for use in case of fire, and that the landlord is only liable for injuries sustained while they are being used for the purpose for which they were designed. Mayer v. Laux, 18 Misc. Rep. 671, 43 N. Y. Supp. 743; McAlpin v. Powell, 70 N. Y. 126, 26 Am. Rep. 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">But the plaintiff further offered to prove that it was necessary to go upon the fire escape in order to make the examination required before an estimate of the cost of the work could be given, and that he (the plaintiff) had no knowledge that the supports of the fire escape were old, worn out, or corroded. If this could have been proved, I think the defendant would have been liable, and we are bound to assume that the plaintiff could have proved it. Clews v. Bank, 105 N. Y. 398, 11 N. E. 814. If it be the fact that it was necessary to go upon the fire escape in order to make the estimate which the defendant had requested from Crowley, it must be held that, if Crowley had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>gone upon the fire escape for that purpose, he would have been there at the defendant\u2019s invitation; and if the defendant, knowing the condition of the fire escape, invited Crowley to go upon it without warning, he would undoubtedly have been liable if Crowley had gone upon it and had been injured by its fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">It cannot be assumed, however, that the 'invitation to Crowley was purely a personal one. If not, any servant whom Crowley might properly have sent would have been on the premises by the defendant\u2019s invitation quite as m\u00fach as Crowley himself would have been. Coughtry v. Globe Woolen Co., 56 N. Y. 124, 126, 15 Am. Rep. 387; Burke v. Ireland, 26 App. Div. 487, 492, 50 N. Y. Supp. 369; Dougherty v. Weeks &amp; Son, 126 App. Div. 786, 789, 111 N. Y. Supp. 218. I do not know that it would make any difference in the plaintiff\u2019s case if, instead of being an agent or servant of Crowley, he had been himself an independent contractor, and had dealt with Crowley as such; nor is it necessary to pass upon that question. The plaintiff\u2019s statement of the case was that he had been sent there by Crowley, and that he went to the premises and commenced his examination pursuant to instructions. The inference that he was acting as the agent or servant of Crowley would be warranted, if necessary to his cause of action. Higgins v. Eagleton, 155 N. Y. 466, 471, 50 N. E. 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">GOFF, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b112-8\">LEHMAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKW\">(concurring). The plaintiff, although on the premises at the invitation of the defendant, was not an employ\u00e9 of the defendant. The defendant'did not owe the plaintiff the duty of providing him with a safe place to work; \u201cFor any such omission the defendant is not liable to one in the service of a third person, where the evidence shows no act of affirmative negligence on the part of the owner.\u201d Callan v. Pugh, 54 App. Div. 545, 66 N.- Y. Supp. 1118. However, \u201cwhere the owner of land, in the prosecution of his own purposes or business, or of a purpose or business in which there is a common interest, invites another, either expressly or impliedly, to come upon his premises, he cannot with impunity expose him to unreasonable or concealed dangers, as, for example, from an open trap in a passageway. The duty in this case is founded upon the plainest principles of justice.\u201d Larmore v. Crown Point Iron Co., 101 N. Y. 391, at page 395, 4 N. E. 752, at page 754 (54 Am. Rep. 718).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">The complaint herein alleges that the \u201cdefendant had knowledge of the defective and dangerous condition of the said supports of said fire escape, and of the platform thereof.\u201d If the defendant, with such knowledge, invited the plaintiff upon the premises, then he was liable for any injury arising because of this act of affirmative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">I concur with Mr. Justice GIEGERICH solely for this reason.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
