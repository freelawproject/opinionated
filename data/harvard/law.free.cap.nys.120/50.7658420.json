In the order denying this motion, it was provided that the creditor had \u201cleave to obtain another order to examine the defendant herein\u00bb\u201d Such another order having been obtained, served, and disobeyed, the creditor moved to punish for contempt, and the debtor moved to set it aside, contending that there was no jurisdiction in the court to grant a second order while the first proceedings were pending, and pointing out that they were still pending, because no order of discontinuance had been entered, as provided by section 2454, Code Civ. Proc. The creditor\u2019s motion to punish for contempt was granted, and that of the debtor, to set aside the second order for his re-examination, was denied, from both of which orders the debtor now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">His contention is well founded. Schwarmecke v. Glenny, 54 Misc. Rep. 36, 103 N. Y. Supp. 499. The order granting \u201cleave to obtain another order\u201d for defendant\u2019s examination was not an order of discontinuance. Both orders appealed from are reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and without prejudice to a new application for examination of the judgment debtor upon entry of an order discontinuing the first proceedings. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
