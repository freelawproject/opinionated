Section 185 of the Negotiable Instruments Law (Consol. Laws, c. 38) provides that notice of dishonor need not be given to the drawer, \u201cwhere the drawer is the person to whom the instrument is presented for payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-15\">The demurrer was, therefore, properly overruled, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs, with leave to the defendant to answer within six days upon payment of costs.
