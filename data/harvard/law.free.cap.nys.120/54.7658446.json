There is no testimony that would tend to show why the boy did not see the car approaching from the west, and no excuse is offered for his failure to look in both directions before leaving the sidewalk. No\" testimony explaining why the boy should have remained in the path of a car which he knew was approaching, instead of standing between the tracks, was offered. The plaintiff was a boy of <em>12 </em>years, apparently, at least, normal, in the sixth grade of the public schools, and upon this testimony he has certainly failed to show that he exercised the degree of care that might reasonably be expected of a boy of his age and faculties.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-15\">The judgment should be.reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
