The order which was originally entered granted all that plaintiff moved for. As the order was resettled, there was excluded from the operation of the receivership one parcel of real estate. The order thus becomes less favorable to plaintiff than she asked, and she desires to appeal therefrom. She finds herself embarrassed, however, by the fact that the order as resettled recites that it was made \"on motion of Johnson and Johnson, attorneys\"for the plaintiff.\u201d In its present form the order certainly is not what plaintiff asked for, and she should not be subjected to possible embarrassment upon appeal by the erroneous recital that an order which she opposed was entered upon her motion. Upon a similar question this court said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-13\">\u2018\u2018A party intending to appeal from an order or part thereof, which he claims is in violation of his rights, should not be compelled to run the hazard upon appeal of having the point made against him that his appeal will not lie because the order below was made on his request. If the recital in the order states that the order was made on his motion, he does run that hazard.\u201d Raymond v. Tiffany, 115 App. Div. 350, 100 N. Y. Supp. 807.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-14\">We ar\u00e9 not to be understood as holding that such a recital will always be. held to'be conclusive upon an appellant, if it appears otherwise from the record that the order as made was not of his asking, but contrary thereto. The recital, however, is a circumstance to be considered and in certain cases may prove to be conclusive. It is seldom, and perhaps never, necessary or appropriate to recite in an order or judgment that it was entered \"on motion\u201d of an attorney, although it should show who moved for the order or judgment and what he asked for. The order or judgment granted is the act of the court. If it grants all the relief that the moving party asked for, it can do no harm, although it is unnecessary to recite that the order was entered on his motion. If it grants less, the party, who moved may appeal, and the order, not conforming to his motion, should not be so drawn as to appear to have been asked for by him or to be satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-15\">The order appealed from should therefore be reversed, with $10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>costs and disbursements, and the motion to resettle granted to the extent of striking out the recital that it was made \u201con motion\u201d of Johnson &amp; Johnson, attorneys for the plaintiff. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
