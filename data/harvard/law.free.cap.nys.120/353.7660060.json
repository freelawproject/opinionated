The facts present an unusual' case of loches. The action was begun on June 33, 1903, to recover damages for the death of plaintiff\u2019s husband by reason of the alleged negligence of defendant. Issue was joined July 11, 1903; but the cause was not noticed for trial'until April, 1904, when it was put on the calendar and a preference granted, A renewal note of issue was filed for the new calendar made up for October, 1904; but no renewal note of issue was filed for either of the new calendars made up for 1906 and 1908. In November, 1908, a motion was made and granted by default to dismiss the cause for want of prosecution. A motion to restore the cause to the calendar was then made and denied. Then followed \u00e1 series of motions culminating in the order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">No excuse is offered for this remarkable delay in prosecuting the action except the neglect and forgetfulness of the attorney having it in charge. \u2019This has repeatedly been held to be insufficient. It may be a hardship upon plaintiff to lose a possibly meritorious claim, but that she does so is the fault of the attorney whom she chose. An equal hardship might be imposed upon defendant 'if called upon to defend an action of this character more than six years after the event, and more than thrice the period thereafter allowed by statute for bringing such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">The order appealed from is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the. motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
