The action is to foreclose a mortgage, it being sought incidentally to hold the respondent Weinstein upon a written guaranty to pay any deficiency. His answer is obviously sham, except, perhaps, that he sufficiently denies due notice of default and a waiver of further notice. The action came on for trial on June 16, 1909, and was adjourned until June 33d, to enable the respondent\u2019s counsel to conclude an engagement upon which he was then occupied. That engagement terminated on June 31st, when counsel should have'held himself prepared to enter upon the trial of this action. Instead of doing that, he entered upon other engagements, sending a clerk to procure a further adjournment of this action. The court very properly refused to further adjourn it, and respondent\u2019s default was taken. The course -pursued by defendant was nothing short of trifling with the court, especially as the only issue raised by defendant\u2019s answer was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>an extremely simple one, and other counsel could have easily been procured to try it. The facts much resemble those in Carruth v. Rosenthal, 124 App. Div. 670, 109 N. Y. Supp. 337, where a default was suffered by the same counsel, who defaulted in the court below in the present case, and an order opening his default was reversed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The order appealed .from is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
