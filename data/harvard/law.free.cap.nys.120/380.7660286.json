The case- seems to have been settled, and the defendant, conceiving that there was some error therein, moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>for a resettlement, asking that certain matters be inserted. On the argument of that motion, the court examined the stenographer\u2019s minutes in detail and in the order denying the motion the stenographer\u2019s minutes were recited as having been read. The defendant appealed from such order refusing a resettlement of the case, and such appeal is now pending. In the course of preparing his papers on appeal from such order refusing a resettlement the defendant made a motion to be relieved from printing the stenographer\u2019s minutes recited in the order. The court denied such motion, and the defendant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The stenographer\u2019s minutes are alleged to consist of nearly 250 pages, exclusive of exhibits. It was unnecessary to print them in full in order to bring before this court the question as to whether the order refusing resettlement was right or wrong. Extracts relating to the matters in controversy only were necessary. Such parts as were material could be designated, and those that had no bearing upon the question eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the matter remitted to the Special Term for action thereon in accordance herewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
