The right of the defendant to make such a motion is challenged by the plaintiff, who has cited the recent decision made at Special Term in this department in Ship v. Fridenberg, 120 N. Y. Supp. 969, where it was held that the statute was not intended to embrace a case of the dismissal of the complaint for insufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-19\">Previously, in October, 1908, in Mitchell v. Dunmore Realty Co., 60 Misc. Rep. 563, 112 N. Y. Supp. 659, I had held directly the contrary, and had granted the motion of a defendant made under the same statute to dismiss the complaint for insufficiency, calling attention to the fact that the language of the section in plain terms conferred the right upon either party, and stating at considerable length the many advantages of the practice authorized by the new Code section referred to. In Jones v. Gould, 130 App. Div. 451, 114 N. Y. Supp. 956, decided in February, 1909, the Appellate Division of this department expressly held that while, under the former practice, the sufficiency of a complaint could only be tested by a demurrer or by a motion to dismiss upon the trial, now the same result could be accomplished by a motion to dismiss made at Special Term in advance of the trial; and in the recent case of Switzer v. Commissioners for Loan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>ing Certain Moneys of the United States in New York County, 119 N. Y. Supp. 383, the same court said that such a motion for judgment is equivalent to a demurrer to the complaint for general insufficiency. It must, therefore, be regarded as the settled law in this-department that a defendant is entitled to make a motion of this character.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Passing, now, to a consideration of the order which is the subject of this review, it is urged by the defendant that the plaintiff\u2019s bill of particulars should be read with the complaint and made a part of the-same, and that if so read the complaint does not state a cause of action. In support of this position he cites several cases which seem to sustain his contention; but an examination of the same shows that the language used by the court had reference to the office of a bill-, of particulars when used upon a trial, and not when the sufficiency-of a complaint was tested by a demurrer or on a motion to dismiss-the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">Upon a trial, a bill of particulars limits the proof, while upon demurrer or motion for judgment\u2019 upon the pleadings, dismissing the-complaint because it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause-of action, the bill of particulars has nothing to do with the complaint, as it forms no part of the record. Seaman v. Low, 17 N. Y. Super. Ct. (4 Bosw.) 337; Kreiss v. Seligman, 8 Barb. 439; Arrow Steamship Co. v. Bennett, 26 N. Y. Supp. 948; Taylor v. Security Mutual\u2019 Life Ins. Co., 73 App. Div. 319, 76 N. Y. Supp. 671; Dixon v. Bunnell, 52 Misc. Rep. 560, 102 N. Y. Supp. 775; Spies v. Michelsen, 15 Misc. Rep. 414, 36 N. Y. Supp. 619; Donald v. Gearhardt, 42 Misc. Rep. 269, 86 N. Y. Supp. 598. In Arrow Steamship Co. v. Bennett, supra, Mr. Justice Ingraham, at page 949 of 26 N. Y. Supp., used the-following language, which is particularly applicable to the question-under consideration, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-7\">\u201cIt is true that the bill of particulars has been spoken of as an amplification of the pleading to which it is attached, and must be construed as a part' thereof; but, strictly speaking, a bill of particulars-is no part of the pleading to which it refers. * * * The facts that would entitle a party to judgment must be stated in the pleading; the details of the claim are to be stated in the-bill of particulars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">As we cannot consider the bill of particulars on this appeal, the decision of the lower court was correct, and the order should therefore be-affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
