Defendant in substance generally denies the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-17\">The issues presented are simple. The burden of proof is on the plaintiff. Defendant is fully apprised of the nature of plaintiff\u2019s claim-. If he shows, as he states, that he does not even know the plaintiff, he must succeed in the action. Under the authorities, however, defendant may be entitled to a statement from plaintiff as to whether the employment was oral or in writing, and the time and place of the agreements on which he sues.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-18\">As so modified, the order should be affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
