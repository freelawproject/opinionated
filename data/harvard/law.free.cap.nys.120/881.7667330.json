The action is by a salesman against his employer for dama<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>ges for a wrongful discharge. Plaintiff was employed under a written contract for a term of 18 months from May 1, 1907, to October 31, 1908. He was discharged in February, 1908. His complaint was dismissed because in the opinion of the trial court he had failed to prove any damages or any facts upon which a verdict for damages could be based. He did prove his contract of employment, which contained the following clause as to' his compensation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-5\">\u201cTour earnings to be based on fou.r per cent, of your sales, discounts and bad debts deducted, allowing you a drawing account of $60 per week, and commissions in excess, if any, to be paid you at the expiration of the present agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Plaintiff also gave evidence of his efforts to obtain other employment, what he obtained, and how much he earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">It is clear that the dismissal of the complaint resulted from a misconception of the nature of the compensation agreed to be paid plaintiff. Under his contract he was entitled to be paid $60 per week in any event. His compensation might amount to more if his sales were large, but not to less, even if his sales did not come up to his employer\u2019s expectation. The case is not to be distinguished in principle from Gifford v. Waters, 67 N. Y. 80. The respondent, indeed, makes but a halfhearted attempt to uphold the ruling below, insisting that upon plaintiff\u2019s own evidence he showed justification for his damages. We should hesitate to go so far as to hold this as' a matter of law, for that is a matter which should ordinarily be left to the jury. In any event, however, the plaintiff, his complaint having been dismissed, is entitled to the most favorable inferences of which the evidence is capable. The sole ground upon which the complaint was dismissed was .that, he- had failed to make proof of damage. He showed damage prima facie by showing the amount the defendants had absolutely agreed to pay him per week. The dismissal was therefore erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">The determination of the Appellate Term and the judgment of the City Court are therefore reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant in this court and the courts below to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
