The notice of motion was accompanied by an affidavit which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-17\">\u201cIt is made in support of a motion for an order directing judgment for plaintiff herein on the ground that the answer to the complaint herein is frivolous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-18\">The order made and entered upon the motion also recites that it was made' \u201cupon reading and filing the affidavit,\u201d etc. The rule is well settled that a pleading cannot be declared to be frivolous, unless it so appears by a mere inspection.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-19\">\u201cWhether a pleading is or is not frivolous must be determined by an inspection thereof, .and the practice of interposing affidavits for or against the pleading cannot be sustained.\u201d Dancel v. Goodyear, etc., Co., 67 App. Div. 498, 73 N. Y. Supp. 875.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-20\">\u201cA pleading will not be regarded as frivolous, unless its insufficiency is apparent upon a mere statement without argument.\u201d Rankin v. Rush, 93 App. Div. 181, 185, 87 N. Y. Supp. 539, 542.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-21\">In the case at bar, the affidavit used on the motion contains not only a restatement of the allegations set forth in the answer, but it also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>contains a conclusion drawn from such restatement as to the sufficiency of the answer and hence its use was error. The answer is clearly bad and insufficient in law; but, as before stated, the use of the affidavit was error, for which the judgment and order must be reversed, without costs, with leave to the appellant to move to amend his answer within five days upon payment of costs in the lower court to the date of such motion, leaving the plaintiff, upon failure of the defendant to so pay such costs .and make such motion, to again move for judgment. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
