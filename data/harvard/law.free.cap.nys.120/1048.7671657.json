Thereafter a large part of the residuary estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>of John Boyle, deceased, was delivered by Phoebe A. D. Boyle and John Neuscheler, acting as a majority of the executors, to the defendant, and the defendant received the same and delivered to the said executors the entire capital stock of the corporation in exchange therefor, and has ever since held and now holds, and uses, the said property and assets in its business as the capital thereof. The plaintiffs as executors and trustees aforesaid are the owners and holders of every share of the capital stock of the defendant corporation. During the first two years of its business, the company earned and paid to the executors 16 per cent, upon its capital, and accumulated in the form of merchandise, accounts, fixtures, and increase of property generally a surplus of $80,045.79 in addition to_ $20,000 reserved for bad debts. During the years 1907 to 1908, owing to the financial conditions which prevailed during that year, sufficient profits were not obtained from said business to warrant the declaration of a dividend by the directors, and therefore no dividends were declared. The evidence is' that the whole sum reserved is $100,045.79. In action No. 1 the finding is that the defendant be directed to pay the plaintiffs $45,000 coming into possession of the defendant prior to September 28, 1908, while in action No. 2 the finding is that the defendant pay the plaintiffs $80,045.79 coming to the defendant prior to the same date. These sums total $125,045.79, which is in excess of the reserve. But I understand that the $45,000 is a part of the $80,045.79, and that the court allowed the defendant to retain $20,000 reserved for bad debts. To comply with the decrees, the defendant must derive the sum demanded from tangible property and accounts in which it exists, to which end these classes of property must be reduced to money. In other words, the business of the company has expanded so that its varied properties exceed its capital by the sum named, and it is the excess that the court has in effect directed to be reduced to money and paid to the plaintiffs. Shrinking its credits and stock carried might be a delicate or even perilous undertaking. It would have been so during the embarrassing times of 1907 and 1908. Certain of the surplus is in the \u201cincrease of property generally.\u201d This may mean that the property represented by the capital has increased in value, and, if so, the decrees would mean that the increment was income, and require that the corpus be decreased to the value of the nominal capital for the purpose of making the imposed payments. The uncertainties attending the situation of the property indicate that the court could not beneficially assume the duties of the directors and supervise the conduct of the corporation. If this should be attempted, it should be in an action directed to that purpose. But I pass to the indubitable contention that this property, in whatever form it may be, is a specific part of the trust estate, and as such payable or deliverable to the trustees. As I understand the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, it is that the residuary turned over to the corporation was property theretofore held in trust, and to which the trustees had title, and this is undisputed; that it could not be conveyed or transferred to the corporation so as to be relieved from the impress of the trust, inasmuch as that would be in contravention of the trust and the directions creating it. This claim! will not bear examination. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>The will gave the title to the trustees. It directed an incorporation of the testator\u2019s business. It empowered the executors and trustees to sell the real estate and mineral estate, and to invest the proceeds or the mineral lands unconverted, and also the personal estate \u201cin stocks, bonds, or other securities of any corporation formed to succeed to my business now carried on under the name of John Boyle &amp; Company.\u201d But to do this the specific property received by the trustees and to-which they had title or the proceeds thereof must be turned over to the corporation in exchange for its stock or bonds. Thereby the property would pass out of the trust and the title would pass from the trustees to the corporation, if it took the property direct, or, if so sold to another, then to such other. . The trustees could not sell the title and keep the title. The property could not be a part of an express trust, and yet vest in title in the person to whom it was sold, and, if it passed out of the trust and vested in another, there - is no way whereby it could be declared reinstated in the trust, except the way pointed out by the will. It was not in contravention of the trust to vest the title in the corporation and divest the trustees of the title, for that was just what the will contemplated. What was intended is clearly expressed, and what was done was a precise execution of the will. The trustees took the specific property out of the trust by transfer to the corporation, and received in allowed substitution the stock of the corporation, which at once fell under the trust provisions and exists subject to all its terms. Are the shares a part of the trust property ? Have the trustees title thereto ? Such must be the case. How, then, could the property of the corporation, represented by the shares, also be a part of the trust property to which-the trustees have or in equity should have title? Instead of measuring their rights by the shares, instead of submitting to and obeying the fourteenth paragraph of the will, the trustees leap over and disregard them, and seek a control, possession, and title that would have belonged to them if no transfer and investment in the corporation had been made, but which the will and law both deny them. Whatever the testator directed done, he presumably intended to be done pursuant to and in subjection to the law of the state. When he directed the creation of a corporation, he meant a legal entity coming into being as the statute directed, to be conducted pursuant thereto, having the powers and subject to the constraints placed thereon by \"the statute. He intended that the directors thereof should be amenable to and obey the law. He did not intend, he did not suggest, narrowing their capacities or duties so that they would disobey the law, so that they would in the conduct of the corporation use less judgment, wisdom, discretion, or power than the law contemplates. What other directors may legally do they were endowed with ability to do, and yet, if the plaintiffs\u2019 contention is true, they are the creatures of the will and not the statute. It is the will that commands them. It is the will that circumscribes their powers, so that the usual legal ability to create a reserve is taken away. It is the will that fixes the tenure of the property of the corporation. In my judgment the will does not seek to constrain them, but merely directs that a corporation such as the law conten\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>plates be formed, that to it the trust property be transferred, and that the corporation be conducted only as the law commands.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">The judgments should be reversed and a new trial granted, costs to abide the final award of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
