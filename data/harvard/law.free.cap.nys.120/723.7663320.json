There is apparently no dispute that plaintiff\u2019s assignor worked regularly till September 19th and was paid regularly till September 4th, and on September 21st he was paid, according to defendant, \u201c$40 on account of the last two weeks.\u201d He is therefore entitled to be paid at least the $20 still due for these weeks, unless the defendant can establish a defense to the entire claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-19\">The trial justice, upon the trial, excluded all evidence intended to establish the defense pleaded. Even if this exclusion was erroneous, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>the judgment cannot be sustained, because there is nothing in the record that would show that the defendant, could establish the defense by competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, but without costs of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
