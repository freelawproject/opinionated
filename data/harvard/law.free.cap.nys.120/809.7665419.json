A bill of particulars was filed showing $340.07, and the complaint was amended accordingly, and also by changing \u201cDecember\u201d to \u201cNovember.\u201d The answer denied that \u201cchasing the walls\u201d was done by plaintiff; denied that $306.07 was the reasonable value of the work; \u201cor that services and materials furnished to defendant were worth any sum whatsoever in excess of $110\u201d; denied that the work was workmanlike or reasonably fit for its intended services. For a further and separate defense it alleged that the work and materials furnished were pursuant to an agreement for actual cost of labor and materials plus 10 per cent., upon time slips to be given to the architect each day, payments to be made only upon said architect\u2019s certificate, and that no such certificate was given. On these issues the cas\u00e9 proceeded to trial without a jury. The court said to plaintiff\u2019s attorney :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-12\">\u201cYou must proceed on one theory or the other\u2014the reasonable value of the work or the agreed price. If I find there is an agreed price, and you have made the wrong election, you will be dismissed. You cannot proceed on both theories.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-13\">Plaintiff did not elect, as, indeed, there was no occasion for its so doing. It was for the defendant on the pleadings to show the agrees ment set up in its answer by affirmative proof, in opposition to plaintiff\u2019s claim on quantum meruit. At the close of the case the court said he believed the architect\u2019s testimony that the work was ordered with the distinct understanding of an agreed price, to wit, cost and 10 per cent., and, except as to admitted items, dismissed the complaint \u201cwith-1 out prejudice,\u201d and gave judgment for the amount admitted, because unable to determine the cost. From the judgment for $110 and costs in its favor, plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-14\">The trouble with the conclusion reached is that Mr. Hull, the architect, confined his testimony of \u201ccost and 10 per cent.\u201d to the \u201cchasing\u201d (a technical term relating to cutting bricks for wiring), agreeing that if Brown (the contractor) did not pay defendant would, and as to \u201coutlet's\u201d he said the same thing to plaintiff\u2019s superintendent. These two items, however, were but a part of the claim here. Another diffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>culty with the conclusion is that the case is barren of evidence to show the cost of the work and labor done and furnished by plaintiff, so that on the trial court\u2019s own theory the credibility given to Mr. Hull\u2019s testimony was not a sufficient basis for accurately fixing the amount due in any sum for \u201ccost and 10 per cent.\u201d Whether the $110 admitted and awarded was quantum meruit, or cost and 10 per cent., does not appear. There should be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
