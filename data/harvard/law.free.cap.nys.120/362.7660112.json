The answer alleges a breach by the plaintiff, and demands judgment upon its counterclaim for $370,000. The order for examination provides that the defendant and certain of its specified officers \u201csubmit to an examination concerning the following elements of damage alleged in defendant\u2019s counterclaim,\u201d enumerating six particulars of the damages set up in the counterclaim in regard to which an examination is desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">. While we have held in Schweinberg v. Altman, 131 App. Div. 795, 116 N. Y. Supp. 318, upon a review of the cases, that the court has power to order a general examination by one party of his opponent, we have also held that it was an unwise use of that discretionary power to order an examination for the mere purpose of disclosing the items which went to the making up of the damages claimed by that opponent and which it was necessary for him to prove. Hartog &amp; Bernheimer Candy Co. v. Richmond Cedar Works, 124 App. Div. 629, 109 N. Y. Supp. 113; Caldwell v. Glazier, 128 App. Div. 315, 112 N. Y. Supp. 655. Upon an examination of the record here submitted, we find no sufficient reason to except this case from the rule there laid down.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-16\">The order appealed from should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant, and the motion to vacate the order for examination granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
