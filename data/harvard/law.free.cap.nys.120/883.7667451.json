His state-, ment is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-6\">\u201cJust as I was stepping off the rail I looked back to see if anything was coming along there, and didn\u2019t see a thing, and then I stepped off and walked 4 or 5 feet and I was hit by something. That is perfectly and absolutely correct. * * * From the place where I was hit up to the top of that hill at Bachman\u2019s Hotel, I could see right up there. There was nothing to obstruct my view. * * * The crown of that hill toward Bachman\u2019s from where I was hit is, I judge, 200 feet. I could see an automobile when it got on top of that hill.1\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">So, able to see 200 feet, and looking, the plaintiff walked 5 feet, and was hit; that is, while he was walking 5 feet, the automobile came 200 feet. Hence the automobile was going forty times as fast as the man, and, assuming that the man was walking 3 miles an hour, the automobile was going 120 miles an hour. This impossibility shows that the man did not look with th\u00e9 care demanded by the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">'The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted, costs to ab'ide the event. All concur, except HIRSCHBERG, P. J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
