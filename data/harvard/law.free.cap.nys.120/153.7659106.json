The Fitzgibbons Boiler Company furnished three boilers to a subcontractor,. which were delivered and installed in part performance of the contract work of Sheehan &amp; Co. The notices filed with the comptroller, which have been ordered discharged, do not purport to be notices of mechanics\u2019 liens. They consist of-three letters. The first is under date of July 12, 1905. It gives notice that the Fitzgibbons Boiler Company has an agreement, in writing, with Rossman &amp; Bracken, steam heating contractors, giving their office address, to furnish the three boilers designated in certain specifications, giving the purchase price, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the boilers were installed in the Bellevue Hospital, Gouverneur Branch, and that \u201cunder such contract it is especially provided that the title to the boilers.shall not pass from our company until all sums due on the purchase price of the same, are fully paid and satisfied.\u201d And it further states the purchase price of the boilers and that Sheehan &amp; Co. are the general contractors. The second letter is dated March 7, 1906, and refers to the other, and gives notice that a payment of $4,452 has been made on account, leaving a balance of $1,113 unpaid, and again draws attention to the provision of its contract by which title was not to pass until the whole amount of the purchase price should be paid. The third letter is under date of December 11, 1907, and refers to the second letter, and describes it as a letter \u201cin regard to a conditional bill of sale,\u201d and states that the amount \u201cof this conditional bill of sale was $5,565,\u201d and that there was a balance due and owing to the Fitzgibbons Boiler Company, of $1,113, together with interest thereon, \u201cbefore we relinquish our right and title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">It will be noticed that no lien was claimed upon the fund due or to grow due to the contractor. There was no attempt to comply with the requirements of section 12 of the lien law (chapter 418, p. 520, Laws. 1897). None of the letters state the residence of the claimant, nor did the first letter state the amount due or to become due, but merely the contract price, without stating whether or not it had been paid. None of the letters stated the date when any part of the purchase price became due. Section 12 of the lien law, as amended by section 2, c. 37, p. 74, of the Laws of 1902, which authorizes the filing of a notice of lien, provides with respect to the contents thereof, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5m\">\u201cThe notice shall state the name and residence o\u00ed the lienor, the name o\u00ed the contractor or subcontractor for whom the labor was performed or materials furnished, the amount claimed to be due or to become due, the date when due, a description of the public improvement upon which the labor was performed and materials expended, the kind of labor performed and materials furnished and give a general description of the contract pursuant to which such public improvement was constructed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">In no view can these letters be held to constitute valid notices of liens under the statute, and therefore the court was without authority to discharge them as if they were mechanics\u2019 liens. -It is extremely doubtful. whether the order of the court, or the undertaking which it requires to'be filed, as a condition of discharging the alleged notices of lien, would protect the city. The only possible theory upon which the city would be protected is that the Fitzgibbons Boiler Company had notice of the application for the order and might be bound by it. The Boiler Company, however, as well as the city, appeals, and its counsel argues that the undertaking would be void and not enforceable for its protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">We are of opinion that the rights of the Fitzgibbons Boiler Company, by virtue of the notices it gave to the comptroller, cannot be determined upon a summary application to .the court. It does not, as already observed, assert a lien against any fund. It merely gives notice that it claims and will claim that the title to the boilers did not pass from it and will not pass until the purchase price thereof is paid in full. Whatever its rights in the premises may be, inasmuch as it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>filed no notice of a mechanic\u2019s lien and asserts no right under the mechanic\u2019s lien law, the court was without authority, by virtue of the provisions of that law, to interfere with the notices which it gave the comptroller. There being no other authority for a summary application to the court in the premises, the application should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\">It follows, therefore, that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements to each appellant, and motion granted, with $10 costs to the Fitzgibbons Boiler Company. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
