The first is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-6\">\u201cIn just what way the plaintiff\u2019s hand became caught in the cogwheel or pinion, as alleged in paragraph \u2018Fourth\u2019 of the complaint, showing, also, just what he was doing with said hand at the time it became caught.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">We think the plaintiff should be required to show what he was doing in the master\u2019s service as an oiler at the time his hand was caught in the cogwheel or pinion, and, if he can, to state how it was that his hand was caught there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">The second requirement is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-9\">\u201cA statement of each and every duty obligatory on the defendant which .plaintiff claims defendant disregarded, as alleged in paragraph \u2018Fourth\u2019 of the complaint, particularly setting forth those facts which plaintiff claims constitute a disregard of each and every said duty.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">We think that the plaintiff should state that duty or those duties of the defendant, owing to the servant, but disregarded by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">The order should be modified as indicated, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
