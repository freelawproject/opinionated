giving to the coroner, public administrator, and surveyor \u201c such fees as are now, or may hereafter be, allowed by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The thirteenth subdivision fixes the fees of justices of the peace, which are to be charged and collected for their own use.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The fourteenth subdivision provides that \u201c constables shall be allowed to charge and collect for their own use fees as follows\u201d: Then follows the schedule of fees</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">allowed for the discharge of various duties, followed with the proviso that no constable shall receive in any one month a sum in excess of one hundred and twenty-five dollars in criminal cases, or a sum in excess of thirty dollars in vagrancy cases, \u201c and his claim against the county shall so state.\u201d For services not enumerated he is allowed the same fees as are allowed the sheriff for like services.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">The seventeenth and last subdivision of the section is as follows: \u201cThis section shall take effect immediately, except such provisions as affect the salaries of the present incumbents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Section 234 of the act is as follows: \u201cThe provisions of this act, unless otherwise herein provided, so far as it relates to the compensation and salaries of all officers named, shall not affect the present incumbent; <em>provided, </em>that when the salary of any such officer, or fees in lieu of such salary, is not fixed by law, the same shall, as to such officer, take effect immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Section 235 applies the law to new counties to be thereafter created or organized, and provides that the salaries of officers in counties the population of which has been decreased by the organization of new counties, shall not be affected during the terms for which they shall have been elected.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">Section 237 is as follows: \u201cThis act shall, except as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>herein, otherwise provided, take effect on the first Monday after the first day of January, eighteen hundred and ninety-five.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The contention of appellant is that subdivision 14 does not affect the present incumbents of the office of constable of Santa Barbara county. In aid of this contention it is -urged that the term \u201c salaries\u201d in subdivision 17 of said section 183 must be construed to include the word <em>\u201c </em>fee,\u201d and to be as general as the word compensation in its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">It will be observed that section 183, hereinbefore quoted, provides that county officers in counties of the twenty-first class \u201c shall receive as compensation .... the following salaries,\u201d and then follow the titles of the several officers and the provisions fixing their compensation,which, in some instances, consists of a fixed salary per annum, and in others of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The word <em>salary </em>signifies the periodical compensation due to men in official and other situations. The word is derived from <em>solarium, </em>which is from the word \u201csal,\u201d salt, that being an article in which the Roman soldiers were paid. (Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, title Salary; <em>Cowdin </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>10 Ind. 85.)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">While the term salary in its original and strict sense signifies a fixed compensation it is frequently used in our constitution and laws as the equivalent of <em>compen</em>sation,</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">In <em>Kirkwood </em>v. <em>Soto, </em>87 Cal. 396, it was said: \u201c The words \u2018 compensation \u2019 and \u2018 salary \u2019 were evidently used synonymously in the constitution and in the County Government Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The phrase, \u201cThe county officers shall receive as compensation for the services required of them by law, or by virtue of their office, the following salaries,\u201d is repeated at least fifty times, at the commencement of as many sections, applicable to counties of different classes, in each of which provision is made for the remuneration of some of the officers by fixed and stated sums per annum, and for others by fees of office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>as now provided by law or as shall be hereafter provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">I regard the conclusion as irresistible that the term \u201c salary\u201d as used in this connection is used, not in its original and restricted sense, but in the broader and more comprehensive sense of <em>compensation, </em>and as applying equally to all officers included in the act whose compensation is fixed thereby, whether such compensation is limited to a fixed sum of money or is payable in fees, or in fees not exceeding a certain fixed amount for the performance of certain specified duties, as in the case of constables..</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">It is, therefore, held that the term salary used in section 183 was intended to apply and does apply to all the officers included in the twenty-first class, viz., county and township officers therein specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Subdivision 17 of section 183 of the act, which, as before shown, provides that \u201cThis section shall take effect immediately, except such provisions as affect the salaries of the present incumbents,\u201d must receive the same interpretation as is given to it in its previous occurrence in the section\u2014that is to say, that, while it is to take effect at once, it does not do so as to the officers whose salaries are fixed by the section, whether by fees or by a fixed lump sum per annum.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">In other words the term salaries in the seventeenth subdivision of section 183 must be construed as broadly as the same word where it first occurs in the first clause of the same section, and must be held not to take effect as to the compensation of the officers enumerated until the first Monday after the first day of January, 1895, when, by the two hundred and thiny-seventh section, the act, except as otherwise provided, takes effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">This view leaves the law to take effect at once in the cases provided for in sections 234 and 235, viz: in cases where the compensation of officers is not fixed by law, and in counties within the twenty-first class created or organized after the passage of the act, and to all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>such matters contained in said section 183, as do not relate to the compensation of officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">These views render it unnecessary to consider other questions raised by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The judgment should be reversed, and the court below directed to enter judgment in favor of plaintiff for three hundred and fifty-nine dollars and forty cents and costs of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Vanclief, C., and Haynes, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment is reversed, and the court below directed to enter judgment in favor of plaintiff for three hundred and fifty-nine dollars and forty cents and costs of suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">McFarland, J., De Haven, J., Fitzgerald, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
