For some time prior to this date he was living on the charity of relatives and friends in the city and county of San Francisco, where he was an elector. He made and subscribed the usual application, and obtained a permit to enter the home. He says that \u2018the reason I went there was because I was in indigent circumstances. Circumstances compelled me to go, and I would not have gone there had it not been for those circumstances. I had no desire to become a resident of the Veterans\u2019 Home or the precinct other than as induced by my indigent circumstances.. Since I have been there I have been maintained and supported by the home. At the time I went there I did not have any fixed intention with respect to the length of time I should stay there: it was my intention to stop there as long as I lived. I have no other interests in the precinct except my relations with the home: I went there with the expectation of living and dying there\u2014making it my permanent home the balance of my life. I have no relatives or property interest in the Veterans\u2019Home precinct. I have no other home. At the time I went there it was my intention to make the home my permanent home. I made it as a home to live and die\u2014as a refuge.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">And counsel for appellant further say: \u201cThere is no claim made that the witness was not a citizen of the United States, of lawful age, and having been in the state, county, and precinct a sufficient length of time to entitle him to vote; but the claim is, that he was not a resident of the precinct and county in which he claimed his vote and voted, within the meaning of section 4 of article II of the constitution. The question presented is whether or not Killalee was a legal resident of the Veterans\u2019 Home precinct, and entitled to Vote-at the last general election.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>It being thus properly conceded that the witness had all the requisite qualifications of an elector of the Veterans\u2019 Home precinct, except the intention to abandon his former residence and to adopt and make the Veterans\u2019 Home his place of residence, the controversy is still further reduced to the simple question of fact as to whether or not he went to the Veterans\u2019 Home and remained there with such intention. And upon this issue the uncontradicted testimony of the witness that such was his intention is abundantly sufficient to justify the finding of the court to that effect. The circumstances and motives by which he was induced to change his residence, so far as disclosed, are immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The evidence upon the issue as to the qualifications of Killalee is, substantially, a fair sample of that applicable to each of the other inmates of the Veterans\u2019 Home, the infirmary, and the college, whose votes were adjudge^ by the court to have been legal. In other words, if Killalee was a qualified elector of the precinct in which he voted, the judgment is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">It is contended for appellant, however, that Killalee could not have gained a residence for the purpose of voting at the Veterans\u2019 Home while there as a beneficiary at public expense, for the reason that the gaining of such residence is prohibited by the fourth section of the second article of the constitution of this state, which is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\u201cFor the purpose of voting no person shall be deemed to have gained or lost a residence by reason of his presence or absence while employed in the service of the United States, nor while engaged in the navigation of the waters of this state, or of the United States, or of the high seas; nor while a student at any seminary of learning; nor while kept at any almshouse or other asylum at public expense; nor while confined in any public prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">As construed by our supreme court in the case of <em>Budd </em>v. <em>Holden, </em>28 Cal. 137, this section does not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>the effect claimed for it by counsel for appellant. In that case the qualification of soldiers to vote, while employed in the service of the United States, was questioned; and it was <em>decided </em>that their presence in Mendocino county, while thus employed in the service j of the United States, did not \u201cpreclude them from ac- | quiring a residence in Mendocino, if disposed to do , so.\u201d The court further said: \u201c That it was their <em>intention to </em>acquire a domicile in Mendocino county suffi- / iciently appears from the evidence. Such being the case, j there is nothing in the constitutional provision in , question (which is merely declaratory of the common law) which stands in the way of their doing so.\u201d Thus j their residence for the purpose of voting in Mendocino i county was made to depend upon proof of their <em>inten- </em>| <em>tion </em>to make that county their place of residence while ! they were there present in the service of the United , States; there being no question that they had all other \u2019\u25a0requisite qualifications of electors. <em>0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Whatever may be said of some portions of the language used, <em>arguendo, </em>in the opinion of Chief Justice Sanderson in that case, the <em>decision </em>is clearly in point for the respondent in this case. And upon the authority of that decision the judgment of the trial court in this case is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Hearing in Bank denied,</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Beatty, C. J., dissented from the order denying a hearing in Bank.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
