Therefore, if you award him a verdict, you need not award interest upon it.\u2019 Thereupon the jury again retired, and, after deliberation, returned with a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, awarding him one thousand five hundred and eighty dollars and ninety-eight cents, without interest.\u201d After its motion for a new trial was denied it presented to the trial judge for settlement another bill of exceptions containing the foregoing affidavit, with the statement that it, together with the judgment-roll, the bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>of exceptions, and notice of intention to move for a new trial, had been presented and used at the hearing, and that the motion had been denied in the absence of its attorneys. The judge declined to settle the proposed bill of exceptions, and the present application is brought to compel him to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\">The matters set forth in the affidavit were instructions of the court to the jury, and, if deemed by the defendant to be erroneous, constituted <em>\u201c </em>error at law occurring at the trial,\u201d and should have been excepted to and embodied in the bill of exceptions provided for in section 650 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Upon an appeal from an order granting or denying a new trial the notice of intention to move for a new trial is not a part of the record on appeal, and need not be included in a bill of exceptions unless the opposite party insists that it is insufficient. <em>(Pico v. Cohn, </em>78 Cal. 386.) As an appeal may be taken from the order denying a new trial, it is deemed to have been excepted to, and need not be embodied in a bill of exceptions. As reference may be made on the hearing of the motion for a new trial to the pleadings in the case (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 660), for the purpose of ascertaining the issues and determining the correctness of the court\u2019s rulings <em>(Bode </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>102 Cal. 586), it will be presumed that such reference was made; and, as the judgment-roll is a part of the record to be used on appeal from the order denying the new trial (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 661), the fact that such reference was made need not be presented by a bill of exceptions. The judge, therefore, correctly declined to settle the proposed bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">The motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
