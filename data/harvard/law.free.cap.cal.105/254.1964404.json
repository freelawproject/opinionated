L. Lyon &amp; Son\u201d; that the publishing and entering of the words entered upon said \u201cblack list\u201d meant, and were intended to mean, \u201c that plaintiff was a person engaged in making accounts which he never paid or intended to pay, and was dishonest and wholly unfit and unworthy of credit,\u201d and were published without cause, and out of pure malice, for the purpose of injuring and damaging plaintiff\u2019s character, credit, and good name for honesty and integrity\u201d; that said libel in writing was distributed to and read by the acquaintances of plaintiff and various dealers and merchants of the city of Oakland, who, under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>standing the meaning thereof, believed that plaintiff was engaged in making accounts which he never paid or intended to pay, and was dishonest and unworthy of credit, by reason of which plaintiff was afterwards refused credit by said acquaintances, dealers, and merchants; that plaintiff previously had a good reputation for honesty and integrity, and that the said publication was false and defamatory, and plaintiff was injured thereby in his reputation, character, credit, and good name in the sum of ten thousand dollars, for which he prayed judgment. A demurrer was interposed on the grounds that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; and that it was ambiguous and uncertain, in not definitely showing that those who read the alleged libelous words knew that plaintiff was meant, nor what they understood the alleged libelous words to mean, nor how much damage plaintiff sustained to his reputation, nor how much to his credit, and contains no averment of special damage, nor of facts out of which special damage may arise. The demurrer was sustained, and, plaintiff declining to amend, judgment was ordered for the defendant upon the demurrer, from which judgment the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-5\"><em>Sawyer &amp; Ayer, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-6\">The face of the complaint does not show that the communication was privileged. <em>(Muetze </em>v. <em>Tuteur, </em>77 Wis. 236; 20 Am. St. Rep. 115; <em>Sunderlin </em>v. <em>Bradstreet, </em>46 N. Y. 188; 7 Am. Rep. 322; <em>Klinck </em>v. <em>Colby, </em>46 N Y. 427; 7 Am.

The complaint states a libel <em>per se, </em>and no allegation of special damages is required. (Civ. Code, sec. 45; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>2 Denio, 293; <em>Stafford </em>v. <em>Morning Journal Assn., </em>22 N. Y.

Hughes, </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-6\">The words were not libelous <em>per </em>sej and the complaint does not distinctly aver that those who read the words knew that plaintiff was meant. <em>(De Witt </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>57 Cal. 576.) The complaint does not sufficiently aver how the words were understood by those who read them. <em>(Maynard </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>34 Cal. 48, and cases cited; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Zanone, </em>93 Cal. 65.) The allegations of damage are insufficient. <em>(Grandona </em>v. <em>Lovdal, </em>70 Cal. 161.) The words not being actionable <em>per se, </em>special damage must be alleged. <em>(Burkett </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>90 Cal. 532; 25 Am. St. Rep. 151; <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Lapham, </em>10 Johns. 281; <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Bradstreet Co., </em>35 Hun, 16; <em>Kingsbury </em>v. <em>Bradstreet Co., </em>35 Hun, 212; <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Trundy, </em>31 Me. 321; <em>Hallock </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>2 Barb. 630; <em>Linden </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>1 Duer, 672; <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>2 Abb.

The innuendo cannot enlarge the meaning of the words, and is explanatory only of the words spoken and extrinsic facts; explanation of them must be explicitly averred. <em>(Bell </em>v. <em>Sun Printing Assn., </em>3 Abb.
