After a joint trial, Mattox was acquitted of all charges. The defendant was found guilty of murder in the second degree as well as the other two charges. The defendant appealed from his convictions and from the denial of his motion for a new trial. The Appeals Court affirmed the convictions and the denial of the motion, although two Justices dissented.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clements, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 508 (2001). We granted the defendant\u2019s ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>plication for further appellate review, limiting our consideration to the issue whether inconsistent, recanted extrajudicial statements of identification that were the sole evidence of guilt are sufficient to convict pursuant to the principles of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55 (1984). We hold that they are and affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The jury could have found the following facts. Gregory Tillery was shot and killed on Harvard Street in the Dorchester section of Boston at about 6 p.m. on January 30, 1995, with a surviving eyewitness to the crime, Sakoya Willis. Willis had known the defendant since childhood, although their relationship had soured shortly before the murder due to \u201cdrugs\u201d and other issues. On the day of the murder, Willis and the victim were selling drugs on a comer on Harvard Street. The defendant and Mattox were also on Harvard Street. At one point, the defendant and Mattox and Willis and Tillery exchanged \u201clooks\u201d; later, Mattox walked by Willis and Tillery singing, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a man cry until a man dies.\u201d After that, Willis and Tillery moved away from Mattox, proceeding on Harvard Street toward Greenwood Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">While Willis was near the comer of Harvard and Greenwood Streets with Tillery next to him, a man about six feet tall and wearing a \u201choodie\u201d began shooting at Willis and Tillery from a distance of about ten feet. The gun appeared to Willis to be a .380 caliber automatic. Willis heard four shots. He hid behind a car, and then ran. The shooter chased and shot at Willis, but his gun jammed. Willis turned when he was about ten feet from the shooter and saw him trying to \u201cunjam\u201d his gun. Moments later Willis heard four or five more gunshots. He continued running, looked back again and saw two men running from the scene, but could not identify them. Later that evening, he learned that Tillery had been killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">At trial, Willis insisted that he was unable to identify the shooter and that in fact he never had known who the shooter was. Willis\u2019s trial testimony was in marked contrast to his pretrial statements. Prior to trial, at a police station on March 9, 1995, Willis had identified the defendant as the assailant from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>an array of eight photographs, and had dated and signed the back of the picture. At trial, Willis acknowledged having made that photographic identification, and the photograph was admitted as an exhibit. Willis further testified that he had given a recorded statement to the police indicating that the defendant was the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Moreover, in November, 1996 (almost two years after the shooting and one year and eight months after he had made the photographic identification), Willis had testified before the grand jury, where he had again identified the defendant as the shooter. At trial, Willis acknowledged his identification of the defendant in his grand jury testimony. He explained his prior identifications to the police and the grand jury by stating that previously, he had believed that it was the defendant who had shot at him and at the victim. He justified his recantation in various ways: he had been drunk at the time of the shooting; it was dark and he really had not seen the shooter\u2019s face; he was repeating what he had heard from others; he was pressured to identify the defendant by the victim\u2019s family; and he had not been \u201cthinkr ing straight\u201d when he named the defendant and had not appreciated the seriousness of his accusations.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">After Willis completed his testimony, the Commonwealth read to the jury excerpts of Willis\u2019s grand jury testimony that were inconsistent with his trial testimony. The defendant objected to these recitations. Pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55 (1984), the judge instructed that the grand jury statements could be received as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, supra, </em>we held that prior grand jury testimony of a trial witness is admissible for substantive purposes provided that certain conditions are met: (1) the witness can be effectively cross-examined at trial regarding the accuracy of the statement; and (2) the statement was not coerced and was more than a \u201cmere confirmation or denial of an allegation by the interrogator,\u201d i.e., the statement must be that of the witness and not of the interrogator.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 73-74. We also required that, apart from these requirements for admissibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ity of the prior grand jury testimony as substantive evidence, when that testimony concerns an essential element of the crime, the Commonwealth must offer at least some corroborative evidence if there is to be sufficient evidence to warrant a conviction. In the final paragraph of the court\u2019s opinion in <em>Daye, </em>see <em>id. </em>at 75, this latter requirement concerning additional corroborative evidence was described as a third prerequisite for the admissibility of prior grand jury testimony as substantive evidence, and, since the <em>Daye </em>opinion, we have characterized that opinion as necessitating three \u201crequirements\u201d for such \u201cadmissibility.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sineiro, </em>432 Mass. 735, 741 (2000). In fact, of course, the first two relate to the admissibility of grand jury testimony, while the third concerns the sufficiency of evidence. Thus, only two factors must be satisfied for the evidence in question to be admitted for substantive purposes. Then, if that evidence concerns an element of the crime, there is a separate requirement that the Commonwealth must meet to sustain its burden on the element: there must be other corroborating evidence on the issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We adopt this formulation despite statements to the contrary. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>435 Mass. 113, 134 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sineiro, supra </em>at 741; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>417 Mass. 341, 344 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berrio, </em>407 Mass. 37, 45 (1990).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In the present case we are concerned with a witness, Willis, who at trial recanted his prior identification of the defendant as the shooter. The prosecutor then presented Willis\u2019s testimony to the grand jury as substantive evidence to identify the shooter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>She also introduced evidence of a photographic identification of the defendant as the shooter that Willis had made to the police approximately five weeks after the murder. The defendant claims that the <em>Daye </em>conditions for admissibility have not been met. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The defendant contends that the first <em>Daye </em>criterion was not satisfied. He argues that Willis was not available for cross-examination regarding the accuracy of his grand jury statements because these statements were not read to the jury until after Willis completed his testimony. That is not an accurate assessment of the events at trial. It was clear from Willis\u2019s direct examination that his' testimony before the grand jury was a subject of contention. A lengthy bench conference was held on the subject just prior to cross-examination. Indeed, defense counsel cross-examined Willis regarding his grand jury testimony and the judge ruled immediately after counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Willis\u201d, and <em>before </em>counsel\u2019s recross-examination, that the inconsistent portions of the grand jury testimony could be read to the jury by the prosecutor. Moreover, the defendant did not object on this basis until the following day and he did not seek to recall Willis at any time.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The separate requirement that the Commonwealth can only sustain'its burden of proof on the identification element by presenting corroborating evidence has been satisfied as well: Willis\u2019s photographic identification of the defendant made to the police approximately five weeks after the murder was the \u201cother evidence tending to prove the issue.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, supra </em>at 75. Our rule is that extrajudicial identifications are admissible as substantive evidence notwithstanding their hearsay attributes because we consider an identification made closer in time to the events in question to be of superior probative worth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weichell, </em>390 Mass. 62, 71 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1032 (1984). See <em>id. </em>at 87 (Liacos, J., dissenting). The fact that the \u201cother evidence\u201d is a recanted, extrajudicial identification does not disqualify it as sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>meet the \u201cother evidence\u201d requirement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We have never held that the other evidence must be of a different nature from the grand jury testimony or that it emanate from a different witness. We decline to do so now. The fact that Willis stated that the earlier identifications were made by him only because of pressure from the victim\u2019s family and were made on the basis of rumors goes to the weight, and not to the admissibility, of the earlier identifications. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>375 Mass. 349, 355 (1978). Willis had testified to the grand jury that the assailant was the defendant, and he had made a photographic identification to the police. When Willis claimed at trial that his prior identifications had been influenced by various factors, the determination of the reliability of the pretrial identifications versus the in-court disavowal was a matter for the jury. They saw the witness and were aware that he had provided inconsistent accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Nor does the fact that the witness was not subject to cross-examination at the time of the earlier identification render the earlier identification insufficient as the \u201cother evidence.\u201d \u201cThe most successful cross-examination at the time the prior statement was made could hardly hope to accomplish more than has already been accomplished by the fact that the witness is now telling a different, inconsistent story.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55, 71-72 n.15 (1984), quoting <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 159 (1970). See <em>Commonwealth v. Daye, supra </em>at 73-74 (\u201cIf, notwithstanding the witness\u2019s rejection on the stand of his prior statement, a jury, based on their observation of the witness and their common sense, were to conclude . . . that [the witness\u2019s] identification of the defendant before the grand jury has probative worth, we see no reason why our rules of evidence should preclude them from so doing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The defendant faults the \u201cother evidence\u201d because it was not under oath. We have not imposed such a requirement, and doing so would emasculate the rule. Pretrial evidence does not normally come to us in the form of sworn statements, but rather as spontaneous utterances, statements to police investigators, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>admissions from the defendant. Generally, only probable cause or grand jury testimony is under oath.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Again, the fact that the extrajudicial identification has been repudiated does not render it insufficient to serve as the \u201cother evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-15\">The three-member panel was enlarged and convictions were affirmed in a three-to-two decision. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clements, </em>51 Mass.
