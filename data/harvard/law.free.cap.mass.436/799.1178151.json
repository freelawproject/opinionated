We affirm the judgments, and decline to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">1, <em>Facts. </em>We recite the facts as the jury could have found them, reserving certain details for discussion in conjunction with the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">a. <em>A&amp;K Jewelers. </em>At about 6:30 p.m. on June 16, 1994, Marilyn Dillon, an employee of A&amp;K Jewelers, \u201cbuzzed\u201d the defendant and Anthony Miller into the shop. Both wore baseball caps, sunglasses, and surgical gloves. The defendant pulled out a gun, then proceeded to a back room where the owner and another employee were working and ordered them to the floor. He instructed Miller to \u201cgo for the diamonds.\u201d After Dillon unlocked the display cases, Miller filled a large green trash bag with jewelry. The defendant took the owner\u2019s wallet and yelled, \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d As they fled, the owner fired several shots at them with his own gun; he did not hit anyone, but shattered the front windows. The robbers escaped into a waiting, stolen Chevrolet Blazer vehicle with an accomplice at the wheel.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Later that night, the defendant and Miller carried a duffel bag into the kitchen of a pizza shop, and offered to sell some rings to \u201cMike the Greek\u201d for $10,000. They also went to visit Miller\u2019s brother-in-law, Charles Lesage. Miller gave Lesag\u00e9 two rings identified as having been stolen from A&amp;K Jewelers that night and several hundred dollars in cash. On June 17, the day after the robbery, the defendant paid $2,500 in cash for a used white Volvo automobile. On June 18, he gave Stephanie Zero a stolen A&amp;K ring and $100 from a large wad of bills, and then took her shopping, spending $200 more on items for their son.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">The defendant told Christina Fernandes that the reason she had not seen him for one week or so in middle to late June was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>that he had been \u201chiding out in New Hampshire because of a big shootout.\u201d He also asked her to hide his gun for him for a few days. From a photographic array of people wearing hats and sunglasses, the owner of A&amp;K Jewelers tentatively identified the defendant on July 14 or 15; saying, \u201cThat looks like the robber, but I\u2019m not certain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">b. <em>Ware Jewelers. </em>Less than two weeks after the A&amp;K incident, the defendant asked to borrow Fernandes\u2019s car, telling her that his white Volvo \u201cstood out too much\u201d and he \u201chad something staked out.\u201d On June 30, the defendant, Miller, and Lesage stole a blue Buick automobile to \u201csave it for a score.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Later that day, the defendant and Miller took Linda Carney in the defendant\u2019s Volvo to the lot where they had left the stolen Buick. The defendant, who was wearing black leather gloves, gave Carney a pair of surgical gloves. Carney testified that he told her to drive him in the blue car while Miller waited in the Volvo. She drove a short distance and then stopped, saying she \u201cwasn\u2019t going to do this.\u201d All three began to argue. Carney got out and walked back to the Volvo. Miller took her place in the driver\u2019s seat. Carney testified that as they were driving off, she heard Miller tell the defendant, \u201cAll you have to do is flash it.\u201d Nothing further appears in the record regarding whether a robbery took place that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">On July 5, the defendant and Miller entered Ware Jewelers. Miller stayed in the front of the store where G. Richard Ware had been working. The defendant went to the back office, gun in hand. Mark Mariani was in that office watching the defendant\u2019s armed approach on the security camera. The defendant said Mariani \u201cwas going for a gun, so [he] smoked him.\u201d The defendant and Miller fled. Ware fired at them in vain as they climbed into a getaway car identified as the stolen blue Buick.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">That evening the defendant and Miller visited Lesage. Both men seemed nervous. Miller took Lesage aside and said, \u201c[I] think [we] shot someone, someone got shot.\u201d The defendant, who had been standing nearby, interjected, \u201cWhat are you tell<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>ing him for? Be quiet.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant also expressed particular interest in the news report of the shooting, asking what had happened, whether police had a description of the car, and whether anybody had died. He offered that he did not think it had been a robbery: \u201cIt might have been a hit or something, [because no one] would just go in and rob a store and not take anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Michael Crippa testified that the defendant had told him about the attempted robbery and shooting when they were cellmates in March of 1996. Crippa reported that the defendant said, \u201cI like to rob jewelry stores; that\u2019s what I do.\u201d The defendant also told Crippa that he had shot someone during a robbery attempt because the man had resisted instead of giving him the jewelry. The defendant said he was hoping to use as a defense that someone else had done it, because in all of his other jewelry store robberies he had taken something, but nothing had been taken this time. He also told Crippa that he had a private investigator who found out that the wife of the victim had been having an affair, \u201cand they were going to make it out like he [the wife\u2019s lover] was the man who had committed the murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">c. <em>BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club. </em>Nine days after the shooting at Ware Jewelers, on July 14 at 12:30 a.m., the defendant and Miller pried open the front fire door at BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club (BJ\u2019s) in Medford. Inside, a security camera videotaped the defendant jumping over the jewelry case and breaking the glass. Ten minutes later, a Med-ford police officer stopped the defendant\u2019s Volvo 150 yards from BJ\u2019s. The defendant, Miller, and a woman who had waited in the car while the men committed the burglary were in the front seat with the stolen jewelry; two computers, also taken from BJ\u2019s, were on the back seat. Also in the car were the tools used for the BJ\u2019s break-in, a box of green trash bags like the one used in the A&amp;K Jewelers robbery, and a notebook that came from the blue Buick used in the Ware Jewelers incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">2. <em>Joinder. </em>The defendant claims that the judge erred in permitting the larceny at BJ\u2019s to be tried together with the other two incidents, and that joinder of these three incidents in one trial was prejudicial to him. Joinder is governed by Mass R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>Crim. P. 9, 378 Mass. 859 (1979),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which provides that the trial judge shall join related offenses for trial unless joinder is not in the best interests of justice. See Mass R. Crim. P. 9 (a) (3). Thus, joinder requires first that the offenses are related, and second that joinder be in the best interests of justice. See Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Crim. P. 9, Mass. Ann. Laws 83-84 (Lexis 1997). The propriety of joinder is a matter for the trial judge\u2019s discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>427 Mass. 336, 345 (1998), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">a. <em>\u201cRelated\u201d offenses. </em>While \u201cthe goal of judicial economy will rarely be paramount to affording the defendant a trial as free from prejudice as possible,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 81, where offenses are related, there is \u201clittle danger\u201d of such prejudice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoppin, </em>387 Mass. 25, 33 (1982). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blow, </em>362 Mass. 196, 200 (1972), we explained that joinder is permitted where \u201cthe separate offences would be proved by \u2018evidence connected with a single line of conduct, and grow out of what is essentially one transaction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maloney, </em>348 Mass. 610, 614 (1965). The defendant relies on <em>Blow, </em>pointing to the facts in that case to argue that our holding there is dispositive of joinder here. In that case, the defendant was charged with robbery of one individual, and breaking and entering and larceny from two more; all of these events occurred on the same day, November 7, 1969. Joinder was not proper, we said, because the \u201cdiverse criminal activity\u201d that occurred on that date was not the result of a \u201csingle fine of conduct\u201d growing out of \u201cone transaction,\u201d and that severance should have been granted. <em>Id. </em>at 200-201.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The defendant argues that this case, like <em>Blow, </em>also involves robbery and burglary of several targets, and that the \u201cevidence reveals no relationship\u201d between the crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 200. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Blow </em>is misplaced because that case was decided before our rules of criminal procedure were adopted. When <em>Blow </em>was decided in 1972, joinder was governed by G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 46 (repealed by St. 1979, c. 344, \u00a7 37), which stated: \u201cTwo or more counts describing different crimes depending upon the <em>same facts or transactions </em>may be set forth in the same indictment if it contains an averment that the different counts therein are different descriptions of the <em>same </em>acts\u201d (emphasis added). In contrast, Mass. R. Crim. P. 9 (a) (1), which now governs joinder, states that offenses are \u201crelated\u201d if they \u201care [1] based on the same criminal conduct or episode or [2] arise out of a course of criminal conduct or series of criminal episodes connected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or plan.\u201d The criteria for joinder are now somewhat broader than when the <em>Blow </em>case was decided, as it is now expressly permissible to join offenses concerning separate episodes where they are \u201cconnected together or constitute] parts of a single scheme or plan.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Crim. P. 9, <em>supra </em>at 81-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The facts of this case demonstrate a series of criminal episodes that are sufficiently connected together or constitute parts of a single scheme or plan. In each episode, the defendant and Miller acted together. In each episode, they stole or intended to steal a retail store\u2019s jewelry in order to \u201cfence\u201d it for cash. In each episode, they left an accomplice outside with a getaway car. The episodes occurred in the same general geographic region (Stoneham, Waltham, and Medford), and in fairly close temporal proximity: no more than two weeks ever passed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>between the planning or execution of each episode.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cSeparate trials are not required merely because offenses occurred on different dates ... or involved different victims\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Auguste, </em>414 Mass. 51, 60 (1992). There was no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s decision that the crimes were sufficiently related.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">b. <em>\u201cBest interests of </em>justice.\u201d Where offenses have been properly joined under rule 9 (a) (1), the burden is on the defendant to show that he nevertheless has been prejudiced by the joinder, and that severance should have been granted under Mass. R. Crim. R 9 (d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 346-347; Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Crim. R 9, <em>supra </em>at 84-85. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 98, 102-103 (2001), citing <em>Unites States </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>474 U.S. 438, 449 (1985) (misjoinder requires reversal only if defendant actually prejudiced).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">The defendant has failed to carry his burden. The evidence of each episode was presented separately, and throughout the trial the judge carefully instructed the jurors to consider each episode separately. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 347 (\u201cno indication in the record that this instruction was inadequate to offset any possible prejudice from the joinder, or that the jury inappropriately applied evidence of one indictment toward another\u201d). The only evidence contributed from the BJ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>burglary to the A&amp;K and Ware incidents consisted of the items found in the defendant\u2019s car at the BJ\u2019s arrest: the notebook (originating from the car stolen for the Ware shooting); large green trash bags (used in the A&amp;K robbery); and black leather gloves (worn by the defendant in the \u201ccasing\u201d incident that demonstrated his intent to rob at Ware). Had the A&amp;K and Ware episodes been tried separately from the BJ\u2019s episode, these items from the BJ\u2019s case would have been admissible in the A&amp;K and Ware trial to prove identity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 224-225 (1986). There is no prejudice to the defendant in having one jury hear this evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">3. <em>Tape recording. </em>The defendant attempted to present evidence that the prosecution had charged the wrong man, suggesting that the shooting victim, Mark Mariani, in fact was killed by one Michael Sullo. Mariani was a married man who was having an affair with Sullo\u2019s former wife. Two days after Mariani was killed, the following message was left on the former wife\u2019s answering machine: \u201cYeah, you know, you\u2019re a real asshole, going out with a married man, fucking him over. You\u2019re next on the list.\u201d She immediately dialed 911 and told police officers that she thought the voice might have been Sullo\u2019s. As a result, the domestic violence unit installed a \u201cpanic button\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on her telephone. The defendant intended to argue that the words \u201cyou\u2019re next\u201d implied that Mariani had been first; in other words, that Sullo in effect had admitted to the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The former wife later disavowed her earlier statement made to the grand jury that the voice might have been her former husband\u2019s. During the voir dire at trial, she stated that the voice was \u201c[absolutely not\u201d his. The judge refused to admit any testimony concerning her prior statement, and ruled that because there was no competent evidence identifying the voice as Sul-lo\u2019s, the tape was also inadmissible. Assuming, without deciding, that identification was a prerequisite to the tape\u2019s admissibility, the judge erred in excluding the recording. The tentative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>nature of an identification does not disqualify it from admission, but goes to its weight. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paszko, </em>391 Mass. 164, 172 (1984). An extrajudicial identification may be offered as substantive evidence even when the witness repudiates that identification at trial as long as there is no dispute that the prior identification in fact was made. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clements, ante </em>190, 192-193 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55, 61 &amp; n.9 (1984), and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, 376 </em>Mass. 402, 408-409 (1978); Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 801 (d) (1) (C). Whether to credit the earlier statement or the one made on the stand is for the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, 367 </em>Mass. 737, 739 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clements, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 508, 520-521 (2001), <em>S.C., ante </em>190 (2002), quoting <em>DiCarlo </em>v. <em>United States, 6 </em>F.2d 364, 368 (2d Cir.) (Hand, J.), cert. denied, 268 U.S. 706 (1925). The prosecutor stipulated that the former wife had testified at the grand jury that the voice might have been her former husband\u2019s. Therefore, her grand jury statement would have been competent evidence at trial tentatively identifying the voice as Sullo\u2019s. It was for the jury to determine whether her statement constituted a credible identification, and whether it was more believable than her testimony on the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Moreover, as the defendant argues, the recording was admissible regardless of whose voice it was simply because it suggests that someone \u2014 anyone \u2014 other than the defendant admitted to the killing, and provides a motive unrelated to the defendant. Had the jurors heard the tape, it would have been up to them to determine whether it truly indicated another person\u2019s confession to the murder or whether it was simply part of a cruel attempt to frighten the former wife, capitalizing on the tragic coincidence that her lover had just been murdered.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The judge\u2019s failure to admit the tape did not prejudice the defendant, however. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on the shooting was extremely strong: the defendant\u2019s admission to Crippa; the defendant\u2019s reaction when Miller told Lesage, \u201c[I] think [we] shot someone\u201d; the blue Buick stolen by the defendant \u201cfor a score\u201d; the defendant\u2019s use of that same car to \u201ccase\u201d another jewelry store a few days before the Ware incident; the identification of the Buick as the getaway vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>at Ware Jewelers; and the presence of the notebook from that car in the defendant\u2019s Volvo one week later. Given this very strong evidence, we decline to order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">4. <em>Statement by the defendant. </em>Next, the defendant claims it was error to admit testimony regarding Miller\u2019s admission to Lesage and the defendant\u2019s response, and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to strike that testimony. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Lesage testified that on the evening of July 5, 1994, Miller and the defendant arrived at his house looking \u201cnervous and shaky.\u201d Miller pulled Lesage into the bathroom to talk, leaving the defendant in the hallway just outside the half-opened bathroom door. Lesage testified that Miller, without running the water or making any other effort to drown out the sounds of their voices, \u201csaid that they think they shot someone, that someone got shot.\u201d The defendant then came into the bathroom and spoke to Miller. On direct examination, Lesage testified that the defendant said, \u201cWhat are you telling him for? Be quiet.\u201d On cross-examination, he stated that the defendant\u2019s words were, \u201c \u2018Why are you telling him that?,\u2019 something like that.\u201d The prosecutor then produced the report Lesage had given to the police wherein he had said the defendant\u2019s words were, \u201cWhat are you doing? What are you saying?,\u201d and the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-7\">Q.: \u201cIs that what [the defendant] said? \u2018What are you doing? What are you saying?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-8\"><em>A.: </em>\u201cYeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-9\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cSo when you told the jury on direct examination that he said something else, you weren\u2019t accurate, were you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-10\"><em>A.: </em>\u201cHe said that; yes, he did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">The defendant claims that by this colloquy, Lesage withdrew his initial characterization of the defendant\u2019s words, and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to strike the \u201cWhat are you telling him for? Be quiet,\u201d version. We disagree. The statement, \u201cHe said that; yes, he did,\u201d is ambiguous, with no clear referent for the word \u201cthat.\u201d Lesage acknowledged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>his testimony might not have been the defendant\u2019s words verbatim, characterizing them as \u201csomething like,\u201d \u201cWhy are you telling him that?\u201d In light of Lesage\u2019s total testimony, it is clear that the import of the defendant\u2019s statement was to rebuke Miller for admitting that \u201cthey shot someone.\u201d This statement by the defendant, together with its context, was admissible; there was no error, and hence no ineffectiveness of counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>413 Mass. 498, 505-508 (1992). See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Babbitt, </em>430 Mass. 700, 704-708 (2000) (discussing admissions and adoptive admissions).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">5. <em>Character evidence. </em>The defendant next claims it was error to admit Crippa\u2019s testimony that the defendant had said, \u201cI like to rob jewelry stores; that\u2019s what I do.\u201d This statement is not admissible as evidence of the defendant\u2019s propensity to commit crime, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welcome, </em>348 Mass. 68, 70-71 (1964), but it is admissible as evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent in the Ware incident. The propriety of the felony-murder charge rests on the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant was attempting to commit a robbery when he shot the victim; hence, the defendant\u2019s intent to rob the store was a material fact and evidence of this intent was admissible. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gollman, ante </em>111, 114 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The jurors were given no instruction to limit their use of this evidence to its permitted purpose, and trial counsel did not request one. Although \u201c[pjrompt cautionary instructions to the jury are critical to protecting a defendant against prejudice where such evidence is admitted,\u201d PJ. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 4.4.6, at 157 (7th ed. 1999), there is no requirement that the judge give limiting instructions sua sponte, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonardi, </em>413 Mass. 757, 764 (1992). Nor does the lack of a limiting instruction necessarily create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>433 Mass. 45, 48, 61 (2000) (affirming conviction of murder in first degree where no limiting instruction given). The evidence of the first two incidents is very strong, see Parts 2 (b) and 3, <em>supra, </em>and the BJ\u2019s incident was captured on videotape. There is no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice here.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>6. <em>Remaining claims, cumulative error, and G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>The remaining claims (regarding closing argument, Crippa\u2019s letter, prior convictions, attempted escape, and failure to instruct) involved no abuse of discretion nor ineffective assistance of counsel. Elaboration would not contribute to our jurisprudence, and we do not discuss them further. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jervis, </em>368 Mass. 638, 647 (1975). The errors that did occur in this case \u201chad minimal impact, if any,\u201d and do not cumulate to require a new trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duran, </em>435 Mass. 97, 107 (2001).

If a defendant is charged with two or more related offenses, either party may move for joinder of such charges. The trial judge shall join the charges for trial unless he determines that joinder is not in the best interests of justice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Because <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blow, </em>362 Mass. 196 (1972), applied the standard set forth in the statute, which was more restrictive than the standard set forth in the rules, decisions subsequent to the adoption of the rules in 1979 that have cited the <em>Blow </em>case when upholding joinder are inapposite to the analysis here: because joinder was upheld in those cases under the stricter, statutorily defined standard, it would have been upheld under the broader, rules-based standard as well. It was therefore unnecessary in those cases to discuss the differences between the statute and the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">We have not previously focused on the difference between the former statute and the current rule. We do so here because it is apparent, even if we were to determine, as the defendant maintains, that joinder was improper under the <em>Blow </em>standard, that joinder was permissible under the prevailing rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Massachusetts Rule of Criminal Procedure 9, 378 Mass. 859 (1979), unlike its Federal counterpart, does not expressly authorize joinder where crimes are of \u201cthe same or similar character.\u201d Compare Fed. R. Crim. P. 8 and 13 (authorizing joinder where offenses \u201c[1] <em>are of the same or similar character </em>or [2] are based on the same act or transaction or [3] on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan\u201d), with Mass. R. Crim. P. 9 (a) (1) (authorizing joinder where offenses \u201c[1] are based on the same criminal conduct or episode or [2] arise out of a course of criminal conduct or series of criminal episodes connected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or plan\u201d). Thus mere similarity is not sufficient by itself to show relatedness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>388 Mass. 749, 754-755 (1983). But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferraro, </em>424 Mass. 87, 91 (1997) (concluding that similarity of attacks makes them related offenses). However, similarities between episodes is a factor that may be considered. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feijoo, </em>419 Mass. 486, 494-495 (1995) (single scheme where karate coach instructed students that they must overcome their deepest fear of \u201cbeing gay\u201d by engaging in sexual activity with him); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 416 (1990) (single scheme where doctor committed sexual crimes on female patients during office visits).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The defendant also claims that it was error to permit each episode to be used as evidence of motive and intent as to the others. This is \u00e1 proper use of \u201cbad acts\u201d evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 224-225 (1986); Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 404 (b). There was no error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\">A device which, when activated, signals the police station of the need for help.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
