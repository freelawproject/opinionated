The Appeals Court affirmed the judgment in a memorandum and order pursuant to its rule 1:28. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 1113 (2001). We granted his application for further appellate review. He contends that the victim\u2019s statements to police in the immediate aftermath of the incident should not have been admitted as spontaneous utterances because the victim\u2019s later recantation of the accusations rendered her spontaneous utterances unreliable. He also argues that the judge erroneously allowed the victim to invoke her privilege under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution after she had waived that privilege by testifying at a voir dire, thus preventing him from presenting the victim\u2019s live testimony as part of his defense at trial. We find no error in the admission of the victim\u2019s spontaneous utterances. However, we agree that the judge applied an incorrect standard in concluding that the victim had not waived her Fifth Amendment rights in the course of her voir dire\" testimony. We therefore remand the matter for further proceedings to determine whether the victim had waived her privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">1. <em>Admission of victim\u2019s spontaneous utterances, </em>a. <em>Voir dire. </em>Immediately prior to the start of trial, the judge conducted an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the victim\u2019s statements to police. At that hearing, two police officers and the victim testified as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">On March 14, 1998, at approximately 3 a.m., Officer Kevin Rowell of the Greenfield police department was dispatched to a gasoline station on Bemardston Road, a few miles from the interstate highway. There he found the victim, accompanied by one Orlando Soto. The victim was crying and shaking. Officer Rowell described her as \u201c[ujpset, excited, speaking rapidly, just blurting things out as she spoke.\u201d He detected an odor of alcohol on her breath, but characterized it as \u201c[vjery little, nothing major.\u201d The victim told Officer Rowell that she and the defendant had been riding in the back seat of Soto\u2019s vehicle, returning home from a nightclub in Springfield. She and the defendant were arguing. During the course of the argument, the defendant grabbed her and choked her three times. She showed Officer Rowell some red, puffy marks on her neck where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>defendant had held her. Near the gasoline station, Soto had pulled the vehicle over, at which time the victim had jumped out and run to the gasoline station. She said that the incident had occurred \u201cjust moments\u201d before the police arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Sergeant Gary Magnan arrived at the scene shortly after the victim had spoken to Officer Rowell. Officer Magnan testified that the victim was still shaking, crying and \u201cvisibly upset.\u201d He needed to calm her down and reassure her \u201cthat things were okay\u201d before she could speak to him. The victim repeated to Sergeant Magnan essentially the same version of events she had given to Officer Rowell.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The defendant then called the victim to testify. She testified that she was the defendant\u2019s former girl friend, and that she remembered the events of March 14, 1998, only \u201c[sjlightly.\u201d She acknowledged that she had made statements to the police .on that occasion, accusing the defendant of choking her, but testified that those statements were only \u201c[pjartially\u201d true. She testified that she was \u201cvery angry\u201d and \u201cvery intoxicated\u201d at the time she had spoken to the police. Some months after the incident, she had given another version, stating that the defendant had been trying to calm her down and had had to use force to restrain her and prevent her from hurting herself. She testified that that later statement was the true version of what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">b. <em>Discussion. </em>A statement is admissible under the spontaneous utterance exception to the hearsay rule if the proponent shows that the statement was made under the influence of an exciting event, before the declarant had time to contrive or fabricate the statement, and that the statement tended to qualify, characterize and explain the underlying event. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nunes, </em>430 Mass. 1, 3-4 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whelton, </em>428 Mass. 24, 26 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Di-Monte, </em>427 Mass. 233, 236, 239 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>413 Mass. 693, 695-696 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number><em>Zagranski, </em>408 Mass. 278, 285 (1990). The underlying exciting event may be proved by the excited utterance itself. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nunes, supra </em>at 4. As with any other witness, the declarant must have personal knowledge of the event in question, and must be competent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>417 Mass. 358, 362-363 (1994), <em>S.C., </em>430 Mass. 683 (2000), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In the present case, the tests for admitting the victim\u2019s statements as excited utterances were plainly met. She was still under the influence of a very recent traumatic event, and her statements explained that event. She had personally observed the event and, although she had apparently been drinking, there was nothing to suggest a level of intoxication that rendered her incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The defendant argued that the victim\u2019s statements to the police should not be admitted as spontaneous utterances because, in light of her later recantation, they were not \u201creliable.\u201d The judge, finding that the requirements for admission of a spontaneous utterance had been met, denied the motion. He explained that, once the foundational requirements had been met, he did not have discretion to decide that the spontaneous utterances were unreliable and thereby exclude them.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The judge was correct. A judge has broad discretion to determine whether the foundational requirements of the exception have been met. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whelton, supra </em>at 26; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>418 Mass. 76, 81 (1994), quoting <em>Rocco </em>v. <em>Boston-Leader, Inc., </em>340 Mass. 195, 197 (1960); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagranski, supra. </em>Thus, a judge\u2019s determination that, in light of the timing and all other surrounding circumstances, the declarant was still under the influence of the exciting event will only be disturbed for abuse of discretion. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMonte, supra </em>at 236-240 (judge abused discretion in admitting facsimile transmission as spontaneous utterance where transmission was sent more than eight hours after alleged assault and contained unrelated information about concert schedules), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 360-363 (child\u2019s statement made five hours after mother\u2019s murder but at child\u2019s \u201cfirst safe opportunity\u201d to speak properly admitted as spontaneous utterance).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Our recognition of that broad discretion to determine whether the prerequisites for the exception are met does not suggest that a trial judge has the authority to exclude a spontaneous utterance that meets those prerequisites on the ground that, in light of other evidence, the statement no longer appears reliable. Rather, it is the circumstances of the excited utterance that confer the requisite reliability. The excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule \u201cis based on the experience that, under certain external circumstances of physical shock, a stress of nervous excitement may be produced which stills the reflective faculties and removes their control, so that the utterance which then occurs is a spontaneous and sincere response to the actual sensations and perceptions already produced by the external shock. Since this utterance is made under the immediate and uncontrolled domination of the senses, and during the brief period when considerations of self-interest could not have been brought fully to bear by reasoned reflection, the utterance may be taken as particularly trustworthy (or, at least, as lacking the usual grounds of untrustworthiness), and thus as expressing the real tenor of the speaker\u2019s belief as to the facts just observed by him; and may therefore be received as testimony to those facts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. McLaughlin, 364 Mass. 211, 222 (1973), quoting J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1747 (3d ed. 1940). \u201cFor the purpose of the spontaneous utterance exception to the hearsay rule, an utterance is spontaneous if it is made under the influence of an exciting event and before the declarant has had time to contrive or fabricate the remark, and <em>thus </em>it has sufficient in-dicia of reliability\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagranski, supra </em>at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Of course, the substance of the declarant\u2019s excited utterance may be controverted by other evidence. For example, it may be contradicted by the testimony of other eyewitnesses; it may be refuted by forensic evidence; or, as here, it may be contradicted by the declarant herself. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Napolitano, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 549, 552-553 (1997) (where victim\u2019s excited utterances met tests for admissibility, judge did not err in admitting them despite victim\u2019s later recantation). Such contrary . evidence goes to the weight to be given the spontaneous utterance by the finder of fact, not to its admissibility. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>defendant\u2019s suggestion that the judge has independent discretion to determine whether, in light of other evidence, the utterance is \u201creliable\u201d would effectively require the judge to hear the entirety of the other proposed trial evidence and would have the judge usurp the fact finder\u2019s function and decide whether the spontaneous utterance was outweighed by more credible, reliable evidence. The judge\u2019s broad discretion to determine whether the prerequisites for the spontaneous utterance exception have been satisfied does not suggest such a broad ranging inquiry into the weight to be given to the spontaneous utterance. Rather, admissibility is determined solely by reference to the requirements of the exception itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">2. <em>The victim\u2019s invocation of Fifth Amendment privilege. </em>At trial,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Commonwealth introduced the testimony of officers Rowell and Magnan, who testified to the victim\u2019s spontaneous utterances and to their observations of the injuries to her neck. Photographs of the victim\u2019s neck, taken at the police station shortly after the incident, were also introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The defendant, who called the victim to testify, intended to introduce evidence of her recantation of the accusations contained in her spontaneous utterances. However, the judge was concerned that the victim\u2019s recantation under oath might expose her to prosecution, and he appointed counsel to advise her with respect to her rights against self-incrimination. After consultation with counsel, the victim asserted her Fifth Amendment privilege.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The defendant objected, arguing that the victim\u2019s testimony under oath earlier that same day at the voir dire constituted a waiver of her Fifth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge offered to listen to the recording of the victim\u2019s voir dire testimony to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>determine whether she had waived the privilege, but he opined that, unless she had been expressly advised of her rights prior to giving that voir dire testimony, he would not find a \u201cknowing and valid.\u201d waiver of those rights. Defense counsel acknowledged that there had been no such express advice prior to the victim\u2019s voir dire testimony. The judge, opining that the absence of such express advice automatically precluded any valid waiver, allowed the victim to exercise her privilege against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u201cIt has long been the law in Massachusetts that if an ordinary witness, not a party to a cause, voluntarily testifies to a fact of an incriminating nature he waives his privilege as to subsequent questions seeking related facts.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>369 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Mass. 183, 189 (1975). However, the doctrine of waiver by prior testimony \u201cis not based on any true waiver theory at all in the usual sense of a voluntary, intelligent relinquishment of a known right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, it is based on two pragmatic ramifications of the witness\u2019s prior voluntary, but potentially incriminating, testimony. One is that \u201cwhen a witness has freely testified as to incriminating facts, continued testimony as .to details would no longer tend to incriminate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190. The second rationale given in support of the doctrine of waiver by testimony is that \u201callowing the testimony to remain in a witness-selected posture would result in serious, unjust distortion; and the witness, having chosen to answer when he could have remained silent, \u2018cannot be allowed to state such facts only as he pleases to state, and to withhold other facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Price, </em>10 Gray 472, 476 (1858).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Waiver by testimony does not require that the witness\u2019s failure to invoke the Fifth Amendment be knowing and intelligent. Rather, waiver by testimony occurs whenever the prior incriminating testimony has been given voluntarily. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koonce, </em>418 Mass. 367, 377 (1994) (hearing held to determine whether witness\u2019s \u201cearlier testimony was voluntary, and thus constituted a waiver of his privilege against self-incrimination\u201d); <em>Luna </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>407 Mass. 747, 750, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 939 (1990) (witness waived privilege \u201cwhen he voluntarily submitted an affidavit\u201d); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 190 (\u201cwitness who voluntarily answers\u201d incriminating question waives privilege with respect to another question \u201cregardless of the reasons which may have impelled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>his original waiver\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Penta, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 36, 45-46 (1992), S.C., 423 Mass. 546 (1996) (error to allow witness to invoke privilege at trial where witness\u2019s testimony at two prior hearings was \u201cvoluntary\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>423 Mass. 496, 500 (1996) (\u201cwitness who voluntarily testifies regarding an incriminating fact waives his privilege against self-incrimination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">A witness\u2019s ignorance of the privilege is a factor to be considered in the over-all assessment whether the prior testimony was voluntarily given. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Koonce, supra </em>at 377-379 (witness who had minimal education, was ignorant of his Fifth Amendment rights, and had testified at prior trial because of fear that refusal to testify would result in criminal charges, did not give incriminating testimony voluntarily; privilege properly invoked at retrial); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 191-193 (juvenile witness who attended trial alone, lacked advice from parents or counsel, was not advised of rights by judge, and testified only with \u201cmuch reluctance and hesitancy\u201d did not waive his privilege against-self-incrimination). By the same token, a witness\u2019s knowledge of the privilege is a factor tending to show that the incriminating testimony was given voluntarily. See <em>Luna </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra </em>at 750 (witness who had met numerous times with attorney and who was present when judge observed that he could \u201ctake the Fifth Amendment\u201d found to have given incriminating testimony voluntarily; privilege against self-incrimination was waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">While advising the witness concerning the privilege immediately prior to the witness\u2019s testimony is relevant to the assessment whether the witness\u2019s incriminating testimony was given voluntarily, it is not dispositive of the issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Here, however, the judge decided there had been no valid waiver un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>less the witness had been expressly advised of her Fifth Amendment privilege at the start of her voir dire testimony. He advised counsel that, unless such advice was demonstrated by the recording of the proceedings, he would rule that the privilege had not been waived. Nothing in our jurisprudence on waiver by testimony suggests that the voluntariness of prior testimony is dependent on a contemporaneous advisement concerning Fifth Amendment rights. The inquiry as to the voluntariness of this witness\u2019s ostensible waiver was improperly truncated and reduced to a single factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The Commonwealth argues that any error in allowing the victim to invoke her privilege against self-incrimination was harmless because, by way of both her prior recorded testimony and the admission of her July 1, 1998, written statement, the victim\u2019s recantation was placed before the finder of fact in full detail (see note 4, <em>supra). </em>We do not agree. At issue was the credibility of the victim and, specifically, whether her recantation was sufficiently credible to cast doubt on the truth of her spontaneous utterances. The mere fact of her recantation does not, by itself, do anything to support the credibility of that recantation. Although the judge heard the recording of the victim\u2019s testimony at voir dire, that testimony was very brief and lacked detail. At the voir dire, the defendant had merely wanted to put before the judge the fact of the victim\u2019s recantation and, based on that fact alone, exclude the spontaneous utterances. It was not the full presentation of the testimony that the defendant wanted to introduce at trial. It was the defendant\u2019s apparent intention to have the witness testify in person to the details of how the incident had occurred, and it was the defendant\u2019s hope that the victim\u2019s more detailed explanation of her recantation would be sufficiently convincing to raise doubt about the credibility of her spontaneous utterances.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In the absence of the live witness, the defendant was also left with no opportunity to address the matters raised by the victim\u2019s protective order affidavit. In many respects, at least on the cur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>rent record, that affidavit severely damaged the credibility of the victim\u2019s later recantation. Her claim to have made the accusations only because she was \u201chighly intoxicated\u201d is largely belied by the coherent, organized, chronological recounting of the attack, written in her own hand, sometime shortly after the attack. However, where that affidavit was only introduced at trial and never mentioned at the voir dire, neither side questioned the victim about that affidavit or her pursuit of the protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We recognize that victims of domestic violence often change their minds about whether to testify and whether to press charges in connection with a prior attack. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMonte, </em>427 Mass. 233, 244 (1998). That does not mean, however, that every recantation by such a victim witness is to be discredited or simply assumed to be the product of that phenomenon. While there is much here to suggest that the victim\u2019s initial account to the police was more credible than her later recantation, the defendant was entitled, absent any proper invocation of privilege by the victim witness, to call the victim witness and present her live testimony. We cannot simply assume that such testimony would not have been credible enough to create a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">It is therefore necessary to remand this matter for further proceedings to determine whether the victim\u2019s testimony at the voir dire hearing constituted a waiver of her Fifth Amendment privilege. If there was not a valid waiver, the witness properly invoked the privilege at trial, and there would be no prejudice from the judge\u2019s having allowed her to do so. If, however, there was a waiver, it was prejudicial error to allow the witness to invoke the privilege and the defendant would be entitled to a new trial. The matter is therefore remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\">An hour or two later, the victim prepared an affidavit in support of a request for a protective order against the defendant. That affidavit was consistent with the statements given to the officers at the scene. See note 5, <em>infra. </em>The affidavit was admitted at trial on other grounds, not as a spontaneous utterance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The trial proceeded before a different judge. The judge who conducted the voir dire had, in the course of ruling on the motion in limine, expressed views about the merits of the case. Subsequently, on learning that the defendant intended to waive his right to a jury trial, the judge appropriately recused himself from the jury-waived trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b273-10\">She did not separately claim any privilege under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b273-11\">He did not contend \u2014 nor could he \u2014 that the victim\u2019s testimony recanting her prior accusations (which she had made in statements to the police and in a sworn affidavit in support of a request for protective order) would not at least potentially incriminate her. \u201cA witness may refuse to testify unless it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>\u2018perfectly clear, </em>from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that the witness is mistaken, and that the answer[s] <em>cannot possibly </em>have such tendency\u2019 to incriminate (emphasis in original).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>423 Mass. 496, 502 (1996), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Funches, </em>379 Mass. 283, 289 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Because the invocation of the privilege rendered the victim unavailable, the judge allowed the defendant to introduce the victim\u2019s voir dire testimony as prior recorded testimony, and the judge listened to the recording of that testimony. He also allowed the defendant to introduce a written statement that the victim had given in July, 1998, although the basis for admitting that statement is unclear. In her July, 1998, statement, the victim explained that she had punched the defendant and that the defendant had pushed her back and held her in order to defend himself. She then tried to open the door of the moving vehicle to jump out, but the defendant pulled her back and shut the door \u201cto protect\u201d her. She asked the driver to pull over at the gasoline station, and got out of the vehicle once it was stopped. She remembered calling her mother and the police, and she acknowledged telling the police that the defendant had assaulted her. She stated, however, that she was \u201chighly intoxicated\u201d at the time and that she \u201cdidn\u2019t remember saying any of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">The prosecutor was then allowed to introduce an affidavit that the victim had submitted on March 14, 1998, in support of her request for a protective order against the defendant. That affidavit, handwritten by the victim, stated that she and the defendant got into an argument about another man while riding back from a nightclub in Springfield; that the defendant grabbed her by the neck three times; that she could not breathe when he did so; that she tried to jump out of the vehicle in order to escape; that the defendant threatened to kill her; that the driver stopped the vehicle and tried to get the defendant away from her, at which time she managed to struggle free and get out; and that she then ran to the gasoline station and called her mother and the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b274-12\">The waiver, once made, waives the privilege only with respect to the same proceeding; the witness may once again invoke the privilege in any subsequent proceeding. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>423 Mass. 496, 500-501 (1996) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>(waiver of privilege before grand jury does not waive privilege at trial); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borans, </em>388 Mass. 453, 457-458 (1983) (same). A voir dire hearing, held on the day of trial, is the same proceeding as the trial for purposes of the doctrine of waiver by testimony, and the Commonwealth does not contend otherwise. See <em>Luna </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>407 Mass. 747, 750-751, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 939 (1990) (privilege could not be claimed at trial where witness had submitted incriminating affidavit in connection with pretrial motion and testified at pretrial hearing); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Penta, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 36, 45-46 (1992), <em>S.C., </em>423 Mass. 546 (1996) (witness who testified at motion to suppress, recanted that testimony in an affidavit, and testified at hearing on motion to reconsider, could not invoke the privilege at trial). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judge, </em>420 Mass. 433, 445 n.8 (1995) (hearing on motion to suppress is same proceeding as trial for purposes of waiver by testimony).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\">For example, a witness who is not advised of the privilege at the start of the hearing may already be fully cognizant of the privilege. Or, even with no knowledge of, or advice concerning, the privilege, a witness\u2019s desire to testify at the earlier hearing may be manifest such that the testimony would still be considered voluntary. By the same token, the fact that a witness was advised of the privilege would not automatically mean that incriminating testimony was given voluntarily. A witness who is fully aware of the privilege may nevertheless be subject to threats or other forms of coercion that would make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>the testimony involuntary.
