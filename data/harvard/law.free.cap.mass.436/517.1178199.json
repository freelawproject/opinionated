In response, Fabre filed a civil complaint against Walton asserting a single claim of abuse of process arising out of her application for the abuse protection order. Walton filed an unsuccessful special motion to dismiss pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H (commonly known as the anti-SLAJPP statute), and appealed the denial of that motion to the county court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">We decide two issues: first, whether there is a right to interlocutory appellate review when a trial judge denies a special motion to dismiss pursuant to the anti-SLAPP statute and second, whether the motion judge erred in denying Walton\u2019s special motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">1. <em>Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">Walton and Fabre dated for approximately three years. At the end of their relationship, Walton filed a complaint against Fabre in the Dedham Division of the District Court Department for protection from abuse pursuant to G. L. c. 209A. The complaint was accompanied by an affidavit in which she described Fabre\u2019s behavior toward her. The District Court judge who reviewed the complaint ex parte found that Fabre\u2019s behavior toward Walton was \u201ccontrolling and oppressive\u201d and that Walton was \u201cvisibly very frightened.\u201d Based on these findings, the judge issued a temporary abuse prevention order.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">A hearing to extend the temporary order was held on April 10, 2000. Fabre and Walton were each represented by counsel and both testified. Fabre\u2019s roommate also testified, and Fabre\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>attorney attempted to elicit testimony from him that a friend of Walton told him that Walton told her that she had applied for the abuse prevention order so that it would appear on Fabre\u2019s future job applications and necessitate his explaining it to future employers. The judge excluded this testimony as hearsay. After the hearing, the judge ruled that Walton had demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that she required the continued protection of the court, and extended the restraining order for six months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Fabre did not appeal from the order, but filed a civil complaint in the Cambridge Division of the District Court Department claiming abuse of process against Walton. In his complaint, Fabre asserted that Walton\u2019s affidavit and her testimony at the 209A hearing were false, that she had not been abused, and that her filing of the 209A complaint was for the ulterior purpose of causing him \u201cfuture embarrassment and repercussions in his employment, his career choices, and otherwise.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Walton filed a special motion to dismiss Fabre\u2019s complaint pursuant to the anti-SLAPP statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge denied her motion without findings or explanation. Walton filed a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>reconsideration, or in the alternative, for a report of the ruling to the Appellate Division of the District Court Department for interlocutory review,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> both of which were also denied. Walton then petitioned the county court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking relief. After a hearing, a single justice reserved and reported the case to the full bench and stayed the District Court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">2. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In enacting the anti-SLAPP statute, \u201cthe Legislature intended to immunize parties from claims \u2018based on\u2019 their petitioning activities.\u201d <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 167 (1998). Accordingly, the statute provides broad protections for individuals who exercise their right to petition from harassing litigation and the costs and burdens of defending against retaliatory lawsuits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 161-162. In this regard, they are similar in purpose to the protections afforded public officials by the doctrine of governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The protections afforded by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, include a procedural remedy that permits the defendant in a SLAPP suit to file a \u201cspecial\u201d motion to dismiss early in the litigation, which a judge shall grant, \u201cunless the party against whom such special motion is made shows that: (1) the moving party\u2019s exercise of its right to petition was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law and (2) the moving party\u2019s acts caused actual injury to the responding party.\u201d They also include the automatic stay of discovery on the filing of a special motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\"><em>Right to an interlocutory appeal. </em>\u201cIt is settled that absent \u2018special authorization,\u2019 ... \u2018an appellate court will reject attempts to obtain piecemeal review of trial rulings that do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>represent final dispositions on the merits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashford </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>421 Mass. 563, 565 (1995), quoting <em>Cappadona </em>v. <em>Riverside 400 Function Room, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 167, 169 (1977), and <em>R.J.A. </em>v. <em>K.A.V., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 369, 372 (1993). The policy underlying this rule is that \u201ca party ought not to have the power to interrupt the progress of the litigation by piecemeal appeals that cause delay and often waste judicial effort in deciding questions that will turn out to be unimportant.\u201d <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. 775, 779 (1979), quoting <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>Plecker, </em>319 Mass. 560, 563 n.l (1946). Consistent with this rule, the denial of a motion to dismiss is ordinarily not an appealable order. See <em>Bean </em>v. <em>399 Boylston St., Inc., </em>335 Mass. 595, 596 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">There are limited exceptions to this rule, one of which is the doctrine of present execution. Under that doctrine, Immediate appeal of an interlocutory order is allowed if the order will interfere with rights in a way that cannot be remedied on appeal from the final judgment. See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 524-525 (1985). See also <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, supra </em>at 779-782. Interlocutory orders relating to claims of governmental immunity from suit are appealable pursuant to the doctrine of present execution because \u201c[t]he entitlement is an <em>immunity from suit </em>rather than a mere defense to liability; and like an absolute immunity, it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>For-syth, supra </em>at 526. See <em>Brum </em>v. <em>Dartmouth, </em>428 Mass. 684, 688 (1999) (\u201cThe right to immunity from suit would be Tost forever\u2019 if an order denying it were not appealable until the close of litigation . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">As in the governmental immunity context, the denial of a special motion to dismiss interferes with rights in a way that cannot be remedied on appeal from the final judgment. The protections afforded by the anti-SLAPP statute against the harassment and burdens of litigation are in large measure lost if the petitioner is forced to litigate a case to its conclusion before obtaining a definitive judgment through the appellate process. Accordingly, we hold that there is a right to interlocutory appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>late review from the denial of a special motion to dismiss filed pursuant to the anti-SLAPP statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Having established a right to interlocutory review, we next turn to the question where that review should occur. SLAPP suits may originate in different venues with different avenues of appeal. In the present case, the suit was brought in the District Court where the route for the appeal of interlocutory orders is less certain than the route available from other courts. Compare Rule 5 of the Dist./Mun. Cts. Rules for Appellate Division Appeal (2001) with G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118. \u201cThis court has \u2018wide discretion in devising various procedures for the course of appeals in different classes of cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zullo </em>v. Goguen, 423 Mass. 679, 681 (1996), quoting <em>Flynn </em>v. Warner, 421 Mass. 1002, 1003 (1995). In the exercise of this discretion, we conclude that, for purposes of certainty, uniformity of treatment of litigants, and the development of a consistent body of law, an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a special motion to dismiss should proceed to the Appeals Court, regardless of the court in which the SLAPP suit was brought. See <em>Zullo </em>v. <em>Goguen, supra </em>at 681-682.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\"><em>Walton\u2019s special motion to dismiss. </em>After reviewing the judge\u2019s denial of Walton\u2019s special motion to dismiss,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we conclude that its denial was erroneous. <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, </em>431 Mass. 343, 348 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The party filing a special motion to dismiss has the initial burden of demonstrating that the activity at issue is \u201cpetitioning\u201d activity within the purview of the anti-SLAPP statute and that the claims in the litigation \u201care \u2018based on\u2019 the petitioning activities alone and have no substantial basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities.\u201d <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 167-168 (1998). The petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>has met these requirements. The filing of a complaint for an abuse protection order and the submission of supporting affidavits are petitioning activities encompassed within the protection afforded by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. See <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, supra </em>at 347. In addition, a cursory review of Fabre\u2019s complaint, which simply recounts and complains of Walton\u2019s conduct in bringing and testifying at the 209A proceedings, demonstrates that the claim against Walton is based on the exercise of her right to petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">However, Fabre asserts that it is not Walton\u2019s petitioning activity that is the subject of his claim, but rather her \u201culterior motive\u201d in pursuing the 209A complaint. He asserts that \u201cthere is evidence that [Walton] utilized the abuse prevention process for an ulterior purpose,\u201d thereby giving rise to an abuse of process claim that is not \u201cbased on\u201d Walton\u2019s petitioning activities alone. In support of his position, Fabre submitted two affidavits in opposition to Walton\u2019s motion to dismiss. In one of these affidavits, Fabre denies that he ever physically abused, threatened, harassed, or gave Walton reason to fear him, and further states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">\u201c[Walton\u2019s friend] came over to my apartment that day to meet [Fabre\u2019s roommate] for lunch. She didn\u2019t want [Walton] to know about her visit and told me in front of [the roommate]: \u2018[Fabre], [Walton] told me she\u2019s not doing this because she is scared or feels threatened. She said she\u2019s doing this so that every time you have a job interview you have this against you.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">In the other affidavit, his roommate confirms Fabre\u2019s assertion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">\u201cThe next afternoon [Walton\u2019s friend] came over to my apartment because we had planned to have lunch. [Fabre] had just returned from France and he and [Walton\u2019s friend] talked. I was present for most of that conversation and heard her say something to the effect that [Walton] had told her she was not filing for the restraining order because she was scared of [Fabre] but was doing it so that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>would be a permanent mark on his record that would show up on future job applications.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">A special motion to dismiss will not succeed against a \u201cmeritorious claim[] with a <em>substantial </em>basis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities implicated\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., supra </em>at 167. Fabre\u2019s claim does not meet this test. Notwithstanding his allegations concerning the motive behind Walton\u2019s conduct, the fact remains that the <em>only </em>conduct complained of is Walton\u2019s petitioning activity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is no \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for the claim other than that petitioning activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Having established that Fabre\u2019s complaint is \u201cbased on\u201d Walton\u2019s petitioning activity, the burden shifts to Fabre to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that Walton\u2019s petitioning activity was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. 543, 553-554 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In determining whether the petitioning activity is devoid of any reasonable factual support or arguable basis in law, the statute directs the judge to consider \u201cthe pleadings and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. However, in light of the findings and the final judgment entered in the contested 209A proceedings, Fabre\u2019s pleadings and affidavits are insufficient to sustain his burden. In the absence of a successful appeal or collateral attack on the final judgment in favor of Walton, that judgment is conclusive evidence that the petitioning activity was not devoid of any reasonable factual support or arguable basis in law. The judge who extended the restraining order found, after an evidentiary hearing, that the requisites for such an order had been established by a preponderance of the evidence. By definition, something that has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>established by a preponderance of the evidence cannot be devoid of any reasonable factual support or arguable basis in law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The motion judge\u2019s denial of Walton\u2019s special motion to dismiss in these circumstances was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">3. <em>Costs and Attorney\u2019s Fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The anti-SLAPP statute requires the payment of attorney\u2019s fees and costs if the judge allows a special motion to dismiss. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. \u201cThe purpose of the statute is to reimburse persons for costs and attorney\u2019s fees if a judge determines that the statute is applicable and allows their motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, </em>431 Mass. 343, 350 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Walton included a request for an award of costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in her special motion to dismiss. Walton renewed her request for an award of costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in her G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition. In light of our reversal of the denial of her motion, Walton is entitled to costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees related to the District Court proceedings. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. She also requested costs and attorney\u2019s fees related to this appeal. \u201cThis is the appropriate procedure for a party seeking costs and fees for appellate work,\u201d <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, supra </em>at 350, and her request is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">4. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for the entry of judgment consistent with this opinion and for the award of costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as required by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. In addition, Walton may apply to the single justice for an award of appropriate attorney\u2019s fees and costs in connection with the appeal.

Based on the credible evidence and reasonable inferences that I draw from that evidence, I am going to extend this restraining order for a period of six months.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The elements of the tort of abuse of process are: \u201c(1) \u2018process\u2019 was used; (2) for an ulterior or illegitimate purpose; (3) resulting in damage.\u201d <em>Vittands </em>v. <em>Sudduth, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 401, 406 (2000), quoting <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 557, 558 (1988). \u201cMore specifically, abuse of process has been described as a \u2018form of coercion to obtain a collateral advantage, not properly involved in the proceeding itself, such as the surrender of property or the payment of money.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vittands </em>v. <em>Sudduth, supra, </em>quoting <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Hurley, 20 </em>Mass.
