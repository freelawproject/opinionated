A Superior Court judge, who was also the trial judge, denied this motion. On appeal, the Appeals Court ruled that the judge did not err in denying the motion to suppress or the motion for a required finding of not guilty and affirmed the conviction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 846 (2001). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review. Because we conclude that the State trooper had sufficient justification to stop behind the defendant\u2019s parked vehicle in a breakdown lane and to inquire about the defendant\u2019s license and registration, the substances recovered from the defendant during the booking process were admissible at trial. Furthermore, there was sufficient evidence to find the defendant guilty of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A. Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">I. <em>Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In deciding the motion to suppress, the judge found the following facts in accord with the evidence presented at trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On August 22, 1997, Trooper Jeffrey Lenti, after completing his shift at the State police barracks at Russell, drove toward the town of Lee on Route 20. At approximately 11:30 p.m., near the town of Becket, Trooper Lenti saw a car pulled over on the right-hand side of the road. The car was in the breakdown lane of Route 20 and its right blinker was flashing. Trooper Lenti pulled up behind the parked vehicle and activated the cruiser\u2019s blue lights. Trooper Lenti testified that his purpose in puffing up behind the vehicle was to see if the person inside needed assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">He approached the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle and saw what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>appeared to be a male sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. This person was later identified as the defendant, Willie A. Evans. The defendant was reclined in the driver\u2019s seat and had his eyes closed. Trooper Lenti knocked on the window but there was no response. He then knocked a little harder. The defendant opened his eyes, sat up, looked around for about ten seconds and then rolled down his window. Trooper Lenti asked the defendant what he was doing alongside the road. The defendant responded, \u201cNothing.\u201d Trooper Lenti then asked the defendant for his license and registration. The defendant stated that he did not have a license, but instead produced a Massachusetts identification card with the name, \u201cWillie A. Evans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Trooper Lenti returned to his cmiser to determine the status of the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license and found that it had been revoked. Trooper Lenti returned to the defendant\u2019s vehicle and placed him under arrest for operating a vehicle with a revoked license.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">While performing an inventory search of the defendant at the police barracks, pursuant to standard booking procedures, Trooper Lenti found $162 in cash, a pager, three packages of what appeared to be crack cocaine in the defendant\u2019s right shoe, and a package of marijuana in the left shoe.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trooper estimated there to be fifteen to twenty pieces of crack cocaine in the packages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Based on this amount and the way in which the crack cocaine was packaged, the defendant was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">At trial, Officer Timothy S. Face of the Lenox police department, who was also affiliated with the Berkshire County drug task force as an undercover officer, gave opinion testimony. He testified that, based on the amount of cocaine possessed by the defendant, the way in which the cocaine was packaged, and the defendant\u2019s possession of a pager and $162 in cash, the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>was consistent with an intent to distribute cocaine. He testified that the nine individually wrapped pieces of crack cocaine had a street value of $20 each and that the two larger chunks of crack cocaine were approximately the size of an \u201ceight-ball.\u201d The total street value of the quantities of cocaine possessed by the defendant was $1,500. Based on the evidence, the jury found the defendant guilty on all three indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">II. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\"><em>A. Denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. </em>\u201cIn reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we accept the motion judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yesilciman, </em>406 Mass. 736, 743 (1990), and cases cited. A judge\u2019s legal conclusion, however, \u201cis a matter for review . . . particularly where the conclusion is of constitutional dimensions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>375 Mass. 349, 354 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The defendant argues that the trooper improperly seized him by pulling up behind his vehicle and turning on the police cruiser\u2019s blue lights. As a result, the defendant argues that the drugs and other evidence seized following his arrest should be suppressed. The defendant also argues that the trooper\u2019s subsequent inquiry of the defendant was an unjustifiable <em>Terry </em>stop and therefore was a seizure. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968). We conclude that the motion judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">1. <em>Community caretaking function. </em>\u201cNot all personal intercourse between policemen and citizens involves \u2018seizures\u2019 of persons. Only when the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude that a \u2018seizure\u2019 has occurred.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>422 Mass. 504, 508, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 877 (1996), quoting <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra </em>at 19 n.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Moreover, there are certain interactions between police officers and citizens that do not require judicial justification. Local police officers are charged with \u201ccommunity caretaking functions, totally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.\u201d <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 441 (1973). This court has recognized that some of these functions include al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>lowing police officers to check on motorists parked in a rest area, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murdough, </em>428 Mass. 760, 764 (1999), and allowing an officer to open the unlocked door of a vehicle parked in a breakdown lane to ascertain the motorist\u2019s need for assistance, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonard, supra </em>at 508-509.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Trooper Lenti\u2019s approaching the defendant\u2019s vehicle in the breakdown lane falls squarely under the trooper\u2019s community caretaking function. It was approximately 11:30 p.m. on a rural part of Route 20, and the defendant\u2019s vehicle was pulled over with its right blinker flashing. The trooper, as part of his community caretaking responsibilities, appropriately decided to check the status of the vehicle and its occupants. This approach does not require judicial justification and was a minimal intrusion on the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>389 Mass. 233, 242 (1983) (\u201cThe very limited and focused inspection of a vehicle to determine whether assistance or aid is required is a minimal intrusion on the occupant\u2019s or owner\u2019s expectation of privacy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">2. <em>Use of the cruiser\u2019s blue lights. </em>The trooper\u2019s activation of blue lights, after puffing up behind the defendant\u2019s vehicle, did not change the nature of the encounter into a seizure. This court has previously held that, during a community caretaking inquiry, where an officer pulled alongside a vehicle, turned on the cruiser\u2019s blue lights, and later opened the vehicle door to ascertain the status of the driver, the officer\u2019s actions up until the point of opening the car door were not \u201cinconsistent with a routine inquiry requiring no justification.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonard, supra </em>at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The defendant relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smigliano, </em>427 Mass. 490, 492 (1998), for the proposition that the activation of blue fights is a \u201cseizure requiring some level of justification.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smigliano, supra, </em>is inapposite. In that case, the defendant had been observed by a police officer driving \u201call over the road\u201d and almost hitting two parked cars. <em>Id. </em>The officer proceeded to pull up behind the defendant\u2019s stopped vehicle, activate his blue fights, and approach the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>The court held that the activation of the blue fights was justified based on the officer\u2019s observations, which indicated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>defendant may have been intoxicated. <em>Id. </em>In the case at bar, the defendant was already stopped and parked in the breakdown lane, a location normally associated with disabled vehicles. Thus, it was entirely logical and necessary for the officer to ascertain whether the defendant needed assistance. Moreover, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smigliano, supra, </em>was not decided under the community caretaking rationale, because \u201cactivating the blue lights was justified as a <em>Terry </em>stop to investigate criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the case at bar, the trooper was performing a community caretaking function, not investigating suspected criminal activity, and therefore, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smigliano, supra, </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">3. <em>Request for the defendant\u2019s license and registration. </em>The defendant also argues that Trooper Lenti\u2019s request for his license and registration was an unjustifiable <em>Terry </em>stop and therefore was a seizure of the defendant. See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra. </em>First, the defendant argues that once he stated, \u201cNothing,\u201d in response to the trooper\u2019s question, \u201cWhat are you doing?,\u201d the inquiry should have ended, as he had effectively denied the need for any assistance. When the inquiry did not end, the defendant claims, the trooper\u2019s request for the defendant\u2019s license and registration became a seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Courts in other jurisdictions have not been uniform in ruling on the issue whether a seizure has occurred when an officer, checking on the well-being of an already stopped motorist, requests the motorist\u2019s license and registration despite a lack of evidence that the driver has committed a motor vehicle violation or criminal act. Some courts have held that a limited and. reasonable seizure has occurred.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Other courts have determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>that such a request is an unjustified seizure,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> while others have held, and we agree, that a seizure does not occur when an officer requests the license and registration of a motorist stopped in the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In the case at bar, the trooper\u2019s request for the defendant\u2019s license and registration was not a seizure. There is no evidence that by requesting the defendant\u2019s license and registration, the officer restrained the defendant through any physical force or authority. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonard, supra </em>at 508-509.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Several reasons justify an officer\u2019s actions in requesting a driver\u2019s license when performing community caretaking responsibilities. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals in <em>State </em>v. <em>El-lenbecker, </em>159 Wis. 2d 91 (Ct. App. 1990), articulates important safety reasons. \u201cIn many cases, police officers are required to make a written report of contacts with citizens. An officer needs to know whom he or she is assisting in the event a citizen later complains about improper behavior on the part of the officer or makes any kind of legal claim against the officer. Moreover, even seemingly innocent activity, such as refueling a disabled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>car, could later turn out to be theft of a car that was left on the shoulder of a highway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Given the length of time it took for the trooper to rouse the defendant by knocking on the car window, the defendant\u2019s response to the trooper\u2019s question, and the fact that the defendant\u2019s car was parked in a breakdown lane late at night on a rural stretch of road, with no indication from the defendant that he was having car trouble, and in light of the considerations articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellenbecker, supra, </em>it was reasonable for the trooper to ascertain the defendant\u2019s identity. This request for the defendant\u2019s license and registration was a minimal intrusion on the defendant\u2019s rights, outweighed by the trooper\u2019s responsibility to protect the public, through the community caretaking function, from a driver who may be unfit to continue driving. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murdough, </em>428 Mass. 760, 764 (1999) (\u201cIf the community caretaking function . . . means anything, surely it allows a police officer to determine whether a driver is in such a condition that if he resumes operation of the vehicle, in which he is seated at a highway rest stop, he will pose such an extreme danger to himself and others\u201d). Accordingly, based on the evidence presented, we conclude that the trooper\u2019s request for the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license posed a minimal intrusion on the defendant\u2019s rights and was not a seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">B. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty on the charge of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A. This court, in reviewing a denial of a motion for a required finding, \u201cmust consider and determine whether the evidence, in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth, notwithstanding the contrary evidence presented by the defendant, is sufficient ... to permit the jury to infer the existence of the essential elements of the crime charged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sandler, </em>368 Mass. 729, 740 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">There was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find the defendant guilty of the charge, beyond a reasonable doubt. Relying on evidence of the amount of cocaine the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>possessed, the way in which the cocaine was packaged, the defendant\u2019s possession of $162 cash and a pager, and Officer Face\u2019s testimony that the evidence was consistent with an intent to distribute cocaine, a reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gollman, <em>ante </em>111, 116-117 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">HI. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. Furthermore, there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find the defendant guilty of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\">The convictions of possession of marijuana and operating without a valid license were placed \u00f3n file with the defendant\u2019s consent and are not before us on appeal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dahl, </em>430 Mass. 813, 813 n.1 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\">At trial, Officer Lenti testified to finding $162 and a pager in the defendant\u2019s possession. In addition, Officer Face testified to his opinion that the circumstances were consistent with possession with intent to distribute the controlled substances. The judge did not make findings with respect to these facts in ruling on the motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Laboratory analysis later showed that the amount of marijuana found in the defendant\u2019s left shoe was 3.69 grams.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b387-10\">The day before trial began, Trooper Lenti and Officer Face reexamined the evidence and counted the pieces of cocaine in the packages. There were actually only nine pieces of crack cocaine in the packages as opposed to the fifteen to twenty pieces estimated by Trooper Lenti at the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\">See 4 W.R.
