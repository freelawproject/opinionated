Although the defendant was a suspect in the killing, he was not charged with the victim\u2019s murder until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>December, 1998. Thereafter, a jury in the Superior Court convicted him of murder in the first degree by reason of extreme atrocity or cruelty. In returning their verdict, the jury credited the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, consisting of the defendant\u2019s incriminating statements, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test results, and other evidence that linked him to the homicide, and they rejected the defendant\u2019s contentions that the statement he made to police officers in July, 1998, was involuntary, and that he could not have been the killer because he is right-handed and the stab wounds had been inflicted on the victim by a left-handed person. Represented by new counsel on appeal, the defendant argues that we should order a new trial because (1) his statement made to police officers in July, 1998, was obtained in violation of his Miranda rights and was involuntary, and, therefore, should not have been admitted in evidence; (2) the prosecutor engaged in prejudicial acts of misconduct; and (3) opinion testimony concerning the DNA testing was improperly placed before the jury. We reject the defendant\u2019s arguments. We also conclude that there is no basis to exercise our authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the conviction to a lesser degree of guilt or to order a new trial. Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">1. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not file a formal motion to suppress the defendant\u2019s July, 1998, statement. Rather, the prosecutor brought to the judge\u2019s attention that there might be an issue concerning the statement\u2019s admissibility, and the judge, over the objection of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> decided, as matter of discretion, to conduct a pretrial evidentiary hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>the issue.* 2 The judge concluded that the defendant\u2019s statement had been lawfully obtained and was voluntarily made, and the statement was later admitted at trial. The defendant\u2019s appellate counsel now contends that the judge erred in concluding that the interrogation of the defendant was noncustodial, and erred in admitting statements made by the defendant after he had invoked his right to counsel, and, alternatively, that the judge erred in admitting the defendant\u2019s statement because it was involuntary. To understand the present challenges, it is necessary to set forth what occurred after the murder in 1988, the evidence at the pretrial evidentiary hearing, the contention made by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, and the judge\u2019s conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">(a) From the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence at trial, the jury could have found the following. At about 7:30 p.m. on August 13, 1988, a man traveling with his father discovered the victim\u2019s body in the woods at a rest stop located near the Westfield-Holyoke line. The victim was naked, bruised, and had been repeatedly stabbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The victim was last seen with the defendant during the early morning of the day her body was found. The night before, at approximately 11:30 p.m., the victim was seen hitchhiking from downtown Westfield, seeking a ride to Holyoke. The defendant picked her up. At about midnight, they went to Foxy\u2019s Tea Room in Westfield, and had a couple of drinks. The defendant was wearing a belt with a knife holder. He left with the victim about one-half hour after they had arrived. The victim was never seen alive again.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">State and local police processed the murder scene. The victim\u2019s shirt, shorts and underpants were recovered near her body. Her clothing was sent to the State police crime laboratory. Initial testing (not DNA testing) of the victim\u2019s underwear for sperm was inconclusive, but sperm cells were detected in her vagina.</p>\n<author id=\"b675-9\">2The judge who conducted the pretrial evidentiary hearing was also the trial judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>An autopsy of the victim\u2019s body was conducted at 6 a.m. on August 14, 1988. The medical examiner concluded that the victim died sometime between twelve to forty-eight hours prior to the autopsy. He noted abrasions, scratches, and bruises on the victim\u2019s body. He also noted marks consistent with blunt trauma injury or defensive wounds. He concluded that the victim had died from multiple stab wounds to her neck, chest, abdomen and back. She had been stabbed thirteen times, and had been alive when the majority of these wounds were inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The investigation of the victim\u2019s death centered on the defendant. State police obtained warrants to search his home and automobile. Testing revealed the presence of \u201coccult\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> blood on his car\u2019s steering wheel and gear shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">A few days after the victim\u2019s death, Westfield police questioned the defendant. After talking to police, the defendant signed a typewritten statement, in which he stated that he saw the victim hitchhiking, picked her up, and dropped her off outside the 49er Lounge. He recounted that he then went to Foxy\u2019s Tea Room for a beer. When confronted with information that he had been observed at Foxy\u2019s Tea Room with the victim, the defendant changed his story, admitting that he took the victim to Foxy\u2019s Tea Room, but insisted that thereafter, he dropped her off outside the 49er Lounge.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">On June 8, 1998, the defendant was taken into custody for a parole violation (on charges unrelated to the victim\u2019s murder), after a suicide threat. The next day, two State troopers met the defendant at the office of his parole officer. The defendant agreed to provide them with a blood sample, which was submitted to a laboratory for analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The defendant\u2019s blood, together with a portion of the underwear and a vaginal swab from the victim, as well as the victim\u2019s blood, were subjected to DNA testing by an analyst at Cellmark Diagnostics laboratory. The analyst concluded, from examining DNA obtained from the sperm fraction on the underwear and on the vaginal swab, that the sperm had been contributed by different donors. She also concluded that the defendant could be excluded as the donor of the sperm on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>underwear, but could not be excluded as the donor of sperm on the vaginal swab.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">After obtaining the results from the DNA testing, the police officers, on July 23, 1998, went to the Massachusetts Correctional Institute at Concord (MCI, Concord), where the defendant was being held, to interview him.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">(b) The sole witness at the pretrial evidentiary hearing was State Trooper William Loiselle. Trooper Loiselle\u2019s testimony described the July 23, 1998, interview, and was credited by the judge. The testimony may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Trooper Loiselle was accompanied on the visit to MCI, Concord, by Detective Baron Maraca of the Holyoke police department. The defendant was being held with the general prison population and was not segregated in the prison\u2019s mental heath unit. The officers were not in uniform and met with the defendant in an office used by the prison\u2019s internal security investigatory unit. The room, approximately sixteen feet by ten feet, contained a round table, chairs and windows. When the defendant arrived, the officers introduced themselves, although the defendant had met Trooper Loiselle the month before when the defendant had provided Trooper Loiselle with a blood sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">After an initial greeting during which the defendant stated that he was doing well, that things were \u201cgoing good\u201d at home, and that he was back together with his wife, Trooper Loiselle read the defendant his Miranda rights from a card. The defendant stated that he understood those rights, signed the card containing the Miranda warnings from which Trooper Loiselle had read, and replied affirmatively that he wished to speak with the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">The officers first questioned the defendant about his recent suicide attempt. Detective Maraca asked the defendant if he had been serious about harming himself, and the defendant replied that he had not been serious, and that he told his wife he was suicidal because such talk \u201cpisses her off.\u201d The defendant\u2019s explanation was consistent with the information provided to them by the defendant\u2019s parole officer and other law enforcement officers: that the defendant had feigned his recent suicide attempt because he was upset after being served with divorce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>papers. They also learned that after the alleged suicide attempt, the defendant had been released from a hospital where it had been determined that he was neither a threat to himself nor to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The officers then turned to the subject of the victim\u2019s murder in 1988, asking the defendant to review his 1988 statement to police. After doing so, the defendant said that it \u201csohnded all right,\u201d and that he had nothing to add. Trooper Loiselle questioned the defendant about whether he had had sexual relations with the victim in August, 1988. The defendant repeatedly denied having any form of sexual contact with the victim. However, after learning from the officers that testing on his blood confirmed that his sperm was found inside the victim, the defendant admitted to having had intercourse with her. The defendant stated that he did not want his wife to discover that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The officers asked the defendant to recount his activities on August 12 and 13 of 1988. The defendant stated the following: after getting out of work on the evening of August 12, 1988, the defendant drank some beer and \u201cdid some cocaine.\u201d He then picked up the victim, who was hitchhiking, and drove to Foxy\u2019s Tea Room, where they each had a beer. They left Foxy\u2019s, returned to the defendant\u2019s car in the parking lot and had intercourse in the car. Afterward, the defendant dropped the victim off at the 49er Lounge and went home.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">During further questioning, the defendant admitted that he had not dropped the victim off at the 49er Lounge, but had driven her to the rest area where her body was later found. Eventually, the defendant confessed to killing the victim, stating, \u201cI did it. What do you want me to sign?\u201d After his initial confession, the defendant started crying.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">At a later point in the interview, the defendant asked the officers if he were under arrest. The officers replied that he was not. The defendant asked them what was going to happen to him. Trooper Loiselle said that the police would pass on the information from the interview to the district attorney\u2019s office. The defendant then stated, \u201cIf I am under arrest, I want an attorney.\u201d The officers stood up and began collecting their papers. Trooper Loiselle told the defendant that if he wanted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>them to leave, they would do so. The defendant again asked if he was under arrest, and Trooper Loiselle told him that he was not. The defendant said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you if I\u2019m not under arrest,\u201d and the interview resumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Trooper Loiselle asked the defendant if he would provide a statement. The defendant agreed, and as the defendant spoke, Trooper Loiselle transcribed his statement. The defendant had stopped crying at this point, was looking at the officers when he spoke, and spoke coherently to them. In his statement, the defendant said that after leaving Foxy\u2019s Tea Room, he took the victim to the rest area and had consensual sex with her out in the woods. He admitted, \u201cI had sex with her and then I blacked out. I don\u2019t know how many times I stabbed her. I did it, but I don\u2019t even remember doing it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The defendant reviewed Trooper Loiselle\u2019s transcription of his statement, stated that it was true to the best of his knowledge, and signed it. Trooper Loiselle read the statement back to the defendant. Trooper Loiselle asked the defendant \u201cif he was glad that he got this off his chest,\u201d and the defendant started crying. Detective Maruca later asked the defendant the same question and the defendant replied, \u201cYes.\u201d The detective asked the defendant if he felt like killing himself, and the defendant replied, \u201cNo.\u201d The officers left.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">During the defendant\u2019s questioning, before he cried, the defendant was calm, looked at the officers when they spoke to him, and responded appropriately to their questions. During the interview, the officers did not physically intimidate, threaten, trick, or pressure him, and did not make any promises, assurances, or offers of inducements to him. The defendant was alert and did not appear to be impaired in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">(c) The defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not present any evidence at the pretrial hearing that the defendant\u2019s statement was involuntary due to a psychological impairment or disability. Rather, he purposefully reserved this evidence for trial and offered it through his expert witness who had performed a psychological evaluation of the defendant. At the pretrial hearing, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel argued to the judge that Trooper Loiselle\u2019s testimony raised a question concerning the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statement because his testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>demonstrated that the defendant had been questioned after requesting a lawyer. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel also argued that the officers should have repeated the Miranda warnings to the defendant throughout their questioning, and that the officers misrepresented to the defendant that he was not under arrest when in fact he was, and that that misrepresentation undercut the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statement. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel explained, \u201cI am not making a Miranda claim. I never moved to suppress the statement, Judge. I\u2019m merely asking you to consider whether some evidence has been adduced relative to the voluntariness of the statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">(d) The judge construed trial counsel\u2019s argument as one raising solely the issue of the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statement. Citing <em>Commowealth </em>v. <em>Larkin, </em>429 Mass. 426 (1999), the judge concluded that the defendant was not in custody, and, therefore, Miranda warnings did not need to be given. Consequently, he ruled, no duty to repeat the Miranda warnings would have arisen.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Alternatively, the judge concluded that, even if Miranda warnings were required, appropriate warnings were given by Trooper Loiselle, and the defendant made a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his Miranda rights beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, the judge concluded that the Miranda warnings did not have to be repeated; that the circumstances of the interview were not coercive and did not render the defendant\u2019s statement involuntary; that the defendant\u2019s remark, \u201cIf I am [under arrest], I want an attorney,\u201d was not an unambiguous exercise of his right to counsel; that the defendant initiated further conversation with his remark that he would talk to the officers if he was not under arrest; that Trooper Loiselle\u2019s statement that the defendant was not under arrest was a truthful statement and \u201cwas not a ploy\u201d; and that the defendant was not under arrest. Last, the judge stated, \u201cI find no evidence that [the defendant] suffered any mental condition which rendered his confessions involuntary. Trial counsel chose to suggest this issue without psychiatric testimony. Psychiatric testimony may be admissible at the trial addressed to the issue of the voluntariness of the statement.\u201d Trial counsel objected to the judge\u2019s admission of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>The defendant\u2019s appellate counsel challenges the judge\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was not in custody when he was questioned at MCI, Concord. Recognizing that the decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larkin, supra, </em>poses an obstacle to this contention, he asks that the <em>Larkin </em>decision be overruled. He further argues that the judge \u201cerred in concluding that [the defendant] initiated further questioning after first mentioning his desire to speak with an attorney.\u201d Alternatively, the defendant\u2019s appellate counsel argues that the judge erred in admitting the defendant\u2019s statement because it was involuntary. In support of this argument, the defendant contends that the statement was involuntary because he provided the statement in the absence of counsel after having requested counsel, and because he possessed a \u201cpsychological disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">We need not dwell extensively on the <em>Larkin </em>point. The <em>Larkin </em>decision represents the general rule that \u201cMiranda warnings are only necessary where one is the subject of \u2018custody and official interrogation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larkin, supra </em>at 432, quoting <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>496 U.S. 292, 297 (1990). The mere fact that a person is incarcerated does not automatically render that person \u201cin custody\u201d for Miranda purposes. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larkin, supra </em>at 434-435, and cases cited. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>163 F.3d 499, 502 (8th Cir. 1998), and cases cited (stating that other Federal courts have similar rule that \u201c[t]he mere fact of incarceration does not ipso facto render an interrogation custodial\u201d). Rather, in such circumstances, it must be determined, from the totality of the circumstances, \u201cwhether the prisoner would reasonably believe himself to be in custody beyond that imposed by the confines of ordinary prison life.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larkin, supra </em>at 435, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Margolies, </em>125 Misc. 2d 1033, 1041 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1984). \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of proving custody.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larkin, supra </em>at 432. The judge\u2019s finding, that the defendant was not in custody when questioned, is consistent with the <em>Larkin </em>decision and is supported by the record. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Larkin, supra </em>at 435-436 &amp; nn.6, 7. The defendant\u2019s arguments to the contrary, that he was in custody because, in contrast to <em>Larkin, </em>\u201cthere was no evidence that the defendant was told \u2018that he did not have to meet with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the troopers at all,\u2019 \u201d and that there was no evidence that the defendant \u201ccould end the interview at any time by signaling a correction[] officer in sight at all times,\u201d ignore the fact that the defendant bears the burden to prove that he was in custody. The defendant did not proffer any evidence that he had been forced to meet with the officers, nor did he proffer any evidence that he was not able to end the interview. Nevertheless, the defendant\u2019s argument fails at its inception, because, even if we assume that the defendant was in custody when he was questioned, the judge expressly found, with support in the evidence, that Miranda warnings were given, understood by the defendant, and knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Although the defendant correctly notes that, in accordance with <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 484-485 (1981), once an accused invokes the right to counsel, he cannot be \u201csubject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police,\u201d he overlooks the significance of the judge\u2019s finding, which was supported by the record, that the defendant never invoked the right to counsel, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandile, </em>397 Mass. 410, 412 (1986). \u201cInvocation of the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel \u2018requires, at a minimum, some statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney.\u2019 . . . But if a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect <em>might </em>be invoking the right to counsel, our precedents do not require the cessation of questioning\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judge, </em>420 Mass. 433, 450 (1995), quoting <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 459 (1994). The judge correctly concluded that the defendant\u2019s request for an attorney was not unambiguous or unequivocal; rather, it was qualified on a circumstance that had not occurred, namely, his arrest. This determination obviates the need to address the defendant\u2019s arguments concerning whether he initiated further questioning by the police, and whether his statement was involuntary because it was obtained after he invoked the right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>As to the defendant\u2019s claim that his \u201cpsychological disability\u201d rendered his statement involuntary, trial counsel did not present any such evidence at the pretrial evidentiary hearing. Rather, it was only during the defendant\u2019s presentation of his case at trial that he proffered evidence on this issue, namely, testimony from his expert witness who had performed a psychological evaluation of the defendant. Whether the defendant\u2019s \u201cpsychological disability\u201d affected, or did not affect, the voluntariness of the July, 1998, statement, was properly left for the jury\u2019s determination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 149-150, cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vazquez, </em>387 Mass. 96, 100 (1982) (concluding that mentally impaired person may waive Miranda rights and provide voluntary statement). There was evidence at trial that undercut the defendant\u2019s claim of a \u201cpsychological disability,\u201d and that evidence supported the Commonwealth\u2019s claim that the statement was the product of a rational mind, made voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">2. We next discuss the claims of prosecutorial misconduct. For the reasons explained below, we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the three alleged acts of prosecutorial misconduct, considered as a whole, rise to the level of prejudicial error warranting relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">(a) The prosecutor called Lieutenant Kenneth F. Martin, a certified bloodstain pattern and crime scene analyst of the State police, as a rebuttal witness. During Lieutenant Martin\u2019s testimony, a mannequin was brought into the court room for Martin to illustrate how a certain knife wound had been inflicted in the victim\u2019s back. The exercise was intended to show that the killer was right-handed, not left-handed as claimed by the defendant. The prosecutor did not obtain prior approval to use the mannequin. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel objected to the prosecutor\u2019s demonstration and asked for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The judge properly denied the motion for a mistrial. The judge admonished the prosecutor for not obtaining approval to use the mannequin. Nevertheless, the judge allowed its use, and, in so doing, exercised his discretion appropriately. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>419 Mass. 750, 757 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">(b) The prosecutor was granted permission by the judge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>speak to Charles J. Walsh, a forensic specialist, who had been retained by the defense to give expert testimony. (The need for the interview was caused by the failure of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel to comply reasonably with discovery obligations.) During a voir dire concerning the content of Walsh\u2019s testimony, Walsh indicated that the prosecutor told him that he (Walsh) would be invited to lecture at a local law school where the prosecutor\u2019s husband taught. Walsh also indicated that he had been reluctant, at one point, to testify for the defense. The suggestion now made by appellate counsel appears to be that the prosecutor had improperly attempted to influence Walsh.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The judge noted that the prosecutor\u2019s conversation with Walsh \u201ccertainly went beyond\u201d the judge\u2019s intentions. Walsh made it clear, however, that his initial reluctance to testify for the defense had nothing to do with the prosecutor. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 385, 387-388 (1994), citing <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>409 U.S. 95, 98 (1972). Walsh ultimately testified for the defendant. The defendant has not shown the loss of any material testimony because of any action by the prosecutor. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colantonio, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 299, 303 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">(c) In response to questioning on direct examination by the prosecutor, a State police forensic chemist testified that she cut out a portion of the victim\u2019s underwear containing a stain, and sent the portion to Cellmark Diagnostic laboratory for DNA testing. A further question to the chemist by the prosecutor, asking whether additional testing had been performed, presumably by the defense, on a portion of the underwear sample that had been preserved for possible inspection by the defense, was met by an objection and a motion for a mistrial by trial counsel. The objection and motion were based on the contention that the prosecutor was improperly suggesting to the jury that the defense had an obligation to present favorable evidence as to the retained sample if such evidence existed. The judge sustained the objection to the prosecutor\u2019s question and denied the motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, </em>389 Mass. 216, 223 (1983). In the sidebar conference held on the objection and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>the motion, the prosecutor gave a good faith reason for asking the question. In any event, the question never was answered. Also, any improper suggestion contained in the prosecutor\u2019s question was cured by the judge, averting any prejudice to the defendant, as he promptly instructed the jury that there was no obligation on the part of the defendant to establish his innocence or to present evidence, and that any suggestion implicit in the prosecutor\u2019s last question was improper. Further, the jury were instructed both before trial commenced, and before they began deliberations, that the defendant is presumed innocent and does not have to prove his innocence, and that the questions posed by counsel are not evidence. The jury are presumed to follow the judge\u2019s instructions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>435 Mass. 722, 732 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">3. The defendant contends that the judge erred in admitting the opinion testimony of an analyst from Cellmark Diagnostics laboratory, and that this erroneous admission of expert testimony, coupled with \u201cother errors committed at trial,\u201d requires a new trial. The analyst offered her opinion that, based on statistical frequencies,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cno one other than [the defendant] is the donor of the DNA obtained from the sperm fraction of the vaginal swabs [of the victim].\u201d After the witness stated her opinion, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel objected and moved to strike her testimony. The judge overruled the objection, stating that the ultimate issue for the jury was whether the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant killed the victim, not whether the defendant was the donor of sperm found inside the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">There was no error. The judge correctly noted that the expert\u2019s testimony did not touch on the ultimate issue in the case. Nor did the expert offer an opinion as to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>419 Mass. 366, 375 (1995). The defendant\u2019s trial counsel was free to cross-examine the expert, or adduce rebuttal evidence, to establish that the DNA testing performed could not conclusively establish the donor of the sperm. That he did not apparently was a strategy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>decision made in light of the defendant\u2019s admission that he had had intercourse with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">4.

After the judge decided to conduct a pretrial evidentiary hearing on the issue, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel called only one witness to testify, State Trooper William Loiselle. At trial, however, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel called his expert to testify. In the absence of any evidence of involuntariness, which was the situation in this case prior to trial, the judge was under no obligation to conduct a pretrial evidentiary hearing.
