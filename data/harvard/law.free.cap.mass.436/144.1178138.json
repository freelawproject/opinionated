L. c. 55A, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. (clean elections law), was approved overwhelmingly by the people, under the initiative provisions of art. 48, The Initiative, V, \u00a7 1, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. See St. 1998, c. 395 (inserting G. L. c. 55A and amending related statutes). The law creates a system that allows electoral candidates for Massachusetts State or Statewide offices<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who, among other requirements, limit the amount and sources of private campaign contributions they accept, to receive public campaign funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-15\">Because the clean elections law was enacted by popular initiative, it engages art. 48, which provides that \u201cif a law approved by the people is not repealed, the general court shall raise by taxation or otherwise and shall appropriate such money as may be necessary to carry such law into effect.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To date, the clean elections law has not been repealed, nor has the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Court of Massachusetts (the Legislature) appropriated any money to carry it into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">In October, 2001, with the 2002 Massachusetts election season already under way, supporters of the clean elections law commenced an action in the county court under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1, against the Director of the Office of Campaign and Political Finance (director) and the Secretary of the Commonwealth (Secretary). They sought a declaration that any Massachusetts State or Statewide election held without access to the funds mandated by the clean elections law would violate both art. 48 and the clean elections law. They also sought permanent injunc-tive relief ordering the director to provide public campaign funds to all candidates entitled to such funds, and barring the Secretary from holding any elections unless and until such funds had been made available to all eligible candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The plaintiffs promptly sought a preliminary injunction in the county court, which the defendants opposed, to order the director to distribute public funds immediately to qualified clean elections candidates.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Noting that no candidate had yet been certified under the clean elections law to receive public funds, a single justice denied the motion solely on the issue of irreparable harm. But see note 7, <em>infra. </em>She then reserved and reported the matter to the full court on an expedited schedule, on the plaintiffs\u2019 corrected complaint, a stipulation in lieu of the defendants\u2019 answer, and a statement of agreed facts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>quently, one plaintiff, a candidate for Governor, was certified by the director as a clean elections candidate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">We are asked to decide whether the director, the executive agent charged with implementing the clean elections statute, has any present duty to distribute public funds to certified candidates for electoral office where the Legislature has not appropriated any monies for disbursement to such candidates. See G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 42. That question requires us to examine the scope of the Legislature\u2019s duties under art. 48 after a law has been enacted by initiative, an issue of first impression. The constitutional command is plain and unambiguous. If a measure properly enacted by the people is not repealed, the Legislature \u201cshall\u201d raise by taxation or otherwise and \u201cshall\u201d appropriate funds to \u201ccarry such law into effect.\u201d Art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 2. Here, however, the measure enacted by the people provides that the distribution of funds to qualified candidates is \u201csubject to appropriation.\u201d G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 8 (a). We must therefore also decide whether the terms of the clean elections statute operate to relieve the Legislature of its obligations under art. 48. We hold that the clean elections initiative was validly enacted into law by the people of Massachusetts, and that nothing in that law relieves the Legislature of its constitutional duties under art. 48.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Only after we have delineated the Legislature\u2019s duties under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>art. 48 can we consider what relief, if any, is available to any plaintiff. For the reasons we describe below, we conclude that plaintiff Tolman has suffered a cognizable injury under the clean elections statute. That injury arose as a result of affirmative actions taken by the director to enable candidates to participate in the clean elections certification process, including certifying Tolman as a clean elections candidate. See G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 5. In consequence of being certified, Tolman is owed $811,050, and is entitled to a judgment in his favor in that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">As to the broader relief sought by the plaintiffs, we conclude that they are not entitled to declarations against either the director or the Secretary. The drastic remedy of enjoining the Secretary from conducting all Massachusetts State elections, including all those elections where there may be no candidates who are or intend to be clean elections candidates, is not warranted. Injunctive relief requiring the director to provide full funding to all qualified clean elections candidates is similarly inappropriate. Because the director has no clean elections funds to distribute and no authority on his own to reach those funds, he cannot be enjoined to distribute them.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">We summarize the salient facts from the statement of agreed facts and other undisputed material of record. The plaintiffs are electoral candidates, Massachusetts voters, and organizations supportive of the clean elections law. The defendant director is an official of the executive branch of the Massachusetts government; among his statutory duties are certifying candidates, distributing monies from the clean elections fund, and promulgating rules and regulations under the clean elections law. See G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 8, 14. The office of Secretary, also a part of the executive branch, was created by the Massachusetts Constitution. See Part II 2, c. 2, \u00a7 4, arts. 1 and 2, of the Massachusetts Constitution, and art. 17 of the Amendments to the Constitution. The constitutional and statutory duties of the Secretary include administering the Massachusetts election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>laws. E.g., art. 48, General Provisions, IV, as amended by art. 74, \u00a7 4, of the Amendments (Information for Voters) (printing and distribution to voters of initiative or referendum petition and related documents); G. L. c. 53, \u00a7 7 (promulgation of regulations designed to achieve and maintain accuracy, uniformity, and security from forgery and fraud in the nomination certification process).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The present controversy arises in the midst of the 2002 Massachusetts election season. The primary campaign period, from March 31, 2001, to September 17, 2002, has already begun. See St. 2000, c. 159, \u00a7 325, an emergency act, approved July 28, 2000, and made effective July 1, 2000, St. 2000, c. 159, \u00a7 498. The general election campaign period begins September 18, 2002. The election will decide, among other State offices, the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, who each serve four-year terms, and State Senators and State Representatives, who each serve two-year terms.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The statute at the heart of this controversy, the clean elections law, was approved at the November, 1998, general election by a majority of Massachusetts voters in every el\u00e9ctoral district, and approved Statewide by a ratio of two to one.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under the law, candidates for State or Statewide office, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>who choose to participate in the clean elections system agree, among other things, to limit the amount of their primary and general election campaign contributions and expenditures. In return, once they are certified by the director, these candidates receive a substantial amount of their allowable campaign expenditures \u2014 approximately 80% \u2014 from the public treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The clean elections law is funded by the clean elections fund, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 42, also created as part of the successful initiative petition. See St. 1998, c. 395, \u00a7 3 (amending G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 42). The clean elections fund presently contains approximately $23 million. That sum was accumulated in large part from transfers of $10 million in each of fiscal years 2000 and 2001 from the general fund to the clean elections fund in annual budget bills passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor. These funds were expressly set aside to be available for the 2002 State elections. See St. 1999, c. 127, \u00a7 2, line item 0920-0302; St. 2000, c. 159, \u00a7 361.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Other sources of revenue for the clean elections fund include money contributed by individual taxpayers through voluntary checkoffs on their State income tax returns, see G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 6C, and G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 42; money transferred from a previous Massachusetts public campaign fund, see St. 1998, c. 395, \u00a7\u00a7 3-5; and certain fines, penalties, and other revenues, see G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">That money has been set aside for a particular fund, here $23 million for the clean elections fund, does not in the ordinary course make these funds available to the director (or anyone else in the executive branch) for distribution, because setting aside money in a fund does not, without more, amount to an \u201cappropriation\u201d to executive officials. See <em>Gilligan </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>413 Mass. 14, 17 (1992). Other steps are required. Specifically, the clean elections law obligates the director to determine annually the amount of funds required for the law\u2019s \u201cfull implementation.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 14 <em>(d). </em>Once he makes that determination, he must then make a request to his designated \u201c[b]udget director,\u201d see G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 1, to include the required amount in the Commonwealth\u2019s annual budget. See G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 14 (d); G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 3. The director has complied with the statutory requirements to request clean elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>tions funds for candidates running for election in the 2002 election cycle, but the Legislature has not appropriated any monies to the clean elections fund.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The process of qualifying for clean elections funding is detailed and specific. Candidates become eligible to receive public campaign funds on certification by the director. See G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 8. The certification process begins during a \u201c[qualifying period.\u201d This is a period prior to State elections during which each prospective candidate must collect a certain number of qualifying contributions of from five to one hundred dollars from voters who sign a form stating that they wish the participant to be eligible for clean elections funding. See G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The minimum number of qualifying contributions that a candidate must garner before he or she has access to public campaign funds is modest; it ranges from 200 for candidates for State Representative to 6,000 for candidates for Governor. See G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">During the election cycle,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and before the end of the qualifying period, a candidate must also file with the director a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>\u201cdeclaration of intent\u201d to comply with the terms of the clean elections law. G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4. Once the director certifies the candidate, the clean elections law provides that the \u201ccertified candidate shall be eligible\u201d to receive distributions from the Massachusetts clean elections fund. See G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7. The director shall then, \u201csubject to appropriation,\u201d pay money to certified candidates from the clean elections fund in specified amounts that depend on the office sought and the stage of the election, and at specified times. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7, 8(a).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Only one plaintiff, Tolxnan, a candidate for Governor, has been certified by the director as entitled to receive public campaign funds for his gubernatorial primary campaign.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Under the statute he is presently entitled to $811,050 in public campaign funds. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>Because the Legislature has not appropriated any money for use by the director for the 2002 election cycle, see note 13, supra, neither the $20 million previously placed in the clean elections fund by the Legislature, see note 11, <em>supra, </em>nor money voluntarily contributed to the fund through income tax \u201ccheckoffs,\u201d nor any other source of revenue is available for the director to distribute to Tolman.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">By electing to participate in this system and to receive public funds, a clean elections candidate voluntarily agrees to significant restrictions on his or her freedom to wage a political contest. See G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 1 (defining \u201c[ajllowable contribution\u201d); G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 7A (a) (1). See also Part n.D, <em>infra. </em>Clean elections candidates must drastically limit the amount of \u201csoft money\u201d they could otherwise accept from nonparty-affiliated political committees interested in influencing the election or future legislation. Compare G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 10, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>G. L. c. 55, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 6A. Without the expectation of receiving funding from the public treasury, few, if any, candidates are likely to choose, or to choose to continue, to abide by the stringent limitations of the clean elections law. To do so against monied opponents might well be futile and quixotic. Candidates who lack private sources of adequate funding for their campaigns are likely to drop out of the election entirely. See <em>League of Women Voters of Mass. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>425 Mass. 424, 429 (1997). See also note 5, <em>supra. </em>Thus, the current situation, in which the clean elections law has not been repealed but no money has been appropriated to fund it, does more than disadvantage clean elections candidates. It frustrates the will of the majority of the people who elected to provide an alternative, assertedly more democratic system of campaign financing for Massachusetts electoral offices than the current private financing scheme. See Part II.C, <em>infra. </em>We turn now to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the director and the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Because our interpretation of the provisions of art. 48 concerning appropriations bears on our reading of the clean elections law, and the director\u2019s obligations thereunder, we consider first the art. 48 question.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">We are mindful that art. 48 establishes a \u201cpeople\u2019s process.\u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>371 Mass. 195, 199 (1976). It gives the people of Massachusetts the opportunity \u201cto enact statutes regardless of legislative opposition,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> a means by which the people \u201ccould move forward on measures which they deemed necessary and desirable without the danger of their will being thwarted by legislative action.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Citizens for a Competi-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>five Mass. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>413 Mass. 25, 30 (1992). We construe art. 48 to effectuate its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In relevant part, art. 48 states: \u201cNo measure that . . . makes a specific appropriation of money from the treasury of the commonwealth, shall be proposed by an initiative petition; but if a law approved by the people is not repealed, the general court shall raise by taxation or otherwise and shall appropriate such money as may be necessary to carry such law into effect.\u201d Art.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 2. We have on several occasions been asked to decide whether an initiative petition is a \u201cspecific appropriation of money from the treasury of the commonwealth,\u201d prohibited by art. 48 from being placed before the people. See, e.g., <em>Mazzone </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>432 Mass. 515, 522-523 (2000); <em>Gilligan </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>413 Mass. 14, 17 (1992); <em>Associated Indus. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>413 Mass. 1 (1992); <em>Tax Equity Alliance for Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>401 Mass. 310 (1987); <em>Slama </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>384 Mass. 620 (1981). In contrast, we have not previously considered a claim arising because a law \u201capproved by the people\u201d has not been repealed and the Legislature has not \u201cappropriate[d] such money as may be necessary to carry such law into effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Article 48 is unambiguous. A law enacted by initiative may be repealed.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Such a law may also be amended by the Legislature, subject to the veto power of the Governor and to the right of referendum by petition. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>But absent repeal, the Legislature \u201cshall raise by taxation or otherwise and shall appropriate such money as may be necessary to carry such law into effect.\u201d The constitutional command is clear. For as long as a law enacted by way of initiative has not been repealed, the Constitution requires that the Legislature appropriate the funds necessary to its operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Our acknowledgment of the Legislature\u2019s duty under art. 48 regarding laws passed by initiative comports with the intent of the framers of art. 48 as described in the proceedings of the 1917-1918 constitutional convention in which the amendment was forged. Article 48 was debated, framed, and adopted during the heyday of a national movement to give citizens more control over lawmaking by amending State Constitutions to add initiative and referendum provisions. See generally D.B. Magleby, Direct Legislation: Voting on Ballot Propositions in the United States 20-25 (1984). The debate over whether to add initiative and referendum provisions to the Massachusetts Constitution was the focal point of much of the 1917-1918 constitutional convention, and the subject of widespread press attention and public interest. See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>357 Mass. 564, 571-573 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The delegates did not take the issue lightly. Before they considered the question of the initiative at the general convention, they delegated to a committee on the Initiative and Referendum the task of studying the question and making recommendations. See 2 Debates in the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention 1917-1918, at 3 (1918) (2 Debates). The committee held public hearings and examined the initiative amendments enacted by other States. These included examples of \u201cdirect initiatives\u201d \u2014 that is, laws enabling the people to bypass the legislative branch entirely and place measures directly on the ballot \u2014 and \u201cindirect initiatives,\u201d which required action by the Legislature before a \u201cpopular\u201d law could take effect. See generally Magleby, <em>supra </em>at 35-40. By a bare majority, and over written objections from the minority, the Committee proposed that Massachusetts adopt an initiative provision and recommended that it take the indirect form. 2 Debates, <em>supra </em>at 3-16.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The convention delegates did indeed adopt the indirect form of initiative. But the precise scope and wording of the proposal that would become art. 48 was subjected to thorough and hot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>debate, and the committee\u2019s original draft amendment was revised substantially. Among the flashpoints was whether to change the proposed amendment as it was originally submitted to prevent the people from enacting laws that required the expenditure of money from the public treasury. The debate on this issue mirrored a larger tension throughout the convention, and throughout much of the Commonwealth at that time, between the people\u2019s concern over their government\u2019s responsiveness, and the people\u2019s fears of being tyrannized by a process that would give free rein to the majority\u2019s whims. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Secretary of the </em>Commonwealth, 428 Mass. 82, 84 (1998), quoting <em>Hurst </em>v. <em>State Ballot Comm\u2019n, </em>427 Mass. 825, 828 (1998) (\u201c[t]he State Constitutional Convention of 1917-1918 sought a balance between competing impulses toward direct versus representative democracy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The record of the constitutional convention reveals that delegate Robert Luce moved to qualify the original initiative proposal by adding the following language to the list of subjects to be excluded from the initiative power: \u201cand no law calling for an appropriation of money from the treasury of the Commonwealth, except for purposes incidental to the administration thereof.\u201d 2 Debates, <em>supra </em>at 815. Mr. Luce and his supporters claimed that the amendment was necessary to prevent demagoguery, and in particular the taking of the property of one group of citizens by another. See <em>id. </em>at 817-818. See also <em>id. </em>at 820 (remarks of Mr. Buttrick); <em>id. </em>at 825 (remarks of Mr. Montague); <em>id. </em>at 829 (remarks of Mr. Parkman). Mr. Luce stated that he did not intend the amendment to preclude the expenditure of funds for salaries and other necessities \u201cincidental\u201d to a law enacted by initiative. \u201cWhat I object to is the possibility of largess, of what was meant by the Latin words, <em>panem et cir-censes, </em>\u2018bread and the games.\u2019 . . . That I do not want demagogues to offer to the people of Massachusetts as a bait for votes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817 (remarks of Mr. Luce). Demagoguery by initiative could only be avoided by preventing the people\u2019s \u201cactual attack upon the treasury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 822 (remarks of Mr. Churchill).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Opponents, however, saw Mr. Luce\u2019s proposal as gutting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>reformist purpose of the initiative. One delegate accused Mr. Luce and his supporters of introducing a \u201cweasel\u201d amendment that would render any reform measures enacted by the people \u201cabsolutely useless\u201d <em>id. </em>at 817, 818 (remarks of Mr. Creamer). (Mr. Luce vigorously denied the charge. <em>Id. </em>at 822.) See <em>id. </em>at 823 (remarks of Mr. Walker). Other delegates were confused about Mr. Luce\u2019s meaning of the word \u201cincidental.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 817 (remarks of Mr. Brown); <em>id. </em>at 816 (remarks of Mr. Harri-man); <em>id. </em>at 820 (remarks of Mr. Lomasney) (\u201cI say, sir, we should state clearly what we mean to restrict [the people] to, but not to use the word \u2018incidental\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Perhaps because of its vagueness, Mr. Luce\u2019s amendment was defeated. The following day, it was reconsidered. The record suggests that the delegates over all were in a mood to compromise. Deliberations moved from debate about demagoguery to talk of practicalities. See <em>id. </em>at 825 (remarks of Mr. Montague). Members of the convention considered how they might balance the need, on the one hand, to prevent \u201cany combination or interest in the Commonwealth [from] asking for a specific appropriation of money for a certain purpose, in the hope that with the purpose and the money being voted on together one would carry the other by,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 826 (remarks of Mr. McAnamey), and the need, on the other hand, to allow the people to enact reform laws they thought necessary to the general welfare, even if those laws required the expenditure of public funds. See <em>id. </em>at 833 (remarks of Mr. Walker) (\u201c[T]he reserve power of the people to make an appropriation when the Legislature neglects or refuses to make one must reside in the people, or else all the teeth are taken out of the initiative and referendum. That is obvious\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In the end, the delegates determined that, by carving out from the initiative powers only those laws making a <em>\u201cspecific </em>appropriation of money from the treasury of the Commonwealth,\u201d art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 2, they could preserve the Legislature\u2019s power to appropriate money from the treasury while giving the people power to enact meaningful reform legislation in the face of legislative recalcitrance, even though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>such reforms would necessarily require the expenditure of public funds. <em>Id. </em>at 833.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Thus, the \u201cspecific\u201d appropriations exclusion ultimately adopted by the constitutional convention delegates narrowed considerably the appropriations restrictions Mr. Luce had originally proposed. This more limited appropriations exclusion preserves the people\u2019s right, through the initiative process, to enact reform legislation, the implementation of which will require the appropriation and expenditure of public funds. The initiative power is, accordingly, far from toothless.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The delegates also added to the original draft of art. 48 a provision making it constitutionally incumbent on the Legislature to appropriate funds (if necessary by raising taxes) to implement any law the people chose to enact. The delegates explicitly chose to bind the Legislature to make monies available to \u201ccarry into effect\u201d any successful initiative petition unless the law is repealed. Repeal was the chosen safety valve, with its attendant consequences of democratic accountability to the voters; the people would learn from the records of any vote which of their legislators voted to repeal the law and which did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">In stark contrast to the spirited debate over the \u201cspecific appropriation\u201d amendment, the \u201crepeal\u201d or \u201cappropriate\u201d provision was added to art. 48 with no recorded debate. See <em>id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>948. Because the convention delegates could be a contentious and polarized lot, we may reasonably infer that this easy passage shows that the delegates viewed the provision as clear and uncontroversial. Without disturbing the Legislature\u2019s prerogative to make specific appropriations, they proposed, and the people approved, a constitutional amendment that required the Legislature to be directly accountable to the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Against this backdrop, we do not construe the provision that the Legislature \u201cshall appropriate such money as may be necessary to carry such law into effect\u201d as merely referencing the Legislature\u2019s discretionary authority to appropriate funds in the normal exercise of its powers. The dissent suggests that this language does nothing more than confirm that it is the Legislature\u2019s job to appropriate funds, and that the Legislature\u2019s customary unfettered discretion over whether and how much money to appropriate is equally unfettered in the case of a law passed by way of the people\u2019s initiative. See Appendix, <em>post </em>at 181-185. That interpretation overlooks the additional language providing that the Legislature \u201cshall raise by taxation or otherwise\u201d the necessary funds, and shall as well \u201cappropriate\u201d those funds. Under the dissent\u2019s interpretation of art. 48 that language becomes mere surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The dissent\u2019s interpretation would also render the \u201cspecific appropriations\u201d exclusion superfluous. If, as the dissent contends, the Legislature always retains full discretion whether to appropriate funds for any law enacted by way of initiative, then it is impossible for any initiative ever to comprise an excluded \u201cspecific appropriations.\u201d We have held in other cases that the insertion of the term \u201csubject, to appropriation\u201d in a proposed initiative petition saves what would otherwise be an excluded \u201cspecific appropriation\u201d; such language effectively provides that the Legislature has the discretion whether to appropriate funds or not. See <em>Associated Indus. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, 413 </em>Mass. 1, 7 (1992). If all appropriations for measures enacted by way of initiative are always a matter of unfettered legislative discretion, they are all \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d and there can be no such thing as an excluded \u201cspecific appropriation.\u201d We do not believe that the delegates\u2019 extended debate on this controversial issue resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>in a superfluous addition to the list of subjects excluded from the initiative process. Rather, the delegates agreed to exclude only \u201cspecific\u201d appropriations from the initiative process precisely because, if passed, any initiative measure that is not a \u201cspecific appropriation\u201d must be funded by the Legislature, unless repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The more difficult issue before us is the significance of the language in the clean elections statute itself providing that the distribution of any clean elections funds is \u201csubject to appropriation.\u201d G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 8 (a). Specifically, does that provision express the people\u2019s decision to give the Legislature the unfettered discretion to decide whether and in what amount to appropriate funds for the clean elections program, notwithstanding the otherwise clear command of art. 48?</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The parties in this case agree that the \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d language was inserted in the initiative at the recommendation of an assistant attorney general to preclude any contention that the initiative was a \u201cspecific appropriation.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> A \u201cspecific appropriation\u201d may not be made by way of initiative, and the insertion of the words \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d excludes any possibility that the initiative is an impermissible \u201cspecific appropriation.\u201d Of course, if such language were necessary to the constitutional validity of the initiative \u2014 in other words, if the initiative would, without such language, constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\u201cspecific appropriation\u201d \u2014 we would have to give such language its full, literal effect, restoring to the Legislature the discretion whether to make such an appropriation. On the other hand, if the language \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d were not necessary to prevent the clean elections initiative from being an unconstitutional \u201cspecific appropriation,\u201d then we would have to assess the effect of this language as intended by those who enacted it. We must, therefore, first decide whether the clean elections law, in the absence of the \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d language, would make a \u201cspecific appropriation\u201d of public funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The essence of a \u201cspecific appropriation\u201d under art. 48 is that money is segregated from the public coffers to be used for a targeted, narrow purpose. See <em>Associated Indus. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra </em>at 5-6; <em>Slama </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>384 Mass. 620, 626 (1981). In considering whether a measure makes a \u201cspecific appropriation,\u201d it is immaterial whether the segregated funds are raised by a targeted tax, e.g., <em>Gilligan </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>413 Mass. 14, 17 (1992) (proposing new tax on tobacco products); <em>Associated Indus. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra </em>(proposing new tax on oil and hazardous waste), or are taken from general revenues, e.g., <em>Slama </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>(distribution of taxes from general revenues to municipalities), or whether the measure in question sets apart an exact dollar amount. <em>Id. </em>The crucial determinant of a specific appropriation is that its \u201cdirect purpose\u201d is \u201cto seize upon all the revenue received from the designated sources and to appropriate it <em>permanently </em>to a specified public use\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 626, quoting <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>297 Mass. 577, 580 (1937). It is money that may not be reached by the Legislature (or any other entity or person) except for its specified purpose. It is in this sense inviolable.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The clean elections law does not specifically appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>public money. It does not isolate a specific sum or percentage of money from the public treasury or from special taxation for permanent and certain use for a narrow purpose. It does not \u201cremove[] public monies\u201d from the Legislature\u2019s control by \u201ccompelling] the expenditure of public funds.\u201d <em>Associated Indus. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra </em>at 6. The clean elections law merely provides that, if, in any election cycle, a candidate becomes certified by operation of the clean elections law, then that candidate is entitled to receive such clean elections funds as are designated in the statute. See G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 8. Absent from this statutory scheme is the rigid, inflexible, and permanent mandate to disburse public funds for a discrete purpose that we struck down in <em>Slama </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra. </em>There, a proposed initiative that would have set aside a certain percentage of public revenues for use by municipalities as they chose violated art. 48\u2019s ban on specific appropriations measures because the proposed law would <em>\u201c{permanently </em>... lay hold of and appropriate to a <em>single </em>public use <em>all the revenue </em>received from one source of taxation\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 625, quoting <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>297 Mass. 577, 581 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">In contrast, the clean elections law bears a closer resemblance to the contingent and flexible tax credit measure that passed art. 48 scrutiny in <em>Tax Equity Alliance for Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>401 Mass. 310 (1987). There we held that a law enacted by initiative that provided for tax credits did not violate the art. 48 ban on specific appropriations where the issuance of credits depended, among other things, on over-all State revenues and individuals\u2019 ability to qualify for the credits. See <em>Mazzone </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>423 Mass. 515 (2000). Here, too, the disbursement of clean elections funds is not fixed but depends on numerous factors that cannot be accurately predicted. A specific amount of money is not permanently alienated from the general treasury. The mere fact that the clean elections law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u201cwill require the appropriation of money from the treasury of the Commonwealth to carry it into effect does not, of itself, bring [the] law within the scope of the [art. 48] prohibition\u201d on specific appropriations. <em>Id. </em>at 524 n.8, quoting <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>309 Mass. 571, 583 (1941). See <em>Gilligan </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 17.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In the last analysis, the clean elections law does not restrict the Legislature\u2019s power and discretion over appropriations to any greater extent than is inherent in the operation of art. 48\u2019s mandate that the Legislature \u201cshall appropriate\u201d funds for a law passed by initiative that it has not repealed. The statute neither bars the Legislature from transferring monies by appropriation out of the fund, see <em>id. </em>at 18-19, nor prescribes the precise source from which funds necessary to carry the law into effect must be taken. The clean elections statute, as a law passed by way of initiative, merely requires that, while the statute remains on the books, the Legislature must somehow provide the funds necessary to implement it. Thus, the insertion of the words \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d was not in fact required in order to avoid the \u201cspecific appropriation\u201d exclusion of art. 48: even absent the phrase \u201csubject to appropriation,\u201d the clean elections law would not constitute a \u201cspecific appropriation\u201d under art. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">While the insertion of the term \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d in the clean elections law was not <em>required </em>to avoid exclusion of that law from the initiative process, we must still determine whether the term has the effect of giving the Legislature discretion to withhold appropriations from the clean elections fund in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the absence of a repeal of the statute. For nothing in art. 48 (or elsewhere in our laws) prevents the people from enacting a reform statute that itself relieves the Legislature of what would otherwise be a constitutional obligation to appropriate funds. If a statute does so, the Legislature is free to take no action on the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">We interpret a statute \u201caccording to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). Accord <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>429 Mass. 324, 326 (1999). We ordinarily interpret a statute to give every word effect, but we \u201cwill not adopt a literal construction of a statute if the consequences of such construction are absurd or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, 336 (1982). Here, it is the voters of the Commonwealth who enacted this law. They are the legislators whose intent we must discern; we must interpret the clean elections law to effectuate their \u201cobject\u201d and \u201cpurpose.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, supra </em>at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Beyond doubt, the intent of the drafters of the Massachusetts clean elections law was to improve Massachusetts government by enacting a public finance scheme that would, among other things, allow potential public servants to eschew monied interests in financing electoral campaigns and to allow citizens who otherwise could not afford to run for public office the opportunity to do so.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The Findings and Declarations that serve as a preamble to the law declare that the law means to \u201cenhance democracy\u201d by \u201creducing] the disproportionate and deleterious influence of large contributors [on electoral politics], and restoring] the rights of citizens of all backgrounds to equal and meaningful participation in the democratic process . . . halt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>[ing] the escalating costs of elections . . . diminishing] the public perception of [electoral] corruption . . . eliminating] the danger of corruption caused by the private financing of elections campaigns . . . [and] creating] genuine opportunities for qualified residents of the Commonwealth to ran for [S]tate office, and encourage more competitive elections.\u201d See St. 1998, c. 395, \u00a7 1 (b) (1). Because the fundamental premise of the clean elections law is that government is more responsive to the people to the extent that its chosen representatives are free from the influence of those providing financial largesse, it is clear that for the drafters of the clean elections law actual public financing of candidates is the heart and soul of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The record establishes that the Massachusetts citizens who voted to enact the clean elections law in the face of the Legislature\u2019s failure to do so considered the clean elections law to be a reform measure. In voting to enact the law, they approved and adopted the goals and purposes recited in the Findings and Declarations, and they intended that the clean elections law further those aspirations without legislative interference. The parties have included in the record a copy of the Official Massachusetts Information for Voters: 1998 Ballot Question (Information), which was published and distributed to all Massachusetts voters by the Secretary, as required by art. 48. See art. 48, General Provisions, III and IV, as amended by arts. 74 and 108. See also art. 48, The Initiative, III, \u00a7 1. The Information included the Attorney General\u2019s summary, the majority report of the Joint Committee on Ways and Means, and arguments in favor of and against the law. See Information, <em>supra </em>at 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The constitutionally required Information, and the additional included arguments in favor of and against the law, made clear that proponents and opponents alike understood that if the clean elections law were enacted and candidates were certified, public funds would be expended to implement it. Proponents focused primarily on the pernicious role of private monies in a fair elections process: \u201cWealthy special interests have too much political influence. Campaigns cost too much money. Politicians spend too much time raising money instead of listening to vot\u00e9is. And good people can\u2019t afford to run for office.\u201d Op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>ponents were adamant that the proposed law would waste public money: \u201cThis petition would take taxpayer dollars and spend those dollars on private political campaigns. It would give public money to all political candidates for the purpose of purchasing campaign materials. The proposal would take millions of dollars from education, health care, child care, and public safety. . . . It will be very expensive and it is entirely unnecessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Neither of these arguments advised voters that if enacted, the law might not be funded.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Voters were expressly advised that the Legislature was opposed to the new measure. The Joint Committee, like the opponents, informed the voters that they objected to the law precisely because it would require spending public money. The law would \u201ccause an enormous increase in taxpayer dollars being spent on private political campaigns [and will] dramatically increase the costs to the public. ... If the supporters of this bill are correct, <em>the [LJegislature will have to spend approximately $56 million dollars in taxpayers\u2019 money . ... As legislators, we have two choices: vote to increase taxes or take away funding from other meaningful programs </em>such as education, childcare, affordable housing, public safety, and healthcare. We are uncomfortable with either choice.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>Nowhere did the Joint Committee suggest that, on passage of the initiative, the Legislature would still retain discretion to withhold funds from the clean elections program. And, where the Legislature\u2019s opposition to such a program was so clearly announced, we may safely conclude that voters in favor of the clean elections law did not intend to give the Legislature the power to thwart the program by depriving it of all funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The lone reference to the distribution of funds being \u201csubject to appropriation by the Legislature\u201d was in the Attorney General\u2019s summary of the law. Viewed in the context of the entire Information, in which advocates and proponents passionately argued the wisdom of providing public financing to candidates if the law were enacted, we do not view this single reference as evidence that, in enacting the clean elections law, the people intended to absolve the Legislature of its constitutional obligation to fund the statute so long as it was not repealed. To the contrary, it would produce an \u201cabsurd\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>\u201cunreasonable\u201d result to construe the clean elections law in a manner that gives to the Legislature the power to vitiate the measures in the law that were designed to reform the Legislature, among other State offices. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, supra </em>at 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In light of the evidence of record that the framers of the clean elections law and the voters who approved it intended to enact a viable public funding scheme, we conclude that nothing in the provisions of the clean elections statutes relieves the Legislature of its constitutional duties under art. 48 to appropriate funds to carry into effect a law passed by initiative that has not been repealed.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">It is the \u201cimperative duty\u201d of the judicial branch of government to say what the Constitution requires, when the question is properly presented. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>269 Mass. 503, 507 (1929). See <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). We have determined that art. 48 mandates that the Legislature \u201craise by taxation or otherwise\u201d and \u201cappropriate such money as may be necessary\u201d to carry the clean elections law into effect. We must now consider whether any plaintiff is entitled to any form of relief where such a statute has been lawfully enacted and has not been repealed, and where funds to carry it into effect have not been appropriated.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Not every violation of a legal right gives rise to a judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>remedy. See <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, supra. </em>In this case, however, one plaintiff, Tolman, has demonstrated a cognizable claim under the clean elections law. Tolman has been certified by the director as a clean elections candidate pursuant to G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 5. He has satisfied all of the relevant requirements of the clean elections law, and he continues to abide by its strictures. As a certified candidate, he is entitled to clean elections funds under G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 7 (a) (1), 8 (a) (1), and 13, which he has not received.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">We reach that conclusion by turning first, as always, to the text of the law. The clean elections statute is a complex transactional scheme that establishes an ongoing regulatory framework between the Commonwealth and clean elections candidates. The statute explicitly acknowledges that a clean elections process is of benefit to the Commonwealth. See St. 1998, c. 395, \u00a7 1 (Findings and Declarations). That is a policy judgment that the people are free to make. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leno, </em>415 Mass. 835, 841 (1993). The statute recognizes that in order for the Commonwealth to obtain the benefit of the clean elections law, it must provide an incentive to candidates to forgo the existing alternative of private funding, which, according to the statute\u2019s preamble, favors wealthy donors and unlimited campaign spending. See <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 39 (1976) (recognizing the candidates\u2019 right under First Amendment to the United States Constitution to unlimited campaign spending). That incentive is provided through the benefits of certification under G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 5. Through the certification process, the statute bargains adherence to the clean elections standards for the certainty of public campaign financing, distributed in set amounts and at clearly defined intervals. The director\u2019s implementation of the certification process and his certification of a candidate is an affirmative act of the Commonwealth that statutorily binds it to provide the benefit of the clean elections bargain. See G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 8 <em>(a) </em>(director \u201cshall\u201d distribute clean elections funds to certified candidates).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In this respect, the clean elections law is similar to other statutes under which we have found the Commonwealth liable for payment to a third party where that third party, to its own detriment, has fully complied with the statutory requirements \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>and the State has acknowledged or approved the compliance \u2014 such as to confer a direct benefit to the State pursuant to a statutory scheme promising payment for the benefit. See, e.g., <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>359 Mass. 206, 209 (1971) (where money was owed by executive agency \u201ceither on an actual or implied contract, or a statutory liability,\u201d agency became liable when private entity rendered services with agency\u2019s \u201cknowledge or approval, or in circumstances which bound it to pay for them\u201d). See also <em>Perkins Sch. for the Blind </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>383 Mass. 825, 828-829 (1981); <em>Springfield Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>350 Mass. 704, 707 (1966). Cf. <em>Boston Elevated Ry. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>310 Mass. 528, 548 (1942) (where statute provided license as inducement to company to build and operate railways at certain location within certain statutory provisions, license was \u201cbinding upon the Commonwealth\u201d and could not be revoked by subsequent statute \u201cat the pleasure of the Legislature\u201d). That the express language of G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 8 (a), makes distributions to clean elections candidates both mandatory and \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d does not vitiate the Commonwealth\u2019s payment obligations where a candidate has complied with the statute with the knowledge and approval of the director and has been certified by the director. The director\u2019s certification furthers the intent of the clean elections law and operates as a concession that Massachusetts is \u201ccarry[ing] [the clean elections] law into effect,\u201d as art. 48 requires in the absence of repeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The record is clear that, for Tolman, the successful quest for clean elections certification was not a theoretical exercise in civics but a concerted effort to obtain the benefits of the statute. He has attested in unchallenged affidavits that he adhered to the requirements of the clean elections law in order to be certified as a clean elections candidate, and thereby to receive clean elections funds.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Because of the director\u2019s conduct, both before and after the inception of this lawsuit, Tolman was able to maintain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>his drive for clean elections certification. The director took all possible steps to implement the statute, thereby permitting candidates to participate in the clean elections scheme. He promulgated numerous detailed regulations regarding clean elections certification, and has created forms for certification of applicants. See 970 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 5.00 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The director also has played a direct role in the certification process. On November 26, 2001, Tolman applied for certification, and the director accepted and reviewed his application. See G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 5 (d). On November 30, 2001, some six weeks after this lawsuit was filed, the director notified Tolman that he had been certified pursuant to G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 5. That same day, the director also notified the comptroller of the Commonwealth in writing that Tolman\u2019s application to become a certified candidate had been approved and that \u201ca distribution of $811,050 is required to be made [to Tolman] within five business days after certification,\u201d under G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7\u00a7 7 (a), 8 <em>(a) </em>(1), and 13. The director enclosed in his letter to the comptroller an official payment voucher in the amount of $811,050 to be processed in favor of Tolman, as the \u201cvendor,\u201d from the Massachusetts clean elections fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Tolman never received the clean elections funds that the director certified as due to him. The Commonwealth\u2019s failure to honor Tolman\u2019s voucher has caused him, and continues to cause him, harm that can only be redressed by payment to him of the funds the Commonwealth pledged. Cf. <em>Durant </em>v. <em>State, </em>456 Mich. 175, 209-210 (1997) (in absence of specific remedy in voter-enacted constitutional amendment requiring State to provide funding for special education and school lunches, court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>awarded school districts money judgments against State incident to declaratory relief under court rules).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The director may have had other options than those he chose. Had he doubted the viability of the clean elections law, or his authority to certify candidates in the absence of clean elections funding, he could have sought the opinion of the Attorney General or other appropriate counsel concerning his legal obligations. He could have filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a court\u2019s determination of his legal obligations in the absence of repeal or appropriation. He did not refuse to authorize Tolman to proceed as a clean elections candidate, withhold certification applications, or delay acting on any application until funding was available or until a court determined his legal obligations. The director did none of those things. He certified Tolman, thus binding the Commonwealth to the clean elections bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The defendants concede that this court has the authority to order a money judgment for Tolman. But they claim that \u201cnothing in the [cjlean [ejlections law or elsewhere waives the Commonwealth\u2019s sovereign immunity to a suit seeking such a money judgment;\u201d They maintain that abrogation of sovereign immunity by this court would be unwarranted, that the Legislature should have an opportunity to decide the immunity issue before the court acts, and that if the court decides to abrogate sovereign immunity under the clean elections law, it should do so explicitly.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The defendants misread the fundamental nature and purpose of the clean elections law. Sovereign immunity has posed no barrier to recovery where, as here, the Commonwealth has been held liable to pay money to a plaintiff by virtue of the State\u2019s breach of its own expressly acknowledged statutory obligations and the plaintiff\u2019s action in conformity with the statutory scheme to his detriment. See, e.g., <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, supra; Perkins Sch. for the Blind </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>supra; <em>Springfield Hosp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Even if sovereign immunity were to apply to the circumstances of this case, it would be waived by the clean elections law itself, thus making judicial abrogation unnecessary. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>doctrine of sovereign immunity holds that \u201c[t]he Commonwealth \u2018cannot be impleaded in its own courts except with its consent, and, when that consent is granted, it can be im-pleaded only in the manner and to the extent expressed . . . [by] statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Woodbridge </em>v. <em>Worcester State Hosp., </em>384 Mass. 38, 42 (1981), quoting <em>Broadhurst </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>373 Mass. 720, 722 (1977). \u201cConsent to suit must be expressed by the terms of a statute, or appear by necessary implication from them.\u201d <em>Woodbridge </em>v. <em>Worcester State Hosp., supra </em>at 42.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> See <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>424 Mass. 758, 764 (1997) (\u201cwe do insist on a specific statement or clear implication before we take the Legislature to have waived the immunity of the Commonwealth\u201d). The \u201crules of construction governing statutory waivers of sovereign immunity are stringent.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Woodbridge </em>v. <em>Worcester State Hosp., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The people, not the Legislature, enacted the clean elections law, under the initiative provisions of art. 48. To the extent that we are required to ascertain whether there has been a waiver of sovereign immunity, it is to the wishes of the people, not the Legislature, that we must look. Their position is clear: the abrogation of sovereign immunity is inherent in the certification process and in the regulatory purpose of the statute that we have described above. The power to bind the Commonwealth to payments of public funds by the process of certification is required \u201cby necessary implication\u201d from the clean elections law, see <em>Woodbridge </em>v. <em>Worcester State Hosp., supra </em>at 42; the certification process, and the director\u2019s role in it, has no meaningful function without the obligation for payment.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>We will not impute to the voters who enacted the clean elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>tions law an \u201cintention to pass an ineffective statute.\u201d <em>Boston Elevated Ry. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>310 Mass. 528, 548 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Moreover, a waiver of sovereign immunity in the matter of monies due to certified candidates harmonizes with other provisions in the clean elections law. The statute permits candidates whom the director decertifies, and who thereby lose public funds, to obtain judicial review of his decision in Superior Court or the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County. See G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 16 (c), (g). It would be perverse to read the clean elections statute, which was enacted as a government reform measure, as invoking sovereign immunity only where the Commonwealth withholds payments to certified candidates who maintain their bona fides, while providing that public funds be returned to a candidate who has been wrongfully decertified.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Finally, this is not a case where sovereign immunity is appropriately invoked in order to protect the discretionary functions of a public official, see <em>Whitney </em>v. Worcester, 373 Mass. 208, 219 (1977), or to prevent the unauthorized actions of a public official, see <em>George A. Fuller Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>303 Mass. 216 (1939), or to shield the public fisc from the specter of virtually unlimited liability. See <em>Morash &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 612, 623 n.6 (1973). Nor is this a case where judicial action on sovereign immunity is appropriately deferred to provide an inducement to the Legislature to abrogate the immunity on its own. See, e.g., <em>Hannigan </em>v. <em>New Gamma-Delta Chapter of Kappa Sigma Fraternity, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 658 (1975); <em>Morash &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra. </em>Here, no reasons of \u201cjustice and public policy\u201d argue for the application of sovereign immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">We also observe that art. 48 enumerates several areas that cannot be the subject of a law passed by initiative. See art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 2. See also note 23, <em>supra. </em>Sovereign immunity is not one of them. Had the framers of art. 48 wished to exclude waiver of sovereign immunity in any law enacted by way of initiative, they surely would have done so explicitly. Should the Legislature become concerned that a statute passed by initiative unduly exposes the sovereign to liability, it is free to employ the art. 48 safety valves of repeal or amendment to remedy the perceived threat. See <em>id. </em>(repeal); art. 48, General Provisions, VI (amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>In short, we find that the statutory scheme of the clean elections law forecloses the defense of sovereign immunity, and that Tolman is entitled to judgment in his favor in the amount to which he is entitled as a certified candidate. Cf. <em>Durant </em>v. State, 456 Mich. 175 (1997). Our holding is a narrow one. The Commonwealth\u2019s liability arises from the affirmative acts of an authorized official of the Commonwealth, the director, in certifying Tolman as a clean elections candidate under G. L. c. 55A, and from the inextricable relationship established by the statute between clean elections certification and clean elections funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The plaintiffs have asked for declaratory and injunctive relief against the director that would order him to provide public campaign monies from the clean elections fund to \u201call eligible candidates\u201d under the clean elections law. See G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 8. Ordering the director to distribute clean elections funds would accomplish nothing. The parties have stipulated that \u201c[njone of the money\u201d previously transferred by the Legislature from the general fund to the clean elections fund and none of the money in the clean elections fund from other sources \u201cis currently available for the [director] to distribute to certified candidates.\u201d In the absence of an appropriation the director has no power to order that monies be disbursed from the clean elections fund. See Part I, <em>supra. </em>Because the director currently has no clean elections funds to distribute and no authority on his own to reach those funds, he cannot be ordered to distribute them.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The plaintiffs have also argued that the clean elections law may not be repealed during the 2002 clean elections cycle. That relief \u2014 directed as it must be to the General Court in the first instance \u2014 does not he. See note 21, <em>supra. </em>Article 48 imposes no time limit within which a statute enacted by initiative must be repealed. The Legislature is free to repeal (or amend) the clean elections law at any time. As we noted, the \u201crepeal\u201d or \u201cappropriate\u201d provisions of art. 48 act as a constitutional safety valve. If the Legislature wishes not to appropriate funds for the law, it may repeal it. See art. 48, The Initiative, n, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Second, as the defendants correctly point out, the court can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>not \u201cinterfere with the process of legislation . . . before it is completed, to prevent the possible enactment of an unconstitutional measure.\u201d <em>Bowe </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>320 Mass. 230, 247 (1946). See <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>416 Mass. 471, 475 (1993) (mandamus and declaratory judgment do not lie against Legislature). We will not speculate about the legal impact, if any, that such a repeal might have on the 2002 elections or on any clean elections candidate. See <em>Bowe, supra </em>at 245 (\u201cIn many cases it would be difficult... to say abstractly and unconditionally that a statute is or is not unconstitutional\u201d). See also <em>Animal Legal Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fisheries &amp; Wildlife Bd., </em>416 Mass. 635, 638 (1993), quoting <em>Slama </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>384 Mass. 620, 624 (1982), and <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Bowker, </em>233 Mass. 455, 459 (1956) (\u201c \u2018[t]o have standing in any capacity, a litigant must show that the challenged action caused the litigant injury.\u2019 . . . \u2018[Ojnly persons who have themselves suffered, or who are in danger of suffering, legal harm can compel the courts to assume the difficult and delicate duty of passing upon the validity of the acts of [another] branch of government\u2019 \u201d); <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. 290, 293 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The choice between available constitutional options is for the Legislature. See <em>Bromfield </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>390 Mass. 665, 670 n.9 (1983). Having delineated the Legislature\u2019s responsibilities under art. 48 with respect to a statute enacted by initiative, we are confident that the Legislature will act to meet its constitutional responsibilities. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>334 Mass. 745, 758-759 (1956) (art. 48 \u201cwas adopted in the expectation that all officers concerned would perform the duties required of them at the proper times\u201d). See also <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>327 Mass. 310, 320 (1951) (\u201cThe people themselves and all branches of their government, legislative, executive, and judicial alike, are bound by [the Constitution] and owe to it implicit obedience\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">We now turn to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for relief against the Secretary. The plaintiffs premise their claims against him on the theory that the clean elections law is \u201cbinding\u201d because it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>not been repealed, and that therefore, because the Legislature has not appropriated funds to carry the statute into effect, every election for State office to be held in 2002 violates both art. 48 and the clean elections law. The relief they seek is sweeping \u2014 an immediate injunction barring \u201cany future elections\u201d for Massachusetts statewide or legislative office.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Elections are mandated by the Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth. The next Statewide election must take place in 2002. See arts. 8-10 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution (affirming people\u2019s right to vote); art. 64, \u00a7 1, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, as amended by art. 82 of the Amendments (establishing election of State officers and terms of office); art. 64, \u00a7 3, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, as amended by art. 82 of the Amendments (establishing date for quadrennial and biennial State elections); G. L. c. 54, \u00a7 62 (establishing date for biennial State elections). The Secretary\u2019s duty is to fulfil these constitutional and statutory mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In contrast, art. 48 confers no duty on the Secretary to implement a law enacted by initiative.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Similarly, the Secretary has no colorable duty to implement the funding provisions of the clean elections law. Simply because the clean elections law was enacted by initiative, the statute does not thereby, as the plaintiffs suggest, obtain the status of a constitutional amendment. Nor does the law modify the Secretary\u2019s constitutional or statutory duties to call elections at specified times.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">In support of their extraordinary request, the plaintiffs have called our attention to several cases from other jurisdictions in which elections have been enjoined. None supports the broad relief the plaintiffs desire. The plaintiffs place particular emphasis on <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, 566 (1964), which concerned a Federal constitutional challenge to a Statewide apportionment of legislative districts. Under the challenged apportionment scheme, the votes of persons in different counties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>were weighted differently, resulting in the dilution of voting power in certain geographic areas and the enhancement of voting power in others. The weight of every vote in every race was unbalanced. Here there is no factual basis in the record to support the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that, unless all certified candidates are fully funded, every Massachusetts voter will be deprived of the intended benefits of the clean elections law (and a meaningful initiative process) in every upcoming Massachusetts electoral contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The plaintiffs have not demonstrated that clean elections candidates are running, or intend to ran, in each and every election they seek to enjoin. There may be many district and Statewide races in which no candidate (present or future) chooses to abide by the clean elections restrictions. In stark contrast, in the <em>Reynolds </em>case, the legitimacy of every possible vote was compromised by an unconstitutional voting system. The systemic imbalance, justifying the exceptional relief there granted, is absent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Granting an injunction against the Secretary will not give the plaintiffs the relief they actually seek and are tacitly requesting: the release of funds to certified clean elections candidates.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief they seek against the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">We remand this case to the single justice with directions to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against the director and the Secretary, without prejudice. The single justice shall retain jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the director and the Secretary for other and further relief. We direct the single justice to enter separate judgment for Tolman against the director in the amount of $811,050: See note 7, <em>supra. </em>The single justice shall retain jurisdiction to award such other and further relief to Tolman to which he is or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>may become entitled under the clean elections statute, consistent with this opinion. The single justice shall retain jurisdiction to grant relief to any other candidate plaintiff who is or may become entitled to relief under the clean elections statute, consistent with this opinion. She may allow motions to amend or motions to intervene to add additional candidate plaintiffs who may seek relief under the clean elections statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u201cThe presumption exists that the Commonwealth will honor its obligations.\u201d <em>Bromfield </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., supra </em>at 669. The Attorney General, representing the defendants, has made clear in his postargument submissions that, should a money judgment issue, the director \u201cwould forthwith take all necessary steps to seek payment of such a judgment from the judgments and settlements account.\u201d Nevertheless, should Tol-man\u2019s judgment remain unsatisfied, he may apply for relief to the single justice, who shall retain jurisdiction over the matter of Tolman\u2019s judgment against the Commonwealth should further proceedings be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">To the extent that any further proceedings in this case are required, the single justice has broad discretion to consider such other and further remedies as she deems necessary and appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Appendix. .</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT FOR THE COMMONWEALTH</p>\n<p id=\"Aij\">IN THE CASE No. SJC-08677</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">KELLY BATES &amp; others <em>vs. </em>DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF CAMPAIGN AND POLITICAL FINANCE &amp; another.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">MEMORANDUM AND ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">In October, 2001, <em>the </em>plaintiffs commenced an action in the Supreme Judicial Court for the county of Suffolk against the Director of the Office of Campaign and Political Finance (director) and the Secretary of the Commonwealth (Secretary) seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. A single justice reserved and reported the matter to the full court on the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, a stipulation in lieu of the defendant\u2019s answer, and a statement of agreed facts. Upon consideration of the briefs and argument, the court concludes as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">(1) The clean elections law, G. L. c. 55A (clean elections law), was approved by the people under the initiative provision of art. 48, The Initiative, V, \u00a7 1, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. See St. 1998, c. 395, \u00a7 2. The initiative petition also created the clean elections fund, G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 42. See St. 1998, c. 395, \u00a7 3 (rewriting G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 42). The clean elections law was enacted by popular initiative, pursuant to art. 48, which provides that \u201cif a law approved by the people is not repealed, the general court shall raise by taxation or otherwise and shall appropriate such money as may he necessary to carry such law into effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">(2) The court concludes that, unless the Legislature has repealed a law that has been enacted by way of initiative, the Legislature is mandated by art. 48 to raise by taxation or otherwise and to appropriate such money as may be necessary to carry the law into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-14\">(3) The clean elections law provides that the distribution of any clean elections funds is \u201csubject to appropriation,\u201d G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 8 <em>(a). </em>General Laws c. 10, \u00a7 42, establishing the clean elections fund, provides, in turn, that amounts credited to such fund \u201cshall be expended, subject to appropriation, only for the purposes set forth in [the clean elections law].\u201d G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 42. The \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d language contained in G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7 8 (a), and in G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 42, was not required to avoid the \u201cspecific appropriation\u201d exclusion of art. 48, and with or without that language the measure is not a \u201cspecific appropriation\u201d under art. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-15\">(4) Nothing in the provisions of the clean elections statutes, including the language \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d referred to above, relieves the Legislature of its constitutional duties under art. 48. The clean elections law has not been repealed. Thus, art. 48 commands that, for as long as that law remains in ef-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>feet, the Legislature is constitutionally required to appropriate the funds necessary to its operation. To date, the Legislature has not satisfied its constitutional obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">In light of the above, the court will proceed to consider, on an expedited basis, the relief that is appropriate, including, but not limited to the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">(i) whether, in light of the passage of time since the enactment of the clean elections law and the failure of the Legislature to appropriate funds for the 2002 elections, it is still open to the Legislature to repeal the clean elections law for this election cycle;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">(ii) whether, in the absence of a vote to repeal the clean elections law, funds to carry the law into effect shall be deemed appropriated as matter of law;</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">(iii) whether, as suggested by amicus curiae Massachusetts Democratic State Committee, if the Secretary of Administration and Finance is added as a party, he would have any power to authorize payments to certified clean elections candidates;</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">(iv) whether an injunction should enter ordering the Secretary of the Commonwealth from proceeding with any or all elections in the Commonwealth in the absence of a vote by the Legislature to repeal the clean elections law or to appropriate funds to carry the law into effect;</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">(v) whether the addition of any further parties is necessary for the relief specified above or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">The court invites the parties and any other interested persons to file memoranda solely on the question of the appropriate relief. The court does not intend that the above remedies be considered exclusive, and the court invites proposals of any additional and further remedies as may be appropriate. All such submissions, each of which shall include a proposed order, shall be filed on or before 5 p.m. on Friday, February 1, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">An opinion or opinions shall follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">By the Court,</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">Susan Mellen, Clerk</p>\n<p id=\"b197-15\">ENTERED: January 25, 2002</p>\n<p id=\"b197-16\">COWIN, J. (dissenting, with whom Spina, J., joins). In my view, the court misconceives art. 48 and proposes a list of possible remedies, all of which presuppose that the Legislature has acted improperly. The Legislature has acted within its constitutional prerogative in refusing to fund the clean elections law, and it is not for the judicial branch to attempt to override it.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-17\">The plaintiffs have sought an injunction ordering the director to provide public campaign funds to eligible candidates and barring the Secretary from holding all future elections until the funds are disbursed to these candidates. In my opinion, we cannot order the director to disburse funds absent a legislative appropriation and enjoining future elections is unjustified. The director <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>has no power to pay out funds, and we have no power to order him to do so, without a legislative appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The court, however, decides that the litigation should continue, perhaps with the Secretary of Administration and Finance or others as parties. This implies that other officials are vested with some authority that the court can order them to exercise and that the problem will thereby be solved. Clearly, neither that Secretary nor any other executive official possess such power because no executive official may spend the Commonwealth\u2019s money without a prior legislative appropriation. Therefore, the question for decision, which the court today avoids, is whether, absent legislation to appropriate passed in the ordinary course, this court has the power to order an appropriation or to treat the situation as if an appropriation were in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">It is my view that an appropriation is necessary before an executive official is permitted to spend the Commonwealth\u2019s funds. We therefore must determine whether art. 48 requires the Legislature to appropriate funds and, if the Legislature fails to perform its obligation in this regard, whether this court can order the Legislature to appropriate the funds or, in the alternative, deem there to be an appropriation as a matter of law and order the Treasurer or any other executive official to spend the Commonwealth\u2019s funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">I disagree with the court\u2019s conclusion that art. 48 requires the Legislature to either repeal the clean elections law or to appropriate such money as may be necessary to carry it into effect. Article 48 provides: \u201c[I]f a law approved by the people is not repealed, the general court shall raise by taxation or otherwise- and shall appropriate such money as may be necessary to carry such law into effect.\u201d Art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 2. We must read this provision of art. 48 consistently with the provision of art. 48 that excludes specific appropriations from the initiative process. See <em>McDuffy </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Executive Office of Educ., </em>415 Mass. 545, 559 (1993), quoting <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>357 Mass. 564, 571 (1970) (\u201cthe Constitution \u2018is to be interpreted in the light of the conditions under which it and its several parts were framed\u2019 \u201d). Article 48\u2019s provision prohibiting specific appropriations indicates that the drafters intended to keep the appropriation power with the Legislature and feared placing such power in the people. During the 1917-1918 constitutional convention, one proponent of the prohibition on specific appropriations stated that the purpose of ffie provision was to prevent the people from spending \u201cthe money that has been saved for . . . crises . . . without the calm, deliberate, judicious, fair scrutiny that is given by a legislative investigation.\u201d 2 Debates in the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention 1917-1918, at 817 (1918) (2 Debates) (remarks of Mr. Luce).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">It is clear from the debates that the drafters chose to exclude specific appropriations from the initiative process despite their recognition that such an exclusion would permit the Legislature to thwart the voters\u2019 purposes by withholding funding for a measure adopted by popular vote. One delegate cautioned that \u201cif this [provision] is adopted it will he possible to make absolutely useless any legislation proposed by the initiative and referendum.\u201d 2 Debates, <em>supra </em>at 818 (remarks of Mr. Creamer). The delegates, however, adopted the provision despite this concern because they believed that:</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">\u201c[N]o Legislature that had received a mandate from the people to put a certain scheme into effect, and that scheme voted for by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>considerable majority of the people, would dare stand up and say: \u2018We won\u2019t appropriate any money for this scheme.\u2019 \u201d 2 Debates, <em>supra </em>at 822 (remarks of Mr. Churchill).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Thus, although the drafters believed that political pressures would prevent the Legislature from withholding funding, they did not believe that art. 48 itself prevented the Legislature from doing so. The \u201crepeal or fund\u201d provision was adopted without any recorded debate. 2 Debates, <em>supra </em>at 948. If the drafters had intended to negate the effect of the earlier-adopted specific appropriations prohibition by requiring a choice between funding and repealing, surely the provision would have been more controversial.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In addition to reading art. 48 consistently with the specific appropriations prohibition, we must read art. 48 consistently with the other articles of our Constitution. <em>McDuffy </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Executive Office of Educ., supra </em>at 559. Article 63, drafted during the same constitutional convention as art. 48, serves as further evidence that language of art. 48 should not be interpreted as requiring that the Legislature appropriate money to fund laws passed by initiative petition. Article 63 vests the Legislature with the responsibility for managing the financial affairs of the Commonwealth, see <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>297 Mass. 577, 580 (1937), and provides that \u201c[t]he general court may increase, decrease, add or omit items in the budget.\u201d Article 63, \u00a7 3, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. This suggests that the provision of art. 48 that the Legislature \u201cshall appropriate such money as may be necessary to carry such law into effect\u201d implies \u201cas determined by the general court,\u201d so that the Legislature bears sole responsibility for determining the amount of appropriation, if any, that is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Further, we must interpret art. 48 consistently with art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, which states that the \u201cjudicial [branch] shall never exercise the legislative . . . powers.\u201d See <em>Alliance AFSCME/SEIU </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin., </em>413 Mass. 377, 382 (1992) (\u201cThe power to appropriate is exclusively that of the Legislature\u201d). Article 30\u2019s principle of separation of powers prevents the \u201cjudiciary [from] substituting its notions of correct policy for that of a popularly elected Legislature.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leno, </em>415 Mass. 835, 841 (1993), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lammi, </em>386 Mass. 299, 300 (1982). The framers of art. 48 were well aware of the limitations imposed by art. 30 and presumably did not enact a provision that would violate its mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Just as art. 30 prohibits the judicial branch from exercising a legislative function, it prohibits the judicial branch from exercising an executive function. The court\u2019s interpretation of art. 48 would not only encroach on the constitutional powers of the Legislature, but those of the executive branch as well. The Governor may veto an appropriation, reduce its amount, sign the bill, or allow it to become law without signature. Art. 63, \u00a7 5, as amended by art. 90, \u00a7 4, of the Amendments. See <em>Alliance, AFSCME/SEIU </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin., supra </em>at 382. If we impose any remedy that bypasses the Governor\u2019s role in the appropriation process, we exercise an executive function. While the Governor may well choose to sign a clean elections appropriation bill should one be presented, we cannot dispense with her constitutional role by assuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>she would do so. See <em>id. </em>at 383 (\u201cGovernor\u2019s approval of the bill cannot be presumed, nor can presentment to the Governor be dispensed with as a mere formality\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The interpretation advocated by the court is also unworkable; it will result in numerous challenges to the Legislature\u2019s authority to control the budget. The clean elections law avoids the need for legislative deliberation on the proper level of funding because it sets forth the amounts to be appropriated by formula. See G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 7, 8 <em>(a). </em>Often, however, only the Legislature will have the resources and expertise to decide the level of appropriation necessary to effectuate a law. The drafters could not have intended a system in which voters challenge the Legislature\u2019s appropriation measures whenever they believe that they are insufficient to carry out the petition\u2019s purpose. This is precisely why, as discussed above, art. 48\u2019s directive that the Legislature \u201cshall appropriate . . . money as may be necessary to carry such law into effect,\u201d must be interpreted to require a legislative determination as to what is necessary, including a determination that what is necessary is nothing at all. Art. 48, The Initiative, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Even if art. 48 requires the Legislature to fund or repeal a law passed by initiative petition, the language of the clean elections law provides that its implementation is dependent on a legislative appropriation. The majority rewrites the initiative petition and the resulting statute by ignoring the phrase \u201csubject to appropriation,\u201d although this language indicates that the provisions of the measure were not intended to be effective without a legislative appropriation. See <em>Associated Indus. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>413 Mass. 1, 7 (1992) (\u201cIt is difficult to imagine how a measure that is \u2018subject to appropriation\u2019 could have been intended to be an appropriation in and of itself\u201d). See also <em>Gilligan </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>413 Mass. 14, 19-20 (1992) (\u201c[T]he inclusion in the summary of the phrase \u2018subject to appropriation by the state Legislature\u2019 accurately and fairly informs voters of the precise contingency involved\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">I disagree with the court\u2019s conclusion that, even absent the \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d language, the clean elections law would not constitute a specific appropriation. A specific appropriation is one that \u201cremoves public monies, and the decision how to spend them, from the control of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Associated Indus. of Mass. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra </em>at 6 (initiative petition establishing excise tax and creating fund to be used for cleanup and control of hazardous waste did not violate art. 48 because money in fund was to be used for this purpose \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d). See also <em>Tax Equity Alliance For Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>401 Mass. 310 (1987) (\u201cAn appropriation designates a sum of money to be devoted to some object\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The clean elections law sets aside money from the public treasury for the particular purpose of providing funds for candidates who agree to abide by the law\u2019s restrictions. As discussed above, the statute enumerates by formula the exact amounts to be distributed to clean elections candidates. See G. L. c. 55A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 1, 7, 8 <em>(a). </em>Once a candidate meets the requirements set out by the law, the amount of the disbursement is fixed. The clean elections law forces the State to pay money to candidates when they satisfy certain conditions. Therefore, the people, rather than the Legislature, directly decide the amounts of money to be expended. Our Constitution does not permit the people to make this type of determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">This court does not have the power to grant any of the relief suggested by the court. We cannot order the Legislature to appropriate funds or deem the funds appropriated as a matter of law, and members of the executive branch are powerless to authorize payments to certified clean elections candidates in the absence of a legislative appropriation. This result is a consequence of the separation of governmental powers, a foundational principle of our system with which we should be reluctant to tamper. The plaintiffs\u2019 remedy, as it always is with political questions, is at the ballot box. If the public is truly concerned about this issue, it will retaliate in the next election against those they hold to be responsible for frustrating the public will. If the public does not care enough about the issue, there will be no such retaliation. See <em>LIMITS </em>v. <em>President of the Senate, </em>414 Mass. 31, 35 (1992) (\u201cWhen the purpose of art. 48 has been frustrated, the only remedy may come from the influence of public opinion, expressed ultimately at the ballot box\u201d).</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b162-16\">The term \u201cStatewide office\u201d refers to the offices of Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Treasurer and Receiver General, Secretary of the Commonwealth, and Auditor.

The court, acting through the defendants before it, has, in effect, entered a declaratory judgment setting forth the mandate of art. 48 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution; established the Legislature\u2019s violation of the mandate; found sovereign immunity inapplicable; and determined candidate Warren Tolman\u2019s entitlement to the immediate entry of a judgment. I agree with this declaration. I write separately to clarify certain issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">It is important to emphasize why Tolman (and others) are entitled to immediate relief. Tolman was not injured by any conduct of the director. His right is grounded on the clean elections statute, which, in turn, is based on art. 48. His entitlement is therefore hybrid in nature, both constitutional and statutory, and the monies due him constitute a property right, suitable for encompassment in a judgment. The right, as a property right, cannot now be abridged by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">At this stage of the proceedings, the clean elections statute is basically self-executing. All certified candidates are entitled to the funds allotted by the statute to their candidacies. Even if the statute is repealed, no certified candidate can be denied the funds due him or her.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">With these principles in mind, I now comment on the remedy provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">(a) I agree that new plaintiffs should be added by way of amendment to the complaint or intervention, as they become clean elections candidates. The affidavits attached to the complaint indicate that there are a number of these candidates who intend to run Statewide and in local representative and senate races.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">(b) As stated, all such candidates will acquire vested property rights once certified. Repeal of the statute may terminate further candidacies. I am not certain about the Legislature\u2019s power to amend the clean elections statute. The power to repeal may include the authority to amend. On the other hand, amendments. which effectively nullify the main purpose of the statute may not be valid, in the absence of outright repeal. If the issue of amendment becomes relevant, I would like briefing on the Legislature\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>(c) The director\u2019s role is essentially ministerial. Candidates who have joined the lawsuit and have been certified should, like Tolman, receive judgments and executions. The grant of executions is appropriate to expedite payments. It is assumed that the Legislature will promptly appropriate funds to pay the judgments. If not, the executions may be used to satisfy the judgments out of Commonwealth property.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">(d) To the extent necessary to process claims, the single justice has available to her any necessary equitable tools, including, if appropriate, the appointment of a special master and receivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">(e) I note that some plaintiffs may be entitled to future relief against the director and Secretary. For example, elections in districts where certified candidates are being denied funds might have to be enjoined until a proper election is held. Similarly, an improperly held election in a given district might have to be voided. These are possible future considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">One final comment is in order. There should be no controversy over the role of the Justices in this case. We came to this case, complicated as it is, with no preset brief or bias and with the utmost respect for the legislative and executive branches. It is our quintessential function, as the court observes, to declare and enforce the law. We have tried to honor this obligation conscientiously. Now that we have set forth a constitutional exegesis that affirms the clear voice of the people as stated in the Findings and Declarations in St. 1998, c. 395, \u00a7 1, we expect the other branches of government to abide by their obligations.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b203-8\">Spina, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaY\">(dissenting, with whom Cowin, J., joins). Today the court has reshaped our Constitution in three significant respects. It requires the Legislature under art. 48 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution to appropriate funds to implement laws enacted by the people; it has stripped the Legislature of its discretion under art. 63 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution to make appropriations for laws enacted under art. 48; and it has made a constructive appropriation in violation of art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>in order to create a private remedy for what it has determined is a failure of the Legislature to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">First, the gloss that the court has placed on art. 48 effectively gives the people the power to do indirectly that which they cannot do directly, namely, enact a measure that makes a specific appropriation of money. See art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 2. Although the court says that the clean elections law does not specifically appropriate public funds, the law has been transformed into an appropriation because it \u201cengages\u201d art. 48. <em>Ante </em>at 146. Article 48 now imposes on the Legislature a duty to appropriate funds necessary to implement any law enacted by the initiative process and the court has made clear its willingness to provide a remedy for the Legislature\u2019s failure to carry out that duty. Thus, the mandate of art. 48 makes all such laws self-appropriating. The fact that they may be repealed makes them no less so. The court\u2019s interpretation of art. 48 was not, in my view, ever contemplated by the constitutional convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Second, the court\u2019s all-or-nothing interpretation of art. 48 has done violence to art. 63. Until today, the Legislature had unqualified discretion under art. 63 to appropriate money. That discretion is now qualified by the mandate of art. 48 that all laws enacted by the people be fully funded. This exception to the Legislature\u2019s authority under art. 63 places initiative laws in a category above other laws. Laws enacted by the people have become super laws, because they alone must be fully funded.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The third area affected is the principle of separation of powers, embodied in art. 30. Today, the court has intruded on the legislative function by granting relief to a litigant for what the com! has determined is the failure of the Legislature to perform a duty assigned to it by the Massachusetts Constitution. Although I do not agree that the Legislature has failed to perform any duty, we have, historically and constitutionally, refrained from granting relief in such circumstances. See, e.g., <em>LIMITS </em>v. <em>President of the Senate, </em>414 Mass. 31, 35 (1992); <em>Alliance, AFSCME/SEIU </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin., </em>413 Mass. 377, 383-384 n.9 (1992). The court has not directly ordered the Legislature to do anything, but it has created a remedy that amounts to a constructive appropriation. This, in my view, violates art. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Finally, I believe that the cases relied on to create a remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>for certified candidates are inapposite to the situation. Those cases involved contract claims or a right to obtain a license. <em>Ante </em>at 169-170. By contrast, the clean elections law specifically provides that payments to certified candidates are to be made from the clean elections fund, which is subject to appropriation. See G. L. c. 55A, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8 (a). Although the director may have certified a qualifying candidate to receive funds, there has been no appropriation. That is a matter of public record. There could be no reliance, and there should be no remedy. The law creates no right to funds unappropriated. See <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>416 Mass. 471 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b205-6\">Cowin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATt\">(dissenting, with whom Spina, J., joins). Having already expressed my view that the Legislature has acted within its constitutional prerogative, and that, accordingly, the plaintiffs have no rights to be vindicated, it is my opinion that no remedy is appropriate. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
