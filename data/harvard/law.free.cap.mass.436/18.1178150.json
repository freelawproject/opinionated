The judge concluded that the agreement was not fair and reasonable either at the time it was executed or when the husband sought its enforcement on commencing a divorce action nearly eight years after the parties were married. The husband appealed and we granted his application for direct appellate review. On appeal he challenges the judge\u2019s order as to the enforceability of the antenuptial agreement and her order that he pay the wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that the evidence did not warrant a conclusion that the antenuptial agreement is unenforceable, and reverse so much of the judgment to that effect. We affirm so much of the judgment as orders the husband to pay the wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, but remand the case to the Probate and Family Court for a determination of the amount to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">1. <em>Factual background. </em>The circumstances in which the parties\u2019 antenuptial agreement was negotiated and executed were as follows.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> M. Joseph DeMatteo (husband) and Susan J. DeMat-teo (wife) were married on March 23, 1990. At the time the husband was forty-seven years old, and the wife was forty-one years old. They had known each other as adolescents and had dated occasionally in the 1970\u2019s. In 1987, they renewed their earlier acquaintance. In 1989, the husband proposed marriage. He did so on condition that the wife sign an antenuptial agreement. She agreed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">This was to be the husband\u2019s first marriage, and the wife\u2019s second. The wife had a daughter, bom in 1983, from her first marriage. Until shortly before her second marriage in 1990, the wife lived with her daughter in a rented two-bedroom house in Dedham. She worked as a secretary earning approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>$25,000 a year, owned no real property, and had few assets. In contrast, the husband was a wealthy individual. He had a substantial ownership interest in his family\u2019s construction business; this and other real estate holdings and investments established him as a man of significant net worth, described more fully below. It is undisputed that the wife knew that her future husband was a man of considerable wealth, and that the husband knew that his future wife had few financial assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">During the fall and winter of 1989-1990, the wife and the husband discussed the terms and necessity of an antenuptial agreement. The judge found that, although he was not \u201coverbearing,\u201d the husband was \u201cvery clear that such an agreement was necessary.\u201d At the husband\u2019s urging, the wife retained independent legal counsel \u2014 Ann C. Palmer \u2014 to represent her in negotiating the agreement. Palmer was recommended to the wife by a friend. The husband was represented by his business counsel, Joel Lewin.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">In February and March, 1990, Lewin and Palmer spoke several times and Lewin sent Palmer a draft antenuptial agreement. The draft provided, among other things, that if the marriage terminated by legal proceedings, including separation or divorce, the wife would receive the marital home free of encumbrance, the automobile that she was then driving, and an annual payment from the husband of $25,000 until her death or remarriage. On Palmer\u2019s advice, the wife did not accept these terms. Palmer sent a letter to Lewin rejecting the draft; she also requested full disclosure of the husband\u2019s assets. In response, Lewin delivered to Palmer the husband\u2019s tax returns for 1984 through 1988 and a current financial statement showing the husband\u2019s net worth to be between $83 million and $108 million. The husband\u2019s interests in his family\u2019s construction business comprised a majority of his assets. The wife made no further inquiries regarding the husband\u2019s assets and has not claimed that the husband\u2019s financial disclosures made before she signed the antenuptial agreement were incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">On receipt of the husband\u2019s financial disclosures, Palmer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>consulted further with her client. She then informed Lewin that her client required that the husband increase the annual payments to the wife to $35,000, adjusted annually for increases in the cost of living. She also requested medical insurance, life insurance, and the lesser of twenty per cent of the husband\u2019s estate or $5 million. The husband rejected these requests. Further negotiations followed, the details of which are not necessary to describe, except to note that the wife dropped her demand for the lesser of twenty per cent of the husband\u2019s estate or $5 million in the event that the marriage was terminated by divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The parties executed the agreement on March 21, 1990. The agreement, fifteen pages long, to which the parties\u2019 respective statements of assets were attached and incorporated,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> contains provisions concerning the disposition of their separate assets on death<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or if the marriage was \u201cterminated or interrupted by divorce or other legal proceedings\u201d during their lifetimes, disposition of liabilities, and numerous other provisions concerning such issues as breach, modifications, and choice of law. The agreement also contains provisions concerning waiver,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cfairness,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> warranties about legal advice,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and child support \u201cif any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>children shall be bom of their marriage.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Concerning termination of the marriage on divorce, the agreement provided that the wife would receive the marital home free of encumbrance,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> yearly support of $35,000 until her death or remarriage with an annual cost-of-living increase,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> an automobile, and medical insurance until her death or remarriage. All property jointly acquired during the marriage would be divided between the parties in equal shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Both attorneys were present when the parties executed the agreement and the signing was recorded on videotape. The recording shows the husband\u2019s attorney reciting the terms of the agreement and the parties communicating their understanding of and consent to those terms. The parties acknowledge they have received advice from counsel of their choice, that they understand their rights in the absence of the agreement, and that they each have read the other\u2019s financial disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">2. <em>Procedural background. </em>On March 13, 1998, the husband filed a complaint for divorce under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 IB, alleging that the marriage was irretrievably broken down and seeking enforcement of the antenuptial agreement. The wife denied that the marriage was irretrievably broken down and challenged the enforceability of the agreement. The judge allowed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>husband\u2019s motion to bifurcate the trial to consider first the validity and enforceability of the agreement. There followed three days of testimony solely on that issue. On February 12, 2001, the judge issued comprehensive findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a judgment that the antenuptial agreement was \u201cnot fair and reasonable at the time of its execution and is not fair and reasonable at the present time, and therefore may not be enforced.\u201d Because it elucidates our discussion of the issues, we describe in some detail the judge\u2019s rulings of law and her supporting analysis; her findings are summarized above.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The judge considered whether the agreement was fair and reasonable. See <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>384 Mass. 591, 599 (1981). Without differentiating between fairness at the time of execution and fairness at the time of the trial, the judge concluded that the agreement was neither fair nor reasonable at either point in time. She based her determination on \u201cthe entirety of the financial settlement\u201d to the wife, on what she termed \u201cthe lack of substantial negotiations involved before the agreement was executed,\u201d the \u201csophistication of the issues involved,\u201d and \u201cthe lifestyle of the parties during the marriage and the vast disparity between the parties\u2019 ability to acquire future assets and income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Addressing the claims of the wife, the judge placed no reliance on her assertion that she was incapacitated at the time she executed the agreement. She found that the wife did not suffer from any incapacity due to any health reasons at the time, nor did she lack \u201ceducation or business acumen to appreciate the significance of what she was doing,\u201d as the wife had also claimed. The judge did not credit the wife\u2019s contention that she signed the agreement under duress: \u201cIf she was under as much duress as she claimed to be, it was not at all apparent\u201d on the video taped recording.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Concerning the negotiations preceding the agreement\u2019s execution, the judge found that there was \u201ccomplete financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>disclosure by both parties.\u201d She nevertheless pointed to what she characterized as \u201cminimal\u201d negotiations prior to the agreement\u2019s execution, noting that \u201cthe financial and legal issues involved in this case were quite complex.\u201d The judge concluded that the wife \u201cdid not fully explore all the options available to her, nor was there any real discussion with her about either the consequences of this agreement or the possible results after a [G. L. c. 208,] \u00a7 34 hearing.\u201d She gave no weight to the fact that the wife was represented by independent counsel, noting only that the wife did not \u201cdiscuss with her counsel what she might anticipate in terms of an appropriate financial settlement in the even[t] of a divorce.\u201d The judge found that the wife was \u201caware of the criteria considered by the Court under [\u00a7 ] 34,\u201d but that \u201cthere was [no] real explanation of its application to her case.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Turning to other factors, the judge also noted that \u201cin view of the fact that this is a ten year marriage which produced two children,\u201d the settlement for the wife was \u201cless than modest.\u201d She pointed to the \u201cfinancial holdings\u201d of the husband, the parties\u2019 \u201clifestyle during the marriage,\u201d and the husband\u2019s \u201cability to acquire . . . significant assets\u201d as compared to the wife, whose ability to acquire assets she termed \u201cvastly inferior\u201d to that of the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">In reaching her conclusion the judge explicitly relied on the \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d test as elaborated by the Appeals Court in <em>Dominick </em>v. <em>Dominick, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 85 (1984), a decision concerning the enforceability of a separation agreement. She reviewed the factors listed in that case<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to conclude that the antenuptial agreement at issue here was unenforceable. The <em>Do</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>minick </em>case, she noted, permitted her to consider the mandatory and discretionary factors in G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, governing the assignment of assets by a judge in divorce proceedings.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, the judge pointed to the length of the marriage, station, amount and source of income, employability, estate, and the needs of each party and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of assets and income.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The judge also noted that \u201c[a] divorcing party\u2019s needs are to be measured by the standard of living enjoyed during the marriage, not by whether a proposed allocation would enable the party to merely survive or even to live comfortably,\u201d citing <em>Rosenblatt </em>v. <em>Kazlow-Rosenblatt, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 297, 301 (1995). In that connection, the judge stated that, \u201c[ajlthough they lived in a manner more frugally than their income required,\u201d the parties \u201clacked no comfort or convenience, and their lifestyle was by choice rather than necessity.\u201d She noted that the couple had spent money \u201con trips, jewelry, home and yard maintenance, outside help and other things that made life easier and actually, more luxurious,\u201d and that \u201c[tjhere were no limits placed on their personal spending.\u201d Finally, the judge concluded that an agreement will be \u201cstruck down\u201d if there are countervailing equities to its enforcement or if it contains representations not supported in the record, even if the agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>ment recites that it was entered into knowingly by the parties, who were advised of their rights by independent counsel, citing <em>Stansel </em>v. <em>Stansel, </em>385 Mass. 510, 514-515 (1982), <em>and Randall </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 24, 31 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">. 3. <em>Enforceability of the antenuptial agreement. </em>In <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>384 Mass. 591, 598 (1981), we held that it is permissible for parties contemplating marriage to enter into an ante-nuptial contract settling their alimony or property rights in the event their marriage should prove unsuccessful. Noting that the freedom to limit or waive those rights in the event of divorce is not unrestricted, we set foith \u201csome guidelines to be used in determining the extent to which such agreements should be enforced.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 599. First, a judge must determine whether an antenuptial agreement is valid. Second, \u201cthe agreement must be fair and reasonable at the time of entry of the judgment nisi.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">As to whether an agreement is valid, we adopted the \u201cfair disclosure\u201d rules announced in <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Lipnick, </em>377 Mass. 666 (1979), where we considered the validity of an antenuptial agreement settling property rights on the death of a party. Under those rules, a judge must determine whether the agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">\u201c(1) . . . contains a fair and reasonable provision as measured at the time of its execution for the party contesting the agreement; (2) the contesting party was fully informed of the other party\u2019s worth prior to the agreement\u2019s execution, or had, or should have had, independent knowledge of the other party\u2019s worth; and (3) a waiver by the contesting party is set forth\u201d (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 672.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">We first examine the judge\u2019s conclusion that the antenuptial agreement in this case was not valid at the time of execution. The application of the second and third <em>Rosenberg </em>mies to the evidence will be disposed of first.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is clear that the wife was \u201cfully informed\u201d of the worth of her prospective husband before she executed the agreement. The judge found that there was \u201ccomplete financial disclosure\u201d by both parties, and it is undisputed that the wife was apprised that her prospective husband had a net worth between $108 million and $133 million; the husband gave the wife a detailed statement of his net worth, which he later supplemented. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>He also acceded to her request and provided her with copies of his income tax returns for the most recent five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Full and fair disclosure of each party\u2019s financial circumstances is a significant aspect of the parties\u2019 obligation to deal with each other \u201cfairly and understanding^\u201d because they stand in a confidential relationship with each other. <em>Rosenberg </em>v. Lipnick, <em>supra </em>at 673. While we have not elaborated on the point, it seems clear that it is sufficient that the disclosure be such that a decision by the opposing party may reasonably be made as to whether the agreement should go forward.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>In re Estate </em>of Lopata, 641 P.2d 952, 955 (Colo. 1982) (fair disclosure \u201cis not synonymous with detailed disclosure,\u201d but \u201ccontemplates that each spouse should be given information, of a general and approximate nature, concerning the net worth of the other\u201d); <em>Button </em>v. Button, 131 Wis. 2d 84, 95 (1986) (requiring \u201cfair and reasonable disclosure [of] financial status\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The wife claims that the negotiations were compressed in time and that she did not receive disclosure of the husband\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>assets until two weeks before the parties executed the agreement. There is no evidence that time precluded the wife from exploring her options. The judge found the husband was not \u201coverbearing\u201d; he issued no ultimatum at the last moment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The wife plainly had sufficient knowledge of her future husband\u2019s worth to make an informed decision as to whether she wished to consent to the agreement. What the judge characterized as \u201cminimal negotiations\u201d are circumstances insufficient to invalidate the agreement. The parties reached agreement after full disclosure of their respective financial positions and after negotiations druing which they exchanged offers and counteroffers. The second <em>Rosenberg </em>mle is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">As to the third rule, that the agreement set forth a waiver by the contesting party of his or her rights, this agreement did just that, providing a waiver by the wife of all spousal rights, except those specifically provided in the agreement. See note 6, <em>supra. </em>The wife did challenge the agreement\u2019s validity, raising defenses of lack of capacity and duress, but the judge did not credit her evidence on those issues. See note 12, <em>supra. </em>The findings on this point are fully supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Moreover, the parties were each represented by independent counsel. The judge found that the wife\u2019s attorney had informed her client that, by signing an antenuptial agreement, \u201cshe gave up her right to have the Court make an assignment of property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>to her.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The judge found that the wife \u201cinitiated little discussion\u201d with her attorney concerning the agreement, did not \u201cassert herself regarding any changes\u201d to the draft agreements, and \u201cdid not discuss\u201d what she \u201cmight receive by way of property division from the Court in the event of a divorce.\u201d However, the wife selected her own counsel, and she cannot now attack the agreement on. the ground that her counsel was not sufficiently sophisticated in matters of antenuptial agreements.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Nor can the wife take advantage of her own failure to question her counsel more fully about the legal consequences of signing the antenuptial agreement and thereby avoid the agreement.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Waiver is important because it underscores that each party is exercising a meaningful choice when he or she agrees to give up certain rights in anticipation of marriage. It was therefore correct for the judge to consider such factors as whether each party was represented by independent counsel, the adequacy of the time to review the agreement, the parties\u2019 understanding of the terms of the agreement and their effect, and a party\u2019s understanding of his or her rights in the absence of an agreement. See <em>Button </em>v. <em>Button, supra </em>at 95-96. See also <em>Rin-velt </em>v. <em>Rinvelt, </em>190 Mich. App. 372, 376-379 (1991) (agreement must be \u201centered into voluntarily, with full disclosure, and with the rights of each party and the extent of the waiver of such rights understood\u201d). But the evidence does not support a conclusion that the wife\u2019s waiver of her rights was not meaningful. However minimal her inquiries to her counsel, the failure to explore more fully with her lawyer the effect of signing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>agreement is chargeable to her (or her lawyer), not the husband.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u2022 The wife recognized that marriage conferred certain rights, and that she waived those rights by signing the agreement. The third <em>Rosenberg </em>rule is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">We turn finally to the first <em>Rosenberg </em>rule, the requirement that an antenuptial agreement contain a \u201cfair and reasonable provision\u201d for the contesting party, measured at the time of execution. The application of this legal standard to the parties\u2019 agreement was vigorously contested at trial, as it is on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">In <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Lipnick, supra </em>at 672, we said that it is permissible to consider \u201cthe parties\u2019 respective worth, the parties\u2019 respective ages, the parties\u2019 respective intelligence, literacy, and business acumen, and prior family ties or commitments.\u201d We noted, however, that \u201cthe reasonableness of any monetary provision in an antenuptial contract cannot ultimately be judged in isolation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On the one hand, any examination of the validity of an antenuptial agreement must respect the parties\u2019 freedom to contract. The Legislature has recognized that ante-nuptial agreements settling property rights on marriage serve the useful function of permitting the parties to arrange their financial affairs as they best see fit. See G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 25.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We recognize those same interests. See <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>384 Mass. 591, 598 (1981) (\u201cThere is no reason not to allow persons about to enter into a marriage the freedom to settle their rights in the event their marriage should prove unsuccessful, and thus remove a potential obstacle to their divorce\u201d); <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Lipnick, supra </em>at 673 (\u201cThe right to make antenuptial agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>ments settling property rights in advance of marriage is a valuable personal right which courts should not regulate destructively\u201d). On the other hand, the State has an interest in protecting the financial interests of spouses when they divorce. Marriage is not a mere contract between two parties, but a legal status from which certain rights and obligations arise. Se <em>French </em>v. <em>McAnarney, </em>290 Mass. 544, 546 (1935). See also <em>Button </em>v. <em>Button, supra </em>at 94. It was for this reason that we determined that the freedom to limit or waive legal rights in the event of divorce \u201cis not appropriately left unrestricted.\u201d <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Osborne, supra </em>at 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">To meet the requirement of \u201cfair and reasonable,\u201d at the time of execution an antenuptial agreement need not approximate an alimony award and property division ruling a judge would be required to make under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. Judged by those statutory requirements, the parties\u2019 right to settle their assets as they wish would be meaningless. The relinquishment of claims to the existing assets of a future spouse, even if those assets are substantial, also does not necessarily render an antenuptial agreement invalid. An antenuptial agreement may be most desired when a wealthy individual contemplating marriage seeks to ensure that, if the marriage is not successful, his or her own assets will not accrue to the spouse. Many valid agreements may be one sided, and a contesting party may have considerably fewer assets and enjoy a far different lifestyle after divorce than he or she may enjoy during the marriage. It is only where the contesting party is essentially stripped of substantially all marital interests that a judge may determine that an antenuptial agreement is not \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d and therefore not valid. Cf. <em>French </em>v. <em>McAnarney, supra </em>at 546-548.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Where there is no evidence that either party engaged in fraud, failed to disclose assets fully and fairly, or in some other way took unfair advantage of the confidential and emotional relationship of the other when the agreement was executed, an agreement will be valid unless its terms essentially vitiate the very status of marriage. Our test of \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d is not the same as the test of \u201cunconscionability\u201d that has been adopted in other jurisdictions. <em>Upham </em>v. <em>Upham, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 295, 301 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>(1994). We agree with the reasoning of the Appeals Court in <em>Upham </em>that while there may be substantial overlap between the standards, a standard of unconscionability generally \u201crequires a greater showing of inappropriateness.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing 3 Lindey, Separation Agreements and Antenuptial Contracts \u00a7 90.07 (1993). See <em>Brash </em>v. <em>Brash, </em>407 Mass. 101, 106 (1990) (separation agreement deemed \u201cnot . . . fair and reasonable and, in fact, . . . unconscionable\u201d). A number of States have adopted a test of unconscionability. See, e.g., <em>Scherer </em>v. <em>Scherer, </em>249 Ga. 635, 641 (1982); <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>Gentry, </em>798 S.W.2d 928, 936 (Ky. 1990) ; <em>Ferry </em>v. <em>Ferry, </em>586 S.W.2d 782, 786 (Mo. Ct. App. 1979); <em>MacFarlane </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>132 N.H. 608, 614, 616-617 (1989).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The standard <em>of </em>unconscionability measured at the time of an antenuptial agreement\u2019s making was also adopted in the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> 9C U.L.A. 35 (Master ed. 2001). On the other hand, our \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d test is consonant with the standard recognized in a number of other States. See, e.g., <em>Ex parte Walters, </em>580 So. 2d 1352, 1354 (Ala. 1991) ; <em>Harbom </em>v. <em>Harbom, </em>134 Md. App. 430, 443 (2000), quoting <em>Hartz </em>v. <em>Hartz, </em>248 Md. 47, 63 (1967) (antenuptial agreement upheld if agreement was \u201cfair and equitable under the circumstances\u201d); <em>McKee-Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>444 N.W.2d 259, 267-268 (Minn. 1989) (agreement must be substantively fair at the time of execution and at the time of enforcement); <em>Matter of the Estate of Crawford, </em>107 Wash. 2d 493, 496 (1986) (\u201cif the agreement makes a fair and reasonable provision for the party not seeking its enforcement, the agreement may be upheld\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">We see no reason to replace our standard of \u201cfair and reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>able\u201d when we test the validity of the agreement at the time of execution with a standard of \u201cunconscionability.\u201d As noted by the commissioners, the unconscionability standard was adopted in the Uniform Act in part because it \u201cis used in commercial law, where its meaning includes protection against one-sidedness, oppression, or unfair surprises . . . and in contract law.\u201d 9C U.L.A. 49-50 at comment, quoting Commissioner\u2019s Note, Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act \u00a7 306, 9A (Part I) U.L.A. 249 (Master ed. 1988). Antenuptial agreements by their nature concern confidential relationships, and a standard for testing the validity of a business agreement seems to us inappropriate in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">We turn to examine the judge\u2019s analysis in this case of the fairness and reasonableness of the agreement at the time it was executed. In making her determination, the judge considered the factors enumerated in <em>Dominick </em>v. <em>Dominick, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 85, 92 (1984),<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> as well as some of the factors listed in G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. The judge also emphasized the parties\u2019 lifestyle and standard of living during their marriage, relying on <em>Rosen-blatt </em>v. <em>Kazlow-Rosenblatt, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 297, 301 (1995). We agree with the husband that the judge applied the incorrect legal standard. The considerations that permit a judge to conclude that a separation agreement is \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d are different from those that permit a judge to conclude that an antenuptial agreement is \u201cfair and reasonable.\u201d Parties to a separation agreement are joined in marriage. On termination of their marriage, it is entirely appropriate that the statutory factors that govern the award of property and support should inform, in part, the fairness and reasonableness of a separation agreement. The separation agreement is, after all, a substitute for the independent application by a judge of those same statutory factors. An antenuptial agreement, in contrast, permits the parties to define the material aspects of their relationship before they enter into the status of marriage. If the terms of a proposed antenuptial agreement are unsatisfactory, a party is free not to marry. See C.P. Kindregan, Jr., &amp; M.L. Inker, Family Law and Practice \u00a7 20.10, at 661 (2d ed. 1996) (\u201cIf antenuptial agreements are to have any standing under which the parties can rely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>on them as an effective settlement of their financial interests, then it is clear that a trial judge cannot simply base the judgment nisi on the same factors set out in [G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Applying the correct legal standard, we conclude that the judge\u2019s findings do not support a conclusion that the agreement was not fair and reasonable when it was executed. Substantively, the agreement provided that in the event of divorce the husband would continue to provide for the wife\u2019s support and her health insurance until her death or remarriage; she would also have housing (the marital home) and transportation. These provisions do not strip the wife of her marital rights. In fact, they leave her in a better economic position than she had before the marriage. The first <em>Rosenberg </em>rule is therefore satisfied. That a judge might have awarded her a significantly larger share of the marital estate under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, does not render the agreement unfair and unreasonable at the time of its execution. We recognize that the standard of living the wife will be able to enjoy after any divorce will be significantly lower than the one she enjoyed during her marriage. However, she was free to refuse to sign the antenuptial agreement; she was free to refuse marriage on those terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that th\u00bf antenuptial agreement was valid when it was executed by the parties before their marriage in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">By concluding that the antenuptial agreement \u201cwas not fair and reasonable at the time of execution,\u201d the judge held, in essence, that the agreement was not valid. See <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>384 Mass. 591, 599 (1981) (validity of antenuptial agreements \u201cshould be judged by the same \u2018fair disclosure\u2019 rules\u201d as in <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Lipnick, supra). </em>She nevertheless proceeded to consider whether the agreement was \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d at the time of the divorce trial, although a \u201csecond look\u201d at the agreement is required only when a judge concludes that an an-tenuptial agreement is valid. <em>Id. </em>Because we have concluded that the agreement is indeed valid, we are required to consider whether there is any reason not to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">In <em>Osborne, </em>we suggested that this \u201csecond look\u201d at an an-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>tenuptial agreement gave the judge the authority to deviate from the terms of an antenuptial agreement \u201cin certain situations, for example, where it is determined that one spouse is or will become a public charge, or where a provision affecting the right of custody of a minor child is not in the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We pointed to <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Remick, </em>371 Mass. 433, 436-437 (1976), in which we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">\u201cIf a judge rules, either at the time of the entry of a judgment nisi of divorce or at any subsequent time, that the agreement was not the product of fraud or coercion, that it was fair and reasonable at the time of the entry of the judgment nisi, and that the parties clearly agreed on the finality of the agreement on the subject of interspousal support, the agreement concerning interspousal support should be specifically enforced, absent countervailing equities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">We are not persuaded that the parties\u2019 agreement is not enforceable now.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Before we explain our conclusion, we pause to comment on the standard applicable to the \u201csecond look\u201d a judge must undertake when a party challenges the enforceability of a valid agreement. In <em>Osborne, </em>we described the standard as \u201cfair and reasonable.\u201d <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Osborne, supra. </em>In the twenty years since <em>Osborne </em>was decided, no Massachusetts appellate court has elaborated on that test, and at least one commentator has suggested that the <em>Osborne </em>second-look test is one of \u201cconscionability.\u201d See C.P. Kindregan, Jr., &amp; M.L. Inker, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 20.10, at 661-662.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">The nomenclature attached to the standard of review \u2014 whether it be \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d or \u201cconscionability\u201d \u2014 is but a shorthand descriptor of what is of real moment: the content and meaning behind the label, and the careful analysis required of judges, case by case, of each antenuptial agreement and the circumstances surrounding its enforcement. Indeed, whether termed \u201cunconscionable,\u201d \u201cfair and reasonable,\u201d \u201cinequit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>able,\u201d or something else, in jurisdictions that employ a \u201csecond-look\u201d analysis, the vast majority direct trial judges to undertake an analysis that is remarkably similar in substance. Compare 1 H.H. Clark, Jr., Domestic Relations in the United States \u00a7 1.9, at 52 n.51 (2d ed. 1987) (\u201cUnconscionability seems to be defined as occurring when enforcement of the agreement would leave the spouse without sufficient property, maintenance, or appropriate employment to support himself\u201d), and <em>MacFarlane </em>v. Rich, 132 N.H. 608, 616-617 (1989) (defining \u201cunconscionable\u201d when \u201cprovisions in an antenuptial agreement may lose their vitality by reason of changed circumstances so far beyond the contemplation of the parties at the time they entered the contract that its enforcement would work an unconscionable hardship\u201d), and <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Werle, </em>977 S.W.2d 297, 303 (Mo. Ct. App. 1998), and cases cited (agreement unenforceable that attempts to \u201ctotally take from one of the spouses his or her presumed right to marital property. ... By contrast, where an antenuptial agreement permits each spouse to retain a share of the marital property, albeit a disproportionately small one, courts are more likely to uphold and enforce the agreement\u201d), with <em>Cladis </em>v. <em>Cladis, </em>512 So. 2d 271, 273 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1987) (\u201ca trial court may determine that the agreement . . . does not adequately provide for the challenging spouse and, consequently, is unreasonable\u201d), and <em>Button </em>v. <em>Button, </em>131 Wis. 2d 84, 98-99 (1986) (\u201cIf . . . there are significantly changed circumstances after the execution of an agreement and the agreement as applied at divorce no longer comports with the reasonable expectations of the parties, an agreement which is fair at execution may be unfair to the parties at divorce\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">In Massachusetts, a valid antenuptial agreement is not unenforceable at the time of divorce merely because its enforcement results in property division or an award of support that a judge might not order under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, or because it is one sided. Moreover, it is not appropriate for a judge to use the same test of enforceability of an antenuptial agreement as she would for the enforceability of a separation agreement, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>reasons explained earlier.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Rather, we follow the majority of courts and require that a judge may not relieve the parties from the provisions of a valid agreement unless, due to circumstances occurring during the course of the marriage, enforcement of the agreement would leave the contesting spouse \u201cwithout sufficient property, maintenance, or appropriate employment to support\u201d herself. See 1 H.H. Clark, Jr., Domestic Relations in the United States, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 1.9. Such circumstances might include, for example, the unanticipated mental or physical deterioration of the contesting party (here the antenuptial agreement provided for full health insurance for the wife), or the erosion by inflation of agreed-on support payments to such a degree as to nullify the obvious intention of the parties at the time of the agreement\u2019s execution (here the support payments agreed to by the parties contained an adjustment for cost of living, which the wife does not claim is inadequate). The \u201csecond look\u201d at an agreement is to ensure that the agreement has the same vitality at the time of the divorce that the parties intended at the time of its execution. See <em>MacFarlane </em>v. <em>Rich, supra </em>at 616-617.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">As we noted above, we will not recognize the validity of an antenuptial agreement that essentially strips the contesting spouse of substantially all of her marital interests. For the same reason \u2014 that marriage is a special status from which certain obligations arise \u2014 we will not enforce an antenuptial agreement that prevents a spouse from retaining her marital rights, of which maintenance and support, however disproportionately small, are the most critical. See <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Remick, </em>371 Mass. 433, 436-437 (1976). See also <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>Gentry, </em>798 S.W.2d 928, 936 (Ky. 1990) (agreement enforceable where \u201cthe terms of the agreement were not \u201cmanifestly unfair\u201d; agreement \u201cdid not attempt to limit or deny maintenance or support\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">We have described the inquiry a judge must undertake when a party contests the enforceability of a valid antenuptial agreement. Our description gives content to, but does not depart from, the standard that has been in effect since <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>384 Mass. 591 (1981). There we described the standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>as \u201cfair and reasonable.\u201d We now hold that the term \u201cconscio-nability\u201d is a more appropriate term to describe the standard at the time of enforceability. We trust that this change of nomenclature will be of assistance to judges and members of the bar, and will facilitate the recognition of the distinction between the enforceability of separation agreements and the enforceability of antenuptial agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Applying the standard to the antenuptial agreement at issue here, the judge made no findings, and the wife points to no evidence, that circumstances during the marriage led to any changes of any significance: the wife suffered no debilitating illness, and she is not unable to work should she choose to supplement her income. The judge grounded her decision on three postmarriage factors: \u201cthe lifestyle of the parties during the marriage,\u201d \u201cthe vast disparity between the parties\u2019 ability to acquire future assets and income,\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and \u201cthe fact that this is a ten year marriage which produced two children.\u201d None is sufficient to render the agreement unenforceable. The settlement is, as the judge characterized it, \u201cless than modest, given the financial holdings of the plaintiff.\u201d But the wife was fully apprised of the husband\u2019s holdings before she agreed to these \u201cless than modest\u201d arrangements.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">4. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>The judge ordered the husband to pay the wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. The husband challenges that aspect of the order on three grounds: (1) that the judge \u201clack[ed] jurisdiction\u201d to make the order, (2) that the antenuptial agreement provides that the party in breach is liable for the parties\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees, and (3) that the judge failed to address the reasonableness of the fees. We agree with the husband as to his last claim only.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">General Laws c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 17 and 38,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> permit the judge to make an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Such an award is within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>sound discretion of the judge and will not ordinarily be disturbed. See, e.g., <em>Kennedy </em>v. Kennedy, 400 Mass. 272, 274 (1987) (\u201cThis matter rests in the discretion of the judge\u201d); <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>385 Mass. 30, 39 (1982), quoting <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>361 Mass. 733, 738 (1972) (\u201c[T]he award . . . may be presumed to be right and ordinarily ought not to be disturbed\u201d). See also <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 557, 560 (1982) (\u201cany award made [is] entitled to considerable respect on review\u201d). The factors a judge may consider include the amount of time required to prepare the case and pleadings, the complexity of the issues involved, the value of the marital property, and the spouse\u2019s ability to pay. See <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Kane, supra </em>at 560-561. See also <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra </em>at 274 (consideration of award should appropriately take into account important interests at stake and amount of opposition interposed by opposing party); <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Roderiques, </em>370 Mass. 435, 437 (1976) (in making award of attorney\u2019s fees, \u201cthe basic factors of need and relative economic positions of the spouses\u201d must be considered). The judge was well within her discretion in ordering the husband to pay the wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees during the pendency of the litigation to enable her to defend the action and to contest the validity and enforceability of the antenuptial agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">While the order is proper, the judgment provides only that the husband \u201cshall pay the parties\u2019 counsel fees.\u201d We remand the case to the Probate Court for a determination of the fees for the wife\u2019s attorney \u201cnot incommensurate with an objective evaluation of the services performed.\u201d <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, supra </em>at 38-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment that the antenuptial agreement is unenforceable is reversed. The judgment that the husband pay the wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees is affirmed. The case is remanded to the Probate and Family Court for a determination of the amount of such fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The judge denied the husband\u2019s motion to stay the divorce hearing and payment of attorney\u2019s fees pending the disposition of this appeal.

The agreement provided for a judicial resolution of all matters concerning any children of the marriage, including child support, custody, and visitation. The agreement made no provision for the wife\u2019s only child of her first marriage. At the time of entry of judgment, the husband continued to support the wife\u2019s daughter, as he had done since the parties began living together.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b38-10\">At the time of the execution of the agreement, the parties lived with the wife\u2019s child in the husband\u2019s Hyannis condominium. The agreement provides that the wife would receive the Hyannis property, or a residential property \u201cof substantially equal value\u201d if the Hyannis property were sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">The judge found that, after they were married, the parties continued to live in Hyannis, but that, in 1992, they purchased the \u201cmarital\u201d home in Norwell, and spent their summers at the Hyannis property. After the parties separated the husband purchased a second home in Norwell where he now resides.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b38-12\">The cost of living increase covered the period between the date of the parties\u2019 marriage and the time of the initiation of any divorce action only.

The judge found that the wife did not so inform the husband and showed no reluctance in signing it.

The judge found that this was the attorney\u2019s \u201cfirst case involving a premarital agreement, and her first case involving assets over one million dollars.\u201d The judge did not find that the attorney was not qualified to represent the wife or that she had failed to represent her adequately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b40-8\"><em>Dominick </em>v. <em>Dominick, </em>18 Mass.
