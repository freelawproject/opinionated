L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, for inspection by their respective counsel, subject to a protective order. We affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Shawn Wilder filed a complaint alleging misconduct by Patrolman Michael A. Tarckini when, without cause or explanation, he detained and arrested Wilder at \u00abgunpoint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Worcester police department claimed to have conducted an internal affairs investigation of the allegations and found no cause to discipline Patrolman Tarckini. On October 1, 1999, pursuant to G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 <em>(a),</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the plaintiff requested that the defendants release \u201ccopies of Worcester Police Department records on the internal investigation into the complaints lodged by Shawn Wilder or on his behalf, stemming from an incident [on] May 1, 1999.\u201d The defendants responded that the records sought by the plaintiff were specifically exempt from public disclosure pursuant to one or more of the exceptions set forth in G. L.- c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (a), (b), (c), and <em>(f).</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The plaintiff then petitioned the supervisor of public records (supervisor), appeal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>ing from the defendants\u2019 refusal to comply with its public records request. The supervisor ordered the defendants to release the requested records to the plaintiff, redacting only the names and identifying details of voluntary witnesses, complainants, and informants. The defendants refused to comply with the plaintiff\u2019s request and the supervisor\u2019s order.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">On May 10, 2000, the plaintiff filed in the Superior Court a complaint in the nature of a mandamus action pursuant to G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 <em>(b),</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and 950 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 32.08(2) (1993). The plaintiff sought to compel the defendants to release the following documents: (1) all complaints against the police department arising out of Wilder\u2019s detention and arrest; (2) all police officer, witness, and informant statements relating to such complaints; (3) all internal investigation reports relating to such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>complaints; (4) all investigatory findings relating to such complaints; and (5) all documents relating to the disposition of such complaints.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The plaintiff also filed in the Superior Court a motion to permit inspection of the public records sought, subject to a protective order. Relying on <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>419 Mass. 852 (1995), it asserted that the circumstances of this case warranted inspection so as to test the defendants\u2019 claim that the requested documents were exempt from public disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The judge allowed the plaintiff\u2019s motion, pursuant to a detailed protective order. He acknowledged that the exemptions to public disclosure set forth in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, could apply, to some extent, to the documents requested by the plaintiff. However, the judge stated that he could not conclude, as a matter of law, that such documents were automatically exempt from disclosure without further inquiry into their precise nature. He opined that the custodian of public records could not be the sole arbiter of the applicability of any exemption to disclosure or the purpose behind G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, would be undermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The defendants filed in the Appeals Court a petition for interlocutory relief from the judge\u2019s order pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par. A single justice of the Appeals Court denied the petition. The defendants filed a motion for reconsideration or, in the alternative, for an order reporting the following question to the full court: Whether <em>Wakefield Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Wakefield, </em>431 Mass. 792 (2000), precludes disclosure of internal affairs files under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth. On reconsideration, the single justice declined to grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the defendants\u2019 request for interlocutory relief, but she gave the defendants leave to file a notice of appeal of this issue in the trial court. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The defendants contend that <em>Wakefield Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Wakefield, supra, </em>is dispositive of the plaintiff\u2019s motion to permit inspection of records because it established that the \u201cpersonnel files\u201d exemption in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(c), </em>applies categorically to documents created or assembled as part of an investigation into allegations of misconduct by a particular public employee (here, Patrolman Tarckini).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendants assert that there is no difference between the internal investigation conducted by the school superintendent in <em>Wakefield Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Wakefield, supra, </em>and the internal affairs investigation conducted by the chief of police of Worcester. Because, as the defendants argue, a \u201cpersonnel file\u201d is exempt from disclosure, no amount of review by the plaintiff will make the requested documents public records. The plaintiff, on the other hand, asserts that, in light of the defendants\u2019 contention that <em>all </em>of the internal affairs documents sought by the plaintiff are exempt as \u201cpersonnel files,\u201d its counsel, at a minimum, should be allowed to have access to the requested documents to determine the accuracy of the defendants\u2019 claim of exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The primary purpose of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, is to give the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>broad access to governmental records. See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>388 Mass. 427, 436 (1983). To that end, disclosure is favored by the \u201cpresumption that the record sought is public.\u201d G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 <em>(c). </em>The purpose of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, however, \u201cshould not be used as a means of disregarding the considered judgment of the Legislature that the public right of access should be restricted in certain circumstances.\u201d <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., supra. </em>In G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, the Legislature has identified twelve categories of records, otherwise public, that are exempt from disclosure, including \u201cpersonnel .... files or information\u201d and \u201cinvestigatory materials necessarily compiled out of the public view by law enforcement ... the disclosure of which materials would probably so prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that such disclosure would not be in the public interest.\u201d The custodian of the requested record has the burden of proving, with specificity, the applicability of the relevant exemption. See G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (c); <em>District Attorney for the Norfolk Dist. </em>v. <em>Flatley, </em>419 Mass. 507, 511 (1995). To the extent that only a portion of a public record may fall within an exemption to disclosure, the nonexempt \u201csegregable portion\u201d of the record is subject to public access. See G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (a); <em>Reinstein </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>378 Mass. 281, 287-288, 290 (1979) (\u201c[tjhat some exempt material may be found in a document or report of an investigatory character does not justify cloture as to all of it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">There is no \u201cblanket exemption\u201d to public disclosure for records kept by police departments or for investigatory materials. See <em>District Attorney for the Norfolk Dist. </em>v. <em>Flatley, supra </em>at 512-513 (judge must determine whether prosecutor\u2019s handwritten notes assembled after interview with rape victim constitute public records or are exempt as law enforcement \u201cinvestigatory materials\u201d); <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, </em>371 Mass. 59, 65 (1976) (not every document placed within what may be characterized by police department as investigatory file necessarily exempt from public disclosure). Rather, the applicability of an exemption to public disclosure must be determined on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>case-by-case basis.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Reinstein </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra </em>at 289-290. \u201cThere must be specific proof elicited that the documents sought are of a type for which an exemption has been provided\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, supra </em>at 65-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">This court has sanctioned several mechanisms for the review of \u201cpublic records\u201d to determine whether they are, in fact, exempt from disclosure pursuant to G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth. Where the applicability of an exemption is questionable, in camera inspection by a judge may be appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 66. This court has stated, however, that \u201c[i]n camera inspection and decision by the judge . . . [should] be used only in the last resort.\u201d <em>Reinstein </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra </em>at 295. See <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, supra </em>at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Review of \u201cpublic records\u201d can be accomplished through the use of an itemized and indexed document log in which the custodian sets forth detailed justifications for its claims of exemption. See <em>Reinstein </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra </em>at 295. Opposing counsel then has an opportunity to review the log, as well as the claimed exemptions, and to eliminate from further consideration those documents, or portions thereof, that are not controverted, thereby narrowing the scope of the court\u2019s inquiry.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The judge may employ the method of review he deems most advisable, and there is room for flexibility. <em>Id. </em>at 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">A third avenue for the review of disputed \u201cpublic records\u201d is for a judge to permit counsel for the custodian and counsel for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>the party seeking production to have access to the documents subject to an appropriate protective order. See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, supra </em>at 868. \u201cThe parties could then particularize their arguments to the judge, citing specific materials, or portions of materials, that are exempt or subject to disclosure. This would relieve the judge from a tedious examination of materials against generalized claims that exemptions are applicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 868-869.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In order to determine whether the documents requested by the plaintiff were \u201cpublic records\u201d subject to disclosure or whether they fell into one of the exempt categories, as claimed by the defendants, the judge below decided to proceed with the third mechanism of review for the documents at issue. The documents requested by the plaintiff may, in fact, all be \u201cpersonnel files\u201d that would be exempt from disclosure. However, such documents also may be a combination of personnel information and other materials that would be segregable and subject to disclosure as \u201cpublic records.\u201d Allowing the defendants to decide unilaterally, without any oversight, what documents are subject to disclosure and what documents are exempt is wholly inconsistent with the purpose of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10. Accordingly, given the options that were available to the judge for ascertaining whether the documents sought by the plaintiff were \u201cpublic records,\u201d we conclude that he did not abuse his discretion in allowing limited disclosure to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, subject to a protective order. See <em>Judge Rotenberg Educ. Ctr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Retardation (No. 1), </em>424 Mass. 430, 461 (1997) (scope and conduct of discovery within sound discretion of judge).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Wakefield Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>School, Comm. of Wakefield, supra, </em>is premature. In that case, the trial judge conducted an in camera review of the \u201cpublic record\u201d at issue, a disciplinary decision and report by the superintendent of Wakefield public schools regarding the performance of a Wakefield public school teacher. In concluding that the report, which resulted in the teacher\u2019s four-week suspension, constituted part of the teacher\u2019s \u201cpersonnel . . . file[] or information\u201d and was exempt from public disclosure, we knew the specific type of document that was at issue. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c); <em>Wakefield Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Wakefield, supra </em>at 793, 797-799, and cases cited. Here, the custodian of the records made a blanket assertion that all documents created or assembled as part of the investigation were exempt. Thus, the applicability of the <em>Wake-field Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>case and the \u201cpersonnel files\u201d exemption to public records disclosure can only be ascertained <em>after </em>the \u201crecords\u201d have been reviewed to determine their precise nature. See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., supra </em>at 435 (\u201cNot every bit of information which might be found in a personnel or medical file is necessarily personal so as to fall within the exemption\u2019s protection\u201d). Cf. <em>Department of the Air Force </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 371, 376-377 (1976) (Congress did not create blanket exemption for personnel files under Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552[b][6], on which G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, is generally based). The documents requested by the plaintiff are not to be insulated from disclosure merely because they have been designated by the defendants as constituting a \u201cpersonnel file.\u201d What is critical is the nature or character of the documents, not their label. See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., supra </em>at 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The order allowing the plaintiff\u2019s motion to permit inspection of public records pursuant to the protective order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The complaint alleged that Wilder, who was suffering from a broken neck, was forced to lie face down on the pavement, at which time Patrolman Tarckini stepped with full force on the back of his neck, causing Wilder to lose consciousness. While unconscious, Wilder was handcuffed, arrested, and taken to the University of Massachusetts Medical Center for treatment of his injuries. No criminal charges were brought against Wilder. After investigation by the plaintiff, no record of the physical confrontation, of Wilder\u2019s injuries, or of his transport to the medical center appeared in the Worcester police department\u2019s public log for May 1, 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b395-6\">General Laws c. 66, \u00a7 10 (a), provides, in pertinent part: \u201cEvery person having custody of any public record, as defined in [G.

The names of the citizens, witnesses, and police officers involved were redacted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b396-11\">General Laws c. 66, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>provides, in pertinent part: \u201cA custodian of a public record shall, within ten days following receipt of a request for inspection or copy of a public record, comply with such request. ...

Rather, the defendants claimed that release of the requested documents to the plaintiff, even under a protective order, would violate the interests protected by the investigatory and privacy exemptions set forth in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (c), <em>(f). </em>It was only after the issuance of our decision in <em>Wakefield Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Wakefield, </em>431 Mass. 792 (2000), that the defendants sent a letter to the judge, who had not yet ruled on the plaintiff\u2019s motion, informing him that this case supported the defendants\u2019 arguments against the release of the documents requested by the plaintiff.
