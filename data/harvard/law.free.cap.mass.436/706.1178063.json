Albrecht and Margaret Page Albrecht bought a newly constructed single-family home with nine fireplaces from Alfred G. Clifford, an architect and general contractor. Several years later, the Albrechts learned that there were defects in the fireplaces and chimneys in another house that Clifford had built in their neighborhood. Consequently, they retained an inspector who found similar defects in the Albrechts\u2019 home. The Albrechts filed a complaint in the Superior Court asserting claims against Clifford for breach of contract (Counts I and II), breach of an implied warranty that the residence was constructed in a good and workmanlike manner (Count III), fraud and deceit (Count IV), negligent misrepresentation (Count V), and violation of G. L. c. 93A (Count VI).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A judge in the Superior Court allowed Clifford\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all the Albrechts\u2019 claims. They appealed. We transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion to consider whether an implied warranty arises out of a contract for the sale of a newly constructed residence by a builder-vendor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that there is such a warranty but affirm the entry of summary judgment for the defendant on statute of limitations grounds. We affirm the judge\u2019s summary judgment rulings on the Albrechts\u2019 contract claims on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">1. <em>Background. </em>In March, 1992, Clifford began construction of a single-family home on property he owned in Newbury (residence). In September, 1993, the Albrechts decided to buy the residence, and with the assistance of experienced and capable counsel, negotiated the terms of the sale with Clifford, including certain express warranties. On September 16, 1993, the Albrechts and Clifford executed a standard form purchase and sale agreement (agreement). Exhibit A to the agreement set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>forth the express warranties that Clifford and the Albrechts agreed would survive the delivery of the deed for one year, including: \u201call systems, e.g., plumbing, electrical, heating, fireplaces and chimneys etc., will work properly\u201d; \u201cthe entire premises is built according to municipal and state regulations, including building, zoning, health, safety, electrical and plumbing codes\u201d; and \u201cthe premises have been constructed in a good and workmanlike manner.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *However, this express warranty provision required the Albrechts to give Clifford written notice of any defects within one year of the delivery of the deed. On October 26, 1993, the Albrechts bought the residence from Clifford for $595,000. They moved in on December 23, 1993, but never used any of the fireplaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">In December, 1996, the Albrechts were told by a neighbor that the fireplaces and chimneys in their home, also built by Clifford, were defective. The Albrechts hired a mason whose inspection of the home led him to conclude that the Albrechts\u2019 fireplaces and chimneys were also defective. The Albrechts sent two letters to Clifford asking him to repair the defects, but Clifford and the Albrechts were unable to agree on a solution. On February 6, 1998, the Albrechts filed this lawsuit. During the litigation that ensued, the Albrechts retained an expert who concluded that the chimneys, fireboxes, dampers, flues, and smoke chambers were \u201cnot constructed in a good and workmanlike manner\u201d and did not comply with the State building code.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">2. <em>Implied warranty of habitability. </em>In 1964, the Supreme Court of Colorado was the first court in the country to abandon the doctrine of caveat emptor and hold that a builder-vendor of a completed residential home impliedly warrants that it complies with applicable building code requirements, is built in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>workmanlike manner, and is suitable for habitation. <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Donohoe, </em>154 Colo. 78, 83-84 (1964). Since the decision in <em>Carpenter, </em>the majority of jurisdictions have similarly abandoned the doctrine of caveat emptor,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and adopted implied warranties of habitability or good workmanlike quality in the sale of newly constructed houses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although we have abandoned the doctrine of caveat emptor in the context of residential leases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>and held that such leases carry with them an implied warranty of habitability,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> until today, we have not adopted such a warranty in the sale of new homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">There are a number of important policy considerations that have led other jurisdictions to adopt the type of implied warranty urged on us in this case. An implied warranty assures that consumers receive that for which they have bargained, an objectively habitable home, see <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Cannon Hill Estates, Ltd., </em>2 K.B. 113, 120-121 (1931); it protects purchasers from structural defects that are nearly impossible to ascertain by inspection after the home is built, see <em>Christensen </em>v. <em>R.D. Sell Constr. Co., 774 </em>S.W.2d 535, 538 (Mo. Ct. App. 1989); and it imposes the burden of repairing latent defects on the person who has the opportunity to notice, avoid, or correct them during the construction process, see <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Schuster-Graham Homes, Inc., </em>194 Colo. 441, 444 (1978). See also <em>Hines </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>913 S.W.2d 373, 375 (Mo. Ct. App. 1996) (\u201cThe cause of action is directed to structural defects that a builder-vendor has the opportunity to observe but fails to correct; defects that, through the construction process, become latent and not subject to discovery by inspection\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">These sound policy reasons lead us to adopt an implied warranty of habitability that attaches to the sale of new homes by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>builder-vendors in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The adoption of such a warranty is also consistent with the protections that our law affords consumers in other contexts. See <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Hemingway, </em>363 Mass. 184 (1973) (implied warranty of habitability in residential leases); <em>George </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>333 Mass. 496 (1956) (implied warranty in construction contracts to do workmanlike job and use reasonable skill). See also G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-314 (implied warranty of merchantability for goods). Its purpose is to protect a purchaser of a new home from latent defects that create substantial questions of safety and habitability. While the scope of this warranty must be left largely to case-by-case determination, a home that is unsafe because it deviates from fundamental aspects of the applicable building codes, or is structurally unsound, or fails to keep out the elements because of defects of construction, would breach the implied warranty we adopt today.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">This implied warranty is independent and collateral to the covenant to convey, and survives the passing of title to and taking possession of the real estate. It cannot be waived or disclaimed, because to permit the disclaimer of a warranty protecting a purchaser from the consequences of latent defects would defeat the very purpose of the warranty.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">This implied warranty does not make the builder an insurer against any and all defects in a home, impose on the builder an obligation to deliver a perfect house, or protect against mere defects in workmanship, minor or procedural violations of the applicable building codes, or defects that are trivial or aesthetic. Its adoption is not intended to affect a buyer\u2019s ability to inspect a house before purchase, to condition the purchase on a satisfactory inspection result, or to negotiate additional express warranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">To establish a breach of the implied warranty of habitability a plaintiff will have to demonstrate that (1) he purchased a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>house from the defendant-builder-vendor; (2) the house contained a latent defect; (3) the defect manifested itself only after its purchase; (4) the defect was caused by the builder\u2019s improper design, material, or workmanship; and (5) the defect created a substantial question of safety or made the house unfit for human habitation. In addition, the claim must be brought within the three-year statute of limitations and the six-year statute of repose set forth in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The motion judge concluded that the Albrechts\u2019 claim for relief under a theory of implied warranty failed because no such cause of action had been recognized in Massachusetts. Having recognized such a warranty, we now apply the principles just announced to the record on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The Albrechts are purchasers of a newly constructed home from a builder-vendor, and the defects about which they complain were discovered after they purchased the residence. In addition, based on their expert\u2019s affidavit, the Albrechts have adequately demonstrated, for purposes of summary judgment,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that there are genuine issues of disputed fact about whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>defects were caused by the builder\u2019s improper design and workmanship, and whether they created a substantial question of safety.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Whether the Albrechts can adequately demonstrate that the defects were \u201clatent\u201d is more questionable. Latent defects are conditions that are hidden or concealed, and are not discoverable by reasonable and customary observation or inspection. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 429, 887 (7th ed. 1999). The defects in this case, however, were in some measure readily observable. In concluding that the fireplaces and chimneys were defective, the Albrechts\u2019 expert did not have to dismantle them or any other part of the residence. He merely made observations and measurements of the materials and components (e.g., hearths, fireplace boxes, dampers, flues, smoke chambers) that were readily accessible.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Admittedly, some of the observations (e.g., smoke chambers, flues, and chimney interiors) were more difficult than others (hearths, fireplace boxes, and dampers), and were made with the assistance of video equipment. Whether the discovery and correction of the obvious defects would have led to the discovery of those which were more difficult to observe is a close question on summary judgment, but is one that we need not resolve. We conclude, as the motion judge did, that even assuming a cause of action for the violation of an implied warranty, the Albrechts were barred from pursuing this claim because of their failure to raise it within the three-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">3. <em>Statute of limitations. </em>The Albrechts bought the residence on October 26, 1993, moved in on December 23, 1993, and filed their complaint on February 6, 1998, more than four years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>later. The motion judge concluded that, absent tolling of the applicable statutes of hmitations, the claims for fraud and deceit (Count IV), negligent misrepresentation (Count V), and G. L. c. 93A (Count VI) were time barred.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He also concluded that the statutes were not tolled in the circumstances of this case. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">To defeat Clifford\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the Al-brechts sought to invoke the discovery rule. \u201cThe rule, which operates to toll a limitations period until a prospective plaintiff learns or should have learned that he has been injured, may arise in three circumstances: where a misrepresentation concerns a fact that was \u2018inherently unknowable\u2019 to the injured party, where a wrongdoer breached some duty of disclosure, or where a wrongdoer concealed the existence of a cause of action through some affirmative act done with the intent to deceive.\u201d <em>Patsos </em>v. <em>First Albany Corp., </em>433 Mass. 323, 328 (2001), citing <em>Protective Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>425 Mass. 615, 631-632 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">We treat as a single argument the Albrechts\u2019 contention on appeal that there was no reason that they \u201cknew or should have known\u201d about the alleged defects, and the motion judge\u2019s conclusion that the alleged defects were not \u201cinherently unknowable.\u201d See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>423 Mass. 467, 473 n.7 (1996), and cases cited (\u201cinherently unknowable\u201d standard is no different from and is used interchangeably with the \u201cknew or should have known\u201d standard). \u201c[T]o the extent that any misrepresentation concerns a fact which was \u2018inherently unknowable\u2019 by the plaintiffs at the time it was made and at the time of the sale ... a cause of action for deceit in the sale of real estate accrues when a buyer learns of the misrepresentation or when the buyer reasonably should have learned of the misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Jablonski, </em>371 Mass. 482, 485-486 (1976). \u201cInherent unknowability is not a fact, but rather a conclusion to be drawn from the facts.\u201d <em>Melrose Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co., </em>402 Mass. 27, 31-32 n.4 (1988) (question of inherent unknowability is properly for court to answer in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>case tried to master and without jury). Plaintiffs who assert that their cases should not be barred by the statute of limitations have the burden of demonstrating that they did not know of the defect within the statute of limitations and that \u201cin the exercise of reasonable diligence, they should not have known.\u201d <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Jablonski, supra </em>at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The Albrechts claim that the purported defects were inherently unknowable and that they did not have any reason to suspect that there was a problem until December, 1996, when neighbors told them about their own problems with their fireplaces and chimneys. The motion judge concluded from the undisputed facts that the Albrechts\u2019 claims were not \u201cinherently unknowable\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">\u201c[T]he defects alleged were readily seen on an inspection conducted sometime after December of 1996. Such an inspection equally as well could have been conducted in 1993 when the Albrechts moved in. Similarly, the mere use of at least some of the nine fireplaces should have signalled a problem, if there was one. And perhaps most obviously, charges that the hearths were the wrong size or the fireboxes not deep enough presented situations that were in plain sight arid discoverable by simple measurements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Whether the defects were inherently unknowable or not, we conclude that on the record of undisputed facts, the Albrechts cannot meet their burden of demonstrating that \u201cin the exercise of reasonable diligence, they should not have known\u201d of them. <em>Friedman </em>v. Jablonski, <em>supra. </em>It was not reasonable as a matter of law for the Albrechts neither to inspect<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> nor to use the fireplaces when they knew the express warranty on the fireplaces and chimneys, which they had negotiated, lasted only one year. This conclusion is also implicit in the judge\u2019s conclusion that the defects were not \u201cinherently unknowable\u201d in the circumstances of this case. The statutes of limitations were therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>not tolled and the Albrechts\u2019 claims for fraud and deceit, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of G. L. c. 93A were filed after the applicable statutes of limitations had expired. For the same reason, the three-year statute of limitations provided in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, expired on the claim for breach of the implied warranty of habitability announced in today\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">4. <em>Breach of contract claims (Counts I &amp; II). </em>The Albrechts allege in Count I of their complaint that Clifford breached the terms of the purchase and sale agreement because \u201cthe Residence delivered to the Albrechts at or about the time of delivery of the deed was not completed in accordance with the requirements of the contract and is in violation of certain building laws.\u201d In Count II of their complaint, the Albrechts allege that Clifford breached the terms of the express warranty contained in Exhibit A to the purchase and sale agreement by failing \u201cto complete the construction of the Residence in a good and workmanlike manner and in accordance with all applicable Massachusetts building laws and regulations.\u201d The judge entered summary judgment on Count I because it was based on a paragraph of the purchase and sale agreement (paragraph 9) that did not survive the Albrechts\u2019 acceptance of the deed but merged with it. The judge dismissed Count II as barred by the parties\u2019 own limitation period as set forth in the warranty itself. We agree with both of these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Acceptance of a deed ordinarily merges all obligations in the purchase and sale agreement, except for those specified in the deed itself. <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>M &amp; D Bldrs., Inc., </em>360 Mass. 54, 59 (1971). Consistent with this rule of merger, the agreement in this case expressly states that: \u201cThe acceptance of a deed by the BUYER . . . shall be deemed to be a full performance and discharge of every agreement and obligation herein contained or expressed, except such as are, by the terms hereof, to be performed after the delivery of said deed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">There is an exception to this general rule when a home builder agrees to undertake an obligation, such as constructing or repairing a building on the property, that is in addition or collateral to the conveyance of the deed. See <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>M &amp; D Bldrs., Inc., supra </em>at 60 (\u201cthe plaintiffs\u2019 acceptance of the deed operated as a merger or waiver only to the extent of precluding any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>claim that the title which the defendant conveyed did not satisfy the requirements of the agreement\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The Albrechts contend that paragraph 9 of the agreement created an obligation that was collateral to the conveyance of the deed and, as such, constituted a contractual warranty that the residence would comply with the applicable building codes. This contention is incorrect. Paragraph 9 of the agreement states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">\u201cFull possession of [the residence] . . is to be delivered at the time of the delivery of the deed, said premises to be then (a) fully completed in accordance with the requirements hereof, and (b) not in violation of any building, planning, health ... or zoning laws .... The Buyer and its consultants shall be entitled personally to inspect said premises prior to the delivery of the deed in order to determine whether the condition thereof complies with the terms of this or any other clause hereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">This paragraph is not a warranty. Rather, it describes some of the conditions on which the Albrechts could have refused to purchase the residence. The agreement provided that if Clifford had been unable to provide good title, convey or deliver possession of the residence, or \u201cif at the time of the delivery of the deed the premises do not conform with [the agreement\u2019s] provisions\u201d \u2014 including paragraph 9 \u2014 he had up to thirty days to use reasonable efforts to remedy any of these problems. If he failed to fix any problems within that time, the agreement would have become void. We agree with the judge that Count I of the Albrechts\u2019 complaint fails because paragraph 9 is not a contractual warranty that survived the Albrechts\u2019 acceptance of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">The warranties that were to survive the acceptance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>deed were identified in Exhibit A of the agreement. However, those warranties expressly survived the acceptance of the deed for only one year. The Albrechts did not notify Clifford of their problems with the chimneys and fireplaces until May 20, 1997, more than three years after they accepted the deed. We therefore agree that Count II, breach of the express warranties in Exhibit A of the agreement, is barred by the parties\u2019 own limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b723-10\">The Albrechts also sued their realtor, who is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b723-11\">We acknowledge the amicus brief of the Home Builders Association of Massachusetts, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b724-7\">There were additional representations and warranties in Exhibit A that survived the delivery of the deed for an unspecified length of time, including that there was no urea formaldehyde foam insulation, asbestos, or chlordane in the residence; that there were no underground storage tanks on the property; that there were no tenants or other people in possession of the residence; that there were no known mechanics or other workmen\u2019s liens on the property; and that Clifford was not subject to certain Federal income tax withholding provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b724-9\">The judge noted that \u201c[Clifford and the realtor] are not in agreement that all of the chimney and fireplace defects claimed exist or even that they are all \u2018defects.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b725-5\">\u201cCaveat emptor, which traditionally has applied to sales of real estate, developed at a time when a buyer and seller were in equal bargaining positions.
