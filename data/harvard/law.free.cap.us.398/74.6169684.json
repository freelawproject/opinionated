The Order of December 13 purported to issue under the authority of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 332, <em>supra, </em>n. 1, and recited that during</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">\u201cthe past four years the Judicial Council at many meetings has discussed and considered the business of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma and has done so with particular regard to the effect thereon of the attitude and conduct of Judge Chandler who, as the Chief Judge of that District, is primarily responsible for the administration of such business. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The Order noted that during that period petitioner had been a party defendant in both civil and criminal litigation, as well as the subject of two applications to disqualify him in litigation in which on challenge petitioner had refused to disqualify himself.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Order continued with a finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">\u201cJudge Chandler is presently unable, or unwilling, to discharge efficiently the duties of his office; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>a change must be made in the division of business and the assignment of cases in the Western District of Oklahoma; and that the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma requires the orders herein made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Expressly invoking the powers of the Judicial Council under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 332, <em>supra, </em>n. 1, the Order directed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">\"until the further order of the Judicial Council, the Honorable Stephen S. Chandler shall take no action whatsoever in any case or proceeding now or hereafter pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma; that all cases and proceedings now assigned to or pending before him shall be reassigned to and among the other judges of said court; and that until the further order of the Judicial Council no cases or proceedings filed or instituted in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma shall be assigned to him for any action whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">\u201cIt is further ORDERED that in the event the active judges of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, including Judge Chandler, cannot agree among themselves upon the division of business and assignment of cases made necessary by this order, the Judicial Council, upon such disagreement being brought to its attention, will act under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 137 and make such division and assignment as it deems proper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Copies of the above Order were filed in the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma on December 27 and 28, respectively. Another copy was served on Judge Chandler by a U. S. Marshal.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">On January 6, 1966, as previously noted, Judge Chandler filed with this Court his motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of prohibition and/or mandamus directed to the Judicial Council. He also sought a stay of its Order. The Solicitor General, appearing on behalf of the Judicial Council, asked this Court to deny the stay application on the Council\u2019s representation that the Order of December 13 was only temporary pending prompt further inquiry into Judge Chandler\u2019s administration of the business of his court. The stay was denied on January 21, 1966, on the ground that the Order was \u201centirely interlocutory in character pending prompt further proceedings . . . and that at such proceedings Judge Chandler will be permitted to appear before the Council, with counsel . . . .\u201d 382 U. S. 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">On January 24, 1966, Judge Chandler addressed a letter to his fellow district judges indicating that he objected to the removal and reassignment of cases previously assigned and pending before him on December 28, 1965, but that he was <em>not </em>in disagreement with them as to the assignment of all new cases to judges other than himself. Judge Chandler asserted continuing judicial authority, however, over the cases pending before him as of December 28. The following day the judges of the Western District of Oklahoma advised the Judicial Council that all judges of that District had agreed on the division of new business filed in that court, but that they could not agree on the assignment to other judges of cases then pending before Judge Chandler.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">On January 27, 1966, the Judicial Council again convened in special session and ordered a hearing on Feb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>ruary 10, 1966, in Oklahoma City at which Judge Chandler was invited to appear, with counsel if he desired. However, by February 4, when the Council met again, it had been advised that no judge of the Western District, including Judge Chandler, desired to be heard pursuant to the order for hearing. Accordingly, no hearing took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">At this same meeting on February 4, 1966, the Council concluded that there was a disagreement among the District Judges of the Western District as to the division of business; it reached this conclusion on the basis of the disagreement between Judge Chandler and the other District Judges as to the reassignment of cases previously assigned to Judge Chandler as of December 28, 1965. The Council accordingly, acting under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 137 and 332, entered an order authorizing Judge Chandler to continue to sit on cases filed and assigned to him prior to December 28, 1965; the Order assigned to the other judges of the Western District cases filed after that date. This Order of February 4 recited further that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">\u201c4. The division of business and assignment of cases made herein may be amended or modified by written order signed by all active judges of the Western District of Oklahoma, provided that nothing contained herein shall be construed as preventing Judge Chandler from surrendering any pending cases for re-assignment to another active judge or to prevent transfer between judges to whom new business is assigned pursuant to this order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">\u201c5. This order supersedes the orders of the Council entered on December 13, 1965, and on January 27, 1966, entitled \u2018In the Matter of the Honorable Stephen S. Chandler, United States District Judge for the Western District of Oklahoma\u2019 and shall remain in effect until the further order of the Council.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>On February 9, 1966, the Solicitor General filed a memorandum on behalf of the Council suggesting that in light of the above developments, namely the confirmation of Judge Chandler\u2019s authority to dispose of the case load then before him and the assignment of new business in accordance with an order previously agreed to by Judge Chandler, the case had become moot since there was nothing more to argue about. To this memorandum Judge Chandler filed a reply on February 25, 1966, contesting the suggestion that he had acquiesced in the Council\u2019s actions. Judge Chandler argued that his acquiescence in the division of new business settled upon by his fellow district judges was given deliberately for reasons of \u201cstrategy\u201d in order to prevent any possibility that the Council could find that \u201cthe district judges . . . are unable to agree upon the adoption of rules or orders\u201d for the distribution of business and assignment of cases under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">A supplemental memorandum filed by the Solicitor General on behalf of the Council expressed the latter\u2019s position that Judge Chandler should dispose of his pending docket of pre-December 28, 1965, cases before seeking assignment of new cases. In view of Judge Chandler\u2019s expressed disagreement with the February 4 Order the Solicitor General withdrew the suggestion of mootness. Later in March 1966 Judge Chandler submitted a reply to that supplemental memorandum asserting that the Council was continuing to act beyond its authority by purporting to require that he certify to it his subsequent willingness and ability to undertake new business. He contended that the supplemental memorandum setting forth the condition that he must apply for assignment was in effect a new order fixing still another condition on the exercise of his judicial office.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">On July 12, 1967, the Judicial Council convened and, in light of a report from the District Judges of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Western District showing that Judge Chandler had only 12 cases then pending, concluded that a modification of the Order of February 4, 1966, might be in order. The Council transmitted a copy of the minutes of the meeting to the District Judges and asked them to consider anew and agree upon a division of business within the Western District. On August 28, 1967, Judge Chandler wrote his district judge colleagues claiming that the Council\u2019s action of July 12 was but another \u201cillegal effort\u201d to create a situation in which the Council could assert its powers under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 137 to assign and apportion cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">On September 1, 1967, the Western District Judges, including Judge Chandler, advised the Judicial Council that \u201cthe current order for the division of business in this district <em>is agreeable </em>under the circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis added.) When the Council convened two weeks later, it noted the letter expressing agreement and concluded that there need be no new order in the case; accordingly the Order of February 4 was left in effect. All of these developments were reported to the Clerk of this Court and are part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">In essence petitioner challenges all orders of the Judicial Council relating to assignment of cases in the Western District of Oklahoma as fixing conditions on the exercise of his constitutional powers as a judge. Specifically, petitioner urges that the Council has usurped the impeachment power, committed by the Constitution to the Congress exclusively. While conceding that the statute here invoked confers some powers on the Judicial Council, petitioner contends that the legitimate administrative purposes to which it may be turned do not include stripping a judge of his judicial functions as he claims was done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>The Judicial Council contends that petitioner seeks to invoke the original jurisdiction of this Court in a case to which such jurisdiction does not extend. The Council argues that the purely administrative action taken in this case has never been reviewed by any court and cannot now be reviewed in an original proceeding under the guise of a claim under the All Writs Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The Judicial Council also contends that the Order of December 13, 1965, has been altogether superseded by the Order of February 4, 1966. The latter, in accordance with petitioner's desire, gave back those cases that had been temporarily withdrawn from Judge Chandler. It also continued in force the assignment and division of judicial business agreed upon by the District Judges including Judge Chandler. Alternatively, the Council contends that even absent petitioner\u2019s agreement on the division of cases, nonetheless the Council\u2019s action is authorized by 28 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 137 and 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The Solicitor General, who has filed a brief as <em>amicus curiae, </em>contends that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the petition for a writ of mandamus or prohibition when a Judicial Council order is directed to a district judge because it acted as a judicial, not an administrative, tribunal for purposes of meeting the requirement that the case fall within this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. The Solicitor General suggests that the Council is nothing more nor less than the Court of Appeals sitting <em>en banc, </em>and that the proceedings in the present case may be analogized to a disbarment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> From this the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Solicitor General concludes that the case falls within the extraordinary relief available through the All Writs Act. That conclusion in turn rests on the further assumption that this Court\u2019s supervisory authority over lower courts under \u00a7\u00a713 and 14 of the first Judiciary Act, 1 Stat. 80,81, was not withdrawn when the latter two sections were repealed in favor of the All Writs Act by the revision of the Judicial Code in 1948. The Solicitor General concludes, however, that even though there is appellate jurisdiction in this Court, nonetheless it ought not to be exercised since the Order of December 13 has been superseded for four years by the Order of February 4, the terms of which have been expressly approved by petitioner. The respondent Council also urges this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Whether the action taken by the Council with respect to the division of business in Judge Chandler\u2019s district falls to one side or the other of the line defining the maximum permissible intervention consistent with the constitutional requirement of judicial independence is the ultimate question on which review is sought in the petition now before us. The dissenting view of this case seems to be that the action of the Judicial Council relating to assignment of cases is an impingement on judicial independence. There can, of course, be no disagreement among us as to the imperative need for total and absolute independence of judges in deciding cases or in any phase of the decisional function. But it is quite another matter to say that each judge in a complex system shall be the absolute ruler of his manner of conducting judicial business. The question is whether Congress can vest in the Judicial Council power to enforce reasonable standards as to when and where court shall be held, how long a case may be delayed in decision, whether a given case is to be tried, and many other routine matters. As to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>these things \u2014 and indeed an almost infinite variety of others of an administrative nature \u2014 can each judge be an absolute monarch and yet have a complex judicial system function efficiently?</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The legislative history of 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 332 and related statutes is clear that some management power was both needed and granted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That is precisely what a group of distinguished chief judges and others seem to have had in mind when, in 1939, Congress was urged by Chief Justice Hughes, Chief Judge Groner, Judges Parker, Stephens and Biggs, and others to give judges a statutory framework and power whereby they might \u201cput their own house in order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Many courts \u2014 including federal courts \u2014 have informal, unpublished rules which, for example, provide that when a judge has a given number of cases under submission, he will not be assigned more cases until opinions and orders issue on his \u201cbacklog.\u201d These are reasonable, proper, and necessary rules, and the need for enforcement cannot reasonably be doubted. These internal rules do not come to public notice simply because reasonable judges acknowledge their necessity and abide by their intent. But if one judge in any system refuses to abide by such reasonable procedures it can hardly be that the extraordinary machinery of impeachment is the only recourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>These questions have long been discussed and debated; they are not easy questions and the risks suggested by the dissents are not to be lightly cast aside. But for the reasons that follow we do not find it necessary to answer them because the threshold question in this case is whether we have jurisdiction to entertain the petition for extraordinary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The authority of this Court to issue a writ of prohibition or mandamus \u201ccan be constitutionally exercised only insofar as such writs are in aid of its appellate jurisdiction. <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>1 Cranch 137, 173-80.\u201d <em>Ex parte Peru, </em>318 U. S. 578, 582 (1943). If the challenged action of the Judicial Council was a judicial act or decision by a judicial tribunal,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> then perhaps it could be reviewed by this Court without doing violence to the constitutional requirement that such review be appellate. As the concurring and dissenting opinions amply demonstrate, finding the prerequisites to support a conclusion that we do have appellate jurisdiction in this case would be no mean feat. It is an exercise we decline to perform since we conclude that in the present posture of the case other avenues of relief on the merits may yet be open to Judge Chandler. See <em>Rescue Army </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>331 U. S. 549, 568-575 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Judge Chandler contends that his acquiescence in the division of business agreed upon by his fellow judges was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>given under some kind of duress flowing from the Council\u2019s Order of December 13, and that it was also given as a matter of \u201cstrategy,\u201d specifically in order to avoid the appearance of an absence of agreement among the District Judges as to a division of work. By so doing he sought to avoid creating a situation in which the Council would undoubtedly have had jurisdiction under \u00a7 137. The Council, however, noting that the judges had been unable to reach agreement as to those cases previously assigned to Judge Chandler, found nonetheless that a disagreement existed. Despite his apparent acquiescence, Judge Chandler contends that his actions since then belie his words; specifically that his subsequent attack in this Court established his disagreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Whatever the merits of this apparent attempt to have it both ways, one thing is clear: except for the effort to seek the aid of this Court, Judge Chandler has never once since giving his written acquiescence in the division of business sought any relief from either the Council or some other tribunal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Were he to disagree with the present division of business, the Judicial Council would thereupon be obliged to \u201cmake the necessary orders.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 137. He chose to avoid that course. As Mr. Justice Harlan\u2019s concurring opinion points out, Judge Chandler apparently desires to have the <em>status quo ante </em>restored without the bother of either disagreeing with the present order of the Council or persuading his fellow district judges to enter another. To say the least this is a remarkable litigation posture for a lawyer to assert in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Instead, Judge Chandler brought an immediate challenge in this Court to the Order of December 13. As noted above, <em>supra, </em>at 79, we denied any relief on the ground that that Order was \u201centirely interlocutory in character pending prompt further proceedings . . . and that at such proceedings Judge Chandler will be permitted to appear before the Council, with counsel <em>. . . </em>He expressly refused to attend the hearing called by the Council for February 10, 1966, in response to this Court\u2019s order; in his brief he gives as a reason that he was unwilling to \u201cattend a hearing conducted by a body whose jurisdiction he challenged . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As a result of that refusal we have no record, no petition for relief addressed to any agency, court or tribunal of any kind other than this Court, and a very knotty jurisdictional problem as well.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Parenthetically it might be noted that Chandler could have appeared, in person or by counsel, and challenged the jurisdiction of the Council without impairing his claim that it had no power in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">As noted above, and as conceded by the dissents, the Order of December 13, 1965, was terminated by the Order of February 4, 1966. Judge Chandler has twice expressed agreement with the disposition of judicial business effected by that latter Order. Nothing in this record suggests that, were he to express disagreement, relief would not be forthcoming. On the contrary, on July 12, 1967, the Council expressly invited the judges of Chandler\u2019s district to agree among themselves upon a new rule or order for the division of business, and all the judges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>wrote back advising the Council that \u201cthe current order for the division of business in this district is agreeable under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Whether the Council\u2019s action was administrative action not reviewable in this Court, or whether it is reviewable here, plainly petitioner has not made a case for the extraordinary relief of mandamus or prohibition. The motion for leave to file the petition is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\n<em>Denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b145-6\">MR.

Congress did not spell out procedures for giving coercive effect to council orders, and the legislative history sheds no light on whether Congress intended this statute to be implemented by regulations. Standing alone, \u00a7 332 is not a model of clarity in terms of the scope of the judicial councils\u2019 powers or the procedures to give effect to the final sentence of \u00a7 332. Legislative clarification of enforcement provisions of this statute and definition of review of Council orders are called for.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\"> We find nothing in the legislative history to suggest that the Judicial Council was intended to be anything other than an administrative body functioning in a very limited area in a narrow sense as a \u201cboard of directors\u201d for the circuit. Whether that characterization is valid or not, we find no indication that Congress intended to or did vest traditional judicial powers in the Councils. We see no constitutional obstacle preventing Congress from vesting in the Circuit Judicial Councils, as administrative bodies, authority to make \u201call necessary orders for the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts within [each] circuit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b143-6\"> We express no opinion as to whether he could, for instance, \u25a0 have brought an action in the nature of mandamus to compel \u201can officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed . . .\u201d to him, 28 U.

The novelty and unusual character of these questions require, regrettably, an opinion of some length.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">I am perplexed by the Court\u2019s explanation for its failure to reach the issues presented by Judge Chandler\u2019s petition. As the Court states, the issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to review the orders of the Judicial Council, and, if so, whether those orders are invalid because beyond the statutory and constitutional bounds of the Council\u2019s authority. The Court says, correctly I believe, that \u201cthe threshold question in this case is whether we have jurisdiction to entertain the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>tion for extraordinary relief.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 86. However, that question is never decided, and the Court's opinion closes with the statement that whether or not we have jurisdiction, \u201cplainly petitioner has not made a case for the extraordinary relief of mandamus or prohibition.\u201d The predicate for this conclusion appears to be that Judge Chandler has an adequate remedy available before the Council, which he must invoke before seeking relief here. As authority for this unusual disposition, the Court cites only <em>Rescue Army </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>331 U. S. 549 (1947), a decision that I do not consider lends itself to the gloss the Court today places upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">It is clear that, although the Council\u2019s Order of December 13, 1965, has been revoked, the subsequent Order of February 4, 1966, is still outstanding and is attacked by Judge Chandler as beyond the authority constitutionally exercisable by the Council under either \u00a7 137 or \u00a7 332 of the Judicial Code. Judge Chandler has twice certified to the Council his acquiescence in the allocation of business mandated by the February 4 Order; indeed, his first certification was relied upon by the then Solicitor General, appearing for the Council in February 1966, as a basis for suggesting that the case was moot. Judge Chandler immediately responded that he did not in any way concede the Council\u2019s power to enter the February 4 Order, and that his indication of acquiescence made to the Council did not constitute such a concession. In light of this continued challenge to the order, the Solicitor General in March 1966 agreed \u201cthat the case can no longer be deemed moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The case thus reached the posture in which it now stands: Judge Chandler unequivocally asserts that the February 4 Order is beyond the Council\u2019s authority. If his contention were sound, the only validly outstanding directives for the allocation of business in the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Court would be those \u201crules and orders\u201d of that court, issued under \u00a7 137, that were in effect prior to December 13,1965. Though the terms of those rules and orders are not before us, it is evident that they provided for assignment to Judge Chandler of a portion of the cases continually filed in his court. In challenging the validity of the Council\u2019s attempts to modify the previous allocation of business, and in requesting restoration of the <em>status quo ante, </em>Judge Chandler seeks to achieve a marked departure from the manner in which business is currently allocated.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Judge Chandler claims a right to accomplish this result <em>without </em>the necessity of mobilizing all the judges of his district to change the assignment of business by unanimous action, as the February 4 Order allows them to do. Further, since he denies the Council\u2019s authority to deprive him of all new business, he of course denies that he should be required to request the Council to renege as a condition of obtaining review of its outstanding order. He claims that it is illegal for the Council to deprive him of new cases, and equally so for the Council to condition his access to new cases upon his making a request to it that is tantamount to a form of a certification of disagreement under \u00a7 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Although the Court states that it does not decide the merits of this claim, see <em>ante, </em>at 87, I can read its opinion only as a determination that the claim is insubstantial. The Court states that it is a \u201cremarkable litigation posture\u201d for Judge Chandler to argue that the Council has no authority to force him to choose between remaining without new business, seeking further action by the Council, or seeking unanimous action by the District Judges. The Court denies relief because \u201c[njothing in this record suggests that, were he to express disagreement, relief would not be forthcoming,\u201d a decision that can only be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>premised on a holding that he is denied no rights by being relegated to that course of action. <em>Ante, </em>at 87, 88-89. But this is the contrary of what Judge Chandler contends, and a conclusion with which two members of this Court sharply differ. As explained in Part III, <em>infra, </em>I too believe that Judge Chandler now lacks meritorious ground for complaint. However, I do not believe that the Court can properly make that holding without first determining its jurisdiction to consider the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><em>Rescue Army, supra, </em>provides no authority for such a procedure. That decision represents one branch of the long-settled doctrine that this Court will not determine constitutional questions unnecessarily or in a case that does not present them with sufficient clarity to make possible the circumspect consideration they require. See generally <em>id., </em>at 568-585; <em>Ashwander </em>v. <em>Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>297 U. S. 288, 346 (1936) (Brand\u00e9is, J., concurring). Because the constitutional issues in <em>Rescue Army </em>were presented in a highly abstract and speculative form, and were clouded by factors not present in this case,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Court dismissed the appeal, declining to adju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>dicate them. It concluded that an appellant there, faced with state criminal charges, would have to undergo a trial on the charges before obtaining review in this Court of his constitutional claims. As in this case, the Court\u2019s action had the effect of rejecting the appellant\u2019s claim of a right to obtain relief without further proceedings in a lower tribunal, see 331 U. S., at 584. However, the Court made that disposition only <em>after </em>carefully determining that it had jurisdiction in the case. See <em>id., </em>at 565-568.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">The Court does suggest, by footnote, an alternative basis for its refusal to consider Judge Chandler\u2019s petition. <em>Ante, </em>at 87 n. 8. If an adequate means of review of Council orders were available in the Federal District Court under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1361, that might justify this Court\u2019s staying its hand until such review had been sought. However, as pointed out by the United States as <em>amicus curiae, </em>it seems wholly unrealistic to suggest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>that an appropriate remedy could be obtained from a District Court. The District Court mandamus statute, \u00a7 1361, extends to \u201cofficers,\u201d \u201cemployees,\u201d and \u201cagencies\u201d of the United States; there is no indication that it empowers the District Courts to issue mandamus to other judicial tribunals. Thus, as the Judicial Council seems to concede, the availability of a remedy under that statute hinges on a determination, which the Court avoids making, whether the Council\u2019s actions under review were judicial or not. Brief for Respondent 19. Beyond that, direct review by a district judge of the actions of circuit judges would present serious incongruities and practical problems certainly not contemplated when \u00a7 1361 was enacted. It is unrealistic for the Court to imply that \u00a7 1361 presents an appropriate avenue of relief justifying this Court\u2019s refusal to exercise its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">I do not disagree with the Court that the issues presented by Judge Chandler\u2019s petition are troublesome ones that we might wish to avoid deciding. However, I can perceive no reasoned justification for the Court\u2019s refusal to decide them. Chief Justice Marshall long ago enunciated the principle that should govern us here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">\u201cIt is most true that this Court will not take jurisdiction if it should not: but it is equally true, that it must take jurisdiction if it should. . . . With whatever doubts, with whatever difficulties, a case may be attended, we must decide it, if it be brought before us. We have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not given.\u201d <em>Cohens </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">That principle has not been abrogated by the <em>Rescue Army </em>decision, which merely undertook to define the limits of our ability to adjudicate constitutional issues in cases that adequately present them. I find no license in that decision for the action taken by the Court today.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Before Judge Chandler\u2019s attack on the orders of the Judicial Council can be considered, it must be determined whether the Court possesses jurisdiction to entertain his petition for a writ of mandamus or prohibition. While I agree with my Brothers Black and Douglas that the Court does have jurisdiction, I think that the question warrants fuller treatment than they have given it.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">A. Constitutional Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Any discussion of the scope of this Court\u2019s authority under the Constitution must take as its point of departure <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>1 Cranch 137 (1803), where the Court held that except in those instances specifically enumerated in Article III of the Constitution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> this Court may exercise only appellate \u2014 not original \u2014 jurisdiction. Because this suit is not cognizable as an original cause, the question initially to be faced is whether it is within our appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The Court was asked in <em>Marbury </em>to issue a writ of mandamus to compel the Secretary of State to deliver to an appointed justice of the peace his previously signed commission. After noting that the suit did not fall within any of the enumerated heads of original jurisdiction, the Court, through Chief Justice Marshall, concluded: \u201cTo enable this court, then, to issue a <em>mandamus, </em>it must be shown to be an exercise of appellate jurisdiction, or to be necessary to enable [the Court] to exercise appellate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 175. The Court held that issuance of mandamus to a nonjudicial federal officer would not be an exercise of appellate, but of original, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>jurisdiction. Thus the statute that purported to authorize such action by the Supreme Court was ineffective. See 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a7 1761 (5th ed. 1891).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The Chief Justice stated, as the \u201cessential criterion of appellate jurisdiction, that it revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted, and does not create that cause.\u201d 1 Cranch, at 175. Beyond cavil, the issuance of a writ of mandamus to an inferior <em>court </em>is an exercise of appellate jurisdiction. <em>In re Winn, </em>213 U. S. 458, 465-466 (1909). If the challenged orders of the Judicial Council in this instance were \u201can exercise of judicial power,\u201d this Court is constitutionally vested with jurisdiction to review them, absent any statute curtailing such review. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>United States, </em>289 U. S. 553, 566 (1933); <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>279 U. S. 716, 723 (1929); <em>In re Sanborn, </em>148 U. S. 222, 224 (1893). On the other hand, if they were not, <em>Marbury </em>alone is sufficient authority to support a conclusion that this suit is beyond this Court\u2019s power under Article III. An analysis of the nature of the Council\u2019s orders must begin with consideration of the statute by which the Council was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The Judicial Councils of the circuits were brought into being by the Act of August 7, 1939, which was termed \u201cAn act to provide for the administration of the United States courts, and for other purposes.\u201d 53 Stat. 1223. The major purposes of the Act were to free the federal courts from their previous reliance on the Justice Department in budgetary matters, and \u201cto furnish to the Federal courts the administrative machinery for self-improvement, through which those courts will be able to scrutinize their own work and develop efficiency and promptness in their administration of justice.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 702, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1939). To this end the Act established the Administrative Office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>of the United States Courts, headed by a Director, to compile statistical data on the operation of the courts and to provide support services of a logistical nature.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Act further established two new entities in each of the judicial circuits: the Judicial Council, composed of all the active circuit judges, and the Judicial Conference, composed of circuit and district judges along with participating members of the bar. The Council, in regular meetings, was to consider the reports of the Director and take \u201csuch action . . . thereon\u201d as might be necessary;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Conference was to meet annually \u201cfor the purpose of considering the state of the business of the courts and advising ways and means of improving the administration of justice within the circuit.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVq\">As these statutory provisions indicate, Congress envisioned quite different functions for the three new bodies. The role of the Administrative Office, and its Director, was to be \u201cadministrative\u201d in the narrowest sense of that term. The Director was entrusted with no authority over the performance of judicial business \u2014 his role with respect to such business was, and is, merely to collect information for use by the courts themselves. Chief Justice Groner of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, who was chairman of the committee of circuit judges that participated in drafting the bill, stressed to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary that the bill would give the Director no \u201csupervision or control over the exercise of purely judicial duties,\u201d because to grant such power to an administrative officer \u201cwould be to destroy the very fundamentals of our theory of government. The administrative officer [the Director] proposed in this bill is purely an administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>officer.\u201d Hearings on S. 188 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 12 (1939) (response to question by Senator Hatch). See also <em>id., </em>at 36 (statement of A. Holtzoff).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The Judicial Conference for each circuit was given a complementary role, again divorced from direct involvement in the disposition by the courts of their judicial business. Patterned in large part after the voluntary conferences that had been held for years in the Fourth Circuit, the Conference was intended to provide an opportunity for friendly interchange among judges and between bench and bar, out of which might grow increased understanding of problems of judicial administration and enhanced cooperation toward their solution. Its function, as indicated by the statutory language quoted above, was to be \u201cpurely advisory.\u201d See Hearings on H. R. 5999 before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 11-12, 17, 23-24 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The Judicial Council, on the other hand, was designed as an actual participant in the management of the judicial work of the circuit. The Act provided that, \u201c[t]o the end that the work of the district courts shall be effectively and expeditiously transacted,\u201d the circuit judges of each circuit were to meet as a council at least twice a year. After consideration of the statistical reports submitted by the Administrative Office, \u201csuch action shall be taken thereon by the council as may be necessary. It shall be the duty of the district judges promptly to carry out the directions of the council as to the administration of the business of their respective courts.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This provision exists today as \u00a7 332 without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>relevant change, except that the 1948 revision of the Judicial Code added a declaration that \u201c[e]ach judicial council shall make all necessary orders for the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts within its circuit,\u201d and correspondingly directed the district judges to carry out all such \u201corders.\u201d The reviser\u2019s note explained this amendment as merely a change in \u201cphraseology,\u201d embodying in new words the original understanding of the powers of the councils. H. R. Rep. No. 308, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., A46 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The most helpful guide in determining the role envisaged for the Judicial Councils is the testimony of Chief Justice Groner, who shouldered most of the task of explaining the purposes of the bill to the committees of both Houses of Congress. He explained that under existing law the circuit judges had \u201cno authority to require a district judge to speed up his work or to admonish him that he is not bearing the full and fair burden that he is expected to bear, or to take action as to any other matter which is the subject of criticism, . . . for which he may be responsible.\u201d Hearings on S. 188, <em>supra, </em>at 11. In contrast, under the proposed bill the Administrative Office would \u201cobserve and see that whatever- is wrong in the administration of justice, from whatever sources it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>may arise, is brought to the attention of the judicial council that it may be corrected, by the courts themselves.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">As examples of the kinds of action a Judicial Council might be expected to take under the proposed bill, Chief Justice Groner suggested that if the statistics showed a particular district court to be falling behind in its work, the Council would \u201csee to it, either that the particular judge who is behind in his work catches up with his work, or that assistance is given to him whereby the work may be made current.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 11. If it appeared that a particular judge \u201chad been sick for 4 or 5 months and had been unable to hold any court, or had been unable, by reason of one thing or another, to transact any business, . . . immediate action could be taken to correct that situation.\u201d Hearings on H. R. 5999, <em>su-pra, </em>at 11. Asked by Representative Walter Chandler \u201cwhat power is given there to require a judge to decide a case that he has had under advisement for months and years,\u201d he responded that the Council, after considering the matter, could issue directions that would be \u201cfinal.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 13. Any \u201clazy judge\u2019s work would be reported to the council, [which] would take the correct action.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 27.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Judge Parker stated his view that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\">\u201cwhat we have done is this, up to this point: We have given to the Circuit Court of Appeals supervisory power over the decisions of the district judges, but we have given them no power whatever over administration by the district judges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">\u201cIf Judge Jones decides a case contrary to the views of the majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals, we can tell him so and reverse him. But if he holds a case under advisement for 2 years, instead of deciding it promptly, there is nothing that we are authorized by the law to do about it in the absence of an application for mandamus. Now, this [bill] authorizes us to do something about it; and I agree with you that something ought to be done about it.\u201d <em>Id.,, </em>at 21.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In place of the inadequate extraordinary remedy of mandamus, which could correct only the extreme abuse in a particular case, the circuit judges, sitting as the Judicial Council, were given the authority for continuous supervision of the flow of work through the district courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In short, the proposed Judicial Council was intended to fill the hiatus of authority that existed under the then-current arrangements, whereby the Attorney Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>eral collected data about the operation of the courts but had no power to take corrective action, \u201cexcept, perhaps, as a result of the moral suasion of his office.\u201d The proposed bill would allow compilation of more complete information, and would \u201cprovide a method, a legitimate, valid, legal method, by which, if necessary, and when necessary, the courts may clean their own house\u201d; it would \u201cgive a body, in which the authority is firmly lodged, the power to do that and to do it expeditiously.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 8. See generally Report on the Powers and Responsibilities of the Judicial Councils, H. R. Doc. No. 201, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. (1961); Fish, The Circuit Councils: Rusty Hinges of Federal Judicial Administration, 37 U. Chi. L. Rev. 203 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">This legislative history lends support to a conclusion that, at least in the issuance of orders to district judges to regulate the exercise of their official duties, the Judicial Council acts as a judicial tribunal for purposes of this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction under Article III. It seems clear that the sponsors of the bill considered the power to give such orders something that could not be entrusted to any purely \u201cadministrative\u201d agency\u2014 not even to the Administrative Office, which was to be an arm of the judicial branch of government and under the direct control of the Supreme Court and the Judicial Conference of the United States. Chief Justice Groner, in the passage quoted above, stated that to give such power to an administrative agency \u201cwould be to destroy the very fundamentals of our theory of government.\u201d Instead, any problems unearthed by the Director\u2019s studies were to be \u201ccorrected, by the courts themselves.\u201d Hearings on S. 188, <em>supra, </em>at 12-13. See also Hearings on H. R. 5999, <em>supra, </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">There were further references throughout the hearings and committee reports to the fact that the corrective power would be exercised by the courts themselves. <em>E. g., </em>Hearings on S. 188, <em>supra, </em>at 16 (statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>A. Vanderbilt); <em>id., </em>at 31-32 (statement of Hon. Harold M. Stephens); <em>id., </em>at 36 (statement of A. Holtz-off) ; H. R. Rep. No. 702, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (1939). The House report quoted with approval an endorsement of the bill by the American Judicature Society, stating that \u201cthere is no way to fortify judicial independence equal to that of enabling the judges to perform their work under judicial supervision.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>These statements indicate that the power to direct trial judges in the execution of their decision-making duties was regarded as a judicial power, one to be entrusted only to a judicial body.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">In this regard it is important to note that an earlier draft of the 1939 Act would have given responsibility for supervising the lower courts to the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice of the United States. The idea of devolving the authority to councils at the circuit level was suggested by Chief Justice Hughes, who believed that the supervision could be made most effective by \u201cconcentration of responsibility in the various circuits . . . with power and authority to make the supervision all that is necessary to induce competence in the work of all of the judges of the various districts within the circuit.\u201d H. R. Doc. No. 201, <em>supra, </em>at 3. It is equally notable that, while the draftsmen did consider giving district judges some representation on the Councils, see <em>id., </em>at 4r-5, there was apparently no thought given to including nonjudicial officers. These indications leave no doubt that the Councils\u2019 architects regarded the authority granted the Councils as closely bound up with the process of judging itself.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Because the legislative history shows Congress intended the Councils to act as judicial bodies in supervising the district judges, there is no need to decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>whether placement of this authority in a nonjudicial body would violate the constitutional separation of powers, as Chief Justice Groner seems to have believed. It is sufficient to conclude from reason and analogy that this responsibility is of such a nature that it <em>may </em>be placed in the hands of Article III judges to be exercised as a judicial function.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">An order by the Council to a district judge, directing his handling of one or many cases in his court, is an integral step in the progress of those cases from initial filing to final adjudication. Like the district judge\u2019s own orders setting a time for discovery or trial, or transferring a case to another district pursuant to 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1404 (a), such an order, even though concerned with a matter of \u201cjudicial administration,\u201d is part of the official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>conduct of judicial business. Unlike the more common orders of the district court, the Council\u2019s orders involve supervision of a subordinate judicial officer. But in this regard they are not unlike the extraordinary writ of mandamus, which Judge Parker thought the Council\u2019s orders would supplement, or the orders entered by courts in proceedings for disbarment of an attorney. In short, the function of the Council in ordering the district judges to take certain measures related to the cases before them is, as the legislative history indicates Congress understood, judicial in nature.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">To support a contrary conclusion, respondent points to the language of Justice Holmes in <em>Prentis </em>v. <em>Atlantic Coast Line Co., </em>211 U. S. 210, 226 (1908), defining a \u201cjudicial inquiry\u201d as one that \u201cinvestigates, declares and enforces liabilities as they stand on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist,\u201d as contrasted to legislation, which \u201clooks to the future and changes existing conditions by making a new rule to be applied thereafter to all or some part of those subject to its power.\u201d The Court in <em>Prentis </em>held that a ratemaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>proceeding in the Virginia State Corporation Commission was legislative in character, despite the fact that the Commission was assumed to function as a court in performing other duties. Similarly, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>13 How. 40 (1852), this Court concluded that the act of a district judge in passing on claims under a treaty, subject to approval by the Secretary of the Treasury, was not a judicial one; the Court held that Congress, in giving this authority to judges, referred to them by their office \u201cmerely as a designation of the persons to whom the authority is confided, and the territorial limits to which it extends.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 47. See also <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>United States, </em>2 Wall. 561 (1865); <em>In re Metzger, </em>5 How. 176 (1847); <em>Rayburn\u2019s Case, </em>2 Dall. 409 (1792).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Respondent argues that the functions of the Judicial Council under \u00a7 332 are, under Justice Holmes\u2019 definitions, legislative, or administrative, rather than judicial; and that the statutory provision making the membership of the Council coextensive with that of the Court of Appeals for each circuit<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is merely a means of designating the individual members by reference to their office. Certainly respondent is correct in urging that Congress\u2019 designation of circuit judges as the members of the Council does not in itself make the Council\u2019s function judicial. I think, however, that the Council\u2019s orders directing the official business of the district courts are judicial within the general definition of that term in <em>Prentis. </em>In urging that the Council\u2019s function merely \u201clooks to the future and changes existing conditions by making a new rule,\u201d respondent disregards the fact that each of the Council\u2019s orders, such as those challenged here, is rooted in the factual circumstances of the business of a particular judge or judges and the status of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>particular case or cases in the district court; and each order, if properly entered, extends only as far as the circumstances that make it \u201cnecessary . . . for the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts.\u201d 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 332. As noted above, the Council\u2019s orders for the handling of cases in the district court serve as one step in the progress of those cases toward judgment. Those orders can be expected to apply commonly accepted notions of proper judicial administration to the special factual situations of particular cases or particular judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">As respondent points out, the power entrusted to the Councils by \u00a7 332, like those added by later enactments, see <em>infra, </em>at 109-110, necessarily involves a large amount of discretion; accordingly, review of the Councils\u2019 actions will usually be narrow in scope. But this does not mean that the Councils are \u201cleft at large as planning agencies.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>First City National Bank, </em>386 U. S. 361, 369 (1967). In <em>First City National Bank, </em>we were faced with a federal statute directing the courts to determine whether the anticompetitive effect of a proposed bank merger was outweighed by considerations of community convenience and need. We ruled that the courts could accept this as a \u201cjudicial task\u201d because, like the \u201crule of reason,\u201d long prevalent in the antitrust field, the effect-on-competition standard was a familiar one within \u201cthe area of judicial competence.\u201d See also <em>United Steelworkers </em>v. <em>United States, </em>361 U. S. 39 (1959). Judicial administration is a matter in which the courts even more clearly should have special competence. Within the framework of the statutes establishing the inferior federal courts and defining their jurisdiction, the Judicial Councils are charged with the duty to take such actions as are necessary for the expedition of the business of the courts in each circuit. Their discretion in this matter, while broad, does not seem to be of a different order from that possessed by district judges with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>to many matters of trial administration. In both instances, review can correct legal error or abuse of discretion where it occurs; that the scope of review will often be very narrow does not in itself establish that the exercise of such discretion is a non judicial act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Respondent makes a further argument to avert a conclusion that the actions here drawn in question were judicial actions. It points out that Congress since 1939 has given the Judicial Councils many specific powers\u2014 powers that respondent considers so clearly nonjudicial as to negate any inference that the Council serves as a \u201cjudicial\u201d body within the purview of Article III. Those powers include the power to order a district judge, where circumstances require, to reside in a particular part of the district for which he is appointed, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 134 (c) ; to make any necessary orders if the district judges in any district are unable to agree upon the division of business among them, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 137; to consent to the pre-termission of any regular session of a District Court for insufficient business or other good cause, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 140 (a); to approve as necessary the provision of judicial accommodations for the courts by the General Services Administration, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 142; to consent to the designation and assignment of circuit or district judges to sit on courts other than those for which they are appointed, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 295; to certify to the President <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>that a circuit or district judge is unable to discharge efficiently all the duties of his office by reason of permanent mental or physical disability, thus authorizing the President to appoint an additional judge, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 372 (b); to direct where the records of the courts of appeals and district courts shall be kept, 28 U. S., C. \u00a7457; to approve plans for furnishing representation for defendants under the Criminal Justice Act, 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 3006A (a); and to take various actions in regard to referees in bankruptcy, including removal of a referee for cause, 11 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 62 (b), 65 (a), (b), 68 (a), (b), (c), 71 (b), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">While many of these powers are trivial in comparison with the courts\u2019 basic responsibility for final adjudication of lawsuits, I am not persuaded that their possession is inconsistent with a conclusion that the Council, when performing its central responsibilities under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 332, exercises judicial power granted under Article III. Cf. <em>Glidden Co. </em>v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530, 580-582 (1962) (opinion of Harlan, J.). In the first place, the respondent concedes that at least one of these enumerated powers \u2014 the power to remove referees for cause \u2014 \u201ccan properly be regarded as judicial,\u201d and it is not at all clear that any of them is beyond the range of the permissible activities of an Article III court. In <em>Textile Mills Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>314 U. S. 326, 332 (1941), the Court noted the range of relatively minor responsibilities, other than the hearing of appeals, placed by statute in the courts of appeals. These included prescribing the form of writs and other process and the form and style of the courts\u2019 seals; making rules and regulations; appointing a clerk and approving the appointment and removal of deputy clerks; and fixing the times when court should be held. Each of these functions was to be performed by the \u201ccourt.\u201d While it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>possible that the performance of some of them might never produce a case or controversy reviewable in this Court, they are reasonably ancillary to the primary, dispute-deciding function of the courts of appeals. Just as the Court in <em>Textile Mills </em>did not question the authority of Congress to grant such incidental powers to the courts of appeals, I see little reason to believe that any of the various supervisory tasks entrusted to the Judicial Council is beyond the capacities of a judicial body under Article III.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">In the second place, my conclusion about the nature of the Council\u2019s primary function under \u00a7 332 would stand even if it were determined that one or more of the Council\u2019s assorted incidental powers were incapable of being exercised by an Article III court. If I am correct in concluding that Congress\u2019 purpose in 1939 in creating the Judicial Councils was to vest in them, as an arm of the Article III judiciary, supervisory powers over the disposition of business in the district courts, that purpose is- not undone by a subsequent congressional attempt to give them a minor nonjudicial task; it would be \u201cperverse to make the status of [the Councils] turn upon so minuscule a portion of their purported functions.\u201d <em>Glidden Co. </em>v. <em>Zdanok, </em>370 U. S., at 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">B. STATUTORY JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">This Court does not, of course, necessarily possess all of the appellate jurisdiction permitted to it by Article III. That article provides that our appellate jurisdiction is to be exercised \u201cwith such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make,\u201d and this language has been held to give Congress the power, within limits, to prescribe the instances in which it may be exercised. <em>E. g., Ex parte McCardle, </em>7 Wall. 506, 512-513 (1869). I turn, therefore, to the Judicial Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>to determine our statutory authority to consider Judge Chandler\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Congress in the Code has not spoken, one way or the other, regarding review of the orders of Judicial Councils. Petitioner asserts that the Court has power to issue mandamus or prohibition to the Councils under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1651 (a), which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">\u201c[t]he Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">This statute has been construed to empower this Court to issue an extraordinary writ to a lower federal court in a case falling within our statutory appellate jurisdiction, where the issuance of the writ will further the exercise of that jurisdiction. See, <em>e. g., De Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>325 U. S. 212, 217 (1945); <em>United States Alkali Export </em>Assn. v. <em>United States, </em>325 U. S. 196, 201-204 (1945). It is now settled that the case need not be already pending in this Court before an extraordinary writ may be issued under \u00a7 1651 (a); rather, the Court may issue the writ when the lower court\u2019s action might defeat or frustrate this Court\u2019s <em>eventual </em>jurisdiction, even where that jurisdiction could be invoked on the merits only after proceedings in an intermediate court. See, <em>e. g., Be Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>325 U. S., at 217; <em>Ex parte Peru, </em>318 U. S. 578 (1943); <em>Ex parte United States, </em>287 U. S. 241, 248-249 (1932); <em>McClellan </em>v. <em>Garland, </em>217 U. S. 268 (1910); cf. <em>FTC </em>v. <em>Bean Foods Co., </em>384 U. S. 597 (1966); <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Evaporated Milk Assn., </em>319 U. S. 21 (1943). But cf. <em>In re Glaser, </em>198 U. S. 171, 173 (1905); <em>In re Massachusetts, </em>197 U. S. 482, 488 (1905).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Each of the prior cases in which this Court has invoked \u00a7 1651 (a) to issue a writ \u201cin aid of [its jurisdiction]\u201d has involved a particular lawsuit over which the Court would have statutory review jurisdiction at a later stage. By contrast, petitioner\u2019s reliance on this statute is bottomed on the fact that the action of the Judicial Council \u201ctouches, through Judge Chandler\u2019s fate, hundreds of cases over which this Court has appellate or review jurisdiction.\u201d Petition for Writ of Prohibition and/or Mandamus 13. He argues that the Council\u2019s orders, allocating to other judges in his district cases that would otherwise be decided by him, constitute a usurpation of power that cannot adequately be remedied on final review of those cases by certiorari or appeal in this Court. The United States as <em>amicus curiae </em>agrees that this claim properly invokes the Court\u2019s power to consider whether mandamus or prohibition should be granted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although this expansive use of \u00a7 1651 (a) has no direct precedent in this Court, it seems to me wholly in line with the history of that statute and consistent with the manner in which it has been interpreted both here and in the lower courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Chief Justice Stone, writing for the Court in <em>Ex parte Peru, </em>318 U. S., at 583, characterized the \u201chistoric use of writs of prohibition and mandamus directed by an appellate to an inferior court\u201d as that of \u201cconfining the inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction, or of compelling it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u201d The bounds of this Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>discretionary power to issue such writs were further stated in <em>Parr </em>v. <em>United States, </em>351 U. S. 513, 520-521 (1956):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">\u201cThe power to issue them is discretionary and it is sparingly exercised. . . . This is not a case where a court has exceeded or refused to exercise its jurisdiction, see <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Evaporated Milk Assn., </em>319 U. S. 21, 26, nor one where appellate review will be defeated if a writ does not issue, cf. <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Soper, </em>270 U. S. 9, 29-30. Here the most that could be claimed is that the district courts have erred in ruling on matters within their jurisdiction. The extraordinary writs do not reach to such cases; they may not be used to thwart the congressional policy against piecemeal appeals. <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Evaporated Milk Assn., supra, </em>at p. 30.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In <em>Parr, </em>the petitioner's claim was simply that a district court had erred in dismissing an indictment at the Government\u2019s request after the Government had obtained a new indictment for the same offenses in another district. In contrast, the present case involves a claim that the Council\u2019s orders were entered in a matter entirely beyond its jurisdiction. Judge Chandler claims that the order of December 13, 1965, depriving him of both pending and future cases, was tantamount to his removal from office, and that such an act far exceeded the limited jurisdiction over \u201cadministrative\u201d matters conferred on the Council by \u00a7 332. He further asserts, as noted in Part I, <em>supra, </em>that the order of February 4, 1966, exceeded the Council\u2019s jurisdiction under either \u00a7 332 or \u00a7 137. Such grave charges clearly go beyond a mere claim that the Council has \u201cerred in ruling on matters within [its] jurisdiction.\u201d Cf. <em>Will </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U. S. 90, 95-96, 98 and n. 6 (1967); <em>Schlagenhauf </em>v. <em>Holder, </em>379 U. S. 104 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Further, there seems to be no means by which Judge Chandler\u2019s challenge to the orders could be aired adequately on review of the cases to which they pertain. While the losing party in a case assigned to another district judge might conceivably argue on appeal that he is entitled to reversal because his case should have been heard by Judge Chandler, such an argument would encounter formidable obstacles. A reviewing court would have no way of determining whether a particular case filed in the District Court after the February 4 Order would, but for that order, have been assigned to Judge Chandler; nor is it clear that the error, if detectable, would in itself entitle the losing party to invalidate proceedings had before another judge. More basically, Judge Chandler is asserting an injury to himself, apart from any injuries to the parties in those cases; the parties cannot be relied upon to seek vindication of that injury. Cf. <em>Ex parte Fahey, </em>332 U. S. 258, 260 (1947); <em>Ex parte Harding, </em>219 U. S. 363, 372-380 (1911).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">It is difficult to see how the very multiplicity of the cases affected by the Council\u2019s orders could derogate from this Court\u2019s authority under \u00a7 1651 (a) to issue an extraordinary writ in aid of its appellate jurisdiction over them. A somewhat analogous multiplicity was found to militate in favor of the issuance of mandamus in <em>McCullough </em>v. <em>Cosgrave, </em>309 U. S. 634 (1940), and in <em>Los Angeles Brush Corp. </em>v. <em>James, </em>272 U. S. 701 (1927). As later explained by Mr. Justice Brennan, dissenting in <em>La Buy </em>v. <em>Howes Leather Co., </em>352 U. S. 249, 266 (1957),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\"><em>\u201cLos Angeles Brush Corp. </em>was a case where a reference [to a master] was made, not because a district judge decided that the particular circumstances of the particular case required a reference, but pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>suant to an agreement among all the judges of that District Court always to appoint masters to hear patent cases regardless of the circumstances of particular cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Mandamus was therefore issued in <em>Los Angeles Brush Corp., </em>and in <em>McCullough, </em>which involved a similar situation in the same District Court, in order to remedy a pervasive disregard of the Rules of Civil Procedure affecting numerous cases.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Similarly, in <em>La Buy </em>the Court upheld the authority of the Court of Appeals under \u00a7 1651 (a) to issue writs of mandamus compelling a district judge to rescind his referral of two antitrust cases to a master for trial. The Court found that the referral \u201cwas a clear abuse of discretion,\u201d and further noted \u201cthat the Court of Appeals has for years admonished the trial judges of the Seventh Circuit that the practice of making references \u2018does not commend itself\u2019. . . [and that it was] \u2018all too common in the Northern District of Illinois.\u2019 \u201d 352 U. S., at 257, 258. This factor was primary among the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d found to warrant the Court of Appeals\u2019 issuance of the writs.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">In the reported case most nearly analogous to this one, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued a writ of mandamus at the behest of the United States to compel a district judge to return to the judicial office from which he had been unlawfully removed. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Malmin, </em>272 F. 785 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1921). Judge Malmin, of the District Court of the Virgin Islands, had returned to the United States after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>territorial governor had purported to remove him and appoint another to his seat. Relying on \u00a7 262 of the Judicial Code of 1911, a predecessor of the All Writs Act, the court ruled that it had authority to issue the writ \u201cin aid of\u201d its jurisdiction, <em>id., </em>at 791; it observed that the absence of a lawfully appointed judge of the District Court affected the rights of litigants in cases reviewable in the Court of Appeals, and that \u201cthe right of the public to a properly constituted trial court from which appeals can validly lie could not be asserted or brought about in proceedings on appeal or by writ of error.\u201d In those circumstances, the court deemed it \u201cessential to the appellate jurisdiction of this court that orderly proceedings in the District Court of the Virgin Islands be restored.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 792,</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">A dissenter in <em>Malndn </em>disagreed with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the defect could not be rectified on appeal, and urged that mandamus should not issue because it could not bind the succeeding appointee, who was not a party. In the case before us, as noted above, the ordinary appeals are not adequate to protect Judge Chandler\u2019s interest; and there is no problem of missing parties, since it is the judge himself who is complaining of illegal interference with the exercise of his office, and that complaint can be remedied fully by the issuance of a writ against respondent Judicial Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">For these reasons I would conclude that the actions challenged by Judge Chandler sufficiently affect matters within this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction to bring his application for an extraordinary writ within our authority under \u00a7 1651 (a), and that his charges, if sustained, would present an appropriate occasion for the issuance of such a writ.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">In the present posture of this case Judge Chandler, in my opinion, is not entitled to the relief he seeks. The Order of December 13, 1965, which prompted his recourse to this Court, has been superseded by the Order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>of February 4, 1966, which I am satisfied is entirely within the authority of the Council. I am wholly unable to regard the latter order either as a \u201cremoval\u201d of Judge Chandler from judicial office, or as anything other than an effort to move along judicial traffic in the District Court. In this state of affairs, I can find no room for the constitutional argument so vigorously made by my Brothers Black and Douglas.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Petitioner strenuously attacks the substance of the December 13 Order, which he claims effectively re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>moved him from office, as well as the procedures under which the order was issued. His substantive argument is that \u00a7 332, on which the Council relied, does not authorize the placing of restrictions upon the functioning of a district judge, even temporarily, and that if it does the statute is unconstitutional because the constitutional provisions<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> vesting in Congress authority to impeach federal officers, including judges, establish the exclusive means of inquiry into the fitness of a federal judge to perform his duties. In response the United States as <em>amicus </em>argues that the impeachment provisions should not be read as precluding legislation that would authorize supervision of federal judges by \u201cjudicial trial of the fulfillment of the condition of federal judicial tenure under Article III \u2014 that the judge maintain his \u2018good behavior.\u2019 \u201d This question has been the subject of scholarly debate, and is presently before the Senate as it considers the proposed Judicial Reform Act. See Hearings on S. 1506-S. 1516 before the Subcommittee on Improvements in Judicial Machinery of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969). Petitioner\u2019s procedural objections to the December 13 Order relate to its issuance <em>ex parte, </em>without notice or hearing \u2014 circumstances that raise serious questions under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">I believe the respondent and the United States are correct in contending that these issues need not be resolved on this occasion. As already appears, the December 13 Order is no longer before us. Therefore, the only question still requiring decision is the validity of the outstanding February 4 Order under the enabling statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The Council rested the February 4 Order on its authority under both \u00a7 137 and \u00a7 332. Considering first the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Council\u2019s more general grant of authority, \u00a7 332, I think this order was substantively within the powers conferred by that provision. The order was designed to deal with the situation in Judge Chandler\u2019s court by requiring him to dispose of his backlog before notifying the Council that he is willing and able to undertake new assignments. See Supplemental Memorandum for Respondent. That the Councils might issue orders of this type was clearly contemplated by the draftsmen of \u00a7 332, and such orders seem to have been a customary measure taken by the Councils under the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The legislative history of \u00a7 332, summarized in Part II above, makes clear that a Judicial Council\u2019s mandate to \u201cmake all necessary orders for the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts within its circuit\u201d was intended to encompass the making of orders that would direct a district judge to clear up his docket or would channel cases to other judges when a situation existed with respect to one judge that was inimical to the effective administration of justice. Cf. Vinson, The Business of Judicial Administration: Suggestions to the Conference of Chief Justices, 35 A. B. A. J. 893, 895 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The Judicial Conference of the United States made a study in 1961 of the role of the Judicial Councils, culminating in a report that was transmitted to Congress by Chief Justice Warren. That report, after thorough consideration of the legislative history of the 1939 Act, specifically listed as among the responsibilities of the Councils \u201chaving a judge who has an accumulation of submitted cases not take on any further trial work until such cases have been decided.\u201d H. R. Doc. No. 201, <em>supra, </em>at 10. This power has been exercised on other occasions by other Judicial Councils. See, <em>e. g., </em>Fish, <em>supra, </em>37 U. Chi. L. Rev., at 230; Lumbard, The Place of the Federal Judicial Councils in the Administration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>of the Courts, 47 A. B. A. J. 169, 170-171 (1961) ; Shafroth, Modern Developments in Judicial Administration, 12 Am. U. L. Rev. 150, 160 (1963). The propriety of such action has apparently never before been seriously challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Judge Chandler argues, however, that \u00a7 332 limits the Council's authority in making this type of order to situations in which the order is necessitated by the existence of an extraordinary backlog of cases, and that the February 4 Order was prompted, not by such a backlog, but by the Council\u2019s desire to punish Judge Chandler for misbehavior. There seem to be two strands to this argument. First, there are suggestions in petitioner\u2019s briefs and in those of <em>amicus curiae </em>Shipley that the Council\u2019s actions have been taken, not for the reasons stated in the various orders and minutes of the Council, but for reasons of personal animosity. There is nothing in the record, which consists of Judge Chandler\u2019s petition and the orders and minutes of the Council, to substantiate this charge, and I for one am quite unwilling to attribute such motives to the Council. Second, Judge Chandler seems to assert that the February 4 Order is sustainable only if supported by a showing that his docket bore a numerically heavier load of pending cases than did those of his colleagues on the District Court, and that this justification is lacking here.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> I believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>this argument reflects an overly restrictive view of the Judicial Council\u2019s role.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">The legislative history of \u00a7 332 contains positive refutation of petitioner\u2019s argument that the only factor a Council might appropriately consider in making an order such as that of February 4 is the statistical weight of the workloads of the various district judges. It is true, as the legislative history in Part II above confirms, that abatement of delays in disposition of cases was a principal purpose for creation of the Councils; but the Councils were deliberately given broad responsibilities to meet other problems as they arose. Chief Justice Groner contemplated that the Councils would cope not only with delays but also with \u201cany other matter which is the subject of criticism, or properly could be made the subject of criticism, for which [a district judge] may be responsible.\u201d Hearings on S. 188, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number><em>supra, </em>at 11. The Senate committee included this part of the testimony in its report recommending passage of the bill. S. Rep. No.. 426, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1939). The same witness later stated that the Council\u2019s responsibilities would embrace correction of \u201cwhatever is wrong in the administration of justice, from whatever sources it may arise,\u201d as a means of promoting \u201cthe strengthening of confidence on the part of the people.\u201d Hearings on S. 188, <em>supra, </em>at 12-13, 14.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The broad mandate of the Councils was further stressed by the Judicial Conference in its 1961 report. The Conference considered it to be.\u201cpatent\u201d from the legislative history that \u00a7 332</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">\u201cimposed upon a judicial council the responsibility of seeing that the work and function of the courts in its circuit were expeditiously and effectively performed; and that this responsibility of observation, supervision, and correction went to the whole of a court\u2019s functioning, in both personal and institutional aspect.\u201d H. R. Doc. No. 201, <em>supra, </em>at 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">From a study of the applications of the statute by the various Councils, the Conference concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">\u201cmost of the councils appear, from the things with which they have dealt in these situations, to have recognized that their responsibilities and power extend, not merely to dealing with the questions of the handling and dispatching of a trial court\u2019s business in its technical sense, but also to dealing with the business of the judiciary in its broader or institutional sense, such as the preventing of any stigma, disrepute, or other element of loss of public confidence occurring as to the Federal courts or to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>administration of justice by them, from any nature of action by an individual judge or a person attached to the courts.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 7.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">The Conference specifically approved this construction in spelling out its conclusions. <em>Id., </em>at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">It is not necessary to define all of the limits on the powers of the Councils under \u00a7 332 in order to determine that the February 4 Order was a proper exercise of those powers. The December 13 Order noted that the Council was familiar with Judge Chandler\u2019s conduct of official business from four years of scrutiny, and it further recited that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">\u201c[djuring that period Judge Chandler has been a party defendant in both civil and criminal litigation. One civil case is still pending. Two proceedings have been brought in the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit to disqualify him from handling specific litigation. In one instance he was ordered to proceed no further and the other is still pending.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">I believe that these circumstances, taken as a whole, established a prima facie basis for the Council\u2019s conclusion that some action was appropriate to alleviate what the Council members perceived as a threat to public confidence in the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Passing over the now-revoked action taken on December 13, I consider the February 4 Order, restricting Judge Chandler for the time being to the cases then pending before him, to be a permissible interim step toward exploration and solution of the problem presented. The Council must be presumed to have known of the substantial number of cases then available to Judge Chandler, see n. 17, <em>supra, </em>and it could reasonably have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>concluded that a careful way to proceed would be to observe the manner in which Judge Chandler handled those cases before determining what more permanent steps should be taken with respect to the administration of the business of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">When the Council learned that Judge Chandler had disposed of the bulk of his cases, it invited him and the other district judges to propose a new distribution of business; the district judges together, or Judge Chandler alone exercising his right under \u00a7 137 to certify a disagreement to the Council, could make such a proposal at any time. Judge Chandler\u2019s claim that his failure to seek a new allocation is the result of unlawful \u201cduress\u201d seems insubstantial in light of the initial validity of the February 4 Order. Even if the December 13 Order did impose a form of duress in January 1966, when the district judges settled upon the present division of cases, that order had been revoked, and there could hardly be said to have been duress, when the district judges declined the Council\u2019s July 1967 invitation to propose a new order. Serious questions would be presented if, after exhausting much of his pending business, Judge Chandler had sought additional business and the Council had declined without advancing spb-stantial additional justification for the refusal. However, because of Judge Chandler\u2019s inaction, that situation is not presented on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In view of my conclusion that the February 4 Order was a valid exercise of the Council\u2019s power under \u00a7 332, I need not consider the Council\u2019s alternative justification of the order under \u00a7 137, or petitioner\u2019s arguments concerning the inapplicability of that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Finally, the procedures followed by the Council in promulgating its February 4 Order do not appear to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>been offensive to Congress\u2019 conception of the manner in which the Councils would act, or inconsistent with the basic demands of due process of law. It seems to have been assumed throughout the consideration of the 1939 Act that, at least on relatively minor matters, the Councils would ordinarily proceed <em>ex parte. </em>See, <em>e. g., </em>hearings on H. R. 5999, <em>supra, </em>at 14 (statement of Chief Justice Groner). Beginning with the initial suggestion by Chief Justice Hughes, one of the major reasons for placing these responsibilities in a body of circuit judges was that they would have a great deal of firsthand knowledge about the district courts and about the work and conduct of the individual district judges. See H. R. Doe. No. 201, <em>supra, </em>at 3 (Chief Justice Hughes) ; Hearings on S. 188, <em>supra, </em>at 16 (statement of A. Vanderbilt). The other major source of the information on which the Councils would act was to be the data gathered by the Administrative Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">However, the statute, which uses very general language to vest heavy responsibilities in the Councils, certainly allows the Councils the flexibility to vary their procedures, adopting in a particular instance those that are especially suited to the matter at hand or necessitated by the demands of fairness. See Fish, <em>supra, </em>at 222. There is much in our tradition of due process of law that runs counter to the taking of serious action on the basis of <em>ex parte </em>assertions or suspicions of misbehavior or incapacity. Apparently recognizing this, the Council after its temporary December 13 Order scheduled a hearing on the question of assignment of cases to Judge Chandler, and invited him to appear with counsel. Cf. <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Judicial Council, </em>382 U. S. 1003 (1966). As explained in the opinion of the Court, this hearing was canceled when the Council learned that no judge of the District Court wished to appear. In these circumstances the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Council, it seems to me, was justified in issuing the February 4 Order without further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Petitioner challenges this conclusion in several ways. First, he argues that the order directing the hearing, entered January 27,1966, did not contain adequate notice of the subject matter of the hearing. That order expressly referred to the December 13 Order and to Judge Chandler\u2019s attack upon it in this Court, and declared that \u201cthis matter\u201d would be set for a hearing at which Judge Chandler might \u201cpresent such matters to the Council as he may deem fit.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In view of the fact that the December 13 Order had listed specific grounds on which the Council\u2019s action was based, and Judge Chandler made no request for further specification, I cannot consider his present contention well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Second, petitioner states that his boycott of the hearing was based on his denial that the Council had any jurisdiction to hold it. He apparently concludes from this that the February 4 Order stands as though the Council had never scheduled a hearing at all. However, the Council had already entered the December 13 Order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>which this Court had declined, at least temporarily, to disturb, and the Council's authority to proceed further was surely sufficiently evident that Judge Chandler was not entitled to remain indifferent to its order setting the matter for a hearing. Finally, petitioner asserts that the proposed hearing was deficient because he was merely invited, rather than ordered, to appear. He cites no authority for this proposition, and it appears quite untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Throughout Judge Chandler\u2019s briefs, and in the dissents of my Brothers Black and Douglas, there are strong assertions of the importance of an independent federal judiciary. I fully agree that this principie holds a profoundly important place in our scheme of government. However, I can discern no incursion on that principle in the legislation creating the Judicial Councils and empowering them to supervise the work of the district courts, in order to ensure the effective and expeditious handling of their business. The February 4 Order, entered pursuant to this statutory authority, is a supportable exercise of the Council\u2019s responsibility to oversee the administration of federal justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">I would grant Judge Chandler\u2019s motion for leave to file his petition for a writ of prohibition or mandamus, but for the reasons stated above I am of the opinion that no such writ should issue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-5\"> The appeal in <em>Rescue Army </em>involved review of a state prohibition proceeding in which was challenged, before trial, the complex state statutory scheme under which an appellant had been criminally charged. The Court observed that the meanings of the various statutory provisions, and their relationships to one another, were left undefined by the ambiguous opinion of the State Supreme Court; and since the attack was on the face of the statutes, the Court found it unclear which statutes were being challenged and even what the charges were against the appellant. In contrast, the present case involves two brief federal enactments that are challenged, not on their face, but as applied by specific orders of the Council relating to Judge Chandler.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The Court states that because the scheduled hearing below was canceled, \u201cwe have no record, no petition for relief addressed to any agency, court or tribunal of any kind other than this Court, and a very knotty jurisdictional problem as well.\u201d We do, however, have a record, consisting primarily of the several orders of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Council and the minutes of the meetings at which it dealt with this matter. The Council\u2019s February 4 Order, unlike that of December 13, which was \u201centirely interlocutory,\u201d effects a change of indefinite duration in the allocation of District Court business. It was incumbent on the Council to take such action only on a record that would support it; if the record fails to support the Council\u2019s action, that does not obfuscate Judge Chandler\u2019s claims but strengthens them. His claims for the most part do not depend on his establishing from the record the existence of particular factual circumstances,, cf. <em>DeBacker </em>v. <em>Brainard, </em>396 U. S. 28 (1969), but on the alleged lack of possible justification in the record for the Council\u2019s action. Nothing in <em>Rescue Army </em>seems to justify a refusal to adjudicate the issue thus presented. I find that the February 4 Order is justified on the record in this case, see Part III, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The significance of Judge Chandler\u2019s failure to seek review in a tribunal other than this Court depends, of course, on the resolution of the \u201cknotty jurisdictional problem\u201d presented by his petition to this Court. I fail to see how it justifies not reaching that question at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\"> \u201cIn all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction.\u201d U.

Those terms are not talismanic; they may, in various contexts, bear a range of related meanings. Certainly the phrase \u201cjudicial administration\u201d is often used to characterize judicial tasks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>performed by the courts as incidents to their primary function of rendering definitive adjudications of disputes. Since the legislative history as a whole indicates that Congress regarded the direction of the trial courts\u2019 handling of cases as a judicial function, I conclude that it used the term \u201cadministrative\u201d in the sense in which the term is applied, for example, to many trial-court rulings that do not dispose of issues in a case but merely determine its course through the judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Nor do I find an obstacle to my construction of \u00a7 332 in Congress\u2019 failure to make express provision for the imposition of sanctions on a district judge who might contravene an order of the Judicial Council. When the question of sanctions was broached at the hearings, Chief Justice Groner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\u201cI doubt but what a judge could properly say, 'I am not going to decide this case any sooner than I choose to decide it. It is my case, and I am conducting my court, and you have no authority, except by impeachment.\u2019 \u201d Hearings on H. R. 5999, <em>supra, </em>at 14. At this, Representative Celler reminded the witness of the provision in the bill making it the \u201cduty\u201d of district judges to carry out the Council\u2019s directions. The witness replied:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">\u201cI cannot conceive of a district judge anywhere, and I do not believe there is any, but, when he is admonished by this council of judges that he must do in accordance with the report made to him a particular thing to correct what is regarded as an abuse, that he will fail to do it. If he does fail to do it,, then I think there would be imposed on the council the duty of bringing the matter in some way to the attention of the only power in existence, in a matter of that kind, which could apply the correct remedy; that is, the Congress of the United States.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Similarly, Judge Parker, in response to a question whether the bill would \u201cput any restraint on the council at all,\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">\u201cI do not think this bill does. Of course, I assume this is true: That the council will be restrained by the inherent limitations of the situation. They would know that, if they commanded a judge to do something, unnecessarily or unwisely, he would refuse to do it, and that would probably be the end of the matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3D\">Representative Sumners queried: \u201cThen you are limited by what you can do to a judge in. the way of punishment?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>replied Judge Parker. <em>Id., </em>at 22. See also Hearings on S. 188, <em>supra, </em>at 18-19 (statement of A. Vanderbilt).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">There is no need to determine in this case the correctness of these witnesses\u2019 apparent assumption that no form of discipline short of impeachment would be permissible for disobedience to an order of the Council, or of their possible assumption that such disobedience would be an impeachable offense. It seems clear that the witnesses\u2019 statements do not detract from the conclusion drawn from the rest of the legislative history, and from the language of the statute itself, that the determinations of the Judicial Council were intended to create legal duties on the part of district judges to whom they were addressed. As Judge Parker said, the Camncil would be \u201cspeaking with authority of law and not merely exercising [a] personal and persuasive influence.\u201d Hearings on H. R. 5999, <em>supra, </em>at 21. Even under the present statutory scheme, certain sanctions might be available in particular circumstances, such as the invalidation on appeal of orders entered by a judge in a case that had been ordered transferred from his docket. At any rate, this is only an aspect of the general problem of determining the permissible and appropriate sanctions for any kind of unlawful judicial conduct. The fact that the enforcement mechanisms are problematic does not destroy the legal nature of the Council\u2019s orders. See H. R. Doc. No. 201, <em>supra, </em>at 8; cf. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Haworth, </em>300 U. S. 227 (1937); <em>Nashville, C. &amp; St. L. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>288 U. S. 249 (1933); n. 9, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b162-5\"> For similar reasons I have little difficulty in characterizing as a \u201ccase or controversy\u201d within the Article III judicial power a challenge to an order of the Council that regulates a district judge in the exercise of his official duties. Where, as here, the purpose and effect of the order are to restrict the judge\u2019s performance of judicial tasks, and he alleges illegal interference with the exercise of his office, his petition presents a cognizable case or controversy just as does a petition for review of the disbarment of an attorney.

If a litigant in a case before the district court considered himself aggrieved by a Council order involving his case, his complaint also would seem to raise a justiciable case or controversy, although it is not necessary to decide now in what manner he might obtain review of the order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b163-5\"> Compare 28 U.

The Court usually did not specify whether it relied upon \u00a7 234 or \u00a7 262, apparently considering that they furnished overlapping authority. Section 234, which derived from \u00a7 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, conferred upon this Court, and this Court only, the \u201cpower to issue . . . writs of mandamus, in cases warranted by the principles and usages of law, to any courts appointed under the authority of the United States Section 262 provided that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court, the circuit courts of appeals,, and the district courts shall have power to issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d The former provision was construed as conferring upon this Court \u201ca general supervisory power over the inferior courts, so far as this power was exercisable through a writ of mandamus in its historic function,\u201d enabling the Court \u201cto exercise the essentially appellate function of reviewing and revising a judicial proceeding in a lower court by appropriate use of the common-law writ of mandamus, whether or not it had been given by Congress some other statutory appellate jurisdiction, or potential appellate jurisdiction, by way of an appeal or writ of error or otherwise.\u201d <em>In re Josephson, </em>218 F. 2d 174, 177-178 (C.

The brief Reviser\u2019s Note explained that the \u201crevised section extends the power to issue writs in aid of jurisdiction, to all courts established by Act of Congress, thus making explicit the right to exercise powers implied from the creation of such courts.\u201d The \u201cspecial provisions\u201d of \u00a7 234 relating to the Supreme Court \u201cwere omitted as unnecessary in view of the revised section.\u201d H. R. Rep. No, 308, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., A144-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>A145 (1947). Because the language of \u00a7 1651 (a) more closely resembles that of \u00a7 262, it has been speculated that Congress by enacting the revision may have withdrawn from this Court its special appellate power under \u00a7 234 to supervise proceedings in the lower federal courts without regard to whether any other statute gives the Court jurisdiction to review those proceedings. See <em>La Buy </em>v. <em>Howes Leather Co., </em>352 U. S, 249, 260 (1957) (Brennan, J., dissenting); <em>In re Josephson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The United States as <em>amicus </em>urges the Court to rule that no such change was effected by the 1948 revision, arguing correctly that \u00a7 234 would clearly encompass the type of review Judge Chandler seeks. The United States points out, in support of such a ruling, that the Reviser\u2019s Note stated that \u00a7 1651 (a) \u201cconsolidates\u201d the earlier provisions, \u201cwith necessary changes in phraseology\u201d; this gave no indication that a significant change in the law was intended, and one should not lightly be inferred. I note that the Court in <em>Ex parte Peru, </em>referring to both \u00a7 234 and \u00a7 262, stated that \u201c[u]nder the statutory provisions, the jurisdiction of this Court to issue common-law writs in aid of its appellate jurisdiction has been consistently sustained.\u201d 318 U. S., at 582-583. Its use of the expression \u201cin aid of its appellate jurisdiction\u201d to characterize both statutes suggests that the similar phrase in \u00a7 1651 (a) may also encompass the powers exercised by this Court under \u00a7 234. However, there is no need to decide this question here in light of the fact that the reviewability in this Court of the many cases whose allocation is determined by the Judicial Council\u2019s orders brings Judge Chandler\u2019s petition within the Court\u2019s powers as they existed under \u00a7262.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b176-7\"> See U.

Further statistics showed that 50 cases were still pending before Judge Chandler on January 31, 1967. On the basis of these figures the Council determined that no action was then appropriate regarding the assignment of eases in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">On July 12, 1967, the Council again reviewed the condition of the District Court docket and, on discovering that only 12 cases were pending before Judge Chandler, determined that a revision should be made of the disposition of business mandated by the February 4 Order. It requested notification from the district judges of a new order of business suitable to them. However, as appears from the Court\u2019s opinion, the district judges advised the Council \u201cthat the current order for the division of business in this district is agreeable under the circumstances.\u201d On receiving this message the Council determined to leave the February 4 Order in effect. Subsequent-statistics, submitted to the Council by the Administrative Office, showed that Judge Chandler had six cases pending on June 30, 1969.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\"> See also Hearings on H.

Chandler shall take no action whatsoever in any case or proceeding now or hereafter pending in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma; that all cases and proceedings now assigned to or pending before him shall be reassigned to and among the other judges of said court; and that until the further order of the Judicial Council no cases or proceedings filed or instituted in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma shall be assigned to him for any action whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Petitioner filed a petition for prohibition and/or mandamus, and sought a stay of the order of the Council. The Court denied relief stating that the order was \u201centirely interlocutory in character pending prompt further proceedings.\u201d 382 U. S. 1003. Mr. Justice Black and I dissented. On February 4, 1966, the Council entered an order allowing petitioner to continue to sit on cases filed and assigned as of December 28, 1965; but it apportioned all subsequent cases among the remaining judges. The Council stated that its order of February 4, 1966, superseded its order of December 13, 1965. By a subsequent order the Council directed that new judicial business would not, until further order, be assigned to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">This case has been and continues to be the liveliest, most controversial contest involving a federal judge in modern United States history.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>The order of February 4, 1966, was made by the Council on the basis of an alleged \u201cdisagreement\u201d among the district judges on one side and Judge Chandler on the other over the reassignment of cases previously assigned to Judge Chandler on December 28, 1965. The Council authorized Judge Chandler to sit on cases assigned to him prior to December 28, 1965; and it assigned to the other district judges all cases filed after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Judge Chandler on the eve of that order, January 24, 1966, agreed to acquiesce in the assignment of new cases to the other district judges. But he disagreed with any action concerning \u201cmy pending cases.\u201d As to them he said: \u201cThere is no provision of law that grants a Judicial Council jurisdiction over cases pending before a judge in the various stages of the judicial process after valid assignment to him. I consider it my duty to continue to assert my exclusive jurisdiction over these cases, and shall do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Since the order of February 4, 1966, said that all cases \u201cassigned to Judge Chandler as of December 28, 1965, shall remain assigned to him,\u201d and since Judge Chandler did not object to the later cases being assigned to others, the then Solicitor General (now Mr. Justice Marshall) suggested in a memorandum that the case had become moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">But the Solicitor General in a later memorandum filed here March 17, 1966, agreed \u201cthat the case can no longer be deemed moot\u201d because of Judge Chandler\u2019s continuing, expressed disagreement with the order of February 4, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">As noted, the original action against Judge Chandler was taken under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 332. The action taken February 4, 1966, was under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 137, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">\u201cIf the district judges in any district are unable to agree upon the adoption of rules or orders for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>that purpose the judicial council of the circuit shall make the necessary orders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">But there was no disagreement among the district judges and no power of the Council to act under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 137. That was precisely the strategy that Judge Chandler selected so that if the feud against him continued, it would have to be waged under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 332. But the Council did not oblige. It recited in its order of February 4, 1966: \u201cIn the circumstances a disagreement exists as to the division of business and the assignment of cases in the Western District of Oklahoma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">If a disagreement existed on February 4, 1966, it existed after Judge Chandler\u2019s so-called \u201cacquiescence\u201d which was expressed in the letter of January 24, 1966. The entire ground is thus swept out from under the mootness argument. In spite of Chandler\u2019s \u201cacquiescence\u201d the Council considered the case a live controversy and Chandler has contested the February 4, 1966, order ever since it issued. His opposition and the continuing raging controversy led the former Solicitor General to concede that the case had not become moot. Nor does the Council, even at this late date, make any such suggestion. Nor does the present Solicitor General.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">The Court holds that because Judge Chandler refused to express to the Council his disagreement with the February 4, 1966, order, he failed to exhaust a possible means for obtaining the relief he now seeks in this Court. Had he disagreed, however, he would have vested the Council with authority to act under \u00a7 137, and that was precisely what he wanted to avoid. As Mr. Justice Harlan points out, the whole basis for Judge Chandler\u2019s attack is \u201cthat it is illegal for the Council to deprive him of new cases, and equally so for the Council to condition his access to new cases upon his making a request to it that is tantamount to a form of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>certification of disagreement under \u00a7 137.\u201d The Court states that by not certifying disagreement to the Council Judge Chandler is apparently attempting \u201cto have it both ways.\u201d It seems clear, however, that the Court\u2019s opinion now allows the Council \u201cto have it both ways\u201d \u2014 for unless Judge Chandler certifies disagreement with the February 4, 1966, order, he is barred from relief in this Court; and if he seeks relief from the Council by disagreeing with its order, he concedes jurisdiction in the Council for its actions under \u00a7 137. Nothing in <em>Rescue Army </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>331 U. S. 549, relied on by the Court, compels this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">For the reasons fully stated by Mr. Justice Harlan, in Part I of his opinion, the case is ripe for decision and we have no excuse for declining to decide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Our first substantial question is whether this is a \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccontroversy\u201d within our jurisdiction. As Chief Justice Marshall said in <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>1 Cranch 137, 175:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">\u201cTo enable this court, then, to issue a <em>mandamus, </em>it must be shown to be an exercise of appellate jurisdiction, or to be necessary to enable [the Court] to exercise appellate jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA6Z\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"23\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA4YAAAAXAQAAAAB/2mzbAAAAgElEQVR4nO2VsQ3AIAwEH5QBshGMkk1glIySURghJZEMZIJPYQUqf3tG95It4QbWpvnFQsCMZlQbR6R05CnGXijtJ0Ut6424KRX+UHiZh5dpc/ZYL4okzrmcQkkt8IDf6cD2fxt4wB0cfyB1hjI9UFQTR0HURl0kibP/0YxmJHkBljP23wSpYGUAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"902\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">\u201cIt is the essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction, that it revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted, and does not create that cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">The question therefore is whether a judicial council is a lower court or inferior tribunal whose decisions are reviewable in the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction. A judicial council is only the court of appeals for a named circuit sitting <em>en banc. </em>These councils were created to place \u201cresponsibility for judicial administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>tion where it belongs \u2014 with the judiciary.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 702, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 4. Chief Justice Groner of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, who helped draft the bill that was enacted, explained it as follows to the Senate:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\">\u201cTo [give the administrative officer any supervision or control over the exercise of purely judicial functions] would be to destroy the very fundamentals of our theory of government. The administrative officer proposed in this bill is purely an administrative officer. ... It is his duty to observe and see that whatever is wrong in the administration of justice, from whatever sources it may arise, <em>is brought to the attention of the judicial council that it may be corrected, by the courts themselves. </em>That is, as I respectfully suggest, as it ought to be.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The Council by 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 137 is under a duty to \u201cmake the necessary orders\u201d in case the district judges are \u201cunable to agree upon the adoption of rules or orders for that purpose.\u201d The Council directs the district judges to carry out certain measures. That is indeed the role of a judicial entity. Only members of the Court of Appeals are members of the Council. Those sitting on the Council do not even change their hats. Expediting the flow of cases to the dockets of district judges is wholly in line with the judicial function. We stated in <em>Textile Mills Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>314 U. S. 326, 332:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">\u201cThere are numerous functions of the court, as a 'court of record, with appellate jurisdiction,\u2019 other than hearing and deciding appeals. Under the Judicial Code these embrace prescribing the form of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>writs and other process and the form and style of its seal (\u00a7 122); the making of rules and regulations (\u00a7 122); the appointment of a clerk (\u00a7 124) and the approval of the appointment and removal of deputy clerks (\u00a7 125); and the fixing of the \u2018times\u2019 when court shall be held. \u00a7 126.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Some functions performed by a Judicial Council may be \u201cadministrative.\u201d But where, as here, it moves to disqualify a judge from sitting, removing him <em>pro tanto </em>from office, it moves against the individual with all of the sting and much of the stigma that impeachment carries. That action gives rise to a \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccontroversy\u201d triggered by the Council. The Council is therefore under the circumstances an inferior judicial tribunal over which we have appellate jurisdiction where a \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccontroversy\u201d arises. On that assumption, it is not seriously argued that mandamus is an inappropriate remedy under the All Writs Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The order of December 13, 1965, may have been qualified but it has not been erased. Petitioner still is disqualified to sit on incoming cases. He still carries the stigma of the brand put on him by the Council. We should remember that the cessation of illegal conduct does not make a case moot:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">\u201cA controversy may remain to be settled in such circumstances <em>. . . e. g., </em>a dispute over the legality of the challenged practices. . . . The defendant is free to return to his old ways. This, together with a public interest in having the legality of the practices settled, militates against a mootness conclusion.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co., </em>345 U. S. 629, 632.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">An independent judiciary is one of this Nation\u2019s outstanding characteristics. Once a federal judge is confirmed by the Senate and takes his oath, he is independent of every other judge. He commonly works with other federal judges who are likewise sovereign. But neither one alone nor any number banded together can act as censor and place sanctions on him. Under the Constitution the only leverage that can be asserted against him is impeachment, where pursuant to a resolution passed by the House, he is tried by the Senate, sitting as a jury. Art. I, \u00a7 2 and \u00a7 3. Our tradition even bars political impeachments as evidenced by the highly partisan, but unsuccessful, effort to oust Justice Samuel Chase of this Court in 1805.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Impeachment Provision of the Constitution<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> indeed provides for the removal of \u201cOfficers of the United States,\u201d which includes judges, on \u201cImpeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d Art. II, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">What the Judicial Council did when it ordered petitioner to \u201ctake no action whatsoever in any case or proceeding now or hereafter pending\u201d in his court was to do what only the Court of Impeachment can do. If the business of the federal courts needs administrative oversight, the flow of cases can be regulated. Some judges work more slowly than others; some cases may take months while others take hours or days. Matters of this kind may be regulated by the assignment pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>cedure. But there is no power under our Constitution for one group of federal judges to censor or discipline any federal judge and no power to declare him inefficient and strip him of his power to act as a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The mood of some federal judges is opposed to this view and they are active in attempting to make all federal judges walk in some uniform step. What has happened to petitioner is not a rare instance; it has happened to other federal judges who have had perhaps a more libertarian approach to the Bill of Rights than their brethren. The result is that the nonconformist has suffered greatly at the hands of his fellow judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The problem is not resolved by saying that only judicial administrative matters are involved. The power to keep a particular judge from sitting on a racial case, a church-and-state case, a free-press case, a search-and-seizure case, a railroad case, an antitrust case, or a union case may have profound consequences. Judges are not fungible; they cover the constitutional spectrum; and a particular judge\u2019s emphasis may make a world of difference when it comes to rulings on evidence, the temper of the courtroom, the tolerance for a proffered defense, and the like. Lawyers recognize this when they talk about \u201cshopping\u201d for a judge; Senators recognize this when they are asked to give their \u201cadvice and consent\u201d to judicial appointments; laymen recognize this when they appraise the quality and image of the judiciary in their own community.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">These are subtle, imponderable factors which other judges should not be allowed to manipulate to further their own concept of the public good. That is the crucial issue at the heart of the present controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">All power is a heady thing as evidenced by the increasing efforts of groups of federal judges to act as referees over other federal judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>On June 10, 1969, the Judicial Conference adopted resolutions for the governance of many activities of circuit judges and districts judges. Resolution I provided:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"At5\">\u201cA judge in regular active service shall not accept compensation of any kind, whether in the form of loans, gifts, gratuities, honoraria or otherwise, for services hereafter performed or to be performed by him except that provided by law for the performance of his judicial duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">\u201cProvided however, the judicial council of the circuit (or in the case of courts not part of a circuit, the judges of the court in active service) <em>may upon application of a judge </em>approve- the acceptance of compensation for the performance of services other than his judicial duties <em>upon a determination that the services are in the public interest or are justified by exceptional circumstances and that the services will not interfere with his judicial duties. </em>Both the services to be performed and the compensation to be paid shall be made a matter of public record and reported to the Judicial Conference of the United States.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>In the Ninth Circuit, of which I am Circuit Justice, this resolution was assumed to bar a federal judge from even being an executor of his own mother\u2019s estate, unless of course he got a permit from the other judges. Resolution I apparently required permits for federal judges to teach in a law school \u2014 a practice which has paid enormous professional dividends and implicates nothing but the interest and energy of the judge. Justice Joseph Story (who sat here from 1811 to 1845) would, I imagine, have been appalled if he had been told that he could not write any of his many books<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> without getting permission from a group of other federal judges. And I imagine that Justice Cardozo, Judge Jerome Frank, and Judge Learned Hand would have felt the same.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\">To obtain a permit the other judges must determine if the services are \u201cin the public interest.\u201d Pray, how could they determine that unless they saw the lecture, or the lecture notes, or the manuscript? And whose \u201cpublic interest\u201d would control? Judges who have not been educated to the needs of ecology and of conservation? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Judges who still have a \u201cplantation\u201d state of mind and relegate many minorities to second-class citizenship? Judges who have a narrow view of freedom of expression or a broad view of due process? Public issues deal with a vast contrariety of views-; and judges, like other people, are to be found in all parts of the spectrum. How under the Constitution can one judge\u2019s lips be sealed because of the predestined view of other judges? An easy reply is that Resolution I covered only services for \u201ccompensation.\u201d But books entail royalties; and tax-wise it is not always easy to disassociate an author from royalties. Even though they go ultimately to charity, they pass through his income tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">It is time that an end be put to these efforts of federal judges to ride herd on other federal judges. This is a form of \u201chazing\u201d having no place under the Constitution. Federal judges are entitled, like other people, to the full freedom of the First Amendment. If they break a law, they can be prosecuted. If they become corrupt or sit in cases in which they have a personal or family stake, they can be impeached by Congress. But I search the Constitution in vain for any power of surveillance that other federal judges have over those aberrations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>of the idiosyncrasies may be displeasing to those who walk in more measured, conservative steps. But those idiosyncrasies can be of no possible constitutional concern to other federal judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">It is time we put an end to the monstrous practices that seem about to overtake us, by vacating the orders of the Judicial Council that brand Judge Chandler as unfit to sit in oncoming cases.

The preparation and adoption of that great document was a turning point in the history of this country and of the world. Our Constitution gave new hopes and dreams for freedom and equal justice to citizens of this country and signaled to the suffering and oppressed people everywhere that government could be humane. One of the many factors which gave birth to these new dreams and hopes was our constitutional plan for a more independent judicial system than had ever before existed. Judges in our system were to hold their offices during \u201cgood Behaviour,\u201d their compensation was not to be \u201cdiminished during their Continuance in Office,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and they were to be removed only after impeachment and trial by the United States Congress. While judges, like other people, can be tried, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>convicted, and punished for crimes, no word, phrase, clause, sentence, or even the Constitution taken as a whole, gives any indication that any judge was ever to be partly disqualified or wholly removed from office except by the admittedly difficult method of impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by two-thirds of the Senate. Such was the written guarantee in our Constitution of the independence of the judiciary, and such has always been the proud boast of our people.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">I am regrettably compelled in this case to say that the Court today, in my judgment, breaks faith with this grand constitutional principle. Judge Chandler, duly appointed, duly confirmed, and never impeached by the Congress, has been barred from doing his work by other judges. The real facts of this case cannot be obscured, nor the effect of the Judicial Council\u2019s decisions defended, by any technical, legalistic effort to show that one or the other of the Council\u2019s orders issued over the years is \u201cvalid.\u201d This case must be viewed for what it is \u2014 a long history of harassment of Judge Chandler by other judges who somehow feel he is \u201cunfit\u201d to hold office. Their efforts have been going on for at least five years and still Judge Chandler finds no relief. What is involved here is simply a blatant effort on the part of the Council through concerted action to make Judge Chandler a \u201csecond-class judge,\u201d depriving him of the full power of his office and the right to share equally with all other federal judges in the privileges and responsibilities of the Federal Judiciary. I am unable to find in our Constitution or in any statute any authority whatever for judges to arrogate to themselves and to exercise such powers. Judge Chandler, like every other federal judge including the Justices of this Court, is subject to removal from office only by the constitutionally prescribed mode of impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>The wise authors of our Constitution provided for judicial independence because they were familiar with history; they knew that judges of the past \u2014 good, patriotic judges \u2014 had occasionally lost not only their offices but had also sometimes lost their freedom and their heads because of the actions and decrees of other judges. They were determined that no such things should happen here. But it appears that the language they used and the protections they thought they had created are not sufficient to protect our judges from the contrived intricacies used by the judges of the Tenth Circuit and this Court to uphold what has happened to Judge Chandler in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">I fear that unless the actions taken by the Judicial Council in this case are in some way repudiated, the hope for an independent judiciary will prove to have been no more than an evanescent dream.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\"> See <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>Judicial Council, </em>382 U.
