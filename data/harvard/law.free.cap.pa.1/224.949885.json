Dixon, Peter Haughawout, Joseph Patton, William D. Gearhart, Joseph Reader, and Robert Scott, to recover damages for taking and selling a plough, the property of the plaintiff. The plough had been levied upon and sold by George A. Dixon, one of the defendants, who had been duly appointed collector of school tax for Rush township, Northumberland county, by the board of school directors of said township, forthe year 1843.

Gear-hart, Joseph Reader, William Moore, and Robert Scott, at the time, and before the alleged trespass was supposed to be committed, were directors of the Rush township common school district, duly and legally elected, and that the said George A. Dixon was, at the time and before the committing of the alleged trespass, collector of the common school tax for said district, duly appointed by said directors before that time; that the said directors, at a meeting duly convened for that purpose, on the-day of-, 1841, it was resolved, that a school tax for said district, equal to two-thirds of the county tax, should be assessed and levied; that at the time, and before the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>mitting of the alleged trespass, a duplicate, containing the name of the said Challes Gearhart, jun., and the'names of the persons in the said common school district rateable for and chargeable with taxes for common school purposes, in said district, for the common school year for 1843, and also a warrant annexed to said duplicate, signed and sealed by the said Peter Haughawout, president of the board of directors, and attested by the said Joseph Patton, secretary of said board, and signed also by the said William D. Gearhart, Joseph Reader, William Moore, and Robert Scott, directors of said common school for said year, was issued and put into the hands of the said George A. Dixon, to be executed; and that the said George A. Dixon, by virtue of the said warrant, and in pursuance thereof, did demand and require of the said Charles Gearhart, jun., payment of the tax with which he stood charged in the said duplicate, on the 3d day of February, 1843, at the county aforesaid, to wit, the sum of $3 15; and because the said Charles neglected and refused to pay the same, the said George A. Dixon did, on the 9th day of March, 1843, at the county aforesaid, by virtue of said warrant,- levy on the plough of the said Charles, in plaintiff\u2019s declaration mentioned, and advertised the same for sale, agreeably to law, and sold the same on the 19lh day of March, in the year last aforesaid, as it was lawful for him to do, for the cause aforesaid, which is the trespass whereof the said plaintiff complains against them: and this they are ready to verify.

Dixon, rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-6\">The defendants, to maintain the issue on their part, offered in evidence the Rush township school-book, after they had proved it to be the book kept by the school directors.

In leaving it to the jury to. find that a majority of the school directors had made a decision as to the amount of tax to be levied, previous to their making out the duplicate on the 29th of May, 1843, without any evidence to that effect.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-5\"><em>Comly, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ak5\">argued the book was not produced by the proper officer, or by any person authorized by him, and was therefore improperly admitted in evidence. Hockenbury <em>v. </em>Carlisle, 1 Watts, &amp; Serg. 282; 9 Watts, 317. Parol evidence was improperly admitted and- left to the jury as sufficient to prove the decision of the board as to the amount of tax to be levied f it ought to have been proved by the minutes of the proceedings'of the board. The acts of Assembly do not in terms require the proceedings of the board to be entered on the minutes; but the 3d sect, of act 13th June, 1836, Purd. Dig. 315, requires the board to choose a secretary. His name imports his duties, which can only be to record the acts and proceedings of the board. But the board had ho power to levy the tax after the first Monday of May: see sect. 4th of same act. And though the 4th section of the act passed 25th April, 1844, (Pamph. Laws, 396,) makes the assessment valid from the date of the act, yet it does not justify trespasses previously committed. A different construction of this act would make it conflict with the constitution of the state and that of the United States.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-6\"><em>Jordan </em>and <em>Hegim, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao7\">contended that the board of school directors are not required by any act of the legislature to make a minute of their proceedings. That if a majority meet, and determine to lay a tax, their determination may be proved by parol. United States <em>v. </em>Fillebrown, 7 Peters, 47; United States <em>v. </em>Dandridge, 12 Wheat. 69. The court below were, therefore, right in submitting it to the jury to determine whether a majority of the board had authorized a tax to be levied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-7\">\u25a0 That the act of 25th of April, 1844, cured' any defect in the levying of the tax, and was clearly retrospective in its operation; and that if the minutes of the board did not show that a meeting had been held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>for the purpose of levying a tax, the duplicate and warrant, signed by all the directors, dated the ,29th of May, 1843, was sufficient.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-4\"><em>Greenough, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-5\">This was not a vexatious suit, but one to try a right of importance to all the inhabitants of the township. There was no tax laid before, or on the first Monday in May. He did not consider that part of the act, fixing the time, as merely directory; but if the directors did not levy the tax on or before the first Monday in May, it is to be laid by the taxable inhabitants of the township or district. The power of school directors to levy a tax on the district is limited within a certain time, and if they do not exercise this power within or at the proper time, they cannot do so afterwards.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-6\">The board of school directors are required to have a secretaiy, and to keep minutes of their proceedings. The minutes, if regularly kept, would be evidence; but irregular minutes cannot be supplied by parol evidence.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"Aq8\">Burnside, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The plaintiff in error has no cause to complain of the way he was treated in the court below. Rush township had adopted the school system. The law required the school directors, not only of Rush township, but the directors of every school district which adopted the common school system, before the first Monday in May, annually, to levy a tax for school purposes, not less than equal to, or more than treble the amount which the district is entitled to receive out of the annual state appropriation. Sect. 4, act of 1836. Here is a positive duty, enjoined by express legislative enactment. Disobedience to an act of Assembly is an indictable offence at common law. 4 Black. Com. 122; 2 Smith\u2019s Laws, 593. The school directors of Rush township were enjoined, by law, to levy the tax on or before the first Monday in May. The act of Assembly is directory as to the time, and if by accident, or from any other cause, this duty was omitted, it could be performed in any reasonable time thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">The Court of Common Pleas should have received the township school-book, offered in evidence by the defendants in error. It was evidence, and the best evidence of the proceedings of the school board, and where it was defective, it might be explained or supplied by parol testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">There is no error in the admission of testimony in the first, second, and third bills of exception; nor is there any substance in the errors assigned to the charge of the court. The law does not require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>school directors to keep \u00e1 record of their proceedings, although it is better that they should do so. The duplicate and warrant were signed by the whole board, and <em>issued in </em>blank, on the 29th of May, 1843. It was some time before a collector could be obtained. Dixon was not appointed until the 30th of September. He demanded the tax from tire plaintiff in error, and payment was refused. It was then his duty to levy and sell. The proceedings of the school directors, his duplicate, and the warrant, justified him in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">The supplemental act of the 5th April, 1844, which is alleged to be unconstitutional, was only declaratory of a sound construction of the preceding acts, and has no bearing on the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
