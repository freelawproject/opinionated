A draft of the said township was annexed to their report, the concluding words of which are as follows: <em>\u2018\u25a0\u2019\u25a0Jind that we are of opinion that said township ought to be divided, and a new township erected therefrom, according to the prayer of the petitioners.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-4\">To this report exceptions were filed, and the court granted a rule to showr cause why the proceedings should not be quashed. Upon the argument of this rule, the court dismissed the exceptions, confirmed the report of the commissioners, and ordered and decreed that all that part of the said township of Bethel, on the southern side of the line run. by the commissioners, and particularly set forth in their report, be erected into a new township, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-5\">\u2022 The following are the exceptions filed to the proceedings and report of the commissioner, in the court below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-6\">1. There is no authority in the Court of Quarter Sessions to entertain such petition as was presented in this case, or power to make such .an order as was issued on said petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-7\">2. The petition asks three commissioners to be appointed to view and ascertain the division line to be established through said township, and does not ask for any inquiry into the necessity or expediency of dividing the said township of Bethel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-8\">. 3. The order of the court authorizes the commissioners only to malee a plot of the township of Bethel, the township proposed to be divided, and the division line, and does not authorize them to inquire into the necessity or expediency of dividing the aforesaid township of Bethel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-9\">4. That due notice was not given to the inhabitants of the township <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>of Bethel who were opposed to the division, to enable them to attend and contest the division before the commissioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-4\">5. That a majority of the inhabitants of the township of Bethel are opposed to the division of the said township, and there is no occasion for the division thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-5\">It was admitted that no notice of the tim\u00e9 and place of meeting, &amp;c. of the commissioners was given to the inhabitants of the township of Bethel who were opposed to the division of said township, than such as appears on the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\">The following are the material errors assigned in this court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-7\">1. The court erred in dismissing the exceptions and the rule to show cause why the proceedings should not be quashed; and in confirming the report of the commissioners, and in making the order and decree contained in the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-8\">2. The court erred in refusing to quash the proceedings.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b101-9\">Uhich, against the proceedings.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-10\">There is no authority in the Court of Quarter Sessions to entertain such petition as was presented in this case, or power to make such an order as was issued on said petition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-11\">The petition ought to set forth, that the inhabitants of the township generally labour under great inconvenience, and not that the petitioners alone labour under great inconvenience.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-12\">It is only in those cases where the inhabitants of a township think their convenience requires a division of the township, that the Courts of Quarter Sessions are authorized to act at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-13\">The only distinction or difference between the act of Assembly of 24th March, 1803, 4 Smith\u2019s L. 30, 31, and of the act of 15th April, 1834, is, that in the latter act, the cofirt is authorized <em>\u201c </em>to cause the lines or boundaries of townships to be ascertained and established.\u201d In other respects the acts are the same.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-14\">The order is defective, inasmuch as it does not direct the commissioners to inquire into tbe propriety of granting the prayer of the petitioners, as is required by the act of Assembly, and could not make, neither could they be sworn to make,, the inquiry.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-15\">The order is defective, also, inasmuch as it merely directs the commissioners to make a draff of the township and of the division line, (meaning the one prayed for in the petition,) without directing them to inquire whether the division of the township could not be made by natural lines and boundaries, as is required by the act of Assembly authorizing the division of townships. Act of 15th April, 1834, Pur-' don\u2019s Digest, page 190, 191.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>The commissioners neither gave any notice whatever, nor could they give any, not being authorized to make the inquiry.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-4\">In the case of Macungie Township, 3 Rawle, 462, due and public . notice was given by advertisements, &amp;c., and the report seems to have been recommitted for the express purpose of giving such notice in that case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-5\">The inhabitants could have shown and convinced the commissioners that the division of the township could be made by natural lines and boundaries, and in that case the commissioners would have been bound to adopt such natural line or boundary as is expressly directed by the act of Assembly; at all events the inhabitants ought to have had an opportunity of being heard before the-commissioners at the time they made the plot and division of the township.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-6\">If the inhabitants generally had received the requisite notice, they would have appeared before the commissioners ; and if they had convinced them (which they could have done) that a majority of the inhabitants were opposed to the division of the township, the commissioners never would have reported that it was necessary or expedient to grant the prayer of the petitioners.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-7\"><em>J. Wddman, </em>contr\u00e1.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APg\">There is enough in the original petition to justify the order of the court. It specifies, that the part containing Fredericksburg should be the old township. This was a fact in the bosom of the court, and their order is no doubt made in such a manner as to comply with the wishes of the petitioners. At all events, it is specific and distinct, which is all that is required.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-8\">The act of Assembly expressly authorizes the court to take such order in the premises at the next term, as may appear to them just and reasonable, without limitation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-9\">In the case of Macungie Township, 14 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 68, the court decide, that the objection is fatal, <em>thatno inquiry was madehy the commissioners as to the expediency of </em>dividing the township. It does not decide that the petition and order must contain a prayer and direction to that effect. Our order ends with the words \u00a3\u00a3 to view, &amp;c.\u201d When the commissioners came to examine the law under which they were acting, they found it was necessary for them to express an opinion, and have done so. They filled up the order with the act of Assembly, and having substantially complied with its provisions, their report should not be set aside for a mere clerical defect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-10\">In the case of Macungie Township, as reported in 3 Rawle, 466, the reasoning on the first exception in that case fully applies to ours. The petition asks for viewers to view and ascertain according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>act of Assembly. The court inquired into the propriety of granting their prayer, they having set forth the reasons which induced them to make it. They appointed three men to view and ascertain according to the act of Assembly. The order of court is entered in short on the back of the petition, \u2014 \u201c appoint L. J., &amp;c., to view, &amp;c.\u201d The commissioners have complied with the act of <em>Assembly; \u201c </em>ought\u201d shows that they inquired into the expediency of dividing the township.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-4\">As to notice in the Macungie case, that point appears to have been abandoned. The act of Assembly requires no notice to be given. Notice in road cases is given under a rule of court. There is but a slight analogy between the two cases.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b103-5\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A7h\">That the commissioners were not commanded to report whether, in their opinion, the township ought to be divided, is fatal. True, they voluntarily certified that they thought the division proper; but in going beyond the terms of the order, they acted unofficially. They are to be sworn, but only to do those things rightly which they are commanded to do; and we know not that they swore to the truth of the opinion which they volunteered; officially, they certainly did not. Besides, that notice of the view should be 'given to the inhabitants, is a principle of natural justice; and the maimer of it ought to be prescribed by rule of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Order reversed and proceedings quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
