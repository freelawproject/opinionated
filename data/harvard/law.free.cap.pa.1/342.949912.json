That a written contract could not be varied by any evidence of a custom. To this position, he cited 1 Johns. 192; Chitty on Contracts, 25, 99; Greenl.

Now the witness had been a paver for thirty years; and he was called, as an expert, to speak-of the method employed by pavers to ascertain the number of bricks laid in a job without reckoning them by tale. He was allowed to prove how many of an ordinary size went to the, square yard; and from that the whole number could be ascertained by measuring the sides of the pavement, just as the whole number of shot in a pile can be ascertained by the number contained in the sides of the base. As an expert, therefore, the witness was competent. But it is said that the paving of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>top of the basin was to be done on the <em>terms </em>contained in tire written contract for paving the bottom and the sides. That contract, however, has no provision that would affect the general <em>principle; </em>and the evidence was consequently proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
