It does not appear that the plaintiff was unable <em>to </em>pay his debts; there is no evidence that any creditor suffered any loss by him. It is said by the plaintiff that these statements thus made by the defendant were false, and that he knew them to be so when he made them, and that they were made maliciously, and with a design to injure him. Whether the facts proved satisfy you that these things are so or not, is for you to decide from the evidence. Whether, if you believe all these things to be.true, it is actionable, is a question of law which the court will determine; the facts you will decide for yourselves, without being bound in any way by what I may have <em>said </em>in relation to them. The law looks upon credit with care and tenderness, as essential to trade and business generally. Formerly words imputing want of credit, to be actionable, must have imputed bankruptcy. This restricted this kind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>of verbal slander to words spoken against merchants. This notion was very soon exploded, and this narrow doctrine abandoned for one that was more just and sensible, and was declared to extend to imputations against the credit of persons engaged in <em>any business. </em>This rule now applies not only'to merchants, but also to-persons engaged in all trades and mechanical pirrsuits. Why should it not apply to farmers and husbandmen? credit is important to them; their sensibility on this point is as tender as is that of any other class in the community; their sense of honour is as bright and correct on the question of credit as any. men\u2019s. Why then is it not to be equally cared for, respected, and protected ? I imagine that no satisfactory reason could be given for an invidious distinction against the husbandman. The loss of credit bears as injuriously upon him as upon any man. His means of living and the subsistence of his family are as much endangered by its loss as are those of any class of our labouring community; his business and his occupation is an important branch of industry. The larger portion of our people is engaged in active agriculture; is not character and credit as dear to this class as it is to merchants, tradesmen, or mechanics ? The malignity which wantonly assails the one, is as culpable as that which \u00e1ssails the other; why then should not the same rule apply to all ? There is no substantial difference, and there should be no distinction in the rule of security and protection. In Starkie on Slander, at p. 119, we have an authority to the very point now at issue. There we have the case of a defendant who said of a husbandman, \u2018He owes more than he is worth; he is a runaway.\u2019 These words were held to be actionable. The counsel have not taken the trouble to prepare any authorities on either side. I have, therefore, been obliged to cast around for such authorities as came within my reach in the hurry of the trial. I adopt this as law in this case, and will apply it in the following form and terms :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-4\"><em>11 </em>If you believe that the defendant made it his business to slander the credit of the plaintiff; that his object in so doing was to injure him; that this was his purpose; that the charges were false, and that he knew them to be so at the time he gave utterance to them; that he made them maliciously, and that in consequence of them being so made, the plaintiff was sued and put to trouble and costs, then, and in that case only are the words proven to have been spoken by the defendant of the plaintiff actionable, and then and in that case only will you render a verdict for the plaintiff for such sum in damages, as you think right under all the circumstances of the case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">The jury found a general verdict for the plaintiff, and assessed the damages at $45; and the defendant, having taken a bill of exceptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>to the charge, removed the record to this court and assigned the following errors:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-4\">1. The court erred in charging the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-5\">2. The court erred in declaring the law to be, that the words spoken and laid were actionable, and that this suit could be maintained.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b68-6\">Filbert, for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-7\">No one branch of the law appeal\u2019s to be more unsettled, and the decisions upon it more uncertain and fluctuating, than the law of slander. There are some principles, however, which appear to be fixed and settled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-8\">The cause now under discussion will lead us to examine that class of cases where the words spoken and charged injuriously affect a man\u2019s office, business, or profession. In order to malee such words slanderous, it must appear that the words spoken have a direct, plain, and unquestionable allusion to a man\u2019s business or profession. Words spoken generally of a man, that may incidentally and only remotely affect his business reputation, cannot be brought into this class of cases; and therefore we say, that the words laid in the declaration, and proved at the trial, are not actionable, because they do not refer to the business or profession of the plaintiff; had no reference to anything whatever, except that the plaintiff owed almost everybody, and that unless his neighbours looked to it, they might lose their money. Almost all the cases cited in Starkie, 74, are put expressly on this ground.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-9\">Again, words to be actionable in themselves must intend to injure prospectively, and must, therefore, attack a man\u2019s integrity, skill, diligence, credit, or in some direct and positive way the subject-matter in which he deals. Starkie, 76 and 80.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-10\">The words must also be false and unfounded. The words proved by the testimony are very different from the words repeated in the charge of the judge to the jury. It was not every thing that the defendant said of the plaintiff that was false and unfounded; he did not put into circulation a gratuitous and false report, and to people with whom the plaintiff had nothing to do; but as far as the testimony goes, he only spoke to such as were creditors of the plaintiff. If what was said was calculated to hurt the plaintiff, it was also calculated to benefit his creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-11\">Again, words to be actionable must be defamatory and scandalous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-12\">The question here is, are the words charged in the declaration actionable in themselves because used of a farmer ? A farmer wants no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>credit. Whatever he sells, he sells for cash. The merchant, tlmtrader, all who buy and sell want credit; but not so the farmer.\\</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-4\">Again, words not actionable in themselves become so by reason of special damage. In this case the plaintiff\u2019s counsel has put his right to recover on the ground of special damage, and such is the allegation in the declaration. But the judge in one part of his charge puts the right of recovery on the ground, that the words charged in the declaration are actionable in themselves, without proof of special damage; and in another part, that they became so by reason of special damage. Neither the declaration nor the charge of the court represent this case to have been of an actionable character. It is not sufficient to bring a case within the true rule of law, that the declaration has been correctly framed; the allegation contained in it must be supported by the evidence. That the plaintiff was sued, harassed, and put to great expense, &amp;c., is set out as part, of the special damage, and to this the witnesses testify. The damage must be the immediate consequence of the slander; but the plaintiff would not have been sued if he had not been in debt. He was not sued because the defendant said he was in debt, &amp;e., but because he owed money to the people who sued him; These actions ought not to be encouraged, because they are against the policy of good laws.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b69-5\"><em>Ballade </em>and <em>Smith, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-6\">Hcefer was a farmer and the tenant of Phillips. One of the objects of Phillips in slandering Hcefer, was to get him to leave his farm before his lease had expired; and as a means of accomplishing this, he wished to break him up. To induce his creditors to bring a suit against him, and to ruin or injure his credit, he published the words charged in our declaration. The slanderous words, charged in the declaration, are actionable; anffiin support of this position, they cited Dobson <em>v. </em>Thornistone, 3 Mod. 112, in which it was decided, that the words, \u201c <em>he owes more money than he is worth; he is run away and </em>broke,\u201d spoken of a farmer, are actionable. In Chapman <em>v. </em>Lampire, 3 Mod. 155, to say of a carpenter, \u201che is broken and run away, and will never return again,\u201d was held actionable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-7\">And to the same principle, they cited Starkie on Slander, 84, 83. To say of a milliner, \u201c You are not worth a farthing,\u201d is actionable. Hamson <em>v. </em>Thornborough, 10 Mod. 196, To say of a drover, that \u201c he is a bankrupt,\u201d held actionable. 2 Day, 495. Slander will lie, for the speaking of words imputing insolvency to any one, to whom credit is important in the prosecution of his business. Ostrom <em>v. </em>Calkings, 5 Wend. 263. Any words spoken of a person in relation to his trade, or profession, which tend to impair his credit, are actionable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Davis <em>v. </em>Davis, 1 Nott &amp; McCord, 290. Words, if spoken of one, in any trade, profession, \u00f3r office, \u25a0which may be of probable ill consequence to such person, will afford a ground of suit. Per Yeates, Justice, McClung <em>v. </em>Ross, 5 Bin. 221.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"AW3\">Sergeant, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">That the words laid are actionable, seems fully supported by the authorities. In Dobson <em>v. </em>Thornistone, 3 Mod. 112, the plaintiff was a husbandman, and brought an action against the defendant for these words, \u201c <em>he owes more money than he is worth; he is run aioay and broke.\u201d </em>After verdict it was moved in arrest of judgment, that the words being spoken of a farmer are not actionable; it must appear the plaintiff has a trade and gets a living by it, otherwise the words spoken will not bear an action. But the court held the words actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The like judgment was given in the case of a carpenter for words, <em>\u201che is broke and ran away\u201d </em>Id. 155. The reason is, that the credit, which a man has in the world, is a means to support his business, and damage is implied from the false and malicious uttering of words calculated to impair it.</p>\n<p id=\"Asb\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
