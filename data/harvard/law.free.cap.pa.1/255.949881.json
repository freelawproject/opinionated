Dunham credits me $12 per M. After I had made my arrangement with Dunham, I asked him if I should haul on; he wanted I should hold up. Said he had bought 50,000 feet already. Bronson and I counted out the lumber, and fixed the price, and he agreed to see me p\u00e1id. I understood him that he vras to carry on the plank and shovel-handle business.

I heard Rogers tell Bronson he did not want the plank used till he got his pay for them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-9\"><em>Virgil Grenett </em>testified: \u2014 \u00ab\u00abI furnished some plank for the shop after Dunham opened his store.

Dun-ham said that an order was drawn oh him by Bronson for these plank. Rogers contended that the order was to apply on a demand Dunham had against him, but Dunham said it was not so. Dunham thought there was- a doubt about collecting the debt in Boston. There was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>some conversation that if, on settlement by Dunham with <em>Bronson, </em>there was a balance in his hands, he would pay the order; and if he collected the debt in Boston, there was a prospect of such balance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-4\">Plaintiff closed, and the defendant, to support the issues on his part, gave testimony as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-5\">' <em>Simon G. Throop </em>testified: \u2014 \u201cDunham talked about the action; thought Rogers was precipitate. Dunham insisted that he was not liable till he had received returns from the sales. Dunham said the order was to be paid when he received the proceeds of those sales. Dunham did not agree that he was liable in any other shape than through the order.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-6\">The defendant then gave in evidence an agreement, of which the following is a copy, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-7\">\u201c An agreement made and executed this 7th day of June, a. d. 1842, between Levi Bronson, of, &amp;c., of the one part, and O.

' O. D. Dunham. [Seal.]\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-8\"><em>Levi Bronson </em>testified : \u2014 \u201c The agreement of 7th June, 1842, was executed at the time it bears date. 'Dunham came to Prompton to do business after the date of the agreement. He came there, I think, in the month of June, with his goods. I think the plank were all delivered before Dunham came. I carried on the shop, and contracted generally for the lumber. Dunham bought some. He was not under obligation to furnish me plank. There was no other arrangement oetween us, about plank or handles, than what appears on the paper. I carried on the shop. Any plank that he purchased he charged to me. It was not his business, but mine, to furnish the shop. Rogers came there to contract with me for lumber in the winter previous to Dunham\u2019s coming. I made a bargain with him for plank; to pay him the money when the canal opened. Rogers furnished the plank in pursuance of the arrangement. It was before the canal opened. All that he furnished was in pursuance of that arrangement. While he was hauling the plank he said he was to have twelve dollars a thousand. Afterwards he claimed fourteen dollar's if I used them. I did not use them; the plank lay there. I went to the qity and came home, and was not prepared to pay for the plank. I objected to fourteen dollars per thousand. He said if I worked them I must allow him fourteen dollars a thousand. The plank were worked up in my absence. Rogers and I settled about the plank after Dunham had removed his store, or very near the time. Rogers came to me and brought the amount of the account, and called the plank twelve dollars a thousand. Wanted an order on Dunham, and I gave it to him. The order was conditional. I asked Rogers if Dunham would accept the order. \u25a0 He said he thought Dunham would. I think I told him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>I had nothing in Dunham\u2019s hands, to draw directly on him, but thought I should have on closing up the business, and gave him an order to that effect.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-4\"><em>Cross-examined. </em>\u2014 \u201cI had some plank when Dunham came there; don\u2019t know the quantity. I might have had from five to twenty thousand. I bought all I could find to buy and pay in goods, and I suppose he did the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-5\">\u201c I should think all the plank were not paid for by Dunham, but there were plank I paid for when plank was due me. There was no bargain except that contract. When I told Dunham that Rogers would not have the plank used, or did not like it after it was used, Dunham said he had a note against Rogers. When Dunham bought lumber I might have used his name to signify how much there was of it. Dunham\u2019s books would show credits to others of the amount charged to me. I made bargains with people, without reference to Dunham. I gave other orders on Dunham prior to this of Rogers. I think the Rogers\u2019 ash plank was laid on my own land, and not on that leased to Dunham.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-6\">The court below (Jessup, President) charged the jury, who found for the plaintiff, and the defendant, excepting to the charge, made the following assignment of error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-7\">\u2022 \u00a3\u00a3 1. The court erred in charging the jury, that if they should believe, from all the evidence in the case, that the plank were used by direction of Dunham, or that he assumed to arrange the amount due for them, with Rogers, by the way of the note, the plaintiff was entitled to recover the value of the plank in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-8\">\u00a3\u00a3 2. The court erred in charging the jury that, under the written agreement, there was a mutual liability to loss, and a mutual chance at obtaining a profit; and if so, they were partners, and that the plank were used in the joint enterprise, and that thus the partnership became liable for them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-9\">\u00a3\u00a3 3. The court erred in charging the jury, that if they find in the evidence that the plank were used in manufacturing the handles, under the arrangement made by Dunham and Bronson, without actual sale by Rogers to either of them, they should find for the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-10\"><em>Cooper, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxNR\">contended, that the rule, that all who participate in profits are liable as partners, is subject to many exceptions. To this point he cited Muzzy <em>v. </em>Whitney, 10 Johns. 226, and Heckert <em>v. </em>Fegely, 6 Watts &amp; Serg. 139, 143.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-11\">A clerk in a grocery store, at a fixed salary and a commission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>seven per cent, on the profits, is not a partner. Miller v. Bartlett and another, 15 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 137.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-4\">Where a share of the profits is given as a payment for labour, it will not constitute a partnership. Collyer on Partnership, 14, 43, 44, 45, 46. For the general doctrine upon the subject of partnership, he cited Haskell v. Blanchard, 4 East, 144; 5th ed. of Chitty on Contracts, 248, and Collyer, as above .referred to.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-5\">Collins, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyG\">argued that there was some evidence of a sale of the plank to Dunham by Rpgers, and of his use or employment of them in the enterprise; and if soothe amount of the evidence would be for the jury, and therefore the first assignment of errors is not sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-6\">The legal construction of the article on which the -enterprise rested will raise'a partnership. The object evidently was to unite their credit, labour, and capital, in about equal sums, and to conduct the business of manufacturing handles, through the aid of a store of goods for their common profit, and with a mutual liability to lose. If so, they are partners. 6 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 337; Chitty on Contracts, 232, 233, 240, 245.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-7\">The plank were used by Bronson without being purchased by him, and with the consent of Dunham, and brought into the common enterprise. If -so, as they went to increase the fund, the partners were liable for them in- trover. We, might waive the tort, and sue on a quantum meruit, and recover their value against one of the partners, if he did not jilead in abatement. This is not denied, but conceded, on the other side, if the facts prove a partnership, as contended for by us.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"AQe\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">* It is not alleged that this lumber was sold immediately to Dunham, and as it was furnished to Bronson and used by him, if Dunham is not liable tor the price of it as Bronson\u2019s partner, he is not liable for it at all. Do the terms of their agreement make him liable for Bronson\u2019s purchases to third persons ? Bronson let his storehouse, with the unenclosed ground, to Dunham, for the purposes of a store and lumber yard ; and agreed to furnish him wooden handles for shovels and other implements, made to order, out of Bronson\u2019s stuff, and to be paid for, according to a tariff of prices, out of the store or the proceeds of the handles; while Dunham agreed to stock the store and conduct the business of it. So far the agreement discloses no feature of partnership ; but in further compensation of Bronson\u2019s labour, skill, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>rent of the storehouse, Dunham agreed to allow him a commission of fifty per cent, on the net profits of the whole. Now, it has been so often and so invariably ruled in England and America, that a commission on profits is not such an interest in-the concern as constitutes partnership, that the point is at rest. What staggers the mind, in this instance, is the apparent shallowness of the distinction, when it is considered that a commission of fifty per cent, is no more nor less than an equal division of the profits; but it must not be forgotten that the distinction is an arbitrary one, resting on authority, not principle; and that, whatever be the proportion, the relation produced by a compensation in the form of a commission is in every instance the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">But, by the terms of the contract, Bronson, and not Dunham, was to procure and pay for the stuff; and they were not to be partners in that part of the business. This provision, I admit, would be inoperative against strangers, if the parties had held themselves out to the public as partners, both in buying and selling; but assuming, for the moment, that there was indeed a partnership in the handles when furnished, and in the store when stocked with goods, yet it is to be borne in mind that the handles, as well as the store-goods, were to,be put into the concern as separate contributions to the joint-stock ; and that, as the stuff for the handles was to be procured by Bronson, it was, consequently, to be paid for by him, just as the store-goods were to be procured and paid for by Dunham, having been purchased on separate account. There may be a partnership for selling, and not for buying; or, for buying, and -not for selling; or, for both buying and selling, which is the most usual: as, if several put separate quantities of wheat into a common stock, to be ground into flour and sold on joint account; or agree to buy jointly, and divide the article when bought; or agree to buy and sell on joint account. In the first case, each would be liable for his own purchases only; but in the second and third cases, each would be liable for the whole. Now, if\u2019 there were any partnership in this instance, it would be of the first class; and in any view of the case, the defendant would not be liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Judgment reversed, and venire de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
