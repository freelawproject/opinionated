I further order and direct that my personal property be sold as soon as conveniently can be done, and the moneys arising from such sale to be applied towards the maintenance and education of my aforesaid three children, after the payment of my funeral .expenses. Lastly, I nominate, constitute and appoint John Stahl, of the borough of Harrisburg, to be the executor of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>my last will and testament: and I do further appoint the said John Stahl the guardian of the persons and estate of my three children, Theodore Lyne, Amelia Elizabeth Lyne, and Alfred Lyne.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-4\">\u201cIn witness wdiereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal, the 7th day of April, a. d. 1838.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-5\">The Court of Common Pleas, (Eldr\u00e9d, President,) after argument, delivered the opinion which follows, and entered judgment for the plaintiffs. Whereupon, the counsel of defendant excepted to the opinion and removed the record to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-6\"><em>Opinion. </em>\u2014 \u00ab Whether the will given in evidence, executed as it was during the coverture of Eliza Lyne, late Eliza Jones, is of any validity, must depend altogether upon the construction of the deed of Eliza Jones to Christian Stahl, executed and duly rendered on the 8th April, 1825, when she was a single woman, and had full power to grant and convey the property on such terms as she thought proper. By this deed she conveys the property in dispute to Christian Stahl, \u00a3 in trust for the sole and separate uses and benefits of herself and her heirs and assigns for ever, but in such a way, and manner that if at any future period the said Eliza Jones should intermarry with any person or persons, her husband or husbands shall by no usage or custom whatever have any right, title, or claim or interest to the rents, issues, and profits of the premises. Nor shall the said premises, nor the rents, issues and profits thereof, be in any way or manner liable for any debts which he or they may now owe, or which he or they may hereafter contract, but be subject to her own order alone, any thing hereinafter contained to the contrary notwithstanding.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-7\">\u201c In other wrords, did Eliza Jones, afterward Eliza Lyne, reserve to herself the power in the above deed to convey the property by a will that she might hereafter make during her coverture ? I take it that it is not material to this question that she devised the property to her heirs at law, in accordance with the deed of trust. If she has reserved the power to dispose of the property by will, she could have devised it to a stranger. One act of Assembly relating to wills, passed 8th April, 1833, authorizes a married woman,\u00a3 under a power legally created for the purpose,\u2019 to dispose of her real and personal estate. It cannot be denied that Eliza Jones, when she executed this will, being then unmarried, could have reserved to herself the power to dispose of the property by will during coverture ; the question is, did she do so ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-8\">\u201cTn Lancaster <em>v. </em>Dolan, 1 Rawle, it is laid down as the rule that a married woman has no power but what is expressly given. In the case of Thomas <em>v. </em>Folwell, 2 Wharton, this rule is recognised as the settled law in Pennsylvania: \u00a3 That a married woman is to be deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>to possess no power in respect to her separate estate but what is positively given or reserved for her by the instrument creating such estate.\u2019 Several other decisions recognise this doctrine, of a later date. So that whatever may be the law in other states, or in England, we must take the rule here indicated with so much conformity as the law of this state: besides, this rule has the merit of substantial justice to support it. In the case of Thomas <em>v. </em>Folwell, the real estate was^ granted by Allen and his wife to the trustee, his heirs and assigns, in fee-simple, to have and hold the same unto the trustee, his heirs and assigns for ever, in trust to and for the only proper use of the wife, her heirs and assigns for ever. The trustee to receive the rents, issues and profits, and pay them over to the wife, or to such person and in such manner as she shall or may direct, order, or appoint from time to time, and at all times hereafter. During the coverture, Mrs. Allen made her will, devising the property to her husband. The court held that she had no power to make a will and dispose of the property during coverture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-3\">\u201c Was, then, Eliza Lyne, late Jones, authorized during her coverture, to make a will under a power legally created for the purpose, in the words of an act of Assembly, which is in effect the same as the rule laid down by the Supreme Court ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-4\">\u201c In the deed to Christian Stahl she conveys the property in trust for her own separate and sole benefit, and that of her heirs and assigns for ever. This deed conveys the whole estate, the rents, issues and profits to herself during life, and the remainder to her heirs and assigns for ever; and provides \u2018 that no future husband shall have any claims or interest to the rents, issues, and profits of the premises. Nor shall the said premises, nor the rents, issues and profits thereof, be in any \u25a0way liable for any debts which he may owe or hereafter contract, but be subject to her order alone.\u2019 These provisions in this deed places the parties, as nearly as may be, in the same condition as was the wife placed in the case of Thomas <em>v. </em>Folwell; here the rents, issues and profits of the premises are to be received by the trustee, and paid over to Eliza Jones without interruption by any act of a husband that she might have, and subject to her order alone. In that case they were to be paid to Mrs. Allen, the wife, or to such person and in such manner as she shall or may direct, order, and appoint, from time to time, and at \u2022 all times hereafter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-5\">\u201c It is said that in this deed of trust, Eliza Jones reserved the control of the land, and the power of disposing of it during coverture, by having inserted in her deed the clause \u2014 c Nor shall the said premises, nor the rents, issues, and profits thereof, be liable for her husband\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>debts, &amp;c., but be subject to her own order alone.\u2019 The counsel contends from these words that not only the rents, &amp;c., but the premises are subject to her order alone, and hence it is she may devise the property by will during her coverture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-4\">\u201c Taking the whole sentence together, as well as the whole deed, I come to a different conclusion. Mrs. Lyne, late Jones, evidently contemplated marriage, and, to secure her property to her own separate use, and to her children after her death, makes the deed already referred to, and conveys the whole in fee-simple, in trust for her sole and separate use during her life, whether married or single, and intending to control the property during her life, for further caution provides against the husband, or his creditors during her life, having any control over the premises, or the rents, issues, and profits. This deed, like the case in Thomas <em>v. </em>Folwell, conveys in fee-simple to the trustee. Nor is there reserved to Mrs. Lyne stronger language of intention to convey it by will in this case than in that. In that case the rents, &amp;c. were to be paid to the wife, or to such person and in such manner as she shall from time to time, and at all times hereafter, order and direct. In this case the counsel seems to think that there is force in the words \u2014 \u2018 In trust for herself, her heirs and assigns,\u2019 which shows that her intention was to reserve the liberty of disposing of her property by will during coverture or otherwise. On a reference to the case of West <em>v. </em>West, in 10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, it will be seen that the word \u2018assigns\u2019 makes no difference. In view, then, of the act of Assembly, and the settled law in Pennsylvania, I am of the opinion Eliza Lyne had no authority to make the will given in evidence, and accordingly give judgment for the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-5\">The following error was assigned:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-6\">The court erred in rendering judgment for plaintiffs in the case stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-7\"><em>Boas, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-8\">Under the 2d section of the act of 8th of April, 1833, Purdon\u2019s Digest, (Stroud\u2019s edition, 1032,) a married woman may, under a power legally created for the purpose, dispose of her real estate. He argued that where a power is generally given, without defining the mode in which it must be executed; it may be exercised either by deed or will. Sugden on Powers, 207. Any words indicating an intention to give or reserve a power are sufficient. Ibid. 97, 98.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-9\">Feoffment of lands generally, and devise to uses, it shall be as owner; but where owner is not able to grant, but by virtue of the power may grant the land, it shall be by the power, and not as owner. 1 P.

Sugden on Powers, 207.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-3\">A power was, therefore, legally created to dispose of her real estate by will, as well as by deed. A gift simply to her separate use, as feme covert, is the same as a gift to such uses as she may appoint by deed or will. Ibid. 115. He also cited Sugden on Powers, 116\u2014119; 9 Ves. J. 520; 4 Digest N. Y.

Act of 8th of April, 1833, sec. 1; West <em>v. </em>West, 10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 445; Thomas <em>v. </em>Folwell, 2 Whart. 11; Wallace <em>v. </em>Coston, 9 Watts, 137. He also cited Dorrance <em>v. </em>Scott, 3 Whart. 309, to show that if the wife have a power to charge the estate by deed or will, this does not give the power to charge it by a judgment. A power reserved to the wife to dispose of real estate by deed, would not confer the power to dispose of it by will, because the act of 1833 requires a power to be legally created to dispose of real estate by will. To this point he cited 32 Law Lib., Roper on Husband and Wife, 111, 113. The principle of the cases is to preserve the wife\u2019s estate from the influence of her husband; and to carry this out, courts will recognise nothing but an express power.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b119-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AHU\">We affirm this judgment, for the reasons given by the president of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
