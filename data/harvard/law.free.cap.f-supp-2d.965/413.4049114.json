KEENAN, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b454-22\">Before the Court is a motion to dismiss brought by the Generic Manufacturer Defendants (\u201cGeneric Defendants\u201d). For the reasons that follow, Generic Defendants\u2019 motion is granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-23\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b454-24\">Plaintiffs in this case were prescribed Fosamax and its generic equivalent, alendronate sodium, an oral bisphosphonate. This MDL involves claims that Fosamax, manufactured by Merck, or its generic equivalent, manufactured by the Generic Defendants, caused users to suffer from a condition known as osteonecrosis of the jaw (\u201cONJ\u201d). Plaintiffs have asserted claims for failure to warn, negligence, design defect, breach of warranty, and fraud against both Merck and the Generic Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-25\">Generic Defendants have moved for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). They argue that plaintiffs\u2019 state law tort claims are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>preempted by federal regulations applicable to generic drugs in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing </em>(Mensing), \u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2567, 180 L.Ed.2d 580 (2011) and <em>Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett </em>(Bartlett), \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2466, 186 L.Ed.2d 607 (2013). Alternatively, the Generic Defendants argue that the claims are inadequately pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">A motion for judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) is governed by the same standard as a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Cleveland v. Caplaw Enters., </em>448 F.3d 518, 521 (2d Cir.2006). A motion to dismiss under 12(b)(6) may be granted only if, accepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a court finds that the plaintiff has failed to set forth fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests. <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">A complaint must contain sufficient factual matter to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citing <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955). The plausibility standard requires that \u201cthe plaintiff plead[] factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged\u201d and demands \u201cmore than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955). Although a court must accept as true all factual allegations in a complaint, that tenet is \u201cinapplicable to legal conclusions,\u201d and \u201c[a] pleading that offers \u2018labels and conclusions\u2019 or \u2018a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-16\">B. Law of Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b455-17\">The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution provides that federal law \u201cshall be the supreme Law of the Land ... any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d U.S. Const, art. VI, cl. 2. \u201cImpossibility\u201d preemption, which is at issue here, occurs when it is \u201cimpossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements.\u201d <em>Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, </em>514 U.S. 280, 287, 115 S.Ct. 1483, 131 L.Ed.2d 385 (1995) (citation omitted); <em>accord U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Mfg. Co., LLC v. City of New York, </em>703 F.Supp.2d 329, 334 (S.D.N.Y.2010). In other words, \u201c[w]here state and federal law \u2018directly conflict,\u2019 state law must give way.\u201d <em>Mensing, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2577 (quoting <em>Wyeth v. Levine, </em>555 U.S. 555, 583, 129 S.Ct. 1187, 173 L.Ed.2d 51 (2009) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment)).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-18\">In <em>Mensing, </em>plaintiffs brought failure to warn claims under state law against several generic manufacturers of the drug metoclopramide, a drug commonly used to treat digestive tract problems. <em>Mensing, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2573. Plaintiffs alleged that the generic manufacturers violated state tort laws by failing to change the labels for metoclopramide to adequately warn of the risk of a severe neurological disorder. <em>Id. </em>The applicable state tort laws required manufacturers that are \u201cor should be aware of [their] product\u2019s danger to label that product in a way that renders it reasonably safe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under federal regulations, however, the generic manufacturers had a \u201cduty of sameness\u201d \u2014 that is, that \u201cthe warning labels of a brand-name drug and its generic copy must always be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2574-75. The Supreme Court held that plaintiffs failure to warn claims under state law were preempted by federal law because \u201cit was impossible for the Manufacturers to comply with both their state-law duty to change the label and their federal law duty to keep the label the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2578.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Under federal law, a generic drug manufacturer may obtain approval of a drug from the FDA simply by showing equivalence to a reference-listed drug that has already undergone clinical trials and gained approval from the FDA. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A). A generic drug manufacturer has the responsibility to ensure that the labeling for the generic drug is the same as the labeling approved for the listed drug. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(v) &amp; (j)(4)(G); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 314.94(a)(8) &amp; 314.127(a)(7). The FDA interprets these regulations as imposing an ongoing duty for generic manufacturers to update their product labels to ensure the sameness of the generic and name-brand drug labels. <em>Mensing, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2575; 57 Fed.Reg. 17961 (1992) (\u201cAbbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) product\u2019s labeling must be the same as the listed drug product\u2019s labeling because the listed drug product is the basis for ANDA approval\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In <em>Bartlett, </em>the issue presented was whether state law design defect claims are also preempted under <em>Mensing. </em>The plaintiff, Bartlett suffered tragic side effects from the generic form of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory called sulindac. She prevailed in district court on a design defect claim, and the First Circuit affirmed the judgment. In reversing the First Circuit, the Supreme Court held that \u201cit was impossible for Mutual to comply with both its state-law duty to strengthen the warnings on sulindac\u2019s label and its federal-law duty not to alter sulindac\u2019s label. Accordingly, the state law is pre-empted.\u201d <em>Bartlett, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2473.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Generic Defendants have based their motion to dismiss largely on the Supreme Court\u2019s preemption jurisprudence as set forth in <em>Mensing </em>and <em>Bartlett. </em>The Court will now explore whether how these cases implicated plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Generic Manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">C. Failure to Warn</p>\n<p id=\"AuV5\">Plaintiffs concede preemption on many of their failure to warn claims, but argue that <em>Mensing </em>merely \u201cnarrow[s] the field of claims that can fairly be assured under failure to warn theories.\u201d According to plaintiffs, \u201cit is clear that claims that generic manufacturers should have unilaterally strengthened their warnings are preempted,\u201d but other claims under failure to warn survive. Specifically, plaintiffs contend that the following two categories of failure to warn claims are not preempted: (1) alleged failure to timely update its labels, and (2) duty to communicate warnings to plaintiffs and their physicians. The Court will turn its analysis to whether these narrow claims of failure to warn are preempted by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">i. \u201cFailure to Update\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">As an initial matter, plaintiffs contend that \u201cmany of the generic defendants have already made a binding judicial admission that they did not timely add the ONJ information Merck first included in its label in March of 2010.\u201d According to plaintiffs, Defendants Caraco and Sun Pharmaceuticals did not employ the updated label for a year after Merck issued it. Plaintiffs make similar allegations regarding Mylan, Aurobindo, Northstar, and Watson. The Generic Defendants ardently reject the notion that they admitted to a delay in updating the labels, adding, \u201cnor has there been any regulatory or judicial finding that any Generic Defendants\u2019 label revisions were untimely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>The Court need not reach the question of whether any alleged \u201cadmissions\u201d of delay by Generic Defendants are \u201cbinding.\u201d Rather, it is sufficient for the Court to note that plaintiffs have adequately pleaded that some Generic Defendants\u2019 delay in updating their labels was unreasonable. Therefore, the relevant issue here is whether these \u201cfailure to update\u201d claims are preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Although courts in other circuits have considered this issue, it is one of first impression for this Circuit. This Court joins the majority of other jurisdictions in finding that \u201cfailure to update\u201d claims against the Generic Defendants are not preempted. Although Generic Defendants were preempted by federal law from including additional warnings, they were required under federal law to ensure that their labeling reflected FDA-approved warnings for the name-brand drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\"><em>Fulgenzi v. PLIVA, Inc., </em>711 F.3d 578 (6th Cir.2013) supports this conclusion. In that case, a brand-name drug manufacturer had updated its warning label in July 2004 to include the risks of long-term use of the drug. <em>Id. </em>at 580. The plaintiff took the generic version of the drug for extended periods on two different occasions\u2014 between September and November 2004, and then for over a year in 2006 and 2007. <em>Id. </em>The generic drug manufacturer did not update its warning label to match the label of the brand-name drug during the entire time the plaintiff was taking the drug. <em>Id. </em>at 580-82. The plaintiff developed serious complications and she sued the generic drug manufacturer under Ohio tort law, claiming the generic drug manufacturer\u2019s failure to update its warning label \u201c \u2018rendered its warnings inadequate under Ohio law1 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The Sixth Circuit concluded that the preemption doctrine did not bar the plaintiff\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cIn our case, not only could PLIVA have independently updated its labeling to match that of the branded manufacturer through the CBE process, <em>see Mensing, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2575, but it had a federal duty to do so, 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.150(b)(10).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">In this case, as in <em>Fulgenzi, </em>it was possible for the Generic Defendants to comply with their federal duty to match their labels to the Fosamax label, while also satisfying their state tort law duty to adequately warn the consumers of alendronate sodium. Indeed, its obligations under federal law were coextensive with state law requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Various state and federal trial courts have reached the same conclusion, based on comparable fact patterns. See <em>Phelps v. Wyeth, Inc., Pliva, Inc., et al., </em>938 F.Supp.2d 1055, 1061 (D.Or.2013) (\u201cUnlike the failure to warn claim in <em>Mensing, </em>plaintiffs do not claim that Pliva was required to use a different or stronger warning label; they merely claim that, under Oregon law, Pliva was negligent by failing to update its label to match the name-brand label \u2014 a requirement that is consistent with the FDCA. Thus, because plaintiffs\u2019 state-law claim does not make it impossible for Pliva to comply with federal law, no conflict exists and preemption is not warranted\u201d); <em>Johnson v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., </em>10 CV 404, 2012 WL 1866839 at *3 (W.D.La., May 21, 2012) (\u201c[I]mpossibility preemption would not apply to any requirement ... that the Generic Defendants update their product labels to reflect labeling changes made by the brand name manufacturer\u201d); <em>Cooper v. Wyeth, Inc, </em>09-929, 2012 WL 733846 at *4 (M.D.La., Mar. 6, 2012); <em>Couick v. Wyeth, Inc., </em>09-cv-210, 2012 WL 79670 at *5 (W.D.N.C., Jan. 11, 2012); <em>Del Valle v. PLIVA Inc., </em>11-113, 2011 WL 7168620 at *5 (S.D.Tex., Dec. 21, 2011) (generic drug manufacturers\u2019 failure to update their labels, \u201cafter the brand named manufactur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>ers enhanced their warning labels in 2004, might preclude the application of conflict pre-emption, but only as to the labeling information added by the brand named manufacturers in 2004\u201d); <em>In re Reglan Litigation, </em>No. 289, 2012 WL 1613329 (Super.Ct. Atlantic County, N.J.2012); <em>Fisher v. Pelstring, </em>817 F.Supp.2d 791, 805 (D.S.C.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Generic Defendants have argued that since there is a federal statute specifically excluding private causes of action for violations of FDA regulations, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 337(a), state tort suits premised on violations of federal law are impliedly preempted. <em>Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs\u2019 Legal Cmte., </em>531 U.S. 341, 348, 121 S.Ct. 1012, 148 L.Ed.2d 854 (2001) (holding that state law \u201cfraud on the FDA\u201d claims were impliedly preempted by the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act). However, these failure to update claims are not premised on federal law, but rather on an independent state duty. As such, the federal duty of sameness is not \u201ca critical element\u201d in plaintiffs\u2019 cases. <em>Buckman, </em>531 U.S. at 353, 121 S.Ct. 1012 (\u201c[W]ere plaintiffs to maintain their fraud-on-the-agency claims here, they would not be relying on traditional state tort law which had predated the federal enactments in questions. On the contrary, the existence of these federal enactments is a critical element in their case.\u201d). The theory of these cases would work \u201cequally well against a branded-drug manufacturer, or a generic-drug manufacturer whose branded counterpart had not updated its warning.\u201d <em>Fulgenzi, </em>711 F.3d at 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">It is important to emphasize, however, that consistent with <em>Mensing, </em>the duty of the Generic Defendants extends <em>only </em>to their alleged failure to update the label within a reasonable time after Merck did. Plaintiffs cannot claim that the Generic Defendants should have included additional warnings; any such allegations are preempted under <em>Mensing. </em>Instead, plaintiffs are left to argue only that the Generic Defendants\u2019 warning was inadequate <em>to the extent </em>that it did not include the language contained in the updated label.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">ii. \u201cFailure To Communicate\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Plaintiffs also assert that the Generic Defendants may also be held liable for failing to communicate the 2003 and 2004 labeling changes to physicians and consumers through the use of \u201cDear Doctor\u201d letters or by other methods. Plaintiffs argue that <em>Mensing </em>held only that generic manufacturers could not send \u201cDear Doctor\u201d letters that contained <em>new </em>or <em>additional </em>warnings, and the Supreme Court did not consider whether a generic manufacturer could use such letters or other methods to apprise health care professionals of information appearing in approved labeling.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is incorrect. In fact, the Supreme Court in <em>Mensing </em>decision squarely foreclosed this argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">A Dear Doctor letter that contained substantial new warning information would not be consistent with the drug\u2019s approved labeling. <em>Moreover, if generic drug manufacturers, but not the brand-name manufacturer, sent such letters, that would inaccurately imply a therapeutic difference between the brand and generic drugs and thus could be impermissibly \u201cmisleading.\u201d ... </em>Accordingly, we conclude that federal law did not permit the Manufacturers to issue additional warnings through Dear Doctor letters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-11\"><em>Mensing, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2576 (emphasis added). As stated by one district court, \u201clabeling is so broadly defined that it encompasses nearly every form of communi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>cation with medical professionals----Simply put, the generic drug defendants are not allowed to alter the labeling adopted by the brand manufacturers in any way.\u201d <em>Del Valle v. PLIVA Inc., </em>2011 WL 7168620, at *6 (S.D.Tex. Dec. 21, 2011) (citing <em>Mensing, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2576 and 21 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.1(l)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">This Court joins the majority of other courts to consider this issue in holding that any claims stemming from the generic defendants\u2019 alleged failure to communicate additional warnings through some method other than their package inserts are preempted. <em>Demahy v. Schwarz Pharma, </em>702 F.3d 177, 185 (5th Cir.2012) (\u201cfailure to warn claims that did not require the manufacturer to add to or differ its warnings from those appearing in the label of its brand-name counterpart\u201d are still preempted); <em>Strayhorn v. Wyeth Pharm., Inc., </em>887 F.Supp.2d 799, 819 (W.D.Tenn.2012) (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the Generic Defendants could have sent Dear Doctor letters or other communica tions to physicians or patients is also preempted\u201d); <em>Moore v. Mylan Inc., </em>840 F.Supp.2d 1337, 1349 n. 11 (N.D.Ga.2012); <em>Guarino v. Wyeth LLC, </em>823 F.Supp.2d 1289, 1292-93 (M.D.Fla.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">D. Design Defect</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett </em>(Bartlett), which addressed design defect claims <em>post-Pliva, </em>the parties submitted supplemental briefing. While Generic Defendants contend that <em>Bartlett </em>compels the finding that all design defect claims are preempted, the plaintiffs argue that none of their design defect claims are preempted, despite the holding in <em>Bartlett.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">Specifically, plaintiffs proffer that the decision in <em>Bartlett </em>turned on New Hampshire law, which strictly applies comment k to \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. Therefore, according to plaintiffs, <em>Bartlett </em>does not \u201cprovide a basis for wholesale dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 design defect claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to evade preemption on their design defect claims falls flat. <em>Bartlett, </em>does not apply only to .design defect claims predicated on label inadequacies, as plaintiffs argue. The Supreme Court explicitly discusses chemical composition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqdS\">In the present case, however, redesign was not possible for two reasons. First, the FDCA requires a generic drug to have the same active ingredients, route of administration, dosage, strength, and labeling as the brand-name drug on which it is based.... Indeed, were Mutual to change.; the composition of its sulindac, the altered chemical would be a new drug that would require its own NDA to be marketed in interstate commerce. Second, because of sulindac\u2019s simple composition, the drug is chemically incapable of being redesigned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">133 S.Ct. at 2475. The Supreme Court\u2019s logic applies with equal force here. The Generic manufacturers could not have changed the chemical composition of the generic forms of Fosamax without being subjected to FDA procedures for new drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">In plaintiffs\u2019 original opposition brief, they explicitly disclaimed a label change as the possible solution to the alleged design defect, choosing to focus only on the claim that the risks of the drugs outweighed the benefits. (PI. Opp. at 8. (\u201cIt is true that in other cases, some plaintiffs have alleged that part of what makes a product defective by design is that the \u201cdesign\u201d or the product did not include appropriate warnings. These plaintiffs ... are guilty of sloppy draftsmanship. The plaintiffs here, however ... [allege] true design claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>that ... the risks of the defendants\u2019 drug outweigh the benefits of taking the drug.\u201d)). <em>Bartlett </em>explicitly addressed this claim and found it to be preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Plaintiffs try to rescue their design defect claims by refusing to specify what they believe the generics should have done differently with respect to the design of alendronate sodium. In light of this omission, the Court is left to speculate; all the potential claims the Court can imagine have been preempted by <em>Bartlett. </em>As discussed above, <em>Bartlett </em>squarely preempts design defect claims where the proposed solution is a label change, as well as design defect claims based upon chemical composition flaws. It also found preempted the possibility of design defect claims based on a generic defendant\u2019s failure to stop selling the product. Since no other way that Generic Defendants could comply with their federal and state duties has been proffered, impossibility preemption applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">For the reasons stated above, the Generic Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is granted with respect to the design defect claims. The motion to dismiss is also granted as to the failure to warn claims, except to the extent that plaintiffs may claim that the Generic Defendants failed to timely update their labels after Merck updated the Fosamax label.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
