FRIEDMAN, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">In this case, thirty-one named plaintiffs have alleged a far-reaching price-fixing conspiracy by the four largest rail freight carriers in the United States: BNSF Railway Company, CSX Transportation, Inc., Norfolk Southern Railway Company, and Union Pacific Railroad Company, which together account for nearly 90 percent of rail freight traffic in the country. On June 21, 2012, the Court certified a class consisting of approximately 80,000 shippers\u2014 a class that likely includes Oxbow Carbon &amp; Minerals LLC and five of its affiliated companies (together, \u201cOxbow\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., </em>287 F.R.D. 1, 10 (D.D.C.2012). On August 9, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated this Court\u2019s class certification decision and remanded the case to permit the Court to reconsider that decision in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1426, 185 L.Ed.2d 515 (2013). <em>In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig.-MDL No. 1869, </em>725 F.3d 244, 255 (D.C.Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>This matter is before the Court on Oxbow\u2019s motion to disqualify Latham &amp; Watkins LLP (\u201cLatham\u201d) as counsel for defendant Union Pacific Railroad Company (\u201cUP\u201d) in this case, sometimes referred to herein as \u201cthe MDL\u201d. Oxbow requests that the Court disqualify Latham as counsel for UP on the ground that Latham\u2019s representation of UP in this case is tainted by a conflict of interest. After careful consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments presented in their briefs and at oral argument on July 9, 2018, the numerous declarations submitted by the parties, including declarations of eminent experts in legal ethics, and the relevant legal authorities, the Court concludes that Latham\u2019s representation of UP in this case does not present a disqualifying conflict of interest and will deny Oxbow\u2019s motion to disqualify counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Because the sequence of events is highly relevant to the Court\u2019s determination of whether the Rules of Professional Conduct have been breached, the following discussion presents the pertinent events chronologically.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">In 1997, Latham began representing UP. Ballenger Decl. \u00b62. Since that time, Latham has represented UP in at least thirty-two separate matters, including litigation and environmental matters. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">In 2004, Latham began representing Oxbow on a variety of corporate transactions. Clark Decl. \u00b6 2. Over the last nine years, Latham has advised Oxbow on more than twenty-three separate matters. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2-3. The parties agree that none of these matters involved Oxbow\u2019s relationship with UP or Oxbow\u2019s domestic rail freight needs, although Oxbow asserts that Latham had access to a wide range of confidential documents, including documents relating to Oxbow\u2019s purchases of rail transportation services. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2, 5; Oxbow Mot. at 2-4; Wyman Decl. \u00b6 5; Sheridan Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-7; Van Driesen Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-10; Barrett Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-7; Della Rocca Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-8; Schindler Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">In January 2007, the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cSTB\u201d) concluded an investigation of the leading railroads\u2019 practice of imposing rate-based fuel surcharges on top of the base rates charged to customers for rail freight services. <em>Rail Fuel Surcharges, </em>Ex Parte No. 661, 2007 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>201205 (S.T.B. Jan. 25, 2007); <em>see also In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig.-MDL No. 1869, </em>725 F.3d at 247-249. This practice, which was infrequent in the early-2000s, had become ubiquitous by the middle of the decade. <em>In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig.-MDL No. 1869, </em>725 F.3d at 248-49. Troubled by the disconnect between the purported rationale for the surcharge, as a recovery mechanism for fuel costs, and the manner in which the surcharge was applied regardless of marginal fuel costs, the STB terminated the practice with respect to rail freight traffic within its regulatory authority. <em>See id. </em>at 248-249; <em>Rail Fuel Surcharges, </em>2007 WL 201205, at *4. Following the STB\u2019s decision, purchasers of rate-unregulated rail freight began to sue the defendant railroads, alleging that those railroads had illegally conspired to impose supra-competitive rates through the uniform application of the rate-based fuel surcharge. <em>In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig.-MDL No. 1869, </em>725 F.3d at 248-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">On November 6, 2007, eighteen of those cases, pending in six districts, were consolidated and transferred to this Court by the Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. <em>See In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., </em>587 F.Supp.2d 27, 29 (D.D.C.2008). The consolidated cases involve common allegations that UP, along with the three other defendant railroads, engaged in price-fixing by conspiring to fix fuel surcharges on rail transportation in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1). <em>See generally </em>Second Consol. Am. Class Action Compl., Dkt. No. 324. Initially, only Jones Day and Covington &amp; Burling LLP (\u201cCovington\u201d) represented UP in the MDL.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">On June 7, 2011, Oxbow filed a separate lawsuit in this Court against UP and BNSF Railway Company. <em>See Oxbow Carbon &amp; Minerals LLC v. Union Pac. R.R., </em>Civil Action No. 11-1049 (referred to herein as the \u201cRelated Case\u201d). Oxbow alleges virtually the same Section 1 fuel surcharge conspiracy as that alleged in the MDL; in addition, Oxbow alleges Section 2 monopoly violations. <em>Oxbow Carbon &amp; Minerals LLC v. Union Pac. R.R., </em>926 F.Supp.2d 36, 39-40 (D.D.C.2013). In the Related Case, UP has been represented only by Jones Day and Covington. Wall Decl. \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">While, as noted, Latham had represented Oxbow on various matters since 2004, on October 3, 2011, Latham solicited an engagement letter (the \u201cEngagement Letter\u201d) from Oxbow Carbon &amp; Minerals LLC for legal work performed in connection with the permitting of new and expanded facilities at the Port of Long Beach in California, and to cover representation on other ongoing and future matters. Engagement Letter, Wyman Decl. Ex. A at 1. The Engagement Letter contained an advance conflicts waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 4. Prior to executing the Engagement Letter, Oxbow\u2019s in-house counsel negotiated for the removal of the Engagement Letter\u2019s arbitration clause. Clark Decl. \u00b6 11; Latham Opp. at 32. After Latham agreed to remove that clause, Oxbow signed the Engagement Letter on October 6, 2011. Clark Deck \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">On June 21, 2012, this Court certified a class of direct purchasers of rate-unregulated rail freight services. <em>In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., </em>287 F.R.D. 1, 10 (D.D.C.2012). Oxbow and Latham agree that Oxbow falls within the definition of the plaintiff class certified by this Court, although Latham suggests that Oxbow opted out of that class for all practical purposes by filing its own separate lawsuit. <em>See </em>Oxbow Mot. at 5; Latham Opp. at 18-19. Technically, however, Oxbow did not have the opportunity to opt out of the class before the Court\u2019s certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>cation was vacated, as the Court stayed class notice pending appeal of the class certification decision. <em>See In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., </em>286 F.R.D. 88, 90 (D.D.C.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">On or about July 2, 2012, UP contacted Latham about assisting UP with respect to its class certification appeal. Latham Opp. at 5-6; Ballenger Decl. \u00b6 3. At that time, Latham \u201crequested a conflicts check regarding the named plaintiffs and named defendants in the class action in Latham\u2019s conflicts system.\u201d Ballenger Decl. \u00b6 3. Latham determined that there were no conflicts and began advising UP concerning the class certification appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Later in July 2012, UP requested that Latham become more deeply involved in UP\u2019s representation in the MDL. Ballenger Decl. \u00b6 4. Before accepting this expanded representation, Latham performed a second conflicts check, on July 30, 2012. <em>Id. </em>Latham determined that there were no conflicts and began advising UP on broad issues of strategy in the MDL. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">On July 31, 2012, Oxbow appeared directly in the MDL by filing a motion seeking access to sealed records (\u201cMotion for Access\u201d). Oxbow\u2019s Motion for Access to the Record, Dkt. No. 554. UP, represented by Jones Day and Covington, opposed the Motion for Access. Defendants\u2019 Opposition to Motions for Access, Dkt. No. 562. Latham represents that \u201cit did not advise UP about Oxbow\u2019s motion seeking access to discovery, and it had nothing to do with UP\u2019s response to that motion.\u201d Ballenger Decl. \u00b6 6. Oxbow does not allege that Latham advised or assisted UP in opposing Oxbow\u2019s Motion for Access.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">In September 2012, UP asked Latham\u2019s Daniel Wall to become UP\u2019s lead trial counsel in the MDL, and he agreed. Wall Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7; Ballenger Decl. \u00b6 5. A few weeks later, UP asked Latham to defend UP in Oxbow\u2019s Related Case. Wall Decl. \u00b6 8. Latham declined that representation, it says, because the firm \u201cdid not want to be adverse to a valued client.\u201d Latham Opp. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayk\">On October 4, 2012, Latham entered an appearance on UP\u2019s behalf in the MDL. Latham Opp. at 6; Latham\u2019s Notice of Appearance &amp; Motions for Leave to Appear <em>Pro Hac Vice, </em>Dkt. Nos. 621-24. Pri- or to Latham\u2019s entering this appearance, Oxbow was unaware that Latham was working with UP concerning the MDL. Clark Decl. \u00b6 13. Oxbow learned of Latham and UP\u2019s relationship by ECF notice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">Within days, Oxbow contacted Latham and requested that Latham cease to represent UP in the MDL. Clark Decl. \u00b6 15. Oxbow\u2019s senior management and General Counsel spoke directly with Latham\u2019s Global Chair and Managing Partner, Robert M. Dell, and insisted that Latham withdraw from its representation of UP. <em>Id. </em>When Latham refused to withdraw, Oxbow terminated its relationship with Latham. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Then, between December 2012 and January 2013, Oxbow and Latham exchanged a series of letters in which Oxbow continued to insist that Latham withdraw; Latham continued to refuse. <em>See id. </em>Exs. E-G. Finally, being unable to secure Latham\u2019s voluntary withdrawal, Oxbow moved, on February 12, 2013, to disqualify Latham from UP\u2019s representation in the MDL. <em>See </em>Oxbow Mot.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">Oxbow argues that Latham\u2019s disqualification is required because Latham\u2019s repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>sentation of UP in the MDL violates Rule 1.7(b)(1) of the D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cD.C. Rules\u201d), which prohibits a firm from representing a client that takes a position in a matter that is adverse to the position taken by another current firm client in the same matter. First, Oxbow contends that Latham\u2019s representation of UP in the MDL is directly adverse to Oxbow in the Related Case, as Latham\u2019s defense of UP in the MDL will provide UP with defenses and arguments relevant to defending the Related Case. Oxbow Rep. at 4-7. Second, Oxbow contends that under the totality of the circumstances presented here, Latham\u2019s representation of UP in the MDL is directly adverse to Oxbow, an unnamed putative class member in the MDL. Oxbow supports its arguments with two expert declarations of Nancy J. Moore, Professor of Law and Nancy Barton Scholar at Boston University School of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">In response, Latham argues that its representation of UP in the MDL does not violate D.C. Rule 1.7(b)(1) because that Rule only restricts a firm from representing a client that takes a position adverse to a current firm client where the clients are each parties in the same case. And, while conceding that Oxbow has not opted out of the putative class, Latham contends that \u201cthe only parties in a putative class action for conflicts purposes are the named plaintiffs and named defendants.\u201d Latham Rep. at 12, 19-23. Latham supports its arguments with two expert declarations of Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr., Distinguished Professor Law Emeritus, Hastings College of Law, University of California, and Trustee Professor of Law Emeritus, University of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">II. LEGAL STANDARD FOR DISQUALIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">A motion to disqualify counsel is within the Court\u2019s discretion. <em>Groper v. Toff, </em>717 F.2d 1415, 1418 (D.C.Cir.1983). \u201cDisqualification, however, is a drastic measure that is disfavored by the courts, and disqualification motions should be subject to particularly strict judicial scrutiny.\u201d <em>Konarski v. Donovan, </em>763 F.Supp.2d 128, 135-36 (D.D.C.2011) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \u201cDisqualification of counsel is uncommon, as evidenced by the relative paucity of case law directly on point.\u201d <em>Paul v. Judicial Watch, Inc., </em>571 F.Supp.2d 17, 20 (D.D.C.2008). The Court also recognizes, however, that motions to disqualify sometimes are used as \u201c \u2018procedural weapons\u2019 to advance purely tactical purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20 (quoting <em>In re Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>972 F.2d 605, 611 (5th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"AXv\">When considering a motion to disqualify, the Court \u201cmust consider two questions in turn: first, whether a violation of an applicable Rule of Professional Conduct has occurred or is occurring, and if so, whether such violation provides sufficient grounds for disqualification.\u201d <em>Paul v. Judicial Watch, Inc., </em>571 F.Supp.2d at 20. The District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct are the applicable rules. D.C. Rules R. 8.5(b)(1) (2007); Loc. Crv. R. 83.15(a). If the Court finds that a violation of the D.C. Rules has occurred, disqualification is appropriate if the Court is convinced that the lawyer\u2019s \u201cability to act as a zealous and effective advocate for the client\u201d is compromised, or if the representation poses \u201ca substantial possibility of an unfair advantage to the current client because of counsel\u2019s prior representation of the opposing party.\u201d <em>Koller v. Richardson-Merrell, Inc., </em>737 F.2d 1038, 1056 (D.C.Cir.1984), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>472 U.S. 424, 105 S.Ct. 2757, 86 L.Ed.2d 340 (1985); <em>see also Steinbuch v. Cutler, </em>463 F.Supp.2d 4, 7 (D.D.C.2006) (noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>that \u201cany motion to disqualify counsel faces the extraordinarily high burden\u201d articulated by the court of appeals in <em>Roller).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Finally, when determining if a firm\u2019s violation of the D.C. Rules requires that firm\u2019s disqualification, the Court should be mindful of the competing interests at stake and make its decision in the interest of justice to all relevant parties. As Judge Harold Greene put it in <em>Laker Airways v. Pan Am. World Airways, </em>103 F.R.D. 22 (D.D.C.1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">It is true, of course, that where there are conflicts of interest, the particular attorney or attorneys must be ordered disqualified. Conflicts of interest by attorneys give rise to many substantive evils <em>(e.g., </em>unfair advantage in litigation, neglect of duties to the client) and they tend to diminish the bar\u2019s image in the mind of the public. But the mere claim of a conflict is not enough; there must be proof. Moreover, the Court must make its decision in the interest of justice to all concerned, and it must balance the need to ensure proper conduct on the part of lawyers appearing before it against the harm to other social interests which may ensue if disqualification is improvidently granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 27 (internal citations omitted); <em>see id. </em>at 27-28 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">When considering whether an attorney may represent a client in a way that is adverse to the interests of another client, the District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct distinguish between the duties owed to a firm\u2019s current clients and those owed to former clients. <em>Compare </em>D.C. Rules R. 1.7 (governing duties to current clients), <em>with </em>D.C. Rules R. 1.9 (governing duties to former clients). The nature of the attorney-client relationship at the time the conflict arose governs the applicable standard, regardless of the status of that relationship at the time of the disqualification motion. <em>Unified Sewerage Agency of Wash. Cnty., Or. v. Jelco, Inc., </em>646 F.2d 1339, 1345 n. 4 (9th Cir.1981) (\u201cThis [current client] standard continues even though the representation ceases pri- or to filing of the motion to disqualify.\u201d); <em>see also Merck Eprova AG v. ProThera, Inc., </em>670 F.Supp.2d 201, 209 (S.D.N.Y.2009) (collecting cases). Because Latham was actively representing Oxbow when it began advising UP on the MDL, D.C. Rule 1.7(b)(1), which prohibits a firm from accepting representation in a matter that is adverse to a current firm client in the same matter, applies here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">Rule 1.7 of the D.C. Rules provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\">(b) Except as permitted by paragraph</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-13\">(c) below, a lawyer shall not represent a client with respect to a matter if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-14\">(1) That matter involves a specific party or parties and a position to be taken by that client in that matter is adverse to a position taken or to be taken by another client in the same matter even though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>that client is unrepresented or represented by a different lawyer....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">D.C. Rules R. 1.7(b)(1). This Rule \u201cdeals with a situation in which the lawyer is representing one client in a matter, such as a litigation or an administrative proceeding, in which another client, which the lawyer represents only in unrelated matters, takes a position adverse to the first client.\u201d D.C. Bar Legal Ethics Comm., Op. 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\"><em>As </em>discussed below, the Court has carefully considered the parties\u2019 arguments and their expert declarations and finds that Oxbow has not met its burden to show that Latham\u2019s representation of UP in the MDL violates D.C. Rule 1.7(b)(1) for two separate reasons. First, Latham\u2019s representation of UP in the MDL is not adverse to Oxbow in the Related Case because the MDL and the Related Case are not the \u201csame matter\u201d under D.C. Rule 1.7(b)(1). Second, Latham\u2019s representation of UP in the MDL is not adverse to Oxbow in the MDL because Oxbow is only an unnamed class member; and nothing about Latham\u2019s relationship with UP or Oxbow\u2019s unusually active participation in the MDL gives the Court reason to stray from the general rule that unnamed class members are not firm clients for conflict purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">A <em>Conflict Arising from Oxbow's Status in the Related Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"AAo\">Oxbow argues that the price-fixing claim that it presents in the Related Case is the \u201csame matter\u201d as the price-fixing claim brought in the MDL. Therefore, according to Oxbow, Latham\u2019s representation of UP in the MDL constitutes a violation of Rule 1.7(b)(1), which prohibits a firm from representing a client that takes a position adverse to another client in the \u201csame matter.\u201d Oxbow Rep. at 4; Oxbow Sur-Rep. at 2-4. To support its argument, Oxbow points to D.C. Rule 1.0(h), which defines \u201cmatter\u201d to include \u201cany litigation, ... claim, ... charge or accusation.\u201d Oxbow Sur-Rep. at 3. Oxbow also relies on two decisions from other jurisdictions for the proposition that a firm\u2019s position for one client in one case may be directly adverse to another firm client in a separate but related ease. <em>See </em>Oxbow Rep. at 6-7 (citing <em>GATX/Airlog Co. v. Evergreen Int\u2019l Airlines, </em>8 F.Supp.2d 1182 (N.D.Cal.1998), <em>vacated as moot, </em>192 F.3d 1304 (9th Cir.1999)); Tr. at 6-10 (discussing <em>Arrowpac, Inc. v. Sea Star Line, LLC, </em>3:12-cv-01180-TJC-JBT, 2013 WL 5460027 (M.D.Fla. Apr. 30, 2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Latham responds that its representation of UP in the MDL is not adverse to Oxbow in the Related Case because the MDL and the Related Case are not the \u201csame matter\u201d under D.C. Rule 1.7(b)(1). Latham Opp. at 19-23; Latham Sur-Rep. at 7-15. Latham cautions that overlapping facts and law cannot make separate cases the \u201csame matter\u201d because, by that analysis, an opt-out case would always be the \u201csame matter\u201d as the underlying class action. Latham Sur-Rep. at 8. Thus, Latham argues that \u201cvirtually any law firm could be conflicted out of a class action by finding a firm client in the class to file suit and assert a conflict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Latham suggests that \u201cdifferent proceedings are presumptively not the same matter.\u201d Tr. at 38. This presumption is overcome only in \u201cextreme circumstances not presented here,\u201d Latham Opp. at 22, when \u201cthere [is] no way to say that there [is] any daylight between\u201d the separate cases. Tr. at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Considering Oxbow\u2019s first argument, the Court is not convinced that D.C. Rule 1.0(h) supports the conclusion that the MDL and the Related Case are the \u201csame matter\u201d simply because they involve the same or similar \u201cclaims.\u201d Other sources more persuasively suggest that \u201csame matter\u201d operates narrowly in D.C. Rule 1.7(b)(1), which \u201cdeals with a situation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>which the lawyer is representing one client in a matter, such as <em>a litigation </em>..., in which another client, which the lawyer represents only in unrelated matters, takes a position adverse to the first client.\u201d D.C. Bar Legal Ethics Comm., Op. 272 (emphasis added to identify singular article). Furthermore, interpreting \u201csame matter\u201d narrowly is consistent with the position on issue conflicts articulated in the comments to Rule 1.7. The comments provide that \u201c[t]he mere fact that advocating a legal position on behalf of one client might create precedent adverse to the interests of a client represented by the lawyer in an unrelated matter does not, without more, create a conflict of interest.\u201d D.C. Rules R. 1.7 cmt. 13. Oxbow\u2019s broad reading of \u201csame matter\u201d in D.C. Rule 1.7(b)(1) would swallow this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Oxbow cites <em>Arrowpac </em>and <em>GATX/Airlog </em>in support of its argument that the MDL and the Related Case overlap to such a degree that they must be considered to be the \u201csame matter.\u201d In <em>Arrowpac, </em>the magistrate judge disqualified the law firm of Baker Hostettler LLP (\u201cBaker\u201d) from representing defendant Sea Star, Inc., in three class action opt-out cases, on the ground that Nestl\u00e9 USA, Inc. (\u201cNestl\u00e9\u201d), another client of Baker\u2019s, was suing Sea Star on the same claim in a fourth opt-out case. <em>Arrowpac, Inc. v. Sea Star Line, LLC, </em>3:12-cv-01180-TJC-JBT, at *4-6, *22. The four cases were nearly identical in both substance and procedural posture, and the magistrate judge expressed concern that work product developed by Baker in the first three cases inevitably would be used against Nestl\u00e9 in the fourth case. <em>Id. </em>at *9-10, *14-15, *20-21. In fact, Baker attorneys already had signed a motion to dismiss Nestl\u00e9\u2019s case, and the magistrate judge anticipated that defendant Sea Star, with the assistance of Baker, would file consolidated motions against all plaintiffs, including Nestl\u00e9, in the future. <em>Id. </em>at *10, *19-20. \u201cGiven the unique facts presented,\u201d the magistrate judge found that Baker was acting directly adverse to its client and concluded that disqualification was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at *4; <em>see id. </em>at *19.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In <em>GATX/Airlog, </em>the court disqualified Mayer Brown &amp; Platt (\u201cMayer Brown\u201d) from seeking a declaratory judgment on behalf of plaintiff GATX/Airlog (\u201cGATX\u201d), on the basis that a declaratory judgment would have foreclosed the claim of another Mayer Brown client, Bank of New York, against GATX in a related case. <em>GATX/Airlog Co. v. Evergreen Int\u2019l Airlines, </em>8 F.Supp.2d at 1185. Focusing on the unique beneficial owner relationship involved, the court noted that any defenses presented by Mayer Brown on behalf of GATX, if successful, would \u201cprobably [be] dispositive of BNY\u2019s claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court therefore found that Bank of New York and GATX were adverse to each other in the same action, and it granted the motion to disqualify. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Both of these cases are based on facts distinguishable from those relevant here. In <em>Arrowpac, </em>the law firm ultimately disqualified was directly involved in the lawsuit involving its own client, as evidenced by the firm\u2019s signature on a motion to dismiss that client. In <em>GATX/Airlog, </em>the disqualified firm sought a declaratory judgment that would have been binding against its current client due to beneficial ownership. The Court does not find the reasoning of <em>Arrowpac </em>persuasive and finds the facts of both cases distinguishable from those presented here. The Court finds the reasoning in <em>Sumitomo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number><em>Corp. v. J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., </em>Nos. 99 Civ. 8780(JSM), 99 Civ. 4004(JSM), 2000 WL 145747, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 8, 2000), more convincing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">In <em>Sumitomo, </em>Paul, Weiss, Rifkin, Wharton &amp; Garrison (\u201cPaul Weiss\u201d) agreed to represent plaintiff Sumitomo Corporation against defendant J.P. Morgan <em>&amp; </em>Co., Inc. (\u201cJ.P. Morgan\u201d), but the firm declined to represent Sumitomo in a related case against another firm client, Chase Manhattan Bank (\u201cChase\u201d). <em>Sumitomo Corp. v. J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., </em>2000 WL 145747, at *1-2, *4. Although the two cases involved similar law and facts, the court denied Chase\u2019s motion to disqualify, based on its finding that Paul Weiss\u2019s representation of J.P. Morgan did not \u201cundermine the Court\u2019s confidence in the vigor of Paul Weiss\u2019 representation of either Sumitomo in the Morgan action or Chase in any unrelated matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *5. The court, like the District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct, recognized that a firm may ethically take positions for one client that, if adopted, would be harmful to another client\u2019s position in a separate case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">While one can understand that [a client] might be unhappy that a law firm which represents it in some matters was taking a position in litigation involving another client that, if adopted, would prejudice an argument that [the client] was advancing in a separate case, that does not mean that the law firm is violating a confidence of its client or engaging in unethical conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-7\"><em>Id. </em>at *4; <em>see also </em>D.C. Rules R. 1.7 cmt. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">While Latham\u2019s defense of UP in the MDL may involve the development of arguments or the taking of positions that ultimately establish negative precedent for Oxbow in the Related Case, the MDL and the Related Case nevertheless constitute distinct matters for the purposes of D.C. Rule 1.7(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">\n<em>B. Conflict Arising from Oxbow\u2019s Status in the MDL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">Oxbow also asserts that, because it is an \u201cactive\u201d absent class member in the MDL, Latham\u2019s representation of UP is directly adverse to Oxbow, in violation of D.C. Rule 1.7(b)(1). As Oxbow acknowledges, its motion presents a question of first impression. Moore Supp. Decl. \u00b6 3. Neither party has cited, nor has this Court found, any case addressing a motion made by an unnamed member of the plaintiff class to disqualify defense counsel in a class action case. After careful consideration, the Court concludes that the general rule that unnamed class members are not firm clients for conflicts purposes applies to Latham\u2019s representation of UP in the MDL. And Oxbow\u2019s filing of its Motion for Access in no way alters this conclusion. Nor is the Court persuaded that the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test proposed by Oxbow and its distinguished ethics expert is a workable standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">1. The General Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">The rules of professional conduct that have been developed to apply to tradi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>tional attorney-client relationships outside the class action context cannot be applied mechanically to conflict of interest problems that arise in class action litigation. <em>See Lazy Oil Co. v. Witco Corp., </em>166 F.3d 581, 589-90 (3d Cir.1999) (conflict rules were not drafted with class action providers in mind and may be at odds with policies underlying class actions); <em>In re \u201cAgent Orange\u201d Prod. Liab. Litig., </em>800 F.2d 14, 19-20 (2d Cir.1986) (traditional conflicts rules cannot be \u201cmechanically applied\u201d). Indeed, both Latham and Oxbow agree that, typically, a firm seeking to represent a defendant in a class action is not required to clear potential conflicts with unnamed class member clients, and that a contrary rule would be \u201cvirtually impossible to satisfy\u201d and \u201cpatently unworkable.\u201d Oxbow Rep. at 2; <em>see </em>Latham Opp. at 14 (describing contrary rule as \u201cunmanageably burdensome and unworkable\u201d); Tr. at 14.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">A contrary rule would create a host of problems for large class actions like this one, in which so many major law firms throughout the country are likely to have at least one client that falls within the class. Thus, many firms sophisticated enough to represent a class action defendant would be disqualified from such representation because of a conflict with an unnamed class member client, unless the firm obtained the requisite consent. But a firm seeking to represent a class action defendant often will be unaware of the identities of absent class members, making it impossible to clear conflicts with clients that fall within the plaintiff class. Even if locating class members were possible, class actions are \u201cdesigned to permit class members to sit back through the process, knowing there are safeguards for their protection.\u201d In re <em>Katrina Canal Breaches Consol. Litig., </em>Civil Action No. 05-4182, 2008 WL 3845228, at *6 (E.D.La. Aug. 13, 2008) (internal quotation omitted). Requiring a firm\u2019s unnamed class member clients to come forward and identify themselves to consent to an adverse representation \u201cwould eviscerate [this] class action device.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Recognizing similar difficulties, courts consistently have recognized that unnamed members of the plaintiff class generally are not considered to be clients of class counsel for conflicts purposes. <em>See, e.g., In re Plasma Derivative Protein Therapies Litig., </em>No. 09 C 766, 2010 WL 1433316, at *4 (N.D.Ill. Apr. 7, 2010) (\u201c[A]bsent class members do not create conflicts.\u201d); <em>In re Katrina Canal Breaches Consol. Litig., </em>2008 WL 3845228, at *4-5 (discussing policy reasons not to apply standard conflict rules to unnamed class members); <em>In re Glassine &amp; Greaseproof Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>88 F.R.D. 302, 305-06 (E.D.Pa.1980) (discussing problems with recognizing conflicts with unnamed class members). Consistent with this case law, the ABA has clarified that Rule 1.7 of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cModel Rules\u201d) \u2014 the model rule on which D.C. Rule 1.7 is based \u2014 permits class counsel to sue or otherwise oppose unnamed class members in unrelated litigation because unnamed members of the class ordinarily are not considered clients of class counsel. Model Rules R. 1.7 cmt. 25 (2002). The ABA also has adopted the same position with regard to defense counsel in class actions: \u201cSimilarly, a lawyer seeking to represent an opponent in a class action does not typically need the consent of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>unnamed member of the class whom the lawyer represents in an unrelated matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the D.C. Rules are based on the Model Rules, and for the policy reasons discussed above, the Court finds that D.C. Rule 1.7(b)(1) should be read to include the limitation made explicit in Comment 25 to Rule 1.7 of the Model Rules.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Note that Comment 25 says that \u201ctypically\u201d the consent of unnamed class members is not required. Model Rules R. 1.7 cmt. 25 (noting that defense counsel \u201cdoes not <em>typically </em>need consent\u201d of a client who falls within the class) (emphasis added). This suggests that in \u201catypical\u201d situations, notice \u2014 and, absent consent, possibly disqualification \u2014 may be appropriate. As the court noted in <em>Sumitomo, </em>\u201c[o]ne can imagine a factual situation where the relationship between the lawyer and client is so extensive and the prejudice that would result to the client, if the position the lawyer advanced on behalf of the other client was accepted, is so great that there would be an appearance of impropriety.\u201d <em>Sumitomo Corp. v. J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., </em>Nos. 99 Civ. 8780(JSM), 99 Civ. 4004(JSM), 2000 WL 145747, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 8, 2000). But this is not such a case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Latham\u2019s representation of UP in the MDL presents no reason to doubt Latham\u2019s loyalty to either UP or Oxbow in the matters in which Latham represented those clients. And Oxbow does not contend that it has shared confidential information relevant to the MDL (or the Related Case) with Latham that could be used against Oxbow. Finally, as will be discussed, despite Oxbow\u2019s assertions, neither its filing of its Motion for Access nor a broader \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d warrant treating Oxbow as anything other than a typical absent class member.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">2. Oxbow\u2019s Motion for Access in the MDL</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">As noted earlier, Oxbow filed a motion in the MDL seeking access to sealed filings submitted by class counsel and defendants. UP \u2014 along with other defendants and class plaintiffs \u2014 opposed the motion, although Latham represents that it did not participate in any legal work related to this motion. Oxbow\u2019s filing of the Motion for Access does not affect the Court\u2019s determination that Latham\u2019s representation of UP in the MDL does not violate D.C. Rule 1.7(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">Looking only at the text of D.C. Rule 1.7(b)(1), it might appear that Latham\u2019s representation of UP violates that Rule because Latham\u2019s client, UP, opposed a motion by another current Latham client, Oxbow, in the same proceeding, the MDL. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><em>See </em>D.C. Rules R. 1.7(b)(1) (prohibiting representation of a client in a matter where \u201ca position to be taken by that client in that matter is adverse to a position taken or to be taken by another client in the same matter\u201d). But D.C. Rule 1.7(d) provides: \u201cIf a conflict not reasonably foreseeable at the outset of representation arises under paragraph (b)(1) after the representation commences, and is not waived under paragraph (c), a lawyer need not withdraw from any representation unless the conflict also arises under paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4).\u201d D.C. Rule 1.7(d) is implicated when \u201ca law firm ha[s] been representing Client A in an ongoing [matter] and Client B, represented by separate counsel, unexpectedly intervened] in the [matter] taking positions adverse to Client A.\u201d D.C. Bar Legal Ethics Comm., Op. 272. As noted, such \u201cunforeseeable\u201d or \u201cthrust upon\u201d conflicts only constitute a violation of the rules if the conflict arises under D.C. Rule 1.7(b)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4)\u2014 in addition to meeting the requirements of D.C. Rule 1.7(b)(1). The conflict that Oxbow alleges arises only under D.C. Rule 1.7(b)(1). <em>See supra </em>note 4. Because Oxbow filed its Motion for Access after Latham began representing UP in the MDL, the literal violation of D.C. Rule 1.7(b)(1) therefore is excused by D.C. Rule 1.7(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Even if the Court were to consider Latham\u2019s October 4, 2012, appearance in the MDL as a new discrete representation, as suggested by Oxbow, <em>but see </em>D.C. Bar Legal Ethics Comm., Op. 272, such that D.C. Rule 1.7(d)\u2019s safe harbor were unavailable, disqualification still would be inappropriate. Oxbow\u2019s Motion for Access presented a discrete dispute in a complicated antitrust class action, and Latham\u2019s uncontested representation is that it did not assist UP in opposing Oxbow\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>Ballenger Decl. \u00b6 7. Considering the harm that would result from depriving UP of its chosen counsel by virtue of Oxbow\u2019s decision to file its Motion for Access, and the discrete and severable nature of the discovery dispute, Latham\u2019s disqualification would be disproportionately prejudicial to UP. Indeed, Oxbow has backed away from its contention that its having filed a motion for access in the MDL is an independent ground for Latham\u2019s disqualification, and now suggests that the motion is a \u201csymptom of a larger and more pervasive adversity,\u201d Oxbow Rep. at 14 n. 25, that demonstrates that Oxbow is something more than \u201csome nameless, faceless, passive class member.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">3. Totality of the Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Professor Moore\u2019s Supplemental Declaration provides the clearest articulation of Oxbow\u2019s argument regarding why Latham\u2019s representation of UP in the MDL is adverse to Oxbow in the MDL. <em>See </em>Oxbow Sur-Rep. at 1 (citing Professor Moore\u2019s totality of the circumstances test). Oxbow argues that a firm must decline representation of a class action defendant when that firm \u201cknows, before entering an appearance that: (1) a current client is an unnamed member of the class; (2) the client has a substantial interest in one or more claims asserted in the class action; and (3) the client is actively pursuing those claims, whether in the class action itself or in related litigation.\u201d Moore Supp. Decl. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>\u00b6 5; <em>see also </em>Moore Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-13. In this analysis, Oxbow urges that \u201cthe adversity results from the totality of these circumstances\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is no need to disaggregate them.\u201d Oxbow Sur-Rep. at I. Therefore, Oxbow\u2019s Related Case and Motion for Access become relevant insofar as they establish Latham\u2019s knowledge that Oxbow was an- unnamed class member with a substantial interest in the price-fixing claim and that Oxbow was actively pursuing that claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1-2; <em>see </em>Oxbow Rep. at 3 (\u201cOxbow is not some nameless, faceless, passive class member.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"At0\">The Court finds that Oxbow\u2019s \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d argument has no foundation in either law or practicality. While unnamed class members may create a conflict of interest in atypical situations, this is not one of those situations. Oxbow, an unnamed class member with a substantial interest in one or more claims, is similar to the tens of thousands of other class members in this case, all of whom presumably have substantial interests in the case. What sets Oxbow apart is that it has been unusually interested in pursuing its claims <em>outside </em>of this class action.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Such activities cannot serve as the basis for deeming Oxbow equal, for conflicts purposes, to a named party <em>within </em>the class action. Moreover, Oxbow\u2019s proposed rule would deny firms the pre-decisional guidance that any rules of professional conduct must provide. For example, a firm seeking to represent a defendant in a class action would somehow need to evaluate and quantify the degree to which unnamed class member clients are \u201cactively pursuing\u201d claims. Such a standard would only invite post-representation litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The Court recognizes that there may be situations in which a law firm\u2019s attorney-client relationship with an unnamed class member may create a conflict that would prevent that firm from representing a named defendant. Such a situation might occur where the law firm\u2019s relationship with the class member is so substantial that it raises questions about the firm\u2019s ability to zealously represent the defendant, or where there is a risk that the class member\u2019s confidential information could be used by the firm in preparing the defendant\u2019s legal strategy. But such circumstances are not present here.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, Oxbow\u2019s motion to disqualify is denied.

Rules 1.7(b)(2)-(3), which prohibit representation of a client if such representation interferes in some substantial way with the representation of another client, do not apply here, as Latham represented Oxbow on transactional matters that are unrelated to this antitrust litigation. <em>See supra </em>at 3; <em>cf. </em>D.C. Bar Legal Ethics Comm., Op. 265 (1996) (noting that a conflict may arise when a lawyer who represents two clients on different matters in the same subject area advocates inconsistent positions in those matters).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b153-5\">. With little explanation, the court also disqualified Mayer Brown from related actions that were consolidated with the first action for discovery purposes. <em>GATX/Airlog Co. v. Evergreen Int\u2019l Airlines, </em>8 F.Supp.2d at 1184-85.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b154-6\">. The district court in <em>Sumitomo </em>effectively distinguished the additional cases cited by Oxbow. See <em>Sumitomo Corp. v. J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., </em>2000 WL 145747, at *5 &amp; n. 4 (distinguishing <em>GATX/Airlog Co. v. Evergreen Int\u2019l Airlines, Inc., </em>8 F.Supp.2d 1182 (N.D.Cal.1998); <em>Fund of Funds, Ltd. v. Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., </em>567 F.2d 225 (2d Cir.1977); and <em>Avacus Partners, L.P. v. Brian, </em>Civ. A. No. 11001, 1990 WL 161909 (Del.Ch. Jan. 23, 1990)). These cases, according to the court in <em>Sumitomo, </em>involved firms \"attempting to establish wrongdoing by the current client\" or \"seeking a declaratory judgment that would have a direct adverse impact on the current client.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *5. Latham\u2019s representation of UP does not raise these concerns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b155-5\">. Initially, Oxbow argued that Latham\u2019s representation of UP in the MDL was adverse to Oxbow in the MDL solely because \u201cOxbow is a member of a class alleging a conspiracy to fix fuel surcharges that the Court has certified in this MDL case.\" Oxbow Mot. at 4-5. Oxbow has abandoned this position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b156-7\">. While the D.C. Rules do not have an analogous comment, the D.C. Rules were not intended to \"lead to significantly different results in actual cases from the results that would be achieved under the ABA\u2019s model rule[s].\u201d D.C. Bar Legal Ethics Comm., Op. 265.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\">. In support of its argument that this case presents an atypical situation, Oxbow relies heavily on <em>Lewis v. NFL, </em>in which Judge Lam-berth refused to certify a plaintiff class of football players, where the firm seeking to represent the plaintiff class was adverse to twenty unnamed members of this class in different proceedings. <em>Lewis v. NFL, </em>146 F.R.D. 5, 10 (D.D.C.1992). In his discussion of the potential conflict of interest, Judge Lamberth noted that such simultaneous representation likely would constitute a violation of D.C. Rule 1.7(b)(1). <em>Id. </em>at 11. This case, however, was decided several years before comment 25 to the Model Rules was adopted. Moreover, the facts in the case \u2014 which raised concerns about counsel\u2019s ability to fairly and adequately represent the class, and which arguably present an example of the \"atypical\u201d situation alluded to in comment 25 \u2014 are clearly distinguishable from those presented here. <em>See id. </em>at 11-12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b157-5\">. Initially, Oxbow argued that Latham\u2019s representation of UP in the MDL was adverse to Oxbow in the MDL solely because \"Oxbow also has appeared in the MDL through counsel seeking relief that UP has opposed.\u201d Oxbow Mot. at 4-6. Oxbow no longer presses this argument, and its expert suggests that the argument has been abandoned altogether. <em>See </em>Moore Decl. \u00b6 13 (\"Oxbow is not arguing, and it is not my opinion, that it is Oxbow\u2019s sole act of filing its motion for access that created the directly adverse conflict in the class action.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\">. With her Supplemental Declaration, Professor Moore, who assisted in drafting Comment 25, provides the following legislative history documents: Working Draft of Proposed Rule 1.7; Reporter\u2019s Observations; Meeting Minutes; and an article by ALAS lawyer Brian J. Redding. <em>See </em>Moore Supp. Decl. at 5-48. This material does not help Oxbow\u2019s argument that it is an \"atypical\u201d class member or that this case presents an \"atypical\u201d situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b158-7\">. Latham argues that even if its representation of UP violated Rule 1.7(b)(1), Oxbow consented to the potential conflict of interest \u2014 as permitted under Rule 1.7(c) \u2014 when Oxbow Carbon &amp; Minerals LLC and Latham signed an Engagement Letter containing a broad advance conflicts waiver provision. Latham Opp. at 23-25. The Court finds Latham\u2019s argument unconvincing. According to the plain language of the Engagement Letter, only Oxbow Carbon &amp; Minerals LLC was bound by that Letter\u2019s terms. Other Oxbow entities \u2014 including entities for which Latham also had performed legal work \u2014 were not mentioned. Although Latham points to other evidence that the Engagement Letter was intended to apply to the entire corporate family, this evidence does not overcome the presumption that the Engagement Letter\u2014and the advance waiver provision it contained \u2014 were limited to the parties clearly specified therein. <em>See Mesa Air Grp., Inc. v. Dep't of Transp., </em>87 F.3d 498, 503 (D.C.Cir.1996) (\"Where the language of a contract is clear and unambiguous on its face, a court will assume that the meaning ordinarily ascribed to those words reflects the intentions of the parties.\u201d) (internal quotation omitted). Because the Court finds no violation of Rule 1.7(b)(1), however, no waiver was required.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
