Apalakis, for forgery of public records in violation of G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1 (1984 ed.). Three indictments also were returned for violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24B (1984 ed.), which procribes forgery of licenses to operate motor vehicles. The case came on for trial before a jury in the Superior Court. At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the trial judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for required findings of not guilty on the three indictments charging violations of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24B, but denied the motion with respect to the indictment under G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1. Mass. R. Crim. P. 25, as amended, 389 Mass. 1107 (1983). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>The defendant renewed his motion for a required finding of not guilty on the remaining indictment after a guilty verdict was returned. The motion again was denied, as was the defendant\u2019s alternative request for a new trial. Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (b) (2). The defendant was sentenced to a term of one year in a house of correction. The judge ordered twelve days to be served and the balance of the sentence suspended; execution was stayed pending appeal. We transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims a variety of errors. We need consider only his claim that the judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty. We summarize the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salemme, </em>395 Mass. 594, 595 (1985). In the fall of 1981, the defendant was employed as an examiner in the Woburn branch of the Registry of Motor Vehicles. He was authorized to examine applicants for operators\u2019 licenses, and to administer written and road tests relating thereto. At that time, the procedure for obtaining a class 1 license, permitting the operation of most types of motor vehicles, including tractor-trailer trucks, was as follows. An applicant would complete a learner\u2019s permit application, pay a fee, and take a written examination. If the applicant passed, he was issued a learner\u2019s permit authorizing limited operation of class 1 vehicles. When the applicant was ready to take a road test, he would then complete a license application and appear for the examination at a specified date and time with a class 1 vehicle and a licensed class 1 operator. The road test itself consisted of off-street and on-the-road phases. If the examiner was satisfied with the applicant\u2019s performance, he would sign or stamp his signature on the license application form certifying that the applicant had passed the examination. If the class 1 applicant already possessed a valid class 3 or class 2 operator\u2019s license,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the examiner would stamp \u201cROR\u201d on the license application, signifying a removal of restrictions. The examiner would then issue a temporary license, known as a pink slip, to the applicant, specifying the class of vehicle the applicant was authorized to operate and bearing a stamped facsimile of the Registrar\u2019s signature and a code number by which to identify the particular examiner. The pink slip served as a temporary license until a regular photographic license could be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">If an applicant possessed a military license applicable to class 1 vehicles, the examiner could waive the road test requirement, provided the application for the Massachusetts class 1 license was made within one year of the expiration of the military license. The examiner would indicate such a waiver by writing \u201cUSA\u201d or \u201cUS Army\u201d on the license application form. In no circumstances could the written examination be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">On five separate occasions in late October and early November, 1981, the defendant issued class 1 licenses to applicants who had not complied with the procedure outlined above, falsely certifying on their license applications that each had passed the prescribed examination. In fact, none of these five applicants had taken a road test. In each instance, the defendant had indicated on the license application, by the designated \u201cUSA\u201d notation, that the applicant had a class 1 military license entitling him to a waiver of the road test requirement, although none had qualified for such an exemption. In addition, only one of the five applicants had taken a written examination. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the defendant removed the restrictions on the applicants\u2019 operator privileges by stamping \u201cROR\u201d on their license applications. He then issued pink slips to each, bearing a stamp of the Registrar\u2019s signature and his own iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>tifying code number. The applicants subsequently exchanged their pink slips for permanent licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The defendant never requested, nor did he receive, any remuneration for issuing these class 1 licenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It had become known to some of the five applicants that a person could obtain a class 1 license from the defendant at the Woburn registry without taking a written or road examination, and for this reason they specifically sought him out to process their class 1 applications; but none had ever seen or met the defendant before, and all were charged only the standard license fee by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">General Laws c. 267, \u00a7 1, states in pertinent part: \u201cWhoever, with intent to injure or defraud, falsely makes, alters, forges or counterfeits a public record . . . shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than ten years or in jail for not more than two years.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The language of the indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>ment originally tracked that of the statute. The judge narrowed the indictment and the Commonwealth\u2019s bill of particulars before submitting the case to the jury, however, by deleting the phrase \u201caltered, forged or counterfeited.\u201d* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the indictment submitted to the jury alleged that the defendant \u201cfalsely made one or more public records, these being licenses to operate motor vehicles or applications for such, with intent to defraud or injure.\u201d On the appeal from the defendant\u2019s conviction we are faced with construing the meaning of the term \u201cfalsely makes\u201d in G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1, to determine whether the defendant\u2019s conduct falls within the statutory proscription. The defendant argues that as matter of law it does not, and therefore his motions for a required finding of not guilty were denied improperly. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">At common law, forgery was defined as \u201cthe false making or material alteration of or addition to a written instrument for the purpose of deceit and fraud.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>11 Gray 197, 198 (1858). False making was a species of forgery, not a separate offense. In defining what was meant by the phrase, the <em>Baldwin </em>court, reflecting accepted common law principles of forgery, stated that \u201cto constitute forgery, the writing falsely made must purport to be the writing of another party than the person making it. The mere false statement or implication of a fact, not having reference to the person by whom the instrument is executed, will not constitute the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court held that the execution and delivery of a promissory note signed by the defendant in the name of himself and another as a partnership was not forgery, even though the partnership had dissolved, because the \u201cwriting alleged to be forged . . . was the handwriting of the defendant, known to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>be such and intended to be received as such.\u201d <em>Baldwin, supra </em>at 199.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Clearly, under the common law, as articulated in <em>Baldwin, </em>the defendant in the instant case did not falsely make any writing. He was authorized to issue class 1 licenses, and those issued pursuant to that authority were genuine. He stamped his own name on the five license applications at issue, and that of the registrar on the temporary licenses, as he was authorized to do. The defendant never purported to be anyone but himself. The gist of the criminal allegations is that he falsely certified that the applicants had taken and passed the required examinations when in fact they had not. While such false representations in an otherwise genuine writing may constitute fraud at common law, they are not sufficient to sustain a forgery conviction. See <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Glens Falls Ins. Co., </em>304 F.2d 866, 870 n.1 (4th Cir. 1962) (\u201cIn criminal cases the great weight of authority holds false statements in or fraudulent execution of otherwise valid instruments not to be forgery within its common law or unexpanded statutory meaning\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The Commonwealth asserts, however, that common law principles of forgery are inapposite in the instant matter because the defendant was convicted of a statutory crime. More specifically, the Commonwealth argues that false making is an offense independent of and broader than common law forgery and includes the application with fraudulent intent of a genuine signature to a falsified instrument.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>A predecessor to G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1, was enacted in 1805 (labelled \u201cAn Act against forgery and counterfeiting\u201d) and made it a crime for any person to \u201cfalsely make, alter, forge, or counterfeit\u201d any public record or certain other specified writings. IV Perpetual Laws of the Commonwealth 277 (1807).* ***<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Construing the statute in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ayer, </em>3 Cush. 150, 152-153 (1849), we noted that at common law forgery was defined as \u201ca false making, a making <em>malo anima, </em>of any written instrument, for the purpose of fraud and deceit,\u201d and concluded that the object of the statute was not to revise or to supersede the common law of forgery, but merely to prescribe a different punishment for forgery of the limited class of writings therein enumerated. The <em>Ayer </em>court recognized no intent on the part of the Legislature in enacting the statute to broaden the class of conduct criminalized as forgery. Moreover, we think that where a term used to define statutorily proscribed conduct was in usage at common law to define a closely related common law offense, it is fair to presume that the Legislature intended the statutory term to be construed in accordance with its common law meaning. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boutwell, </em>129 Mass. 124, 125 (1880). See <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>370 U.S. 650, 655 (1962) (in the absence of anything to the contrary, the Court assumed that Congress used the term \u201cforgery\u201d in a Federal statute in its common law sense). The Commonwealth maintains, however, that the phrase \u201cfalsely makes, alters, forges or counterfeits,\u201d in G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1, establishes four alternate bases of liability and indicates that false making and forgery are not synonymous. While we are loath to conclude that any language in a statute is surplusage, we are convinced nonetheless that the term \u201cforges\u201d adds nothing to the meaning of G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1. Indeed, that false making is a type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>forgery is made apparent by G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 39 (1984 ed.), which defines forgery as \u201c[t]he false making, altering, forging or counterfeiting of any instrument described in [G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1].\u201d Thus, under the statute, as well as at common law, false making is a type of forgery rather than a separate offense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Several Federal Courts of Appeal, construing a similarly worded Federal statute that prohibits transportation in interstate or foreign commerce of any \u201cfalsely made, forged, altered, or counterfeited securities,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 (1982), have concluded that these terms are substantially synonymous and refer to the crime of forgery, which should be viewed in light of its common law meaning. E.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>553 F.2d 351, 354-355 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 968 (1977). We agree, and think the language of the court in <em>Marteney </em>v. <em>United States, </em>216 F.2d 760, 763 (10th Cir. 1954), particularly apposite to the instant case: \u201cAs used in criminal statutes, the words \u2018falsely made\u2019 and \u2018forged\u2019 are homogeneous, partaking of each other. They have always been synonymously construed to describe a spurious or fictitious making as distinguished from a false or fraudulent statement. The words relate to genuineness of execution and not falsity of content.\u201d See <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 658 (citing <em>Marteney </em>with approval).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The Commonwealth cites several Massachusetts cases in support of its contention that, the common law notwithstanding, the statutory crime of forgery may be committed by one who executes a writing in his own name. Of the cases cited, only one is of possible relevance, but we find it inapplicable to the facts of the case at bar. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Segee, </em>218 Mass. 501 (1914), this court reviewed the defendant\u2019s forgery conviction under R. L. c. 209, \u00a7 1 (1902), a predecessor of G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1. As chairman of the board of assessors of Revere, the defendant was responsible for maintaining town valuation lists for purposes of assessing taxes on local land. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>made various false entries and alterations on the lists, which apparently inured to the benefit of several of his friends whose tax bills were thereby reduced. The court upheld his convictions, focusing primarily on the defendant\u2019s exceptions relating to various evidentiary rulings and the trial judge\u2019s refusal to give the requested jury instructions on intent to defraud. As to whether the defendant\u2019s actions could support a forgery conviction under R. L. c. 209, \u00a71 (1902), the court stated only that \u201c[t]he offense of forgery may consist in the alteration in a material part of a valid document by which another may be defrauded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504. Because the defendant altered existing valuation lists, the court apparently viewed <em>Segee </em>as an alteration case rather than a prosecution for a false making.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the result is consistent with both common law and statutory forgery principles as the defendant materially altered an otherwise genuine public document with intent to defraud.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Our interpretation of G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1, is reinforced by several considerations. First, we adhere to the principle that penal statutes should be strictly construed against the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clinton, </em>374 Mass. 719, 721 (1978). Second, we note the existence of another statute that appears to speak directly to the type of conduct in which the defendant engaged. General Laws c. 268, \u00a7 6A (1984 ed.), states: \u201cWhoever, being an officer or employee of the commonwealth or of any political subdivision thereof or of any authority created by the general court, in the course of his official duties executes, files or publishes any false written report, minutes or statement, knowing the same to be false in a material matter, shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Legislature which enacted this statute would not have done so had it believed that the knowing execution of a false statement by a public employee was already punishable as a felony under G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1. Finally, this court\u2019s statements in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>114 Mass. 311, 319 (1873), directly contradict the Commonwealth\u2019s reading of G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1. In that case, the court, speaking of Gen. St. c. 162, \u00a7 1 (1860), which was identical in all respects here pertinent to G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1, states: \u201c \u2018 [W]hoever falsely makes\u2019 a promissory note, \u2018with intent to injure or defraud any person\u2019 is punishable as for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>offence of forgery. The falsity of the instrument consists in its purporting to be the note of some party other than the one actually making the signature.\u201d Thus, construing identical language, the <em>Foster </em>court adhered to the common law definition of false making.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Under G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1, as at common law, \u201c[t]elling a lie does not become forgery because it is reduced to writing.\u201d <em>In re Windsor, </em>6 Best 522, 530, 122 Eng. Rep. 1288 (1865) (Blackburn, J., concurring). We therefore hold that the judge erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty. We reverse and remand to the trial court where judgment is to be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-6\">A class 3 license permits operation of ordinary motor vehicles and trucks weighing up to 18,000 pounds.

L. c. 267, \u00a7 1. The treasurer of an importing company procured from the company\u2019s cashier a check signed in blank by her, stating that the check was needed to purchase exchange to send to a foreign customer. The treasurer altered the bank receipts, showing payment of the foreign drafts he purchased to correspond to the amount he filled in the check. He showed an amount greater than the exchange actually cost, and pocketed the difference. <em>Peakes </em>is essentially an alteration case and has no bearing on the instant matter. The treasurer did not sign the check himself in his own name, but altered an otherwise genuine writing by inserting an amount above that authorized by the company. <em>Strother </em>was a tort case in which it was alleged that the defendant, a notary public, falsely certified that the plaintiff had appeared before him and had acknowledged a deed when in fact the plaintiff had not. The court stated that, under the facts alleged, the making of a false certificate as a notary public would be a violation of G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1. This language clearly is dictum, and does not bind us. Finally, <em>Mycall </em>is not a statutory forgery case at all, but a case under the common law in which a justice of the peace was indicted for altering a writ of attachment that he had issued himself by changing the county to which the writ applied. The court stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>that if the facts alleged constituted any charge at common law, it was forgery, but the indictment lacked the technical precision to support a conviction on that charge. The court did not hold that the defendant\u2019s actions were sufficient to sustain a forgery conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b317-6\"> We do not rule as to whether, after disposition of this appeal, prosecution of the defendant under G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 6A, would place him twice in jeopardy. The defendant appeared to view a violation of \u00a7 6A as a lesser included offense in that, in his posttrial motion, he asked the trial judge to reduce the jury\u2019s finding to that of a violation of \u00a7 6A. The judge did not charge the jury that a violation of \u00a7 6A would be a lesser included offense to that charged under G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1. The Commonwealth contends, and we agree, that the crime set forth in G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 6A, requires proof of elements not included in G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1, and hence is not a lesser included offense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>384 Mass. 353, 357-361 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
