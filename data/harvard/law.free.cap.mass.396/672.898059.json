The judge sentenced the defendant to imprisonment for life on the first charge, imprisonment for eight to ten years, to be served from and after the life term, on the charge of armed robbery, and imprisonment for eight to ten years on the last charge, to be served concurrently with the sentence for armed robbery. A year and one half later, the defendant filed a pro se motion for a new trial. His motion was denied, and the defendant appealed. Following appointment of counsel, the defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of his pro se motion. This motion also was denied, and the defendant appealed. The Appeals Court consolidated the appeals, and we transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">We review briefly the factual background of the case as outlined by the prosecutor at the joint plea hearing of the defendant and his brother Ralph, a codefendant. On March 13, 1981, at 1:40 a.m. three Boston police officers responded to a radio call based on a report of a woman screaming. As they arrived at a house occupied by two sisters, Vilma and Martha Magoch, they were met on the lawn by Vilma, who cried, \u201cHurry, they are going to kill my sister upstairs.\u201d Officer Michael Dowd entered the house, saw the defendant\u2019s brother, Ralph Colantoni, on a stairway landing, ran up the stairs, and caught him. After handing Ralph down the stairs to the other two police officers, Officer Dowd looked into the bedroom of the second sister, Martha, and saw the defendant choking her and hitting her with an eighteen-inch stick. Officer Dowd seized the defendant and brought him downstairs. The defendant and his brother were arrested, advised of their rights, and searched. Two rings, a watch, and a necklace belonging to Martha Magoch were recovered from the defendant\u2019s pocket. Martha <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Magoch told the police officers that, after the brothers broke into her bedroom, the defendant had threatened her, saying, \u201cWhere is the money? Give me the money or I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The defendant was found competent to stand trial after an extended series of examinations. At the plea hearing, the defendant\u2019s counsel explained to the judge the extreme difficulty the defendant had in expressing himself. Speech came late to the defendant; he did not speak before age three. His intelligence was reported to be in the dull normal range, with IQ test results between sixty-seven and seventy-five. In stressful situations, the defendant\u2019s difficulty in speaking was aggravated.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The defendant\u2019s counsel indicated that he had discussed with the defendant the questions which the defendant would be expected to answer. Counsel stated that the defendant \u201cexpressed his full understanding of the questions, his perceptions and answers to them, and the consequences.\u201d Counsel anticipated that the judicial proceeding and the plea colloquy would be especially difficult for the defendant and suggested that the colloquy might be conducted more easily by the defendant\u2019s counsel, as the defendant might be more comfortable answering his attorney. The trial judge rejected his suggestion, relying on our statement in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>363 Mass. 601, 605 (1973), that it is better that the judge ask the questions. Counsel then suggested that it might be easier if the colloquy with the defendant\u2019s brother, also pleading guilty at the hearing to the same charges, could be held first, so that the defendant could become familiar with the proceeding. The judge adopted this suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">The indictments against the brother were read. The prosecutor then related the facts which the Commonwealth would have introduced at trial. He displayed the stick which Officer Dowd had seen the defendant use to hit Martha Magoch. After the colloquy with the defendant\u2019s brother, the judge attempted to question the defendant. It soon became impossible to continue the colloquy. The defendant was unable to verbalize his answers and could only nod his head. At this point the judge asked the defendant\u2019s counsel to conduct the questioning. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>cause of the defendant\u2019s continuing difficulty, the judge ordered a recess to give him an opportunity to collect his thoughts.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">When the hearing resumed, the indictments against the defendant were read, and the defendant was asked by the court clerk, \u201c[D]id you do these things as charged?\u201d The defendant replied, \u201cYes, I did.\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel then continued the questioning. The pertinent part of the resultant colloquy is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following this series of questions, the judge accepted the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>The defendant claims, first, that he did not admit to facts constituting an armed assault. He argues that, since being armed is an essential element of armed robbery and of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, it follows that his pleas of guilty to these charges were invalid and should not have been accepted by the judge. The defendant argues that it was the duty of the judge to ask the questions, and that his failure to do so caused him to overlook the crucial omission. The defendant claims, second, that his trial counsel failed to conduct pretrial discovery, that this failure and counsel\u2019s consequent advice to plead guilty constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, and that the defendant\u2019s pleas were therefore invalid. The defendant claims, third, that the trial judge was required to make findings on the allegations of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, and that the summary denial of the motion without an evidentiary hearing was an abuse of discretion. We conclude that there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>1. <em>Plea colloquy. </em>We consider both aspects of the defendant\u2019s claim that his guilty plea was invalid: the delegation to defense counsel of the judge\u2019s role in questioning the defendant; and the alleged failure of the defendant to admit to sufficient facts to permit a guilty finding on those charges that included an element of being armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">(a) <em>The role of the trial judge in the plea procedure. </em>Rule 12 (c) of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, 378 Mass. 866 (1979), provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">\u201c(5) <em>Hearing on </em>Plea; <em>Acceptance. </em>The judge shall conduct a hearing to determine the voluntariness of the plea and the factual basis of the charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">\u201c(A) Factual Basis for Charge. A judge shall not accept a plea of guilty unless he is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the charge. The failure of the defendant to acknowledge all of the elements of the factual basis shall not preclude a judge from accepting a guilty plea. Upon a showing of cause the tender of the guilty plea and the acknowledgement of the factual basis of the charge may be made on the record at the bench.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">The defendant argues that the language of the rule specifying that \u201c[t]he judge shall conduct a hearing\u201d mandates that the judge ask the questions to determine the validity of the plea.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have stated before that, while desirable, it is not essential that the judge ask the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">\u201cNor is it crucial that most of the questions were asked by the defendant\u2019s attorney, rather than the judge. . . . However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>the spontaneity and flexibility of the dialogue, which supports a conclusion of voluntariness, can best be achieved where the judge asks the questions. This also avoids even the appearance that the colloquy is but a prearranged script. Therefore, we think it would be better practice for the judge to ask the questions, just as we think it would be better practice to include specific inquiry as to the defendant\u2019s understanding waiver of the three constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>363 Mass. 601, 605 (1973). The facts of the case at bar demonstrate that the trial judge, aware of <em>Morrow, </em>made a considerable effort to question the defendant directly. Only after he had attempted to proceed by conducting the colloquy himself, with little success, did he permit counsel \u2014 at counsel\u2019s request \u2014 to become involved in the questioning. Even then, we note that the judge carefully directed and followed the colloquy. We cannot say, in light of the judge\u2019s substantial compliance with the requirements of rule 12, that the judge did not \u201cconduct\u201d the hearing as required by rule 12 (c) (5).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">(b) <em>The defendant\u2019s admissions. </em>Two of the three crimes of which the defendant was convicted include an element of being armed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>380 Mass. 296, 306 (1980) (assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon requires assault by means of a dangerous weapon and intentional, unjustified touching by means of that same dangerous weapon). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>386 Mass. 607, 608 (1982) (offense is not armed robbery unless perpetrator possessed weapon).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The Supreme Court of the United States, in <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637, 646 (1976), held that a guilty plea is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>involuntary and cannot serve as an intelligent admission of guilt if the defendant is ignorant of a critical element of the offense and makes no factual statement or admission necessarily implying that element. As we read <em>Henderson, </em>the guilty plea will not be involuntary if the record shows affirmatively, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>368 Mass. 100, 102 (1975), either: (1) an explanation by the judge of the elements of the crime; or (2) a representation that counsel has explained to the defendant the elements he admits by his plea; or (3) defendant\u2019s statements admitting facts constituting the unexplained elements. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGuirk, </em>376 Mass. 338, 343-344 (1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1120 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Begin, </em>394 Mass. 192, 197 (1985). The defendant\u2019s affirmative response to the facts as stated by another, if those facts contain the necessary elements of the crime, is sufficient to satisfy the <em>Henderson </em>test. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soffen, </em>377 Mass. 433, 442 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>382 Mass. 78, 84 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Turning to the transcript of the defendant\u2019s plea hearing, we find no explanation by the judge of the elements of the crimes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, supra. </em>Colantoni\u2019s trial counsel did not represent clearly that he had explained the elements of the crimes to his client, but only that he had gone over the questions to be asked in the plea hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Counsel\u2019s representation, by itself, does not suffice to establish the defendant\u2019s understanding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>We look, however, to the other aspects of the proceeding to determine whether, in the entire circumstances, the record establishes the defendant\u2019s pleas to have been knowingly and voluntarily made. The gravamen of a claim under <em>Henderson </em>is that the defendant was unaware of the facts he was impliedly admitting by his plea and that he did not intend to admit those facts. A showing that the defendant admitted the facts constituting the crime negates his claim, even if he is not aware that the facts he admitted are the elements of the crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGuirk, supra </em>at 347. The admission may be an assent to facts stated by another, so long as the assent is clearly an agreement to that statement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soffen, supra. </em>Here, it is clear that the defendant admitted facts constituting breaking and entering a dwelling house at night with intent to commit larceny and making an actual assault on a lawful resident of the house,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> robbery,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>and battery.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although there is not as clear an admission by the defendant that he was armed during the commission of these crimes, the Commonwealth argues that the defendant assented to the prosecutor\u2019s statement of facts constituting the unexplained elements of the crimes charged, that is, the armed assault. The Commonwealth correctly reports that the prosecutor related, in the defendant\u2019s presence, Officer Dowd\u2019s proposed testimony, including a statement that he observed the defendant holding an eighteen-inch stick, choking Martha Magoch, and that he saw the defendant strike her. The prosecutor displayed the stick \u201cthat Officer Dowd observed Anthony Colantoni [use in] striking Martha Magoch over her head.\u201d Additionally, after the prosecutor stated the Commonwealth\u2019s intended evidence of the facts, the clerk inquired of the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">\u201cAnthony P. Colantoni, with regards to Indictment 034954 which charges that you on the 13th of March, 1981 a dwelling house in the nighttime did break and enter with intent to commit larceny and did make an assault upon an occupant lawfully therein, <em>being armed with a certain </em>weapon; and with regard to Indictment 034955 which charges that you on that same day <em>armed with a dangerous weapon </em>did assault Martha Magoch with intent to rob her and did rob a watch, rings and necklace of her property; and Indictment 034956 which charges that you on the same day <em>did commit an assault and battery upon one Martha Magoch with a dangerous weapon, to wit, an eighteen-inch </em>stick; did you do these things as charged\u201d (emphasis supplied)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">The defendant answered, \u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">It is true that the prosecutor\u2019s recitation of facts was made during the plea hearing of Ralph Colantoni, the defendant\u2019s brother, but the taking of the pleas from the two brothers was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>done in one unified hearing of short duration. The defendant was reminded of the prosecutor\u2019s recitation of the evidence which could be offered against him, as a coventurer with his brother.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">We reject the defendant\u2019s suggestion that we focus only on a portion of the plea hearing. Rather, we have examined the entire record in light of the various methods by which a defendant\u2019s understanding of the elements of the crime to which he pleads guilty may be shown. The case is a close one, but, taking the record as a whole, we conclude that there was an adequate showing of the defendant\u2019s intent to admit the \u201carmed\u201d element of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">2. <em>Assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant claims that his trial counsel did not conduct pretrial discovery, and that this failure constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. We are not convinced that the defendant\u2019s unsupported allegation is true. In light of the record, we do not agree that counsel\u2019s assistance was constitutionally ineffective. See <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>394 Mass. 251, 255-256 &amp; n.3 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). There is no showing that counsel\u2019s tactics deprived the defendant of any substantial ground of defense or that he lost any right in the entry of his pleas of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">3. <em>Lack, of findings on defendant\u2019s renewed motion for new trial. </em>The defendant submitted the affidavit of a private investigator in support of his motion for reconsideration. The investigator stated that Officer Dowd told the investigator that Dowd did not see the defendant strike Martha Magoch. This statement would contradict directly the police reports signed by Officer Dowd. The investigator\u2019s affidavit contains hearsay evidence, available only for impeachment, and does not trigger the need for an evidentiary hearing. The judge is not required to believe such affidavits. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass. 575, 580-581 (1982). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>383 Mass. 253, 258 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The orders denying the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial and for reconsideration of the denial properly were made. There is no error. The orders are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b691-6\"> Defense counsel: \u201cDo you know what you are charged with in those indictments?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The defendant: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Defense counsel: \u201cDid you hear the statement that the District Attorney made before?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">The defendant: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">Defense counsel: \u201cDo you understand that that would be the testimony given against you by the women and the police officers involved in this case?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">The defendant: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">Defense counsel: \u201cOn the night of March 13th did you break into that house?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">The defendant: \u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-14\">Defense counsel: \u201cDid you break into that house with the intention of taking things, stealing things?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-15\">The defendant: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-16\">Defense counsel: \u201cWhile you were in that house did you break into that lady\u2019s bedroom?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-17\">The defendant: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-18\">Defense counsel: \u201cAs a result of your breaking into that lady\u2019s bedroom was she struck?

To place a defendant in such a posture is inconsistent with a proper recognition of the value that ought to be, and is attached by the Supreme Court and this court to the constitutional rights involved.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>390 Mass. 714, 721 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b696-10\"> See G.L. c. 266, \u00a7 14, which reads in pertinent part: \u201cWhoever breaks and enters a dwelling house in the night time, with intent to commit a felony, or whoever, after having entered with such intent, breaks such dwelling house in the night time, any person being then lawfully therein, and the offender being armed with a dangerous weapon at the time of such breaking or entry, or so arming himself in such house, or making an actual assault on a person lawfully therein, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of not less than ten years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">As the defendant concedes in his brief, he is \u201ctechnically guilty\u201d of \u201cbreaking] and entering] a dwelling house in the night time, with intent to commit a felony, . . . and . . . making an actual assault on a person lawfully therein.\u201d His conviction on this charge thus does not turn on the contested \u201carmed\u201d element of the other two charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b696-12\"> See G.L. c. 265, \u00a7 19: \u201cWhoever, not being armed with a dangerous weapon, by force and violence, or by assault and putting in fear, robs, steals and takes from the person of another money or other property which may be the subject of larceny, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of years.\u201d Section 19 was amended by St. 1981, c. 678, \u00a7 4.
