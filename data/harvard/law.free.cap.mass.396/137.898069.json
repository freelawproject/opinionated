We reverse the decision of the board. The relevant facts are not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">John S. Lane &amp; Son, Incorporated (Lane), is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut with a principal place of business in Westfield, Massachusetts. Lane is in the business of converting volcanic rock deposits into finished crushed stone products that are used in the construction industry. From 1937 to 1981, Lane was classified as a foreign manufacturing corporation on the list sent to each board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>assessors by the Commissioner pursuant to G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 2 (1984 ed.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Foreign manufacturing corporations are entitled to claim an investment tax credit under the provisions of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 31A (1984 ed.) ,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lane claimed this credit during 1978,. 1979, and 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In October, 1981, the Commissioner requested Lane to file a statement relating to its manufacturing activities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Based on the information disclosed, the Commissioner determined that Lane was no longer engaged in manufacturing and informed Lane that its present classification was being revoked and that it would be classified as a business corporation for purposes of State and local taxation. On December 29, 1981, the Commissioner notified Lane pursuant to G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 26 <em>(b) </em>(1984 ed.), that deficiencies in the corporate excise it paid for the years 1978, 1979, and 1980, were being assessed. The deficiency assessments were based on the Commissioner\u2019s determination that Lane was not involved in manufacturing during those years and therefore was not entitled to the investment tax credit available to foreign manufacturing corporations under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 31A. A deficiency totalling $63,394.62 was assessed against Lane. After paying the amount assessed, Lane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>filed applications for abatement. The Commissioner failed to act on Lane\u2019s applications within the time limit prescribed by G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 6, and Lane appealed to the Appellate Tax Board.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The board determined that Lane was not entitled to classification as a manufacturing corporation. The board ruled, however, that the Commissioner could not change Lane\u2019s classification for the years 1978, 1979, and 1980, and determined that Lane was therefore entitled to abatements on the additional corporate excise assessed for each of those years.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The record on appeal includes the board\u2019s detailed findings of fact and its opinion prepared at the request of the Commissioner pursuant to G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13 (1984 ed.) and Rule 32 of the Rules of the Appellate Tax Board (1985). The decision of the board is final with respect to findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence. G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13. Our review is limited to questions of law. We now review the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In ruling that Lane was entitled to abatements of the additional corporate excise it paid for the years 1978, 1979, and 1980, the board concluded that \u201cthe procedure established by G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 2, for modifying [Lane\u2019s] classification is exclusive, and that the Commissioner has no statutory authority to change retroactively a classification ... for any year for which the appeal period has expired.\u201d The board also ruled that if a mistake was made in classifying Lane as a foreign manufacturing corporation, the mistake was \u201cthe Commissioner\u2019s own,\u201d and the Commissioner was not empowered to correct that mistake under the provisions of either G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 24 or \u00a7 26. We disagree with the legal conclusions reached by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>1. <em>G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 2. </em>Whether a corporation is classified as \u201ca foreign manufacturing corporation with reference to its Massachusetts operations has a significant bearing on its tax liability to the Commonwealth and the cities and towns thereof.\u201d <em>Franki Found. Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>361 Mass. 614, 615 (1972). It is the function of \u201cthe commissioner in the first instance to determine the classification of each corporation.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>321 Mass. 90, 96 (1947). We have previously recognized the difficulty in determining whether the activities of a corporation fit within the definition of \u201cmanufacturing. \u201d See, e.g., <em>Southeastern Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>384 Mass. 794, 795 (1981). If the Commissioner has made a mistake in determining the classification of a corporation, unless specifically prohibited by statute or constitutional principles, he should not be estopped from correcting that mistake and from assessing a tax that is otherwise lawfully due. See generally <em>Automobile Club </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>353 U.S. 180, 183-184 &amp; n.7 (1957), (doctrine of equitable estoppel is not a bar to correction by Commissioner of mistake of law); Annot., 21 A.L.R.4th 573, 620 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In this appeal, Lane does not argue that it was entitled to claim the investment tax credit under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 31A, because it was, in fact, engaged in \u201cmanufacturing\u201d during the years 1978, 1979, and 1980. Rather, in arguing for the credit, Lane relies on the board\u2019s ruling that the Commissioner is precluded from revoking the classification assigned to Lane on the list distributed to each board of assessors pursuant to G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 2. To allow the board\u2019s ruling to stand would, in our opinion, conflict with the legislative purpose behind G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 2. See <em>Joseph T. Rossi Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>369 Mass. 178, 181 (1975). If, as determined by the Commissioner, Lane was not engaged in manufacturing during 1978, 1979, and 1980, it is not entitled to the favorable tax treatment afforded to foreign manufacturing corporations. We must determine, then, whether the Commissioner may revoke Lane\u2019s manufacturing classification retroactively for the years 1978, 1979, and 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>2. <em>G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 26. </em>General Laws c. 62C, \u00a7 26 <em>(b), </em>provides that \u201c[i]f the commissioner determines, from the verification of a return or otherwise, that the full amount of any tax has not been assessed or is not deemed to be assessed, he may, at any time within three years after the date the return was filed . . . assess the same with interest . . . [after] first giving notice of his intention to the person to be assessed.\u201d Acting in accordance with the provisions of this statute, the Commissioner on December 29, 1981, notified Lane of the intention to assess deficiencies in the corporate excise paid by Lane for 1978, 1979, and 1980.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Contrary to the conclusion reached by the board, we hold that the Commissioner, under the provisions of G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 26 <em>(b), </em>was entitled, after determining that Lane was not a manufacturing corporation, to revoke that classification and assess any corporate excise then legally due to the Commonwealth. Lane argues, however, that even if the Commissioner could reclassify its operations, such a reclassification would, under the facts of this case, \u201cbe inequitable and thus unconstitutional.\u201d We now briefly address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">3. <em>Lane\u2019s constitutional claim. </em>Lane argues that \u201c[b]ecause a reclassification of the nature here at issue would directly influence the consequences of past conduct, it is indistinguishable from the retroactive application of a taxing statute.\u201d The United States Supreme Court has recognized that a tax is not necessarily invalid simply because it is retroactive. See <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>United States, </em>283 U.S. 15, 21 (1931), and cases cited. In the past, this court has looked to the \u201creasonableness\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>of a statute in determining whether its retroactive application would be unconstitutional. See, e.g., <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>374 Mass. 181, 189-190 (1978). Focusing on the facts of this case, we cannot agree with Lane\u2019s contention that the deficiencies assessed by the Commissioner are \u201cso harsh and oppressive as to transgress the constitutional limitation.\u201d <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>305 U.S. 134, 147 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Moreover, we do find that there is a distinction between the retroactive application of a statute and the procedures followed by the Commissioner in this case. General Laws c. 62C, \u00a7 26 <em>(b), </em>inserted by St. 1976, c. 415, \u00a7 22, was enacted five years prior to the time the Commissioner notified Lane that deficiencies were being assessed. The statute allowed the Commissioner three years from the date a return is filed to determine whether the full amount of any tax has been assessed. We cannot agree that Lane\u2019s constitutional rights are violated by allowing the Commissioner to collect a tax that is lawfully due under procedures that were firmly established at the time the deficiencies were assessed. This result is not changed by the fact that Lane failed to pay the full amount of its taxes because of an error made by the Commissioner. See generally <em>Memphis Shoppers News, Inc. </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>584 S.W.2d 196, 199-200 (Tenn. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\n<em>Decision of the Appellate Tax Board reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-6\"> General Laws c. 58, \u00a7 2, provides in material part: \u201cThe commissioner shall annually, on or before April first of each year, forward to each board of assessors a list of all corporations known to him to be liable on January first of said year to taxation under chapters fifty-nine, sixty A and sixty-three. Such list shall indicate which of said corporations have been classified by the commissioner as manufacturing corporations and shall contain such other information as in his judgment will assist such boards of assessors in the assessment of taxes\u2019. ...</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\u201cAny person aggrieved by any classification made by the commissioner under any provision of chapters fifty-nine and sixty-three or by any action taken by the commissioner under this section may, on or before April thirtieth of said year or the thirtieth day after such list is sent out by the commissioner, whichever is later, file an application with the appellate tax board on a form approved by it stating therein the classification claimed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The relevant portion of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 31A <em>(a), </em>provides in part: \u201cA manufacturing corporation . . . shall be allowed a credit as hereinafter provided against its excise due under this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b154-9\"> The Commissioner sent Lane a letter on October 29, 1981, enclosing a Form 355Q (Statement Relating to Manufacturing Activities) which Lane was requested to complete and submit to the Commissioner within thirty days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\"> The Commissioner disallowed the investment tax credits claimed by Lane and assessed additional excise taxes in the amounts of $16,387.51 for 1978, $17,924.45 for 1979, and $29,082.66 for 1980. As a result of these assessments, Lane filed three separate abatement applications. Lane also appealed from the Commissioner\u2019s determination that it was not a manufacturing corporation under the provisions of G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 2. The board held for the Commissioner on the classification status and no further appeal was taken by Lane.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b157-6\"> Lane has not argued that the Commissioner acted outside the three-year limit of G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 26 <em>(b). </em>In its brief, Lane does not address the authority of the Commissioner to assess a deficiency under G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 26. Rather, Lane argues that the Commissioner\u2019s power to \u201cverify\u201d a tax return under G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 26, is limited to those instances where \u201cthe Commissioner has reason to believe that the return in question is either fraudulent or incorrect.\u201d We do not agree that the Commissioner\u2019s scope of review in verifying a tax return is as limited as suggested by Lane. However, we need not address this issue since G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 26 <em>(b), </em>permits the Commissioner to assess a deficiency if he determines \u201cfrom the verification of a return <em>or otherwise, </em>that the full amount of any tax has not been assessed\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
