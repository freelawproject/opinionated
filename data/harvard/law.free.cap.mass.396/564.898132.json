Innes (taxpayer) an abatement of real estate taxes for fiscal year 1984. On appeal, the assessors attack the board\u2019s decision to strike the testimony of their expert. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">The board could have found the following facts. The property in question is a one-story building situated on 1.46 acres of land in Andover. The building has been leased to the Howard Johnson Company (Howard Johnson) for use as a restaurant since 1963. The original lease to Howard Johnson, a twenty-year lease with two five-year options, provided for a minimum guaranteed annual rent of $16,000, plus a specified percentage of sales. In 1975, the taxpayer and Howard Johnson entered into an agreement providing for the conversion of the premises into a Ground Round restaurant. In addition to providing for the building\u2019s conversion, the agreement stated that the term of the original lease would terminate on June 25, 1985. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>the agreement also granted Howard Johnson an option to enter into a new five-year lease with an automatic five-year extension upon the termination of the original lease. It was agreed that this new lease would contain the same terms as the original lease except that the minimum guaranteed annual rent would be increased to $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">At the hearing before the board, the assessors presented one witness, Francis E. Ryan. The taxpayer stipulated to and the board accepted Ryan\u2019s qualifications to testify as an expert. On direct examination, Ryan testified that he used the capitalization of income approach to arrive at the value of the property for the 1984 fiscal year. Ryan stated that he \u201cwent into the market\u201d to determine an economic rent because, in his opinion, \u201c$16,000 a year did not reflect market rent as of January 1, 1983.\u201d After stating that he determined economic rent from the market, Ryan offered an opinion of value of $447,700.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the taxpayer cross-examined Ryan, the assessors offered to introduce Ryan\u2019s written appraisal report in evidence. The taxpayer objected to the introduction of the report, and the board excluded it. The taxpayer then moved to strike Ryan\u2019s testimony. The board took the motion under advisement but stated in its decision granting the taxpayer an abatement of real estate taxes that it had allowed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The assessors argue that it was error for the board to strike Ryan\u2019s testimony. According to the assessors, Ryan\u2019s testimony on direct examination was sufficient to allow him to give an opinion of value. We disagree. For the opinion of an expert to be admissible, \u201can expert must have some knowledge of the particular facts to enable him to bring his expertise to bear.\u201d <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Lynn, </em>393 Mass. 591, 601 (1984). For an expert\u2019s opinion as to value to be helpful, it must be based on facts of which the expert has direct personal knowledge or on facts in evidence which the expert has assumed pursuant to a hypothetical question, or on some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>combination of these sources. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ, </em>232 Mass. 58, 73 (1919). Ryan failed to testify as to any direct personal knowledge of the subject property itself, and he did not state his opinion of value in response to a suitable hypothetical question. Therefore, the board was warranted in striking Ryan\u2019s opinion of value.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">\n<em>Decision of the Appellate Tax Board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\"> For fiscal year 1984, the assessed value of the property was $444,200. The taxpayer presented the testimony and written report of an expert real estate appraiser, which placed the fair market value of the property at $264,200. The board found the fair market value to be $312,100.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b582-6\"> We decline to award costs, as requested by the taxpayer, under Mass. R. A.
