R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974). The question is: \u201cAfter impasse has been reached, can the City lawfully implement, without the Union\u2019s agreement, the City\u2019s proposal to modify \u00a7 4.04 of the Newton Police Contract which limits police officers\u2019 rights to accidental disability leave as provided in M. G. L. c. 41 \u00a7 11 IF?\u201d We answer this question in the affirmative for the reasons set forth below. The record contains a \u201cjoint agreed statement of facts\u201d and a \u201cjoint amendment to joint agreed statement of facts\u201d from which, in the main, the following summary of facts is drawn.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The Newton branch of the Massachusetts Police Association (association)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the city of Newton (city) were parties to a collective bargaining agreement that was operative from July 1, 1980, through June 30, 1982. In April of 1982, the association and the city began negotiating for a successor agreement. At the first bargaining session, the association introduced its \u201cthird-party doctor\u201d proposal seeking a modification of the terms in \u00a7 4.04 of the 1980-1982 collective bargaining agreement relating to paid accidental disability leave granted to police officers by G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF (1984 ed.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>association\u2019s proposed \u00a7 4.04, a neutral physician would be required to determine whether a police officer was capable of returning to duty in cases where there was a difference of opinion between the officer\u2019s own physician and the physician designated pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In 1983, the city made a counter proposal in which it sought to include a \u201climited duty\u201d clause in the proposed \u00a7 4.04. Under the city\u2019s submission, a police officer would forfeit his right to paid accidental disability leave if the city\u2019s physician determined that the officer was capable of performing limited police duties on either a full or part-time basis and the officer failed to perform the duties. The chief of police was given the authority to prescribe the limited duties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Negotiations continued for approximately two years, but the parties failed to reach an agreement on the \u201climited duty\u201d modification of the proposed \u00a7 4.04. From April of 1983 through March of 1984, the city and the association engaged in mediation and fact finding under the direction of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Joint Labor-Management Committee. On March 29, 1984, the city, at the association\u2019s request, made a final, written proposal for a total contract settlement. The city\u2019s provision relating to the modification of the proposed \u00a7 4.04 was not acceptable to the association.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On March 30, 1984, the city declared an impasse. Shortly thereafter the city, through its attorney, sent the association a letter stating that it intended to implement all the provisions of its final offer on April 30, 1984. In its letter, the city provided the association with an opportunity to negotiate over the impact of its decision or any other matters. There were no further negotiations and the city unilaterally implemented its proposal as scheduled, and delivered a copy of the new contract to the association. The association refused to sign the contract and has not agreed to its implementation. The association filed this action in Superior Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief regarding the city\u2019s unilateral implementation of the disputed \u201climited duty\u201d provision in \u00a7 4.04. The case was reported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>to the Appeals Court on one controlling question of law, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">1. <em>The duty to bargain. </em>Collective bargaining negotiations between a public employer and its employees must be conducted in accordance with G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6 (1984 ed.). This statute provides that \u201c[t]he employer and the exclusive representative shall meet at reasonable times . . . and shall negotiate in good faith with respect to wages, hours, standards or productivity and performance, and any other terms and conditions of employment.\u201d The statute further provides that the obligation to meet and negotiate \u201cshall not compel either party to agree to a proposal or make a concession.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The association initiated discussions regarding the proposed \u00a7 4.04 of the collective bargaining agreement. Since this section involved a condition of employment and was therefor a mandatory subject of collective bargaining, the city was obligated to meet with the association concerning this issue and to negotiate in good faith. G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 6. To fulfil this obligation, the city was required to attend the negotiating sessions with an \u201copen and fair mind\u201d aimed at reaching an agreement. See <em>School Comm. of Newton </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>388 Mass. 557, 572 (1983). In their joint agreed statement of facts, the parties admit that their negotiations were conducted in good faith and hence we need not address this point. The parties have also agreed, by virtue of the question reported, that their negotiations continued until they reached an impasse. It is well-established that \u201c[ajfter good faith negotiations have exhausted the prospects of concluding an agreement, an employer may implement unilateral changes [in conditions of employment] which are reasonably comprehended within its pre-impasse proposals.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Org. of State Eng\u2019rs &amp; Scientists </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>389 Mass. 920, 927 (1983), quoting <em>Hanson School Comm., </em>5 M.L.C. 1671, 1675-1676 (1979). See R.A. Gorman, Labor Law 445 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The thrust of the association\u2019s argument, however, is that those rights that are granted by statute and enumerated in G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7 <em>(d), </em>may only be eliminated by a collective bar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>gaining agreement reached between the employer and the employee\u2019s exclusive representative. Therefore, the city is precluded from implementing its proposal unilaterally. Since we do not agree that the city\u2019s proposed \u00a7 4.04 \u201celiminated\u201d any rights that Newton police officers were granted under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">2. <em>General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 111F. </em>As we indicated earlier, the legislative scheme of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F, is designed to afford \u201csome protection to a disabled officer pending recovery or pending a severance from employment due to factors beyond the officer\u2019s personal control.\u201d <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Bridgewater, </em>388 Mass. 219, 226 (1983). \u201cThe statute clearly contemplates, in instances not resulting in retirement or pensioning, a return to duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statute does not, however, qualify the term \u201cduty\u201d or require the city to continue paying the officer until he is capable of returning to the precise duty assignment he was performing at the time of the incapacitating injury. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F. Relying primarily on our decision in <em>Votour </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>335 Mass. 403 (1957), the association argues that a police officer is \u201cincapacitated for duty\u201d under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F, until he is capable of performing the \u201cfull duties\u201d of a police officer. We disagree. The only issue before this court in <em>Votour </em>was whether the trial judge erred in denying three of the city\u2019s requests for rulings of law. <em>Id. </em>at 405. In its request numbered thirteen, the city asked the trial judge to rule that \u201c[a] finding that the plaintiff ... is incapacitated for limited rehabilitating police work would be against the weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405-406 n.l. At trial, a medical report prepared by a panel of three physicians who had examined the plaintiff Votour was admitted in evidence. The report stated that the plaintiff\u2019s back condition rendered him totally and permanently disabled from performing \u201cany kind of duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405. We held that the evidence warranted the trial judge\u2019s finding that the plaintiff was incapacitated for duty.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although we did acknowledge that G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>c. 41, \u00a7 111F, makes no distinction between total and partial incapacity, this acknowledgement does not support the interpretation of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F, urged by the association.* *******<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">As we read the city\u2019s proposal, it affords Newton police officers the same benefits the city is required to provide under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F. The proposal does nothing more than allow the chief of police to assign an officer who may be incapacitated for purposes of performing one type of police duty to another which he is fully capable of performing. In its brief the city represents that all of the duty assignments listed in the proposed \u00a7 4.04 are contained within the civil service job description of a police officer, and that these assignments are presently being performed by full-time police officers in the Newton police department. If a police officer is not incapacitated from performing any one of the duties to which he might be legally assigned, he is required to perform that duty or forfeit his right to paid accidental disability leave under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Moreover, through the city\u2019s proposal, Newton police officers are afforded the additional option of having a neutral third physician determine whether they are medically capable of returning to duty. This is a provision that was originally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>requested by the association. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>Further, in cases of dispute, officers are allowed to remain on paid accidental disability leave until the third physician has rendered his opinion regarding the officer\u2019s medical condition. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>These provisions afford the officers greater protection than required by G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F. The city has not eliminated any rights granted under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 111F. We hold that the city was entitled to implement unilaterally its proposal after good faith negotiations with the association had reached an impasse. See <em>Massachusetts Org. of State Eng\u2019rs &amp; Scientists </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>389 Mass. 920 (1983).

The city also listed the limited duties that officers would be required to perform and represents that all of the listed duties are contained within the civil service job description of a police officer. This is a condition that we believe adequately controls the discretion granted to the chief in making his assignments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b207-6\"> The trial judge found that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s back condition is the chief reason that he would be unable to perform the full duties of a police officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>but that even without the back disability the limitation of motion in Votour\u2019s right wrist would interfere with the full duties above mentioned.\u201d <em>Votour </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>335 Mass, at 405. The association relies on this finding to support its position that a police officer is entitled to remain on paid accidental disability leave until he is capable of performing all of the duties a police officer could be required to perform. This is an overbroad interpretation of the holding in <em>Votour </em>and not warranted in light of the fact that Votour was totally disabled from \u201cany kind of duty. \u201d <em>Votour, supra </em>at 405.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b208-15\"> \u00c1 police officer may be partially incapacitated and yet unable to perform any one of the various police duties he might be assigned.
