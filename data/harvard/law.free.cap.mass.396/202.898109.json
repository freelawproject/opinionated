Trapp, was indicted on October 20, 1981, for the murder of Lawrence (Larry) E. Norton, armed robbery of Norton\u2019s landlord, Donald L. Hutcheson, and larceny of Hutcheson\u2019s automobile. A jury found Trapp guilty of murder in the first degree, for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment, as required by G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2 (1984 ed.), and armed robbery and larceny of a motor vehicle, for which he was sentenced to concurrent terms of fifteen to twenty years and five to ten years respectively. Trapp appealed his convictions and filed motions for a required finding of not guilty and for a new trial. The trial judge denied the motions. The defendant also has appealed from the denial of his motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">There was evidence of the following facts. Norton paid rent to Hutcheson for two rooms in Hutcheson\u2019s house and for the use of common areas of the house. During the early morning of May 8, 1981, Hutcheson was awakened by noises from Norton\u2019s bedroom. Moments later, a man burst into Hutche-son\u2019s bedroom carrying a knife. Hutcheson testified: \u201cHe said to me: Get out of bed. I want your money and your car keys. And you\u2019re coming with me.\u201d As Hutcheson got out of bed, the man said, \u201cYou better have some money. Larry\u2019s upstairs dead.\u201d Hutcheson handed over $20 and the keys to his automobile. The two men left the house and walked to Hutche-son\u2019s automobile, parked on the street nearby. Though he knew that the automobile was unlocked, Hutcheson told the defendant that the defendant would have to unlock the door, since he had the keys. As the defendant switched the knife from his right hand to his left, Hutcheson seized the opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>escape and ran to a neighbor\u2019s house. The defendant chased him, but Hutcheson reached the neighbor\u2019s door, with the defendant fifty yards behind, and began pounding on the door. When the neighbor\u2019s light came on, the defendant turned and fled. Gaining entry to his neighbor\u2019s house, Hutcheson called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The police officers responded, entered Hutcheson\u2019s house, and found Norton lying nude on the floor of his room, in a pool of blood, dead. Norton had been stabbed eighteen times. The police officers transmitted a description of the stolen vehicle over the police radio. The abandoned vehicle was located later that morning in Somerville. Three witnesses \u2014 Hutche-son,^ bartender who had seen Norton with another man the evening of May 7, and a service station attendant who had seen Hutcheson\u2019s vehicle and had spoken to its driver at 3 a.m. on May 8 \u2014 were able to select Trapp\u2019s photograph from an array shown them by police officers. A State police fingerprint expert identified a fingerprint found on the gearshift lever of Hutcheson\u2019s abandoned automobile as that of Trapp. A warrant was issued, and Trapp was arrested on May 26, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">At his trial, Trapp raised a defense of insanity. He did not testify on his own behalf. Several witnesses testified about his deprived childhood and his troubled adolescence. They also testified about the abrupt and drastic behavioral changes Trapp exhibited in the twelve to eighteen months preceding the crimes. Four experts expressed opinions supporting the defense theory that the violent eruptive episode the night of May 7-8 was the result of a combination of organic abnormality in the part of the brain responsible for impulse control and memory, and of psychological stress brought on by his wife\u2019s deviant behavior.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s evidence was that the organic ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>normality which underlay the defendant\u2019s behavioral changes was caused by traumatic head injuries he suffered between 1978 and 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">On appeal, Trapp contends that (1) the judge committed reversible error and denied him a fair trial by permitting the prosecutor to introduce evidence of his character in the form of other bad acts; (2) the judge violated his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution by ordering that he furnish to the prosecutor scientific and medical records and reports containing privileged communications that were used against him at trial; (3) the judge committed reversible error by permitting the prosecutor to communicate to the jury that Trapp previously had been incarcerated; and (4) he was prejudiced by the substitution of judges during jury deliberation in violation of Mass. R. Crim. P. 38, 378 Mass. 916 (1979). He further argues that this court should exercise its power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1984 ed.), to grant a new trial or to direct the entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt because of the judge\u2019s improper limitation of the testimony of one of the expert witnesses called by the defendant, and for a variety of other reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">We agree that the verdict must be overturned because of the admission of .improper character evidence. Although we need not address the defendant\u2019s other contentions, <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Bongiorno, </em>304 Mass. 476, 478 (1939), we discuss briefly three of his allegations of error, namely the evidence of prior incarceration, the order to produce scientific and medical records, and the limitation of expert testimony, because these issues may arise at a new trial. We also comment, in the interest of the orderly administration of justice, on the substitution of judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">1. <em>Admission of evidence of \u201cbad acts.\u201d </em>The judge permitted the prosecutor to introduce evidence that, four years before the murder of Larry Norton, Randall Trapp had told a psychiatrist that he was angry with his wife and that he longed to kill her and her boy friend. The judge also admitted as business records three Officer\u2019s Disciplinary Reports describing inci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>dents involving Trapp while he was detained at the Billerica house of correction awaiting trial. According to one of the reports, three weeks before the trial the defendant and another inmate engaged in a verbal altercation, each threatening to kill the other. Another report indicated that eight months before trial, Trapp was found to be in possession of a small amount of marihuana. The third report showed that fifteen months before trial (three weeks after his arrest) Trapp was involved in a fight with two other inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">It is a fundamental rule that the prosecution may not introduce evidence that a defendant previously has misbehaved, indicta-bly or not, for the purpose of showing his bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welcome, </em>348 Mass. 68, 70 (1964). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>321 Mass. 471, 473 (1947). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>132 Mass. 16, 20-21 (1882), we stated the rationale of this long-standing rule as follows: \u201cSuch evidence compels the defendant to meet charges of which the indictment gives him no information, confuses him in his defence, raises a variety of issues, and thus diverts the attention of the jury from the [crime] immediately before it; and, by showing the defendant to have been a knave on other occasions, creates a prejudice which may cause injustice to be done him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">While this rule has its exceptions, see P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 421-422 (5th ed. 1981 &amp; Supp. 1985) (cases collected), the exceptions to the rule are not without limitation. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>389 Mass. 382, 384-386 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welcome, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>One of the exceptions to the rule of exclusion allows admission of evidence of other bad acts when that evidence relates to a subsidiary issue, such as the state of mind of the defendant, and is not offered to prove his guilt but rather to prove a relevant subsidiary fact. See Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 404 (b) (1981). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 268-270 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>(1982). The Commonwealth argues that the evidence of Trapp\u2019s acts in 1977 and in pretrial detainment are within the exception to the rule because the evidence was probative of his sanity. Trapp would have been unable to make threats or to engage in altercations, the Commonwealth contends, if he truly were suffering from the mental disease or defect that he claimed. Logic, experience, and common sense do not support this inference. Despite its claim to the contrary, the prosecution has not established through testimony of expert witnesses that such inferences are warranted. Furthermore, the threats made in 1977, even if they tended to establish his sanity in 1977, would not tend to refute the defendant\u2019s claim of lack of mental responsibility in 1981. The defendant\u2019s evidence was that his drastic behavioral changes symptomatic of his mental disease or defect first occurred between 1978 and 1981, following traumatic head injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Similarly, at least one of the incidents revealed in the disciplinary reports lacks any rational link to the question of the defendant\u2019s mental responsibility on the date of the crime. The probative value of the evidence of possession of marihuana is not clear and was not established. This evidence should not have been admitted, in that it is marginally relevant, at best, and its probative worth is outweighed by the risk of undue prejudice. See Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 403 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Additionally, a more complex issue is raised by the use of three disciplinary reports to prove three of these incidents. Assuming, without deciding, that evidence that the defendant made a threat to kill another inmate and was engaged in a prison altercation while incarcerated in the Billerica house of correction pending trial was relevant to the issue of his mental responsibility, the Officer\u2019s Disciplinary Reports are hearsay.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>These records were admitted as business records under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78 (1984 ed.).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Before business records can be admitted under \u00a7 78, the judge must make four preliminary findings: (1) that the entry was made in good faith, (2) in the regular course of business, (3) before the beginning of the proceeding, and (4) that it was the usual course of business to make the entry at the time of the event or within a reasonable time thereafter. <em>See Household Fuel Corp. </em>v. <em>Hamacher, </em>331 Mass. 653, 655 (1954). The records offered here were made while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>the defendant was in custody awaiting trial. The defendant argues that, although the judge made no preliminary findings of admissibility, it is clear that the reports were not made before the beginning of the proceeding and should not have been admitted. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>368 Mass. 58, 84 (1975) (ruling of admissibility imports the necessary preliminary findings). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The common law exceptions to the rule excluding hearsay evidence depend on the presence of two elements; (1) a necessity for evidence that otherwise would be excluded, and (2) a guarantee of trustworthiness in the circumstances surrounding the making of the hearsay declaration. P J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 266 (5th ed. 1981). In providing a statutory exception for business records, the Legislature omitted any requirement that the declarant be unavailable, basing the exception entirely on indicia of reliability and trustworthiness embodied in the four qualifying restrictions. See <em>Wingate </em>v. <em>Emery Air Freight Corp., </em>385 Mass. 402, 406 (1982); <em>id. </em>at 408 (Liacos, J., concurring). Assuming, without deciding, that the records in this case would satisfy the other three requirements, we do not agree that they were made \u201cbefore the beginning of the . . . criminal proceeding.\u201d G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78. To reach this conclusion, we need not decide precisely when a criminal proceeding begins for all purposes, nor even when it begins for purposes of the business records exception. We need only consider whether, in this case, the criminal proceeding against Trapp could be said to have begun before the records were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">For this purpose, it is helpful to compare the statutory requirement that the record must have been made before the beginning of the proceeding to the common law prerequisite that hearsay declarations of this type, to be admissible, must have been made ante litem motam, i.e., before the litigation began. The common law rule has been applied even though the litigation had not actually begun at the time the hearsay declaration was made. Bias \u201cis sufficiently probable if a dispute or controversy is actually in progress, even though it may not have reached the stage of legal proceedings.\u201d 5 J. Wig-more, Evidence \u00a7 1483, at 375 (Chadbourn rev. 1974). See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>DiMarzo </em>v. <em>American Mut. Ins. Co., </em>389 Mass. 85, 105-106 <em>(1983);Simony. Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91,106-107 n. 10 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">A criminal proceeding begins at least as early as indictment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>348 Mass. 7, 11 (1964) (indicted defendant entitled to assistance of counsel), citing <em>Massiah </em>v. <em>United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 204 (1964). A probable cause hearing is also a \u201ccritical stage\u201d in the criminal process. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britt, </em>362 Mass. 325, 330-331 (1972), citing <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>399 U.S. 1, 9-10 (1970) (right to assistance of counsel at preliminary hearing on probable cause).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For some purposes, commencement of proceedings may be said to begin when a suspect is taken into custody. <em>See Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Accaputo, </em>380 Mass. 435, 452 (1980). But cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smallwood, </em>379 Mass. 878, 884 (1980) (defendant not entitled to assistance of counsel although complaint and arrest warrant had issued and noncustodial interrogation was conducted over telephone; \u201cadversary proceedings\u201d had not yet commenced).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">When the Commonwealth has custody and control of the accused, we cannot say that the dispute or controversy between the accused and the Commonwealth has not already begun, for the purposes of admitting hearsay declarations made ante litem motam. So, under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78, the Officer\u2019s Disciplinary Reports made after the defendant was in pretrial detainment at Billerica house of correction are not admissible as business records. There can be no question, on this record, that the use of these records was prejudicial to the defendant. Considered cumulatively, the evidence of threats in 1977 and of misconduct between arrest and trial were so prejudicial that the admission of such evidence requires reversal of the judgments and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>2. <em>Additional issues. </em>We consider some of the issues that may arise again on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">a. <em>Evidence of prior incarceration. </em>During cross-examina-tian the prosecutor asked questions clearly indicating that the defendant had been in jail on occasions prior to his arrest for these crimes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Cross-examination is not limited to a narrow range of inquiry, <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>7 Met. 262, 266 (1843), but the introduction of prejudicial material is not permitted, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spare, </em>353 Mass. 263, 267 (1967). The Commonwealth argues that the questions were offered to impeach the reliability of the psychiatrist\u2019s diagnosis by demonstrating that the persons whom the psychiatrist interviewed could not have observed the defendant\u2019s behavior during the crucial period. An effort should have been made to achieve this result without the introduction of prejudicial material.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">b. <em>Refusal to admit testimony on defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility. </em>Dr. Herbert Rothfarb, a clinical psychologist, testified about his psychological evaluation of the defendant. He stated that Trapp did not suffer from a psychosis. Based on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>statement, the judge refused to permit Dr. Rothfarb to give his opinion on Trapp\u2019s criminal responsibility. The test for criminal responsibility was set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544, 546-547 (1967). The test includes no prerequisite that an expert testify that the accused is psychotic before that expert may offer an opinion on criminal responsibility so long as the testimony relates to a mental disease or defect.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">c. <em>Compelled self-incrimination. </em>The judge ordered the defendant to furnish to the prosecutor psychiatric and medical reports and records. The defendant argues that this order was a violation of his rights against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">There is no merit to the defendant\u2019s arguments. First, it is clear that the initial order of the judge was for the defendant to provide to the Commonwealth the results of those scientific tests which were not testimonial in nature, such as a CAT scan and psychological tests. This order was in the judge\u2019s power under Mass. R. Crim. P. 14 (a) (3) and (b) (2) (B), 378 Mass. 874 (1979). Nontestimonial scientific tests are not within the. protection of the Fifth Amendment or of art. 12. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>386 Mass. 772, 776-783 (1982); <em>Blaisdell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>372 Mass. 753, 759 (1977). Second, the judge properly ordered the defendant to turn over to the Commonwealth the reports of the defendant\u2019s experts based, in part, on the defendant\u2019s statements only after it became clear that the defendant\u2019s experts would testify extensively on such basis. Thus, whatever right the defendant could assert on constitutional grounds was waived. <em>SeeBlaisdell, </em>supraat766.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>3. <em>Substitution of judges. </em>We touch on one other matter for the reason that it is of grave concern to the proper administration of justice. During jury deliberations, the trial judge was absent on the return of the jury for questions and for delivery of the verdict. He was replaced by two other judges of the Superior Court. The first substitute judge took questions from the jury; the second substitute judge took the verdict. The defendant now claims that the substitution of a judge prior to the receipt of a verdict was in violation of Mass. R. Crim. P. 38 (a) and prejudiced his rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Other jurisdictions have addressed situations similar to the circumstances of this case. In an early Illinois case, the substitute judge heard closing arguments and delivered the instructions, prepared in part by the trial judge. The defendant objected to the substitution, and on appeal it was held to be error requiring reversal. <em>Durden v. People, </em>192 Ill. 493 (1901). The power of judges was held not to include the right to delegate a duty which involved the exercise of judgment and the application of legal knowledge and judicial deliberation to facts known to the first judge and not known to the second. <em>Id. </em>at 498-499.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>In a case almost on all fours with this one, a trial judge in Washington instructed the jury and then left the courthouse. The jury requested further instruction during deliberation, and, over the defendant\u2019s objections, a substitute judge instructed the jury. On appeal, the court found this to be error, entitling the defendant to a new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gossett, </em>11 Wash. App. 864 (1974). Other courts have found that error, if any, was harmless, when the jury were not misled or the original instructions were adequate. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>708 F.2d 1394 (9th Cir. 1983). <em>People </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>107 Ill. App. 3d 568 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">We need not decide whether such a substitution is reversible error because the defendant did not object to the substitution of judges at the time, nor did he claim dissatisfaction with the answers given to the jury by the first substitute judge. We note, however, that Mass. R. Crim. P. 38 (a) is intended to govern cases in which a judge is unable to complete a trial. The circumstances in which a substitute will be permitted are limited to \u201cdeath, sickness, or other disability.\u201d There is no indication in the record that the trial judge was absent for one of those reasons. The rule requires written certification by the substitute judge that he is familiar with the record of the trial. There is no such certification in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">We recently addressed noncompliance with Rule 6 of the Superior Court (1974). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>395 Mass. 604 (1985). We concluded that the requirements of rule 6 were mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 606. The requirements of rule 38 which specify that, except for ministerial acts, e.g., taking a verdict under rule 38 (b), the original trial judge should ordinarily be available throughout the trial, ensure the integrity of the trial process. Such aspects of the rules of criminal procedure are entitled to no less respect than the Rules of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The judgments are reversed, the verdicts set aside, and the cases are remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-9\"> The defendant does not press before this court his appeal of the denial of his motion for a required finding of not guilty, and the denial of the motion for a new trial presents no additional issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The defendant\u2019s wife had worked as a prostitute from the time she was thirteen years old, and she also worked as a stripteaser for six years. She was openly and promiscuously bisexual. Trapp had an aversion to homosexuality, and there was continual friction about her way of life, particularly as it affected their four year old daughter. Both Trapp and his wife had been heavy drug and alcohol users, but the defendant generally had not been a heavy user since their marriage in 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\"> It is also true that evidence of facts admissible for one purpose is not made inadmissible because it could not be admitted for another purpose. <em>Whipple </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>180 Mass. 477, 479 (1902).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b223-7\"> The use of hearsay evidence in a criminal prosecution raises an additional issue of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be confronted with adverse witnesses. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Canon, </em>373 Mass. 494, 507-513 (1977) (Liacos, J., dissenting), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 933 (1978). We do not address this issue today, but we note that its potential presence should encourage a judge to exercise care in deciding the admissibility of hearsay evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b224-5\"> When we declined to adopt the Proposed Massachusetts Rules of Evidence, we encouraged the bar to cite those rules for our consideration when applicable. Under Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 803 (6) (1981), and under Fed. R. Evid. 803 (6), business records are admissible if made (1) at or near the time of the event, (2) by a person with knowledge of the event, (3) in the course of a regularly conducted business activity in which it was the practice to make such records. The Proposed Rule departs from Massachusetts practice in several respects. Opinions would be admissible. Compare <em>Julian </em>v. <em>Randazzo, </em>380 Mass. 391, 393 (1980) (opinions not admissible as part of a business record). The jury would not reconsider the questions of fact that are the basis for admissibility of the records. Compare G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78 (1984 ed.): \u201c[I]n a criminal proceeding all questions of fact which must be determined by the court as the basis for the admissibility of the evidence involved shall be submitted to the jury, if a jury trial is had for its final determination.\u201d Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>371 Mass. 462, 469-473 (1976) (Massachusetts \u201chumane practice\u201d described); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Devlin, </em>335 Mass. 555, 563 (1957) (no reversible error where failure to submit questions to jury is without objection). The court would not need to determine that the record was made in good faith \u201cunless the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness.\u201d Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 803 (6) (1981). Records made post litem motam would not be excluded under rule 803 (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">We conclude today that the extra assurance of unbiased assertions guaranteed by the requirement that a record must have been made before a proceeding began is a necessary component of the Massachusetts business records exception to the rule forbidding the admission of hearsay evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Last, we note that each of the records admitted showed the defendant \u201cguilty\u201d of jail infractions. Whether such disciplinary reports ought to be viewed as merely business records in light of the \u201caura of officialdom inherent in the report[s] and apparent on [their] face,\u201d <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>1 Mass.
