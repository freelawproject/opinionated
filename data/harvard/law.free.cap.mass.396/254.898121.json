The defendant Jones appeals from a ruling granting the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on his counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">1. <em>The parties. </em>The plaintiff, Joyce Godbout, was appointed to the council on aging (COA) by the board of selectmen of Bellingham (board) in 1976. Subsequently she was elected president by the members of the COA. Sometime in the spring of 1982, the board began receiving complaints concerning the plaintiff\u2019s conduct and job performance. As a result, in May, 1982, the board commenced an investigation. Each of the four defendants before us took part in the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">At that time the defendant Cousens was a member of the board of health of Bellingham. Cousens had assisted her own elderly mother in dealings with the COA. The defendant Jones is a self-employed machinist. The plaintiff provided services to Jones\u2019s elderly mother. She discussed conditions at Jones\u2019s mother\u2019s home with the board of health. The defendant Trudeau had an elderly aunt and uncle living in Bellingham. The plaintiff worked on problems relating to Trudeau\u2019s aunt and uncle. The defendant Lavelle is a resident of Florida. Her mother is an elderly resident of Bellingham, who had used COA services.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">2. <em>The complaint. </em>We summarize the allegations and undisputed factual circumstances giving rise to the complaint. Prior to May, 1982, members of the board received complaints con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>ceming the plaintiff. Those complaints indicated that the plaintiff was harassing elderly persons and using improper influence in her position on the COA. On May 11, 1982, the board sent the plaintiff a letter informing her that the board would hold an executive session pursuant to the Open Meeting Law, G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B (1984 ed.),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to consider the complaints against her and possible disciplinary action. On May 17, the board held an executive session attended by the plaintiff. The board asked Cousens and Jones to appear to discuss their experiences with the plaintiff and the COA. At the meeting Cousens and Jones made statements to the board which the plaintiff claims are defamatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">On May 20, 1982, the board sent the plaintiff a written list of the allegations against her.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff denied the charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>in writing. The plaintiff requested that the board conduct its investigation at an open meeting pursuant to G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B. The board continued its investigation in open meetings held during June and July.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In a letter dated June 13, 1982, the defendant Trudeau wrote to the board and described her aunt\u2019s and uncle\u2019s experiences with the plaintiff. The essence of the letter was that the plaintiff had mistreated Trudeau\u2019s aunt and uncle and had taken advantage of them. In the letter Trudeau asked the board to remove the plaintiff from her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In a letter dated June 30, 1982, the defendant Lavelle wrote to the board complaining about the treatment her mother had received from the plaintiff and the COA. The letter accused the plaintiff of intimidating the elderly and of billing Medicaid for charges not incurred by Lavelle\u2019s mother. As a result of its investigation, the board on July 12, 1982, voted to rescind the plaintiff\u2019s appointment to the COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">We now consider whether each of the defendants, in moving for summary judgment, met the initial burden to \u201cshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that [they are] entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). We look to the affidavits, which \u201cshall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (e), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). See <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Erwin, </em>395 Mass. 715, 719 (1985). We do not consider the credibility of the evidence. We examine separately the record before the court on each defendant\u2019s motion. The substantive law of defamation determines which facts are material to the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">a. <em>The standard for defamation. </em>The plaintiff admits that for purposes of her defamation action, she is a \u201cpublic figure\u201d* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>and must therefore prove that the defendants acted with actual malice in publishing the defamatory statements.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254 (1964). <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 849 (1975). \u201cActual malice is not necessarily proved in terms of ill will or hatred, but is proved rather by a showing that the defamatory falsehood was published with knowledge that it was false or reckless disregard of whether it was false.\u201d <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., supra </em>at 867. To prove \u201creckless disregard\u201d there must be \u201csufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>St. Amant </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>390 U.S. 727, 731 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">While we favor the use of summary judgment procedures in defamation cases, <em>New England Tractor-Trailer Training of Conn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>395 Mass. 471, 480 (1985), the defendants must still meet the usual burden under rule 56 of demonstrating by evidence \u201cconsidered with an indulgence in the plaintiff\u2019s favor,\u201d the absence of disputed issues of material fact and their entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>National Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, Inc. </em>v. <em>Central Broadcasting Corp., </em>379 Mass. 220, 231 (1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 935 (1980). Because the issue of actual malice involves a determination of state of mind, summary judgment will frequently be inappropriate in defamation cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>Hutchinson v. Proxmire, </em>443 U.S. 111, 120 n.9 (1979). However, the issue of actual malice \u201cis not automatically a jury question.\u201d <em>Aarco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Baynes, </em>391 Mass. 560, 564 (1984). The plaintiff is entitled to a jury trial if there is some indication before the motion judge from which an inference of actual malice \u2014 knowing falsehood or reckless disregard of the truth \u2014 could be drawn. <em>Id. Central Broadcasting Corp., supra. </em>See <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>37 Cal. 3d 244, 252 (1984), petition for cert, filed sub nom. <em>Synanon Church </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Ass\u2019n, </em>53 U.S.L.W. 3619 (U.S. Feb, 26, 1985) (No. 84-1304); Note, The Role of Summary Judgment in Political Libel Cases, 52 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1783, 1820-1821 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">b. <em>The statements. </em>The defendants Cousens and Jones each made statements at the closed executive session of the board on May 17. Cousens repeated a remark she had heard from a clerk at the COA office: \u201cThe person in the [COA] office said that the busses used to be bad \u2014 they were dirty and the restrooms weren\u2019t very clean. She then said that the busses now are good, \u2018but what is a few bucks under the table when the comfort and safety of the seniors are concerned. \u2019 \u201d According to the plaintiff, Cousens\u2019 statement defames her by suggesting that the plaintiff bribed someone.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In her affidavit, Cousens avers, \u201cI did not make any statement at any time stating, implying, or suggesting that Mrs. Godbout was passing money \u2018under the table. \u2019 I had told one of the selectmen privately, before the meeting held in executive session on May 17, 1982, that I had overheard a remark by a COA clerk concerning passing money under the table to obtain bus service for the COA. I repeated at the meeting that the comment had been made by the clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Jones told the board, \u201cOn [December 23, 1981], 11:15 p.m., Joyce called me and said that she and the Board of Health were up there [at my mother\u2019s house] that day and want my mother moved the following day.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that Jones\u2019s statement was intended to mean and was understood to mean that the plaintiff was harassing Jones\u2019s mother. Jones submitted an affidavit in which he asserted the truth of his statement at the meeting and his lack of intent to hold the plaintiff up to public scorn or ridicule.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Trudeau\u2019s allegedly defamatory statements were made in a letter she wrote to the board on June 13, 1982, in which she described the experiences of her elderly aunt and uncle with the plaintiff.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In her affidavit, Trudeau states that at the time she wrote the letter, she believed that everything she said was true, that she still reasonably believes everything to be true, that her sole reason for writing was to protect the welfare of her aunt and uncle, and that she did not intend to harm the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Lavelle\u2019s allegedly defamatory statements were made in her letter of June 30 to the board. In her complaint, the plaintiff singles out the following comments as defamatory: \u201cJoyce entered my mother\u2019s apartment and forcibly took my mother from her bed to attend a Selectmen\u2019s meeting in regard to Joyce\u201d; \u201cJoyce billed my mother\u2019s medicaid for bills not [incurred] by my mother\u201d; \u201c[i]t is a sad state of affairs that she [the plaintiff] is allowed to intimidate the elderly\u201d; and \u201c[Lavelle\u2019s mother] is having problems with her health because of the tense situation created by this Joyce.\u201d In her affidavit, Lavelle states that her letter was written \u201cin good faith\u201d and that her \u201conly intent\u201d was \u201cmy concern for my mother and her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>well-being, and in no way did I intend to injure the Plaintiff, Joyce Godbout.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">c. <em>The summary judgments. </em>We assume, without deciding, that the defendants\u2019 statements might hold the plaintiff up to contempt, ridicule or hatred, or tend to impair her standing in the community. <em>Ingalls </em>v. <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Co., </em>304 Mass. 31 (1939). Nevertheless, each of the defendants, by affidavit, met the initial burden under rule 56 (c) of showing that there was no dispute as to a material fact and that he or she was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The defendants Cousens, Jones, and Trudeau each averred the truth of his or her statements. Jones, Trudeau, and Lavelle each averred the absence of any intent to harm the plaintiff. A witness is competent to testify as to his own intent, <em>Lunn &amp; Sweet Co. </em>v. <em>Wolfman, </em>268 Mass. 345, 353 (1929), so that statements of intent in an affidavit are appropriately considered as admissible evidence on a motion for summary judgment. See <em>Commonwealth Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Plotkin, </em>371 Mass. 218, 221 (1976). Each of the defendants established by affidavit that his or her statements were true or were not made with actual malice, either by a knowing falsehood or in reckless disregard of the truth. Thus, the defendants met their burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Once the defendants met their burden in moving for summary, judgment, the burden shifted to the plaintiff to show with admissible evidence the existence of a dispute as to material facts. \u201cWhen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported . . ., an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If he does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>shall be entered against him.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (e). See <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Erwin, </em>395 Mass. 715, 719 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The plaintiff submitted no affidavits that controvert the factual averments in the defendants\u2019 affidavits,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but instead relies on the allegations of her unverified complaint to establish the existence of disputed issues of fact.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This she cannot do. Only if the plaintiff files a verified complaint is the complaint treated as an affidavit for purposes of rule 56 (e). <em>Pupecki </em>v. <em>James Madison Corp., </em>376 Mass. 212 (1978). If, as here, the complaint is <em>not </em>verified, then the court considers it only to ascertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the nature of the cause of action or defense and to guide the court in determining which facts are material. See <em>Ratner </em>v. <em>Young, </em>465 F. Supp. 386, 389 (D.C.V.I. 1979); 10A C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 2721, 2722, at 43-46 (1983). Allegations in an unverified pleading are not accorded any evidentiary weight in determining whether there exists a genuine issue of material fact under rule 56 (c).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Piper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>392 F.2d 462, 464 (5th Cir. 1968), and cases cited. Because the defendants met their burden of showing no disputed issues and entitlement to judgment, the plaintiff\u2019s failure to make the responsive showing is fatal. See <em>Framingham Clinic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Framingham, </em>382 Mass. 283, 298-299 (1981); <em>Farley </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>374 Mass. 419, 425 (1978); <em>Olde Towne Liquor Store, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>372 Mass. 152, 155 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">3. <em>Jones\u2019s counterclaim. </em>The defendant Harold Jones appeals the entry of summary judgment against him on his counterclaim. In his complaint, Jones alleges that statements made by the plaintiff at the closed executive session of May 17, 1982, and repeated at the open meeting on June 7, defamed him. In discussing her treatment of Jones\u2019s mother, the plaintiff commented on Jones\u2019s mother\u2019s clothing, personal hygiene, diet, and care of her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">For purposes of this decision, we assume, without deciding, that the statements are defamatory of Jones\u2019s mother. If the statements are false, they would support a claim of defamation. However, \u201c[i]t is a fundamental principle of the law of defamation that a plaintiff must show, inter alla, that the allegedly defamatory words published by a defendant were of and concerning the plaintiff.\u201d <em>New England Tractor-Trailer Training of Conn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>395 Mass. 471, 474 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>(1985). A private person makes that showing upon \u201cproof that the defendant was negligent in publishing defamatory words which reasonably could be interpreted to refer to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Jones admits in his affidavit that the statements here at issue \u201crefer[ ] to my mother.\u201d He makes no argument that the words themselves could reasonably be interpreted to refer to him. Nor does Jones point to any extrinsic facts that show that the words could be interpreted to refer to him. <em>Id. </em>at 480. <em>Brauer </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>351 Mass. 53, 56 (1966). Moreover, the plaintiff made the remarks in the context of a discussion of <em>her </em>treatment of Jones\u2019s mother. In these circumstances, there was no genuine dispute that the remarks did not refer to Harold Jones. Summary judgment was properly entered against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">4. <em>Claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress. </em>Both the plaintiff Godbout and plaintiff-in-counterclaim Harold Jones sought damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The motion judge granted summary judgment on these claims against both the plaintiff and Jones.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Both rulings were correct. To sustain an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must show, inter alla, \u201cthat the actor intended to inflict emotional distress or that he knew or should have known that emotional distress was the likely result of his conduct.\u201d <em>Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. 140, 144-145 (1976). There was no genuine dispute on intent on either claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The plaintiff argues that the allegations in her complaint that the defendants\u2019 statements were made with actual malice suffice to demonstrate that the defendants bore the requisite intent. We have already concluded that there was no evidence of actual malice shown in the plaintiff\u2019s defamation claims. Hence, there is no disputed issue on the defendants\u2019 intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>inflict emotional distress, and the defendants are entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Similarly, Jones\u2019s claim for emotional distress fails because there is no genuine dispute on the plaintiff\u2019s intent to harm Jones. The plaintiff submitted an affidavit supporting her summary judgment motion on Jones\u2019s claim, in which she stated that she had made her statements as to Jones\u2019s mother\u2019s mental and physical condition in good faith and without the intent to humiliate, ridicule, or harm Jones or to inflict emotional distress on him. Although Jones submitted a counteraffidavit,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> nothing therein suggests any factual circumstances from which a reasonable jury could infer that the plaintiff intended to harm Jones or should have known that emotional distress to Jones was a likely result.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Because neither the plaintiff\u2019s nor Jones\u2019s claims survive on independent grounds, we need not decide whether an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress could ever survive the loss of an action for defamation. See <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Benzaquin, </em>390 Mass. 175, 189 (1983). But see <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>37 Cal. 3d 244, 265 (1984) (cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress does not survive failure of defamation claim because liability cannot be imposed on any theory for what has been determined to be a constitutionally protected publication); <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Proxmire, </em>579 F.2d 1027, 1036 (7th Cir. 1978) (same), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 443 U.S. 111 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>We conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact on the plaintiff\u2019s claims and on Jones\u2019s counterclaim. The moving parties are entitled to judgments as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-13\"> In her complaint, the plaintiff named twelve individuals and the town of Bellingham as defendants. Summary judgment motions were granted in favor of eight of the defendants.

The plaintiff did not respond to the'request for admissions. We deem the matters admitted. Mass. R. Civ. P. 36 (a). <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Benzaquin, </em>390 Mass. 175, 176 n.5 (1983). 8 C.A.

Additionally, the plaintiff conceded in her brief and in argument to this court that she is a public figure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b274-11\"> The defendants\u2019 statements were made to public officials by way of complaint about the performance in office of the plaintiff, a public official. Because the plaintiff\u2019s complaint fails on other grounds, we need not decide whether these statements are conditionally privileged as \u2018\u201cpetition[s] [to] the Government for a redress of grievances\u2019\u201d under the First Amendment. See <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>472 U.S. 479, 482 (1985). For the same reason, we also do not decide what privilege, if any, protects statements made to public officials conducting an investigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that other statements made by Cousens at the May 17 meeting are defamatory. Because the plaintiff\u2019s briefs and arguments to this court focus only on the statement quoted in the text, we do not consider whether any of the other statements were defamatory. Even if those statements were properly before us, none advances the plaintiff\u2019s cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s complaint quotes at length from Trudeau\u2019s letter. The plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of the letter is that it \u201cstrongly suggests that [Trudeau\u2019s aunt] lost $500.00 and other valuable property while in plaintiff\u2019s care and that it was misappropriated by the plaintiff [in] larcenous circumstances. The letter further strongly hints that the plaintiff took advantage of [the aunt and uncle] for her own selfish interests.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\"> Lavelle also averred in her affidavit that her letter to the selectmen \u201cwas written without malice, recklessness or negligence . . . and is entitled to such communications on matters of public concern.\u201d The plaintiff moved to strike that portion of the affidavit. The record does not indicate the court\u2019s ruling. However, because those phrases are conclusions of law rather than statements of fact based on personal knowledge, we disregard them. Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (e). <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Erwin, </em>395 Mass. 715, 721 (1985). <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Annis, </em>730 F.2d 741, 743 (11th Cir. 1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b278-6\"> The plaintiff submitted no counter affidavit concerning Jones, Trudeau, or Lavelle. She did submit an affidavit stating that she had rejected the defendant Cousens\u2019 application for a job and that thereafter Cousens was hostile to the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit does point to a factual circumstance which, if supported by other evidence adduced at trial, might lead a reasonable jury to believe that Cousens harbored some malicious intent against the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, however, does not contradict the truth of Cousens\u2019 assertion that she had heard a clerk make the statement. Nor does the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit even dispute the truth of the clerk\u2019s statement or point to any facts that show the statement was so improbable that Cousens was reckless in repeating it. Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit does not controvert the truth of Cousens\u2019 statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">At the argument on Cousens\u2019 summary judgment motion, Cousens made an oral motion to strike the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit. The judge denied the motion and Cousens cross appeals. Because we decide in Cousens\u2019 favor on other grounds, we do not discuss that ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The plaintiff argues that entry of summary judgment was premature because she did not have time to complete discovery. The plaintiff filed her complaint on August 27, 1982. In March, 1984, she sent interrogatories to the defendants. Rule 30 of the Superior Court (1974) states, \u201cInterrogatories may be served within one year after the entry of an action or within such further time as the court may allow.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s counsel filed a motion for leave of court but did not bring the motion to the court\u2019s attention and makes no attempt here to explain the lack of diligence. Nor did the plaintiff notice any depositions in the eighteen months between filing her complaint and the filing of the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. Hence, we reject the argument that summary judgment was premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Even if the plaintiff had initiated discovery in a timely fashion, she was required to file an affidavit representing that \u201cfor reasons stated [she could not] present by affidavit facts essential to justify [her] opposition\u201d and requesting a continuance to complete discovery. Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (f), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). The plaintiff\u2019s attorney did submit an affidavit indicating the plaintiff\u2019s intent to subpoena newspaper reporters and the secretary of the board to prove that these sources had quoted the defendant Cousens\u2019 statements verbatim. None of the defendants contested the fact they made the statements in issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\"> Indeed, the plaintiff did not even introduce in evidence Trudeau\u2019s letter. A copy of Trudeau\u2019s letter is in the record on appeal only because Lavelle appended a copy to her motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u201cWe note with frustration the more and more typical phenomenon, present in this case, of a . . . court having to decide a motion for summary judgment without the assistance the court should expect from counsel.\u201d <em>Stepanischen v.Merchants Despatch Transp. Corp., </em>722 F.2d 922, 927(1st Cir. 1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\"> A Superior Court judge had previously allowed Trudeau\u2019s motion under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b)(6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s emotional distress action against Trudeau for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b281-9\"> Jones\u2019s counteraffidavit only disputes the statements made about his mother\u2019s mental and physical condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
