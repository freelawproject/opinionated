A review examiner of the division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s discharge from work was attributable solely to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest within the meaning of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2) (1984 ed.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board of review of the division (board) denied the plaintiff\u2019s application for review. A judge of the District Court affirmed the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Because the board denied the plaintiff\u2019s application for review, the decision of the review examiner is treated as that of the board. See G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 41 <em>(c). </em>We summarize the findings of the review examiner. The plaintiff was employed by Raytheon as a wire assembler for six years prior to his discharge on May 4, 1984. On April 3, 1984, the plaintiff notified the employer that he would be absent from work because of headaches. Thereafter, the plaintiff remained absent without further notification to the employer. On April 10, the employer requested a medical certificate from the plaintiff\u2019s physician substantiating his illness. On April 18, the employer received a document from the plaintiff\u2019s physician. The employer deemed that document insufficient excuse under the terms of its collective bargaining agreement with the plaintiff\u2019s union, and requested further verification from the plaintiff on April 27. After receiving no response from the plaintiff, the employer discharged him on May 4. The review examiner found \u201cnot persuasive\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s contention that he had done all within his power to comply with the employer\u2019s requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The plaintiff appeals, claiming that the record lacks substantial evidence to support the board\u2019s conclusion that the employee deliberately acted in wilful disregard of his employer\u2019s interest. Thus, he concludes that on this record it was error to disqualify him under \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2). We agree. We reverse the judgment of the District Court and order that a judgment be entered remanding the case to the Division of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Employment Security for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Last we comment on the burden of persuasion under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">A claimant is disqualified from benefits if the individual left work \u201cby discharge shown to the satisfaction of the director to be attributable solely to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest.\u201d G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2). Not every act of misconduct disqualifies a claimant. \u201cThe apparent purpose of \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2) then is to deny benefits to a claimant who has brought about his own unemployment through intentional disregard of standards of behavior which his employer has a right to expect. When a worker is ill-equipped for his job or has a good faith lapse in judgment or attention, any resulting conduct contrary to the employer\u2019s interest is unintentional; a related discharge is not the worker\u2019s intentional fault, and there is no basis under \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2) for denying benefits.\u201d <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 94, 97 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The parties agree that the \u201ccritical factual issue in determining whether an employee\u2019s discharge resulted from his wilful or intentional misconduct is the employee\u2019s state of mind at the time of his misconduct.\u201d <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>387 Mass. 776, 779 (1982). The parties further agree that the director\u2019s decision must be based on substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is \u201c \u2018such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u2019\u201d taking \u201c\u2018into account whatever in the record detracts from its weight. \u2019 \u201d <em>Lycurgus </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 623, 627-628 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The review examiner\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff acted with deliberate and wilful disregard is not supported by substantial evidence. There is evidence that, as a result of the plaintiff\u2019s absence from work, the employer requested the plaintiff to provide medical documentation. The plaintiff\u2019s physician wrote a letter. The employer deemed the physician\u2019s letter \u201cinsufficient\u201d and sent the plaintiff a telegram in which it requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>\u201cfurther documentation. \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This telegram is the only evidence that the plaintiff knew of the employer\u2019s expectations. There is no evidence of the employer\u2019s expectations as to the additional medical documentation it required, of the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge and understanding of those expectations, and of the reasonableness of the expectations. The employer\u2019s request for \u201cfurther documentation\u201d without elaboration is not substantial evidence on these issues.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Jean </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 206, 209 (1984); <em>Garfield, supra </em>at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The plaintiff told the review examiner that after receiving the telegram he repeatedly asked his physicians to comply with his employer\u2019s request. The plaintiff concedes that he may have erred in relying on his physicians to mail the documents to the employer rather than hand-carrying the documents to his employer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But that error in judgment does not rise to the level of intentional fault or wilfulness which disqualifies an otherwise eligible claimant under \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2). See <em>Garfield, supra </em>at 96-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Because it is clear from recent litigation<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that there is a need for further analysis of \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2), we comment on the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>of persuasion under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2). We begin our analysis by considering the language of \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2) to determine its legislative purpose. <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977). The section at issue disqualifies individuals whose termination comes about \u201cby discharge shown to the satisfaction of the director to be attributable solely to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest.\u201d G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2). The section itself does not specifically allocate the burden of persuasion. Thus, we look to the entire statute to discern the intention of the Legislature. See <em>Negron </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>373 Mass. 199, 201-202 (1977), <em>citing Holbrook v. Holbrook, </em>1 Pick. 248, 250 (1823). In other parts of the statute, the Legislature used explicit language to place the burden of persuasion on the employee. For example, \u00a7 25(e)(1) disqualifies claimants who have left work \u201cvoluntarily without good cause attributable to the employing unit or its agent.\u201d The section states that \u201c[n]o disqualification shall be imposed if <em>such individual establishes to the satisfaction of the director </em>that he left his employment in good faith . . .\u201d and \u201c[a]n individual shall not be disqualified ... if <em>such individual establishes to the satisfaction of the director </em>that his reasons for leaving were for such an urgent, compelling and necessitous nature as to make his separation involuntary\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e), </em>second par. See <em>Sohler </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 785, 788 n.1 (1979). \u201c[W]here the Legislature has employed specific language in one paragraph, but not in another, the language should not be implied where it is not present.\u201d <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 616 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Further, in claims under \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(1), the claimant is the party most likely to have information about his reasons for leaving work and therefore is required to carry the burden of persuasion. By contrast, under \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2), the board must take into account the employer\u2019s expectations of the employee, the notice to the employee of these expectations, and the reasonableness of the expectations. See, e.g., <em>Jean </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 206, 209 (1984); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>390 Mass. 1004 (1983); <em>Torres, supra </em>at 780; <em>Garfield, supra </em>at 97. Because evidence bearing on those factors is found in the employer\u2019s possession, the employer ought to bear the burden of producing such evidence and persuading the board of its sufficiency. See P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 41 (5th ed. 1981) (\u201cburden of persuasion is on the party who . . . has freer access to the evidence\u201d). Moreover, such evidence disqualifies a claimant who has otherwise established eligibility under \u00a7 24. Whether wilful misconduct is considered a statutorily-created exception or an affirmative defense, principles of statutory construction dictate that the employer, as the party raising the exception or defense, must bear the burden of persuasion. Sar<em>ni Original Dry Cleaners, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cooke, </em>388 Mass. 611, 617 (1983). See generally P.J. Liacos, <em>supra </em>at 40-44.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Our interpretation is consistent with decisions in other jurisdictions interpreting similar statutory provisions. See, e.g., <em>Magma Copper Co. </em>v. <em>Arizona Dep\u2019t of Economic Sec., </em>128 Ariz. 346 (Ct. App. 1981); <em>Arvada </em>v. <em>Industrial Comm\u2019n of Colo., </em>701 P.2d 623 (Colo. App. 1985); <em>Dalton Brick &amp; Tile Co. </em>v. <em>Huiet, </em>102 Ga. App. 221 (1960); <em>Roll </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>105 Idaho 22 (1983); <em>Potts </em>v. <em>Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Sec. Div., </em>475 N.E.2d 708 (Ind. App. 1985); <em>Cosper </em>v. <em>Iowa Dep\u2019t of Job Serv., </em>321 N.W.2d 6 (Iowa 1982); <em>Charbonnet v. Gerace, </em>457 So. 2d 676 (La. <em>1984); Dubois </em>v. <em>Louisiana Dep\u2019t of Labor, Office of Employment Sec., </em>427 So. 2d 645 (La. App. 1983); <em>Wallace W. Carlson Co. </em>v. <em>Hasler, </em>351 N.W.2d 688 (Minn. App. 1984); <em>Adelsman </em>v. <em>Northwest Airlines, Inc., </em>267 Minn. 116, 123 (1963); <em>Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Review </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>25 Pa. Commw. 583, 586 (1976); <em>In re Therrien, </em>132 Vt. 535 (1974); <em>Kansas City Star Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Indus., Labor &amp; Human Relations, </em>60 Wis. 2d 591, 602 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Our holding expressly limits the broad statement in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>384 Mass. 758, 761 (1981), that the claimant \u201cbears the burden of persuasion on issues affecting his eligibility for unemployment benefits.\u201d To the extent that cases following <em>Smith </em>have expressly or impliedly placed the burden of persuasion on the claimant on issues bearing on disqualification for benefits under \u00a7 25 <em>(e), </em>(2), they will no longer be followed. See, e.g., <em>White </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>395 Mass. 635 (1985); <em>DiNatale </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 655 (1985); <em>Rioni </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>392 Mass. 436 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">In sum, the claimant still must meet the initial burden of establishing eligibility for benefits. <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>340 Mass. 315, 319 (1960). <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>324 Mass. 45, 50 (1949). Once the claimant establishes eligibility, the burden is on the employer to persuade the director that the employee should be disqualified for wilful misconduct. The director\u2019s decision must be based on substantial evidence, and he must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>make subsidiary findings of fact on each issue essential to his decision. <em>Manias </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>388 Mass. 201, 205 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Because there may have been some misunderstanding as to the burden of persuasion, the board on remand may consider evidence on deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest. Alternatively, the board may send this matter back to the review examiner for findings and a determination on that issue. The judgment of the District Court is reversed and a new judgment is to be entered remanding this matter to the Division of Employment Security for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b243-7\">General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 25 (1984 ed.), provides, in part, that \u201cno benefits shall be paid to an individual under this chapter [when the employee\u2019s termination comes about] <em>(e) . . . (2) </em>by discharge shown to the satisfaction of the director to be attributable solely to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b245-7\"> At the hearing, the plaintiff produced documentation that the review examiner found would have met the employer\u2019s request. The plaintiff also said that he asked his physicians on multiple occasions to send more medical information. The physicians failed to do so in a timely manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\"> There is some suggestion that the union contract under which the plaintiff was employed may govern the employer\u2019s requirement for medical documentation. That section of the contract is not in the record before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b245-9\"> Because we must remand this matter, we do not decide whether the failure of a third person to respond to a request for information may be attributable to the employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b245-10\">Since 1984, there have been at least sixteen cases on this section. See, e.g., <em>White </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>395 Mass. 635 (1985); <em>Menefee </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>395 Mass. 1004 (1985); <em>Coulouras </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>394 Mass. 817 (1985); <em>Babize </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>394 Mass. 806 (1985); <em>Jorgensen </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>394 Mass. 800 (1985); <em>Hoye </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>394 Mass. 411 (1985); <em>Jean </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>394 Mass. 225 (1985); <em>DeNatale </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 655 (1985); <em>Grise </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 271 (1984); <em>Shyngle </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Sec., 392 Mass. 1009 (1984); <em>Rioni </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>392 Mass. 436 (1984); <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>392 Mass. 305 (1984); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>392 Mass. 148 (1984); <em>Starks </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 640 (1984); <em>Lycurgus </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 623 (1984); <em>Jean </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 206 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b247-5\"> Nothing in our interpretation of \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2) is inconsistent with G.

Moreover, the claimant is the party likely to have freer access to the evidence required by \u00a7 25 <em>(b) </em>(1) and (2): whether he is participating or financing or directly interested in the labor dispute and whether he is a member of the grade or class of workers participating or financing or directly interested in the dispute.
