(DCI), commenced this nonjury unfair competition action against DataComm User, Inc. (User), and its parent company Computerworld, Inc. All these parties are Massachusetts corporations. Shortly thereafter, DCI obtained a temporary restraining order against User and Computerworld, enjoining the defendants from using the name \u201cDATACOMM \u201976\u201d to promote its 1976 national data communications trade show. The judge referred the case to a master and on his recommendation dissolved the temporary restraining order and also denied DCI\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. User then counterclaimed against DCI, ultimately alleging that DCI engaged in unfair competition, conversion, abuse of process, interference with contractual relations, and defamation. User later amended its counterclaim, adding Sheldon G. Adelson, a principal of DCI, as a party. In February, 1976, User was granted a preliminary injunction enjoining DCI and Adelson from using a copy of a magazine circulation list.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Hearings before the master began in 1977, after the master allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for a bifurcated trial. In July, 1980, after approximately fifty days of trial, the master issued his final report on liability (facts final), finding against DCI on its unfair competition claim, and finding for User on its counterclaim for unfair competition, conversion, and abuse of process. User and Computerworld filed a motion pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F (1984 ed.), for reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees, a motion to confirm the master\u2019s report, and later amended the counterclaim to include a claim under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In November, 1980, a judge confirmed the master\u2019s report on liability,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and ordered the case recommitted to the master for findings on the issue of counterclaim damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The master submitted his report (facts final) on User\u2019s counterclaim damages in December, 1982, awarding total damages of $33,250. The judge recommitted the case to the master for findings relating to the motion under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, and for clarification of a portion of the damage award. In August, 1984, after the master filed his report after recommittal, the judge confirmed the master\u2019s report on damages, denied User and Computerworld\u2019s motion under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, and ruled that DCI and Adelson\u2019s actions had not constituted a violation of G. L. c. 93A. Judgment was entered in favor of User and Computerworld in the original action and for User on the counterclaim for $33,250.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">All parties filed notices of appeal. DCI filed a motion including a request for leave to file a statement of the evidence. The judge denied the motion in October, 1984. DCI and Adelson nevertheless filed a statement of the evidence, and the judge allowed User and Computerworld\u2019s motion to strike the statement, imposing sanctions of $300. We granted DCI and Adel-son\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">On appeal, DCI argues that the circumstances of User and Computerworld\u2019s promotion and operation of their data communications trade show, \u201cDATACOMM \u201976,\u201d did in fact con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>stitute unfair competition and that the master\u2019s report was erroneously confirmed; the master\u2019s failure to submit summaries and to report certain excluded evidence constituted prejudicial error; it was error to strike DCI and Adelson\u2019s statement of the evidence and to impose sanctions; and the damage awards are unsupported by the master\u2019s findings. On cross appeal, User challenges the denial of relief under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, and G. L. c. 93A. We affirm the judgment as it applies to DCI\u2019s unfair competition action. We affirm the judgment on User\u2019s counterclaim in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Sheldon G. Adelson was the principal investor in Communications Trends, Inc. (Trends), which in June, 1972, began publishing a magazine called The Data Communications User (TDCU) and continued publishing it continuously until May, 1975. The first issue of TDCU announced that it would sponsor a national trade show devoted exclusively to data communications called Data Communications INTERFACE \u201973. In July, 1972, Trends formed DCI, the plaintiff in this action, a wholly owned corporation. DCI was intended to own and operate the INTERFACE shows. The master found, however, that DCI never operated as a separate financial entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Trends and DCI had jointly obtained a loan from Capitol Bank, having pledged all the assets of both corporations as collateral. Trends suffered financial difficulty in May, 1975. Although Trends filed a petition in bankruptcy, Capitol Bank, pursuant to its security agreement with Trends and DCI, successfully foreclosed on the loan. In June, 1975, Computerworld purchased all assets of Trends which had been used in the publication and marketing of TDCU. The sale to Computer-world included: all copies of circulation lists used by Trends for subscription, circulation, or other such purposes in any form; all promotional materials; all rights to the name \u201cThe Data Communications User-,\u201d and all other names owned by Trends; and all trademarks and goodwill pertaining to the publications.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Just after purchasing TDCU, Computerworld formed DataComm User, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary corporation. The new publishers of TDCU decided that the magazine would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>again sponsor a data communications trade show, now to be called DATACOMM \u201976, to be held in New Orleans at the same site as INTERFACE \u201975.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The master found that the public was not confused or misled as to the source or origin of the DATACOMM \u201976 or INTERFACE \u201976 show. The master did find that some confusion existed as to which show was indeed the \u201congoing\u201d show. Although DCI\u2019s show was officially named Data Communications INTERFACE, it was, from its inception, commonly and popularly called INTERFACE. INTERFACE was the name by which DCI\u2019s show was intended to be known.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The master found that an allegation in the complaint in the instant action verified by Adelson that \u201cthe name Data Communications \u20197- has acquired a meaning exclusively identified with the product and services of the plaintiff so as to indicate the plaintiff\u2019s show\u201d was a knowing misstatement. The master also found that Adelson knew INTERFACE \u201973, \u201974, and \u201975 had never been known as Data Communications \u20197-.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">1. <em>Procedural issues.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">a. <em>Summary of the evidence. </em>DCI contends that by failing to append summaries of the evidence to his report, as requested by DCI, the master violated his duty under Rule 49 (7) of the Superior Court, as amended (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">The proper practice under rule 49 (7) and Mass. R. Civ. P. 53 (e) (2), 365 Mass. 820 (1974), to raise the issue before the Superior Court judge, whether a finding of the master is supported by evidence, has been extensively treated elsewhere and a detailed review need not be attempted here. See <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Pevear, </em>383 Mass. 350, 358 (1981), and cases and authorities cited. See also Greaney, Trials Before Masters: A Procedural and Substantive Primer for the Practicing Lawyer, 63 Mass. L. Rev. 195 (1978). DCI failed properly to follow the required procedure. Its procedural missteps are fatal to its claim for summaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Shortly after the July, 1980, filing of the master\u2019s final report on liability, DCI filed a document entitled, \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Objection to Master\u2019s Report re Liability,\u201d and moved to recommit the report. This document of approximately seventy-eight pages is an admixture of argument, objections to legal conclusions of the master, objections to factual conclusions of the master, objections to the master\u2019s conclusions regarding credibility of witnesses, objections to the master\u2019s failure to find facts that the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses would support, and included numerous exhibits reproduced in part or entirely. This document was discursive, prolix, confusing, and, in part, argumentative. It also contained a request for summaries of the evidence. Most of the objections contain reference to transcript pages or to specific exhibits, but the presentation of the objections is confusing. In November, 1980, the judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion to confirm the liability report without summaries. The plaintiff did not file a motion to order the master to submit summaries prior to the hearing. The master submitted his final report on damages in December, 1982, and in March, 1983,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> DCI and Adelson filed objections to the report and moved to strike portions of the report or recommit. Requests for summaries of the evidence were dispersed throughout DCI and Adelson\u2019s twenty-eight pages of objections. Many of the transcript references are broad and cite fifty and one hundred page sections of transcript at a time. The final report on damages after recommittal was filed without summaries, the master\u2019s findings were confirmed, and judgment entered in accordance with the report in August, 1984. DCI and Adelson first moved to have the judge order the master to submit summaries of the evidence in September, 1984. A single justice of the Appeals Court denied a motion under Mass. R. A. P. 15 (c), 365 Mass. 859 (1974), to order the master to report summaries because the case had gone to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>DCI\u2019s summary requests fell short of the precision necessary for proper procedure. Even if the requests for summaries were not so lacking in the necessary degree of specificity required under rule 49 (7), as to relieve the master of his obligation regarding summaries, we hold that DCI\u2019s failure to file a motion for an order for such summaries until after entry of judgment and four years after its initial submission of a summary request, forecloses any claim of prejudicial error. Even that motion did not comply with the requirement that it be \u201caccompanied by an affidavit of [the objecting party\u2019s] counsel setting forth a summary of the evidence as [the objecting party] thinks the master ought to have prepared it, relating each portion of summary to the finding it purportedly contradicts.\u201d <em>Thomas O\u2019Connor &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 15 (1983), quoting <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Winshall, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 312, 316 (1980). See <em>Artco, Inc. </em>v. <em>DiFruscia, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 513, 516 n.3 (1977); J.W. Smith &amp; H.B. Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 53.10 (1977 &amp; Supp. 1985). In view of the foregoing, the Superior Court judge committed no error in denying DCI and Adelson\u2019s 1984 motion to order the master to submit summaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">b. <em>Statement of the evidence; imposition of sanctions. </em>DCI and Adelson maintain that it was error to strike their statement of the evidence submitted after the denial of their October, 1984, motion to order the master to submit summaries, as they properly complied with Mass. R. A. P. 8 (c), as appearing in 378 Mass. 924 (1979). There was no error. Rule 8 (c) \u201cdoes not apply to matters referred to masters.\u201d <em>Roderick v. Carvalho, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 873, 874 (1981). The subsequent filing of the statement of the evidence was in direct contravention of the judge\u2019s ruling of October, 1984. The judge ruled that DCI and Adelson\u2019s filing of the statement was frivolous. We do not disagree with his imposition of $300 in sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">c. <em>Excluded evidence. </em>DCI claims that the master, over its objections, wrongfully excluded testimony of six witnesses as inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">DCI\u2019s \u201cTestimony Exclusion Report Request\u201d states that the excluded evidence concerned \u201ctestimony of [six] witnesses that customers and potential customers of Plaintiff made statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>to the witnesses indicating that the customers were confused as to whether Plaintiffs or Defendants had the right to represent themselves as [the ongoing data communications trade show].\u201d There was no error. See <em>Programmed Tax Syss. </em>v. <em>Raytheon Co., </em>439 F. Supp. 1128, 1131 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. 1977). Moreover, we hold, <em>infra, </em>that acts which led to confusion as to which show was the ongoing show do not support the plaintiff\u2019s unfair competition claim. Even if the evidence was not barred by the hearsay rule, therefore, it was not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">2. <em>Unfair competition claim. </em>The master found that there was no confusion as to source or origin of the INTERFACE \u201976 and DATACOMM \u201976 shows and that neither defendant engaged in any conduct which would lead the public to believe that the DATACOMM shows were owned or sponsored by DCI. Furthermore, he found that the names DATACOMM and INTERFACE did not confuse or mislead the public as to source or origin of either show. DCI does not seriously contest these findings, but instead challenges the master\u2019s legal conclusion that DCI\u2019s unfair competition claim was not actionable because likelihood of confusion as to source or origin is an essential ingredient of the tort of unfair competition. DCI argues that the master\u2019s findings that confusion existed as to whether INTERFACE \u201976 or DATACOMM \u201976 was the ongoing or continuing data communications trade show and that User sought to convince exhibitors and prospective exhibitors that DATACOMM \u201976 was the ongoing show,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are legally sufficient to sustain DCI\u2019s unfair competition claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">In Massachusetts, a plaintiff<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> may recover by showing <em>\u201ceither </em>\u2018palming off <em>or </em>that the features of the product... [or service] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>have acquired\u201d a secondary meaning such that confusion as to its source is likely to arise if the defendant is allowed to copy them. <em>Pic Design Corp. </em>v. <em>Bearings Specialty Co., </em>436 F.2d 804, 807 (1st Cir. 1971) (emphasis in original). Professional <em>Economics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Professional Economic Servs., Inc., </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 70, 79 (1981). <em>See Paramount Beverage Co. </em>v. <em>Davis Square Liquors, Inc., </em>354 Mass. 272, 274 (1968), and cases cited. See also <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Parkway Motor Sales, Inc., </em>324 Mass. 151, 156 (1949). \u201cPalming off\u201d or \u201cpassing off\u201d is an attempt to deceive the public into believing it is trading with one person when in fact it is dealing with another. See <em>Summerfield Co. </em>v. <em>Prime Furniture Co., </em>242 Mass. 149, 155 (1922); <em>Professional Economics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Professional Economic Servs., Inc., supra, </em>quoting <em>Remco Indus. </em>v. <em>Toyomenka, Inc., </em>286 F. Supp. 948, 954 (S.D.N.Y.), aff\u2019d, 397 F.2d 977 (2d Cir. 1968) (the attempt to induce customers to believe that his products are actually those of another). Under either theory, it is evident that the gravamen of an unfair competition claim is the likelihood of consumer confusion as to the source of the goods or services. See <em>Coca-Cola Co. </em>v. <em>Snow Crest Beverages, Inc., </em>162 F.2d 280, 283 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 332 U.S. 809 (1947). See also 2 J.T. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition \u00a7 23:1(A) and (C) (2d ed. 1984). DCI argues that, although the confusion in the context of an unfair competition claim has traditionally meant confusion as to source or origin of goods or services, the trend in Federal and other courts is to include confusion as to sponsorship, endorsement, or some other affiliation. See <em>Stop The Olympic Prison </em>v. <em>United States Olympic Comm., </em>489 F. Supp. 1112, 1121-1122 (S.D.N.Y. 1980); 2 J.T. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 23:1(D) (confusion remedied by unfair competition law is confusion not only as to source, but also as to affiliation, connection, or sponsorship). See also <em>Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pussycat Cinema, Ltd., </em>604 F.2d 200, 204-205 (2d Cir. 1979), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>cases cited (construing definition of confusion under \u00a7 43 [a] of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125 [a]. Requiring \u201cconfusion [only] as to the origin of the [product]. . . read[s] the confusion requirement too narrowly. . . . The public\u2019s belief that the mark\u2019s owner sponsored or otherwise approved the use of the trademark satisfies the confusion requirement\u201d). We need not now consider whether the requirement of confusion as to source or origin in Massachusetts unfair competition law should be interpreted to include confusion as to sponsorship because such an interpretation does not assist DCI in its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The courts which have expanded the concept of confusion to include affiliation, sponsorship, connection, and the like within the ambit of unfair competition law have done so to extend protection to plaintiffs, in appropriate circumstances, where the defendant is involved in a noncompeting endeavor. See 2 J.T. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 24:3(C). See also <em>Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pussycat Cinema, Ltd., supra </em>at 205. The master found that both shows, DATACOMM and INTERFACE, were in fierce competition with each other. His findings relative to lack of source confusion indicate that it was quite unlikely that exhibitors and attendees or prospective exhibitors or attendees thought DATACOMM \u201976 was sponsored by, affiliated with, or in some way approved by DCI.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is evident, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>that the broader notion of confusion we have discussed is inapplicable to the facts of the instant case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The facts found by the master relative to the confusion which did exist do not amount to confusion as to source or origin. The distinction between the two shows in 1976 was apparent, and as stated, there was no likelihood that attendees or exhibitors might be misled into thinking DATACOMM \u201976 was sponsored by or run by DCI. In the circumstances of this case, therefore, confusion as to which of the two shows was the \u201ccontinuing\u201d show is not actionable under the tort of unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">DCI argues further that the adoption by User of certain features of the INTERFACE shows which DCI denominates as the shows\u2019 \u201ctrade dress\u201d constitutes unfair competition. DCI primarily refers to the fact that the master found that User adopted items such as a fee schedule, program schedule, and floor plan for DATACOMM \u201976 that were similar to DCI\u2019s INTERFACE \u201975 fee schedule and floor plan and intentionally used a contract form for exhibitors which was similar to that used by DCI. We do not decide whether the term \u201ctrade dress\u201d contemplates the items referred to by DCI because for DCI to recover under its \u201ctrade dress\u201d theory it must show that these features had acquired secondary meaning such that there was a likelihood that confusion as to its source would arise by the defendants\u2019 adoption of them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>It is evident from the master\u2019s findings that these features had not acquired any special significance as applied to DCI, were not associated in the public\u2019s mind to any extent with DCI, and that no deception of the public resulted from DATACOMM \u201976\u2019s use of these features. See <em>Randolph Ref. Corp. </em>v. <em>Shapiro, </em>333 Mass. 506, 508 (1956); <em>Jenney Mfr. Co. </em>v. <em>Leader Filling Stations Corp., </em>291 Mass. 394, 398 (1935). Consequently, it is apparent that no secondary meaning attached to the features.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">In view of the master\u2019s finding that there was no confusion as to the source or origin of either show, any palming off claim would also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Finally, DCI argues that the defendants, as \u201csecond comers\u201d to the data communications trade show market had a duty to distinguish their show to avoid confusion. It is of course true that second comers have such a duty. <em>Staples Coal Co. </em>v. <em>City Fuel Co., </em>316 Mass. 503, 507 (1944), and cases cited. Assuming arguendo that the defendants were in fact second comers to this market, DCI\u2019s contention is answered again by the master\u2019s finding that there was no confusion as to the source of either show, and that the origin of the features discussed was unmistakably made clear. The defendants successfully distinguished their show and avoided confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">3. <em>Comparison of marks DATACOMM and INTERFACE. </em>DCI and Adelson argue that the master\u2019s finding that the name DATACOMM \u201976 bore no resemblance to the name INTERFACE \u20197- is clearly erroneous in light of his additional finding that DCFs show was officially named Data Communications INTERFACE \u20187- and was known as \u201cThe DATACOMM SHOW or THE INTERFACE SHOW.\u201d See <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Pevear, </em>383 Mass. 350, 359 (1981). We do not agree. The master\u2019s numerous and detailed findings include that: (1) although Data Communications INTERFACE was the official name of DCFs shows, it was known most commonly and popularly \"as \u201cINTERFACE\u201d and when the shaw\u2019s official title was used, \u201cINTERFACE\u201d appeared in boldface; (2) DCI emphasized the name INTERFACE extensively in TDCU prior to the sale of the magazine to Computerworld and regularly in show pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>motional material; (3) after sale of TDCU, DCI increased its emphasis on the name INTERFACE; (4) in its application for Federal service mark registration, DCI disclaimed protection for the words, \u201cData Communications,\u201d and (5) in a verified complaint DCI filed in an unrelated unfair competition action in 1978, Adelson swore that the show \u2019 s name was INTERFACE \u201cfrom the beginning and the name had \u2018at all times\u2019 been emphasized in its shows, its advertising,\u201d so that INTERFACE was clearly identified in the computer and communication industry and among the exhibitors and attendees. In context, therefore, the additional finding that some members of the public were familiar with the official title of the INTERFACE shows does not render the findings contradictory or inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">DCI and Adelson maintain further that, in considering the issue of similarity of marks, the comparison between INTERFACE and DATACOMM was wrong as a matter of law and suggest that the DATACOMM SHOW and DATA COMMUNICATIONS INTERFACE \u201976 were names more properly compared with the defendants\u2019 show title. They argue that it was error for the master to \u201cdissect\u201d the name of DCI\u2019s show and focus on INTERFACE, since \u201cin an action for unfair competition the entire image of the services and product must be considered.\u201d It is clear from the master\u2019s findings that he did consider the entire image of the services, found that INTERFACE was the dominant feature of the shows\u2019 name, and concluded that the shows were known as INTERFACE.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">4. <em>Damages assessed against DCI and Adelson relative to User\u2019s successful counterclaim. </em>DCI and Adelson challenge the following damages awarded User as a plaintiff-in-counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">a. <em>For conversion of circulation list copy. </em>User was awarded $4,000 for DCFs conversion of a copy of a magazine circulation list Computerworld purchased from Capitol Bank in 1975 when it bought TDCU, and $6,250 for legal fees expended in connection with DCFs wrongful use of the list copy. DCI and Adelson allege that it was error for the master to find that DCI converted the copy, and argue that the facts demonstrate instead that DCI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>had maintained lawful possession of the copy. The master found the following. Computerworid purchased at foreclosure all of the assets of Trends which had been involved in the production of TDCU including all known copies of circulation lists. The circulation lists had been prepared for, billed to, and paid for by Trends. The person who prepared and maintained the list had never heard of DCI, which at that time had no independent financial existence. DCI nevertheless obtained a copy of the list, made use of it, and refused to turn it over to Computerworid. When Trends refused to relinquish a carbon copy of TDCU\u2019s circulation list to Computerworid, stating that the copy belonged to DCI, Computerworid filed a complaint against DCI in Bankruptcy Court. Adelson produced a copy of the list in the course of his deposition in that case and testified that it was the only copy in DCI\u2019s possession. Relying on Adelson\u2019s sworn representation concerning that copy, Com-puterworid agreed to settle the suit in exchange for the copy. As a result, Computerworid dismissed its complaint and withdrew its objection to DCI\u2019s reorganization plan. DCI turned over the copy and entered into a stipulated agreement with Computerworid, which provided that DCI was in possession of the copy and had \u201cthis day delivered [to Computerworid] said copy.\u201d DCI, however, possessed a carbon copy of the list, which it continued to retain and use to promote INTERFACE \u201976. DCI and Adelson base their argument on the contention, not found by the master, that Adelson indicated at his deposition that the copy produced might not be the only list in DCFs possession. They state that DCFs agreement with Computerworid only contemplated their relinquishing control of the copy produced at the deposition, and did not extinguish DCFs property interest in the carbon copy. Even if this argument were open to DCI and Adelson on the record before us, see <em>Riverview Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Case, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 974 (1981) (unreported evidence or evidence not appearing in the record is valueless), it would fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The master\u2019s findings establish that Computerworid purchased all forms of the list and that DCI, inferentially, had no rights in it. Even were this not the case, the settlement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>claim against DCI in the Bankruptcy Court would have extinguished any vestigial rights of DCI in the list.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">b. <em>For abuse of process. </em>User was awarded $4,500 for legal fees incurred in defending against the temporary restraining order obtained by DCI, as part of the damages sustained due to abuse of process. DCI and Adelson incorrectly contend that the facts found by the master do not constitute abuse of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The master found that Adelson, on behalf of DCI, knowingly misstated the facts in the verified complaint. Adelson alleged there that the name DATA COMMUNICATIONS \u20197- was exclusively identified with DCI as indicating DCI\u2019s trade show. The master found that Adelson knew at the time that DCI\u2019s show was never popularly identified as such, and was commonly referred to by DCI and Adelson as INTERFACE. DCI obtained a temporary restraining order enjoining User and Com-puterworld from using the name DATACOMM \u201976 to promote their trade show. Shortly thereafter, Adelson told a witness that he \u201cdoubted seriously that anyone could change its name and promote a show with a new name in sixty days.\u201d The master found that DCFs actions immediately following the issuance of the restraining order manifested its intention to use the litigation as a marketing tool against the DATACOMM show and launched a promotional plan which insinuated that DATACOMM \u201976 would not take place. Finally, the master found that DCI, largely through Adelson\u2019s actions, caused \u201csubstantial disruption and damage to [User].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">To prevail on an abuse of process claim \u201cit must appear that the process was used to accomplish some ulterior purpose for which it was not designed or intended, or which was not the legitimate purpose of the particular process employed.\u201d <em>Beecy </em>v. <em>Pucciarelli, </em>387 Mass. 589, 595 (1982), quoting <em>Quaranto </em>v. <em>Silverman, </em>345 Mass. 423, 426 (1963). The essential elements of the tort are \u201c(1) \u2018process\u2019 was used; (2) for an ulterior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>or illegitimate purpose; (3) resulting in damage.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Brockton Pub. Mkts., Inc., 369 </em>Mass. 387, 389 (1975). <em>Stromberg </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>456 F. Supp. 848, 849 (D. Mass. 1978). All these elements are supported by the master\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">DCI and Adelson contend that no \u201cprocess\u201d was utilized, since the alleged abuse concerned the issuance of an injunction and that this court has previously declined to \u201cbroaden our definition of process to include injunctions.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Brockton Pub. Mkts., Inc., supra </em>at 390. The master, however, based his findings on misrepresentations in DCI\u2019s initial verified complaint instituting the suit. See <em>id. </em>at n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The master\u2019s findings concerning DCI and Adelson\u2019s knowing misrepresentations in the complaint, coupled with his findings concerning their behavior in emphasizing the litigation in marketing, support the conclusion that the action was instituted for an ulterior motive. See <em>Quaranto </em>v. <em>Silverman, supra </em>at 427; <em>Lorusso </em>v. <em>Bloom, </em>321 Mass. 9, 10 (1947); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 682 comment a (1977). The fact that DCI\u2019s unfair competition action was instituted at least in part as a marketing tool shows a misuse of the legal process. Compare <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Brockton Pub. Mkts., Inc., supra. </em>As there is also a finding of damage, an essential element of this tort, <em>Quaranto </em>v. <em>Silverman, supra, </em>we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">c. <em>Other damages. </em>The master awarded User $15,000 for injuries sustained due to the \u201cmisconduct and the culpable acts committed by [DCI and Adelson]\u201d which were in addition to those sustained due to DCI and Adelson\u2019s misuse of the circulation list copy. The master made findings clarifying this award in his report after recommittal. The award was largely based on his finding of a $35,000 shortfall in expected exhibitor fees for DATACOMM \u201976. The master found that certain business decisions of User contributed to its failure to achieve the anticipated income and could \u201cnot find that the [entire] $35,000 shortfall was a direct result of [DCI and Adelson\u2019s] unfair method of competition or deceptive trade practices.\u201d Nevertheless, he found that DCI caused User to suffer \u201csubstantial disruption and damage,\u201d principally through Adelson\u2019s activities on DCI\u2019s behalf. He specified some of the misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>and culpable acts from which the damage flowed and reasserted his belief that $15,000 reasonably represents \u201cthe loss sustained by [User].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">In the case of business torts \u201can element of uncertainty in the assessment of damages is not a bar to their recovery.\u201d <em>National Merchandising Corp. </em>v. <em>Leyden, </em>370 Mass. 425, 430 (1976). An \u201caward of damages can stand on less than substantial evidence . . . particularly [in] the case of business torts, where the critical focus is on the wrongfulness of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Ricky Smith Pontiac, Inc. </em>v. <em>Subaru of New England, Inc., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 396, 426 (1982), citing <em>Randall v. Peerless Motor Car Co., </em>212 Mass. 352 (1912). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">d. <em>For annual bond premiums paid by User. </em>User was awarded $3,500 for bond premiums it paid between 1976 and 1982. User had successfully obtained a preliminary injunction enjoining DCI and Adelson from using or selling the circulation list copy they wrongfully retained. As a condition of the injunction, the judge required User to post a $50,000 bond at an annual premium of $500. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 65 (c), 365 Mass. 832 (1974). Since the master found that the list lost most of its value after January, 1976, DCI and Adelson assert that it is inequitable to assess them the costs of maintaining the injunction past 1976, as they allege that payment of the bond premium after that date was a voluntary choice of User. User\u2019s continued payment of bond premiums during the pen-dency of the action was not merely \u201cvoluntary.\u201d To argue to the contrary borders on the frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">5. <em>User\u2019s Cross Appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">a. <em>Claim under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. </em>After the master\u2019s report on liability was confirmed, User was allowed to amend its counterclaim by alleging violations of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. In his report on damages, the master made no specific findings regarding this claim. Based on the factual findings in the liability report and the report on damages, a judge ruled that the acts of DCI and Adelson did not constitute a violation of G. L. c. 93A. We hold, however, that the master\u2019s findings do demonstrate a violation of G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (a) (1984 ed.) makes unlawful any \u201c[u]nfair . . . acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d Although the statute does not itself define what constitutes an unfair act or practice made unlawful by \u00a7 2 <em>(a), Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCotis, </em>366 Mass. 234, 241 (1974), courts are to be guided by the interpretation given to those terms by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a)(1) (1982), and by the Massachusetts Attorney General. See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 <em>(b), (c) </em>(1984 ed.). Relying on FTC interpretations, this court has stated that the following are \u201cconsiderations to be used in determining whether a practice is to be deemed unfair: \u2018(1) whether the practice ... is within at least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) . . . is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) . . . causes substantial injury [to] . . . competitors or other businessmen.\u2019 \u201d <em>PMP Assocs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>366 Mass. 593, 596 (1975), quoting 29 Fed. Reg. 8325, 8355 (1964). The Attorney General\u2019s Rules and Regulations provide a similarly broad contention, \u201c[A]n act or practice is a violation of Chapter 93A, Section 2 if: . . . [i]t is oppressive or otherwise unconscionable in any respect.\u201d 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3:16 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">This court has underscored the broad impact of c. 93A as creating \u201cnew substantive rights\u201d and providing relief which is \u201cin addition to, and not an alternative to, traditional tort . . . remedies.\u201d <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 383 (1979), and cases cited. Consequently, while it is clear that common law actions for fraud and deceit are within the contemplation of an \u201cunfair act\u201d under the statute, it is equally well established that the definition of the term under c. 93A goes far beyond the scope of these common law actions. See <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., 366 </em>Mass. 688, 703 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The master found that Adelson identified the photo-reduced copy of the circulation list as the only one in DCI\u2019s possession, that in reasonable reliance on that representation Computer-world settled its suit, and that at the time of Adelson\u2019s deposition DCI retained the carbon copy of the list. He specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>found that the carbon copy not produced at the deposition was \u201cwrongfully withheld.\u201d The master also found that DCI commenced an action on oath which misstated a fact and was used as a marketing tool to cast doubt on whether the DATACOMM \u201976 show would ever occur. In addition, the finding that Adel-son knowingly made a false representation to Computerworld concerning DCI\u2019s possession of the carbon copy gives rise to a reasonable inference that the false representation was made to induce Computerworld to drop its suit while DCI retained use of the list. It is clear that the type of misconduct found by the master falls within the concept of \u201cunfair acts\u201d prohibited by G. L. c. 93A. See <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Zuckerman, </em>388 Mass. 8, 12 (1983) (in enacting c. 93A, the Legislature \u201cstrove to encourage more equitable behavior in the marketplace\u201d and by the addition of \u00a7 11 by St. 1972, c. 614, \u00a7 2, these protections were extended to those engaged in trade or commerce in business transactions with others similarly engaged).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">User argues that it is entitled to an award of multiple damages under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11 (1984 ed.), which provides that \u201c[i]f the court finds for the petitioner, recovery shall be in the amount of actual damages; or up to three, but not less than two, times such amount if the court finds that the use or employment of the method of competition or the act or practice was a willful or knowing violation of . . . section two.\u201d We have stated that G. L. c. 93A \u201cties liability for multiple damages to the degree of the defendant\u2019s culpability by creating two classes of defendants.\u201d <em>International Fidelity Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 853 (1983). Those defendants who have committed \u201crelatively innocent violations\u201d of the statute are not liable for multiple damages, while a second class of defendants who have committed \u201cwillful or knowing\u201d violations are. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Actions involving fraudulent representations in knowing disregard of the truth encompass culpable, \u201cwillful\u201d behavior under the statute. Compare <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 388 (1979), and <em>Jeffco Fibres, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dario Diesel Serv., Inc., </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1029, 1031 (1982). We have already said that the master\u2019s findings concerning Adelson\u2019s statements that the copy of the circulation list produced was the only one DCI had, support a conclusion that this was a knowing misrepresentation. Moreover, Adelson\u2019s misstatement in DCI\u2019s verified complaint was explicitly found to be \u201cknowing\u201d by the master. The master found that the acts establishing liability on the abuse of process claim against DCI and Adelson were intentional. For example, he found that DCI intended to use the litigation as a marketing tool. We conclude that these acts were \u201cknowing\u201d in the sense of the statute, and that multiple damages are therefore appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Having demonstrated a violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, User is, of course, entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs. See <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, supra </em>at 388. User has already been awarded attorney\u2019s fees of $6,250 in connection with the misuse of the circulation list.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> User is not entitled to a duplicative award. The award of $4,500 in connection with the abuse of process claim is recovery for part of the damage sustained by User. As an element of damages it is subject to the multiplier provisions of G. L. c. 93A. On remand, the judge is to assess multiple damages and such attorney\u2019s fees and costs as are appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">b. <em>Claim under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. </em>General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6F (1984 ed.), allows a party in a civil action to recover its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>\u201creasonable counsel fees and other costs and expenses incurred\u201d where \u201call or substantially all of the claims, defenses . . . whether of a factual, legal or mixed nature, made by any party . . . were wholly insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith.\u201d The judge in his order pursuant to User\u2019s motion under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, found for DCI.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The master\u2019s findings support a conclusion that the bulk of DCI\u2019s claims in its unfair competition action against User and Computerworld, as well as its defenses to User\u2019s counterclaim were not \u201cwholly insubstantial, frivolous, and not advanced in good faith.\u201d DCI\u2019s complaint sets forth essentially two basic claims as part of its unfair competition action. The first is that the defendants\u2019 promotion and operation of DATACOMM \u201976 was confusing and misleading and created confusion as to which show was which. While the master found there was no confusion as to source, he found evidence of confusion as to which show was ongoing. Although we hold today that such confusion cannot sustain a successful unfair competition action, the question was subject to debate. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F (\u201cNo finding shall be made that any claim, defense . . . was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>wholly insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith solely because a novel or unusual argument or principle of law was advanced in support thereof\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">DCI\u2019s second claim basically is that DATACOMM \u201976 copied features of the INTERFACE shows which had acquired secondary meaning. The master found that, in fact, User and Computerworld had copied the features complained of. The question whether the features copied were protectable was plainly not an insubstantial or frivolous one.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The master found that DCFs verified complaint contained a known misstatement and we have earlier discussed the detailed facts found which substantiate this. Clearly a claim founded upon this allegation would be insubstantial, frivolous, and certainly in bad faith under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. This is, however, but one relatively minor aspect of DCFs claims. The statute states that relief may be granted on the court\u2019s finding that <em>\u201call </em>or <em>substantially all </em>of the claims . . . were <em>wholly </em>insubstantial, frivolous and not in good faith\u201d (emphasis added). Although DCI and Adelson\u2019s misconduct is clearly reprehensible, it does not appear to have permeated \u201csubstantially all\u201d of DCFs claims. Neither is it readily apparent that DCFs claims are \u201cwholly insubstantial\u201d by virtue of this misrepresentation. In light of this we cannot say the judge abused his discretion in denying relief under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">We affirm the judgment in so far as it pertains to DCFs unfair competition action. We reverse so much of the judgment on User\u2019s counterclaim as denied relief under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. The case is remanded for determination of multiple damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs under c. 93A, \u00a7 11, in accordance with this opinion. In all other respects the judgment on the counterclaim is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b779-9\"> The judge struck one finding from the report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b781-10\"> This was the Superior Court rule in effect in .1980 when the master submitted his final report on liability.

INTERFACE on the other hand was presented as cosponsored by Datamation magazine and was to be held in Miami in March.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">He further found that the trade press reflected \u201cthe clear distinction\u201d between the two shows. In finding that exhibitors and attendees had a \u201cclear choice as to whether or not to attend both shows, neither show, or one show,\u201d the master found this choice to be \u201caffected by one or more of the significant differences between the shows.\u201d User never implied it was con-1 tinuing INTERFACE shows but candidly stated that DATACOMM \u201976 would contain essential ingredients of what had become identified with prior shows.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b787-7\"> DCI\u2019s arguments concerning so-called \u201creverse passing off\u2019 are equally inapplicable.

The master found that, when Capitol Bank foreclosed, it took possession of all the assets, which presumably included those of both Trends and DCI. Even assuming that a copy of the circulation list was indeed an asset of DCI, it would appear that after foreclosure the list belonged to the bank.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b795-6\"> DCI and Adelson contend that User\u2019s claim for relief under c. 93A, \u00a711, must fail as \u00a7 11 requires proof of loss of money or property and the master\u2019s findings demonstrate that no damages resulted from the acts allegedly violative of the statute. We need state no more than that the master found and awarded damages, which we have upheld, of $4,000 concerning DCI\u2019s wrongful use of the circulation list and $15,000 for lost income largely resulting from the facts giving rise to a finding of abuse of process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b796-7\"> No question is raised regarding the propriety of awarding attorney\u2019s fees as an element of damages in conversion.

Although User would not ordinarily be entitled to such an award, it is not necessary to amend the judgment since we have concluded that User is entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under G.

User focuses on the portion of the statute which reads \u201cthe <em>court may determine, </em>after a hearing, as a separate and distinct finding, that all or substantially all of the claims . . . were wholly insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith. <em>The court </em>shall include in such finding the specific facts and reasons on which the finding is based\u201d (emphasis added).
