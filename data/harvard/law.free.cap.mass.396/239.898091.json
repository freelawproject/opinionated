(Warner) of local tax assessments made by the assessors of Everett for fiscal years 1980 and 1981 on personal property contained in Warner\u2019s cable television system. We agree with Warner, on its appeal from the board\u2019s decision, that its cables over public ways are not subject to local taxation, but we reject Warner\u2019s argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>that converters placed in subscribers\u2019 homes are also free from local taxation. We reject the assessors\u2019 contentions in their appeal that no substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s finding of the rates of depreciation to use in valuing Warner\u2019s property according to the \u201creproduction cost new less depreciation\u201d approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">1. The board improperly ruled that the cables that comprise Warner\u2019s distribution system over public ways were subject to local taxation. The board relied on G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Sixteenth (2) (1984 ed.), a clause which, along with others in \u00a7 5, states what property is exempt from local taxation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The fact that certain property, such as wires and aerial cables, may not be exempted from local taxation under \u00a7 5, Sixteenth (2), does not by itself make that property subject to assessment. Similarly, the provision that \u201c[a]ll property, real and personal, situated within the commonwealth . . . unless expressly exempt\u201d (G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 2 [1984 ed.]) is subject to taxation does not make nonexempt property assessable without statutory direction as to whom and by whom it is to be assessed. See <em>Squantum Gardens, Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Quincy, </em>335 Mass. 440, 446-448 (1957); P. Nichols, Taxation in Massachusetts 228 (3d ed. 1938) (\u201c[N]o property can lawfully be taxed unless the statutes further define the place where and the person to whom it is to be assessed\u201d). The statutory provisions that appear only to define the place of assessment and the person to be assessed do, in fact, determine what property is taxable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The assessors seek to justify their assessment of Warner\u2019s distribution system over public ways as \u201cmachinery used in the conduct of the business.\u201d G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 18, Second (1984 ed.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board rightly rejected this contention, saying that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\u201cunder our tax laws, poles and wires, among others, are distinct subject matters of taxation and are taxed, if at all, as \u2018poles and wires\u2019 and not as \u2018machinery used in the conduct of the business. \u2019 \u201d We reject any suggestion that Warner\u2019s entire cable television system is one great machine used in the conduct of its business. The concept of \u201cone great integral machine\u201d was first applied in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lowell Gas Light Co., </em>12 Allen 75, 78 (1866), to make the \u201centire apparatus by which gas is manufactured and distributed\u201d taxable as \u201cmachinery employed in any branch of manufactures.\u201d Gen. Stats, c. 11, \u00a7 12, Second (1860). The concept of one great machine was reluctantly extended to an electric distribution system in <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>334 Mass. 549, 565 (1956). We would not extend it beyond the manufacturing context.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Almost forty years ago, in a case involving property of a telephone company, this court considered G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 18, Fifth (Ter. Ed.), which provided for local assessments of \u201c[Underground conduits, wires and pipes laid in public ways, . . . and poles, underground conduits and pipes, together with the wires thereon or therein, laid in or erected upon private property.\u201d We concluded that clause Fifth \u201cmakes no provision for the taxation of poles with the wires thereon erected on public ways but taxes only those located on private property.\u201d <em>Assessors of Springfield </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>321 Mass. 186, 194 (1947). There has been no statutory amendment or addition to alter that conclusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">2. The board correctly concluded that converters placed in subscribers\u2019 homes are \u201cmachinery used in the conduct of the business\u201d and are not \u201cstock in trade.\u201d Pursuant to G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Sixteenth (2), machinery, other than stock in trade, used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>in the conduct of a business is subject to local taxation. The board found that \u201cthe function of the converter is to enable the subscriber to select any one of [thirty-six] cable television channels made available by the appellant\u2019s cable TV system.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The word \u201cmachinery\u201d in \u00a7 5, Sixteenth (2), has not acquired a specialized meaning. <em>Assessors of Brockton </em>v. <em>Brockton Olympia Realty Co., </em>322 Mass. 351, 355 (1948). Any \u201cmechanical device which can fairly be said to be a machine must be treated as \u2018machinery\u2019 under the statute.\u201d <em>Assessors of Haverhill </em>v. <em>J.J. Newberry Co., </em>330 Mass. 469, 472 (1953) (cash registers, syrup dispensers, and typewriters [among others] taxable as machines). Accordingly, we have accepted a broad definition of machinery: \u201cany combination of mechanical means designed to work together so as to effect a given end.\u201d <em>Collector of Taxes </em>v. <em>Cigarette Serv. Co., </em>325 Mass. 162, 165 (1950), quoting <em>Assessors of Brockton, supra </em>at 355 (cigarette vending machines taxable). The board was fully warranted in concluding that converters are \u201cmachinery\u201d within the common understanding of the word and that converters are within the general range of items this court has ruled to be machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Warner\u2019s converters are not \u201cstock in trade\u201d exempt from local taxation. The words \u201cstock in trade\u201d in \u00a7 5, Sixteenth (2), have been given a narrow meaning. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Mac-Gray Co., </em>371 Mass. 825, 827 (1977). See <em>Collector of Taxes </em>v. <em>Cigarette Serv. Co., supra </em>at 166. The board found that the converters were not for lease; that Warner\u2019s \u201cstock in trade,\u201d if it had one, was the sale of the right to select and view cable television programs; and that converters allowed the subscriber to choose any of Warner\u2019s programs. The arrangements with subscribers by which converters are placed in homes are made, therefore, solely to create access to the product Warner is selling. See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Mac-Gray Co., supra </em>at 828 (coin-aper-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>ated washing machines and dryers taxable); <em>Collector of Taxes </em>v. <em>Cigarette Serv. Co., supra </em>at 166. See also <em>Ultronic Syss. Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>355 Mass. 284, 288 (1969) (machinery principally involved in processing information, the taxpayer\u2019s stock in trade, not exempt).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">3. In their appeal, the assessors \u2019 sole challenge to the board\u2019s determination of the value of Warner\u2019s taxable personal property asserts the absence of reliable evidence of depreciation rates to apply to the reproduction cost of that property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This argument must fail because the board found, on ample evidence, that the depreciation rates employed were those Warner ordinarily used both in its corporate balance sheets and in regulatory rate proceedings. Particularly because the assessors made no effective challenge to Warner\u2019s evidence of depreciation rates, either by cross-examination or by direct evidence, the record unquestionably has substantial evidence to support the board\u2019s determination of those rates. See <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456,466 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">4. These proceedings are remanded to the board for a determination in light of this opinion of the fair cash value of Warner\u2019s personal property subject to local taxation. Such a determination could be made by eliminating the value of wires and cables over public ways from the values previously determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\"> This clause in relevant part exempts from local taxation all property owned by foreign corporations, as defined in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30, \u201cother than the following: \u2014 real estate, poles, underground conduits, wires and pipes, and machinery used in the conduct of the business, which term, as used in this clause, shall not be deemed to include stock in trade . . ..\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b256-8\"> Neither the board nor the- assessors in their brief have relied on the introductory language of \u00a7 18 or on \u00a7 18, First, to justify the city\u2019s right to assess Warner\u2019s aerial distribution system located over public ways.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\"> The board erroneously sought to distinguish the <em>Springfield </em>case and to avoid the implications of G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 18, Fifth, which, the board acknowledged, made no provision for taxing wires on public ways. The board stated that Warner is a foreign corporation governed by G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Sixteenth (2) (which does not exempt poles and wires of a foreign corporation), and that in the <em>Springfield </em>case the telephone company was not governed by such a provision. The distinction is unimportant. The telephone company was governed by comparable language in G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Sixteenth, as appearing in St. 1941, c. 467.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The board further found: \u201cIt is connected to the appellant\u2019s cable television system by means of a drop cable and attached to the subscriber\u2019s television set. The television set is tuned to Channel 3 and remains on that channel; and by means of a switch and a row of buttons on the converter the subscriber may select the cable television channel of his choice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\"> The assessors\u2019 challenge to Warner\u2019s statistical estimate of the amount of cable over public ways leading from poles to residences (so- called \u201cdrop cable\u201d) is premature. Because it upheld the taxation of all wires and cables the board did not reach the question, as it now must, of what portion of Warner\u2019s cables is over public ways and what portion is not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
