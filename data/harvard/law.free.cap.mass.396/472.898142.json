L. c. 234A, \u00a7 4 (1984 ed.), that jurors speak and understand English and that a jury be composed wholly of citizens of the United States. The defendants also challenge the notice to prospective jurors on the ground that that notice deprived the defendants of their right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">The defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss raising these issues were denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant Acen was tried and convicted on two indictments charging distribution of cocaine, and the defendant Penabriel was tried and convicted of attempted robbery (unarmed). The appeals were consolidated for purposes of briefing and oral argument in the Appeals Court. We granted Penabriel\u2019 s application for direct appellate review and transferred the Acen case to this court on our own motion. We affirm the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">1. <em>Trial by jury de medietate linguae. </em>Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights entitles the defendants to \u201cjudgment of [their] peers, or [by] the law of the land.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>defendants argue that art. 12 affords them the right to a trial by jury de medietate linguae<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and therefore that the statutory requirements of citizenship and command of English are unconstitutional.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Article 12 is directly drawn from Magna Charta, c. 39, which reads<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that \u201cno freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his freehold, or liberties, or free customs, or be outlawed or exiled, or other wise destroyed; nor will we not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.\u201d <em>Whitcomb\u2019s Case, </em>120 Mass. 118, 120 (1876) (Gray, C.J.). See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>8 Gray 329, 342-343 (1857). To say that art. 12 is derived from Magna Charta, however, is not to say that our Constitution incorporates the precise rights and privileges imposed upon King John by the nobles at Runnymede. Were that the case, judgment by one\u2019s peers would be an impossible attainment in our more egalitarian society, since the term \u201cpeer\u201d at the time of Magna Charta did not refer to all Englishmen.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>we look at the words of art. 12 not \u201cas a newly invented phrase, first used by the makers of our constitution; but we are to look at it as the adoption of one of the great securities of private right, handed down to us among the liberties and privileges which our ancestors enjoyed at the time of their emigration, and claimed to hold and retain as their birthright.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Robbins, supra </em>at 342. Thus from Magna Charta did we receive the great fundamental principles of due process and trial by jury. <em>See Rochin v. California, </em>342 U.S. 165,168-172 (1952); <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>New Orleans, </em>96 U.S. 97, 101-102 (1877); <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Utah, </em>170 U.S. 343, 347-348 (1898); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Robbins, supra </em>at 342-343. Whatever else may be said of a jury de medietate linguae, its relative obscurity alone demonstrates it is not among those great fundamental principles. It is also clear that this form of trial was not derived from Magna Charta.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u201cThe jury <em>de medietate linguae, </em>anciently allowed in England for the trial of an alien, was expressly authorized by statute . . . .\u201d <em>Ex parte Virginia, </em>100 U.S. 339, 369 (1879) (Field, J., dissenting). Justice Field referred, implicitly, to 28 Edw. III, c. 13 (1354) which provided the privilege of a trial by jury de medietate linguae to all aliens.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is clear, however, that although 1353 is considered the traditional date of the inception of such a privilege, its lineage is considerably older.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>practice endured throughout some 500 years until finally repealed by 33 Vict. c. 14 (1870).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The statutory right to trial by jury de medietate linguae was therefore an infrequently used part of the common law of England, around the time of the formation of this Commonwealth. See <em>Respublica </em>v. <em>Mesca, </em>1 U.S. (1 Dall.) 73 (Pa. 1783); <em>State </em>v. <em>Antonio, </em>11 N.C. 200 (1825); <em>People </em>v. <em>McLean, </em>2 Johns. 381 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1807) (citing English trials by jury de medietate linguae).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Some early cases from other American jurisdictions recognized the right although no case since <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wood, 299 </em>U.S. 123, 145 (1936) (which held in dictum that the \u201cancient rule\u201d of trial by jury de medietate linguae \u201cno longer obtains\u201d under the Sixth Amendment), has acknowledged its existence. See <em>Respublica </em>v. <em>Mesca, supra; People </em>v. <em>McLean, supra; United States </em>v. <em>Cartacho, 25 </em>F. Cas. 312 (C.C.D. Va. 1823) (No. 14,738); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carnot, 25 </em>F. Cas. 297 (C.C.D.C. 1824) (No. 14,726). See also LaRue, A Jury of One\u2019s Peers, 33 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 841, 850 &amp; n.29 (1976). Cf. 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *360-361. Even where the right has been found to exist, some jurisdictions have limited its applicability. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Antonio, supra. </em>Cf. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>38 Va. (11 Leigh) 690 (1841) (use of trial by jury de medietate linguae held discretionary). See also <em>Respublica </em>v. <em>Mesca, supra </em>at 75.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> No modem court has found the right to be of constitutional magnitude, and we decline to do so here. Even if we assume that the right was adopted as part of the common law of Massachusetts<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>II, c. 6, art. 6, of the Massachusetts Constitution) and has not fallen into desuetude<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or lapsed for lack of applicability to current conditions, the Legislature could preempt and abrogate the common law rule by G. L. c. 234A, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">2. <em>Claims under art. 12. </em>In the alternative, the defendants rely on our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aponte, </em>391 Mass. 494, 507 (1984), for the proposition that a \u201cdefendant is constitutionally entitled to a jury selection process free of discrimination against his grouping in the community.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 478, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>364 Mass. 87, 92 (1973). In order to prevail in such a claim a defendant must demonstrate that he is a member of a \u201cprotected class.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aponte, supra </em>at 506-508. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, supra </em>at 486 (\u201cparticular, defined groupings in the community\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bastarache, </em>382 Mass. 86, 101 (1980). The defendants assert that individ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>uals who cannot speak English and noncitizens form discrete groups within the community deserving of art. 12 protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aponte, supra </em>at 507, we stated that \u201c[t]he groups which art. 12 protects and which cannot form the basis for juror exclusion are the same classes referred to in art. 1 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bastarache, supra </em>at 101; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, supra </em>at 486 n.29, 488-489.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendants do not base their claim of discrimination on membership in any such class. Their art. 12 discrimination claims therefore cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">3. <em>The Federal law claims. </em>In <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>419 U.S. 522, 526-531, 538 (1975), and <em>Duren </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>439 U.S. 357, 359 (1979), the United States Supreme Court held that a criminal defendant has the right, under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, to \u201ca petit jury selected from a fair-cross-section of the community.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Duren </em>v. <em>Missouri, supra </em>at 364, created a three-part test for establishing a prima facie violation of the fair cross section requirement of the Sixth Amendment: (1) the group must be a \u201cdistinctive\u201d group in the community; (2) the venires must not fairly and reasonably represent the proportion of such persons in the community; and (3) such underrepresentation must result from systematic exclusion of the group when juries are selected. The showing of a prima facie violation of the fair-cross-section requirement does not end the inquiry: the State may rebut the prima facie case, if \u201ca significant state interest\u201d is \u201cmanifestly and primarily advanced by those aspects of the jury-selection process . . . that result in the disproportionate exclusion of a distinctive group.\u201d <em>Duren </em>v. <em>Missouri, supra </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>at 367-368.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 challenges fail under <em>Duren </em>and <em>Taylor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">a. <em>The non-English speaking requirement. </em>In acknowledging the existence of the fair-cross-section requirement, the Court pointed out in <em>Taylor, supra </em>at 538, that the States retain \u201cbroad discretion\u201d and \u201cremain free to prescribe relevant qualifications for their jurors and to provide reasonable exemptions.\u201d Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Brown, </em>121 Mass. 69, 78 (1876). It is unquestionable that an ability to speak English is a relevant and important qualification for jurors. No court has ever held that \u201cnon-English speaking persons\u201d form a distinct or protected class. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>288 F. Supp. 957, 962-966 (D.P.R. 1968). In fact, the weight of authority is to the contrary. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Armsbury, </em>408 F. Supp. 1130, 1135 (D. Or. 1976), the court held that under the Sixth Amendment and the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968 (28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1861 et seq.): \u201cGroups based solely on language, residency, or citizenship are not cognizable.\u201d The earlier case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mirabal Carrion, </em>140 F. Supp. 226, 230-231 (D.P.R. 1956), likewise found no exclusion of a \u201ccohesive or representative group\u201d under a Federal grand jury requirement, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 867 (1982), which excluded non-English speaking persons from the grand jury list.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olivo, </em>369 Mass. 62, 72 (1975), we held that those who are unable to read English are not a suspect class under the equal protection clause. That reasoning applies to the Sixth Amendment as well.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It remains true that \u201ca group might constitute a \u2018distinctive\u2019 group in the community for Sixth Amendment purposes but not [be] an \u2018identifiable\u2019 group for equal protection purposes\u201d because of the broader scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>of Sixth Amendment protections. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bastarache, </em>382 Mass. 86, 97 (1980). But under both the equal protection clause and the Sixth Amendment, the policy favoring an exclusion of non-English speaking persons is the same. \u201cEnglish is the language of this country. This conception is fundamental in the administration of all public affairs.\u201d <em>Conners </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>209 Mass. 111, 119 (1911).See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olivo, supra </em>at 72-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Even if we assumed, arguendo, that non-English speaking persons were a \u201cdistinct\u201d class, there would be no doubt that a significant interest would be \u201cmanifestly and primarily\u201d advanced by such an exclusion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The courts that have considered the problem have found that the requirement that conduct of judicial affairs be in English is both reasonable and important. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Benmuhar, </em>658 F.2d 14, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1981); <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>United States, </em>255 F.2d 9, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1958); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mirabal Carrion, supra. </em>As the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico announced in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Valentine, supra </em>at 964, \u201cit is difficult to conceive how this court could remain a viable part of the federal judicial system if proceedings here were conducted in Spanish.\u201d \u201cIn any other district court, the contention would be too patently frivolous to require an answer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 962. As we noted in <em>Olivo, supra </em>at 73, \u201c[tjhis is not an officially multilingual country,\u201d and we take notice of the fact that English is and has been the primary language of the Commonwealth since its inception.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">b. <em>Noncitizenship. </em>In <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Jury Comm\u2019n of Greene County, </em>396 U.S. 320, 332 (1970), the Supreme Court stated in dictum that \u201cStates remain free to confine the selection [of jurors] to citizens.\u201d The courts that have considered that issue have been in accord. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gordon-Nikkar, </em>518 F.2d 972, 976-977 (5th Cir. 1975). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Armsbury, supra </em>at 1135. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>370 F. Supp. 134, 138 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>(D. Md. 1974), aff\u2019d, 426 U.S. 917 (1976). <em>Rubio </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>24 Cal. 3d 93, 101 (1979). We agree, and find G. L. c. 234A withstands the constitutional challenges raised here under both the Sixth Amendment and the equal protection clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">For purposes of the equal protection clause it is settled that most classifications based on alienage are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Bernal </em>v. <em>Fainter, </em>467 U.S. 216, 219-220 &amp; n.5 (1984). <em>In re Griffiths, </em>413 U.S. 717, 721 (1973). <em>Sugarman </em>v. <em>Dougall, </em>413 U.S. 634, 642 (1973). <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 372 (1971). However, an exception to that rule exists for \u201cpolitical function[s].\u201d <em>Bernal </em>v. <em>Fainter, supra </em>at 220. See <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Connelie, </em>435 U.S. 291, 297 (1978); <em>Ambach </em>v. <em>Norwick, </em>441 U.S. 68, 78-79 (1979); <em>Cabell </em>v. <em>Chavez-Salido, </em>454 U.S. 432, 439-441 (1982). Laws which \u201cexclude aliens from positions intimately related to the process of democratic self-government,\u201d are not subject to strict scrutiny. <em>Bernal </em>v. <em>Fainter, supra </em>at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Although the exception is \u201cnarrow,\u201d <em>Bernal </em>v. <em>Fainter, supra, </em>the Court has found police officers, public school teachers, and probation officers to be so related. <em>Id. </em>at 220. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Connelie, supra. Ambach </em>v. <em>Norwick, supra. Cabell </em>v. <em>Chavez-Salido, supra. </em>In <em>Foley, supra </em>at 296, the Court stated in dictum that a State may deny aliens the right to vote or to run for office \u201cfor these lie at the heart of our political institutions . . . [and] [s]imilar considerations support a legislative determination to exclude aliens from jury service.\u201d Jury service clearly lies at the heart of Anglo-Saxon democratic self-government and falls within the <em>Bernal </em>political function exception. See <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Smith, supra </em>at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Even though minimum scrutiny is all that is required in this case, G. L. c. 234A could withstand even the heightened scrutiny imposed by the fair-cross-section requirement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Both <em>Perkins </em>and <em>Gordon-Nikkar. </em>upheld similar statutes under strict scrutiny analysis. That rationale is at once compelling and obvious: jury service demands loyalty to this country and its laws as well as knowledge of and familiarity with its customs. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gordon-Nikkar, supra. Perkins </em>v. <em>Smith, supra. </em>See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Armsbury, supra </em>at 1134. Resident aliens often have allegiance to this Commonwealth and the country, and could be competent to sit on juries. See <em>Perkins, supra </em>at 138. Yet it is undeniable that some aliens do not possess these requisite attributes and jury service is too critical to the just operation of the court system to place it in the hands of those who are not able to carry out the duties of such service. The naturalization process requires citizens to demonstrate loyalty and competence for the duties of citizenship generally, and any other test of loyalty and competence would either be ineffective or would \u201cundercut the efficiency and significance of existing procedures.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\"><em>4. The notice of juror qualification requirements. </em>The defendants claim prejudice in the mailing of the juror qualification notice. On this issue they do not rely on the equal protection clause or the fair-cross-section requirement, but instead assert a denial of \u201cfundamental fairness.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The basis of the defendants\u2019 claim is their assertion that the notice prejudices the jury pool by suggesting that noncitizens and non-English speaking persons are \u201cunqualified\u201d to be jurors in some pejorative sense, which thereby prejudices defendants who are in those groups. The notice does juxtapose various disqualifications which might carry such overtones, e.g., minority, previous criminality, or insanity. But the notion that such a notice to potential jurors would so prejudice them against those classes which are excluded from service as to deprive them of a fair trial is unfounded. Jurors presumably will under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>stand that minors or individuals over age seventy, for example, are not to be judged in their trials by virtue of their affiliation with their groups. While it might be helpful if the notice pointed out that groups disqualified for jury service are not unequal before the law in other respects, it was not error to omit such a provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The motions to dismiss were denied correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Appendix.

See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>393 Mass. 150, 167 (1984).

Thus, the term \u201cpeers\u201d referred to only a specific group of Englishmen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b491-12\"> That statute broadened the privilege granted in 1353 to alien merchants, 27 Edw. III, st. 2, c. 8, to all aliens. See LaRue, A Jury of One\u2019s Peers, 33 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 841, 850 (1976). Cf. note 8, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b491-13\"> As early as 1201, King John granted special consideration to Jews of England in a \u201cCharter of Liberties\u201d which provided, in part, \u201cif a Christian shall have a cause of action against a Jew, let him be tried by the Jew\u2019s peers.\u201d LaRue, <em>supra </em>at 849. See McKechnie, <em>supra </em>at 269, 439-440. Although that grant predated the rise of juries in criminal trials, see J.H. Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History 64 (1979), there is evidence of such a jury in a criminal trial in 1278. See LaRue, <em>supra </em>at 849.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b492-6\"> During the reign of Henry V, a general statute was passed which specified juror qualifications. Though that statute made no mention of the right to trial by jury de medietate linguae, the courts decided that 28 Edw. III, c. 13, had been repealed. LaRue, <em>supra </em>at 859. 8 Hen. VI, c. 29, reaffirmed that statute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Antonio, </em>11 N.C. 200, 204 (1825).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\"> Chief Justice McKean applied 28 Edw.

But he wrote, \u201cif this were a new case the judgment of the court would be different; for, the reasons which gave rise to the 28 Edw. 3. do not apply to the present government, nor to the general circumstances of the country.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\"> We are aware of no reported Massachusetts decision which indicates that a trial by jury de medietate linguae was granted, or even considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>in any case. It is clear that even at an early point in Massachusetts history \u2014 during the colonial and provincial periods \u2014 there were laws extant which limited juries strictly to freeholders or freemen and inhabitants. Colony Laws c. 61, \u00a7 1 (1634); Province Laws c. 5, \u00a7 9 (1692); Province Laws c. 61, \u00a7 5 (1699). Ancient Charters 144-145, 221, 332 (1814). Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Antonio, supra </em>at 214-215 (Taylor, C.J., dissenting) (freehold qualification for jurors, standard at common law, does not abrogate the right to trial by jury de medietate linguae).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">However, Colony Laws c. 98, \u00a7 4 (1641), entitled, \u201cActs Respecting Trials\u201d provided: \u201cAlso children, idiots, distracted persons, and all that are strangers or new comers to our plantation, shall have such allowances, and dispensations in any case, whether criminal or others, as religion and reason require.\u201d Ancient Charters 199 (1814). There is no reason to believe, however, that that provision was intended to cover a situation like a trial by jury de medietate linguae. The development of strangers\u2019 courts is also unrelated.
