On October 11, 1984, the Board of Registration of Chiropractors (board) suspended Langlitz\u2019s license to practice chiropractic medicine for a period of sixty days.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff appealed to a single justice of this court pursuant to G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64 (1984 ed.), and G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1984 ed.), seeking review of his suspension and injunctive relief. The single justice reserved and reported the case, without decision, for determination by the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">Langlitz placed an advertisement in the 1983 \u201cyellow pages\u201d section of the Springfield telephone directory. On October 3,</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">1983, the board issued an order to show cause why Langlitz\u2019s license should not be revoked or suspended by reason of this advertisement. The board held an adjudicatory hearing in May, 1984, at which Langlitz was present and represented by counsel. Five months later, the board issued its decision suspending Langlitz\u2019s license. The board concluded that Langlitz, in his advertisement, offered treatment beyond the scope of his expertise and the statutory definition of \u201cchiropractic,\u201d G. L. c. 112, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\u00a7 89 (1984 ed.); that he offered therapies independent of chiropractic care, and not supportive thereof, in violation of G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 89, and 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 4.03 and 4.10 (1983); that he advertised in a misleading and deceptive manner, in violation of 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.11; and that he engaged in misrepresentation and deceit, in violation of 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Langlitz argues on appeal that (1) the board\u2019s procedures deprived him of due process of law as guaranteed by the United States Constitution and Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; and (2) the board\u2019s findings were unsupported by substantial evidence. We conclude that the decision of the board should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">1. <em>Due Process Claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Langlitz argues that the board\u2019s proceeding against him denied him due process of law. He contends that his due process rights were denied because the board failed to provide him with adequate notice of the charges against him; amended the allegations against him after all the evidence had been heard; and earlier refused to render an advisory ruling on the propriety of the advertisement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the board\u2019s actions did not violate Langlitz\u2019s rights to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Fundamental considerations of fairness require that administrative decisions involving licenses to engage in lawful occupations be made after a reasonable opportunity for a hearing. See <em>Milligan </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>348 Mass. 491, 495 (1965). G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (1984 ed.). \u201cDue process requires that, in any proceeding to be accorded finality, notice must be given that is reasonably calculated to apprise an interested party of the proceeding and to afford him an opportunity to present his case.\u201d <em>LaPointe </em>v. <em>License Bd. of Worcester, </em>389 Mass. 454, 458 (1983). <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Medicine, </em>378 Mass. 519, 522 n.5 (1979). See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number><em>Konstantopoulos v. Whately, </em>384 Mass. 123, 135 (1981); G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (1) (1984 ed.). While constitutional principles require administrative procedures to be reasonable and to comply with the requirements of \u201cnatural justice and fair play,\u201d <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>License Comm\u2019rs of Quincy, </em>308 Mass. 142, 146 (1941); <em>Marmer </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Chiropractors, </em>358 Mass. 13, 16 (1970), such hearings need not comport with any particular form. See <em>Higgins, supra </em>at 145-146; <em>Foster from Gloucester, Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council of Gloucester, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 284, 291 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The board\u2019s order to show cause and notice of hearing adequately informed Langlitz of the charges against him. In its order to show cause, the board advised Langlitz in unambiguous language that it would examine whether the content of his telephone directory advertisement violated G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 89, and board regulations, 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 4.03, 4.09, 4.10, and 4.11. The notice of hearing subsequently issued by the board advised Langlitz of the time and place for the hearing. Due process does not require that notices of administrative proceedings \u201cbe drafted with the certainty of a criminal pleading,\u201d as long as the notice is sufficient for persons whose rights may be affected to understand the substance and nature of the grounds upon which they are called to answer. <em>Higgins, supra </em>at 145, 146, and cases cited. Langlitz was provided sufficient information to prepare and present his case through the order to show cause and the hearing notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Langlitz contends that the board improperly refused to supplement its order and notice and to provide him with detailed information relative to the charges against him. Due process does not require an administrative agency to provide interested parties with a detailed description of evidence it intends to introduce at a disciplinary hearing. <em>LaPointe, supra </em>at 458. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>311 Mass. 21, 25 (1942) (in criminal proceeding bill of particulars not required to set forth evidence which Commonwealth will present at trial); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giacomazza, </em>311 Mass. 456, 461 (1942) (same). Further, if Langlitz was surprised by, or unprepared to respond to, any of the grounds for discipline raised by the board at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>hearing, he could have requested a continuance or the opportunity to present additional evidence and argument after the hearing. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (1). <em>Foster from Gloucester, supra </em>at 290. As Langlitz did not make any such request, he is in no position to challenge the suspension of his license. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Langlitz contends that the board amended the allegations against him after all the evidence had been heard. See <em>In re Ruffalo, </em>390 U.S. 544, 551 (1968). This claim is without merit. Langlitz had notice that his advertisement in the telephone directory was the primary subject of the disciplinary proceeding. The board did not base its findings on any activity not mentioned in the advertisement, nor did it base its decision to discipline Langlitz on any statute or regulation not referred to in the order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Langlitz argues that his suspension violates fundamental principles of fairness, because he requested, and was denied, an advisory ruling regarding the propriety of his advertisement. On November 8, 1982, Langlitz, by his attorney, forwarded a draft of the proposed advertisement to the board, requesting that the board review its contents to determine if any representations made therein were deceptive or misleading. By letter dated November 30, 1982, the board notified Langlitz that it \u201cdoes not act as an approving authority for advertising,\u201d and indicated that \u201cresponsibility for placing advertisements\u201d in accordance with 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.11 \u201clies solely with the doctor placing the ads.\u201d Langlitz argues that the board\u2019s refusal to grant an advisory ruling precludes it from later imposing sanctions based upon the content of the same advertisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">To the extent that Langlitz advances an estoppel argument, we are \u201creluctant to apply principles of estoppel to public entities where to do so would negate requirements of law intended to protect the public interest.\u201d <em>Holahan </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>394 Mass. 186, 191 (1985), quoting <em>Phipps Prods. Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>387 Mass. 687, 693 (1982). See <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Medicine, </em>378 Mass. 519, 527 (1979) (revocation of physician\u2019s license not penal, but designed to protect public health, welfare, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>safety). To the extent that Langlitz\u2019s argument rests on due process considerations, we think that the board\u2019s discipline of Langlitz after denying his request for an advisory ruling did not violate \u201cfundamental considerations of fairness.\u201d <em>Milligan, supra </em>at 495. Under 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.09, the board is authorized, but not required, to render advisory rulings in appropriate cases. It was not unreasonable for the board to require Langlitz, as a licensed professional, to exercise his own judgment in accordance with the board\u2019s regulations and the specific proscriptions of \u00a7 4.11. The board was not prevented from disciplining Langlitz by his unsuccessful attempt to gain prior approval of the advertisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">2. <em>Substantial Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Langlitz argues that the decision of the board is unsupported by substantial evidence and therefore must be set aside. The scope of review under the State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1984 ed.), is circumscribed. <em>Trustees of Forbes Library </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>384 Mass. 559, 568 (1981). We must uphold the decision of the board where, considering the entire record, its findings are supported by substantial evidence. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) <em>(e). Costello </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>391 Mass. 527, 539 (1984). Under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6), substantial evidence is defined as \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d See <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>383 Mass. 299, 304 (1981); <em>Maddocks </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>369 Mass. 488, 495 (1976). Applying this standard of review, we conclude that the decision of the board must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Evidence presented on behalf of the board at the hearing consisted of five exhibits: a copy of Langlitz\u2019s advertisement as it appeared in the telephone directory; the board\u2019s order to show cause; Langlitz\u2019s answer; a letter from Langlitz\u2019s counsel requesting a speedy hearing; and the board\u2019s notice of hearing. Both parties requested the hearing examiner to take administrative notice of the board\u2019s regulations and of the General Laws of the Commonwealth. The board presented no witnesses. Langlitz testified on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>In his advertisement, Langlitz offered \u201ccomplete chiropractic &amp; holistic health care.\u201d Included under this general heading was a list of ten specific types of treatment offered by Langlitz, including therapeutic nutrition, acupuncture, weight control, and cardiovascular analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The board concluded that Langlitz engaged in unfair and deceptive advertising, in violation of 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.11, by implying that he offered these four specific therapies independent of his chiropractic practice. By statute, G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 89, licensed chiropractors in the Commonwealth are allowed to offer certain procedures and therapies not encompassed within the statutory definition of \u201cchiropractic,\u201d as long as these therapies are \u201csupportive\u201d of, and offered as \u201csupplemental to\u201d chiropractic care.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The board concluded that Langlitz\u2019s advertisement created the false impression that weight control, therapeutic nutrition, cardiovascular analysis, and acupuncture could be received as independent treatments, without accompanying chiropractic adjustments.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The board found that Langlitz\u2019s practice of therapeutic nutrition occasionally continued as an independent therapy. Langlitz testified that on certain occasions a patient would have a chiropractic condition alleviated, and yet continue to visit his office for independent nutritional maintenance. The board concluded that such therapy exceeded the permissible scope of chiropractic practice under G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 89. In addition, the board concluded that cardiovascular analysis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>another procedure listed in the advertisement, was beyond Langlitz\u2019s actual expertise as a chiropractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The board also concluded that Langlitz engaged in misrepresentation and deceit, in violation of 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.09. The board found the term \u201cholistic health care\u201d misleading, and susceptible of falsely inducing a reader of the advertisement to seek treatment not lawfully available in the office of a chiropractor. In addition, the board found that Langlitz offered \u201cacupuncture\u201d in his advertisement, when in fact he was not qualified to practice acupuncture, and indeed admitted in his testimony that he offered only \u201celectroacupuncture therapy\u201d to his patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Langlitz contends that there was insubstantial evidence to support these findings, in the absence of expert testimony construing the board\u2019s regulations and evaluating the representations made in Langlitz\u2019s advertisement. Langlitz argues that, in the absence of such expert testimony, the board improperly substituted its own expertise for evidence in the record. See <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>383 Mass. 299, 305 (1981). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Although an agency or board may not sit as a silent witness where expert testimony is required to establish an evidentiary basis for its conclusions, <em>Arthurs, supra </em>at 310, it is free to evaluate evidence in light of its own technical expertise, and to draw inferences regarding the legal effect of the conduct at issue. <em>Id. </em>The board had taken administrative notice of its own regulations, as well as of G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 89. Both the scope of chiropractic care, and the nature of supportive procedures, are explicitly defined in these provisions. The.board also introduced a copy of Langlitz\u2019s advertisement, perhaps the most significant evidence in the case. Under these circumstances, the board merely applied a narrow set of legal standards to the specific facts on the record, in light of its own general expertise and knowledge. See <em>Vitale </em>v. <em>State Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1025, 1026 (1982). The board did not substitute its expertise for evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Next, Langlitz argues that the board was required to establish, through independent testimony, that members of the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>had actually been deceived by the advertisement. Section 4.11, 233 Code Mass. Regs., does not require such a showing. The regulation prohibits \u201cdeceptive, confusing, misleading, or unfair\u201d advertising. Advertisements which are inherently misleading or deceptive are prohibited by this provision, irrespective of any resulting harm to the public. It was not necessary, as Langlitz suggests, for the board to hear testimony from a third party that the advertisement was deceptive. The board\u2019s determination that the advertisement was inherently misleading was a matter of common experience and common sense, based on the appearance and content of the advertisement itself. See <em>Arthurs, supra </em>at 311 (board\u2019s conclusion that physician prescribed controlled substances for other than legitimate medical purposes was a reasonable inference from the evidence, based on common experience and common, sense).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Finally, Langlitz argues that 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.11, prohibiting advertising that is \u201cdeceptive, confusing, misleading, or unfair,\u201d is so vague as to violate the requirements of due process. We need not address the merits of this claim, because it was not raised by Langlitz in the proceedings before the board. As a general rule, a party is not entitled to raise an argument on appeal if the claim could have been raised, but was not raised, before the administrative agency. See <em>Albert </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the City of Boston, </em>388 Mass. 491, 493 (1983). This principle applies to constitutional challenges to an agency\u2019s decision, including \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d arguments. <em>Gurry </em>v. <em>Board of Pub. Accountancy, </em>394 Mass. 118, 126 (1985). We perceive no reason to deviate from this principle in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The action is remanded to the single justice with directions to enter a judgment affirming the decision of the board suspending Langlitz\u2019s license to practice chiropractic medicine for a period of sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-14\"> The board voluntarily stayed the suspension of the plaintiff\u2019s license pending the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b392-9\"> Langlitz mentions at two points in his brief that the board also deprived him of his right to a speedy hearing. This assertion is made without citation to authority or reasoned argument. As such, it does not rise to the level of appellate argument. Cf. Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 919 (1975). <em>See </em>Commonwealth v.Amazeen, 375 Mass. 73, 84 n.9 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\"> General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 89 (1984 ed.), defines \u201cChiropractic\u201d as follows: \u201cthe science of locating, and removing interference with the transmission or expression of nerve force in the human body, by the correction of misalignments or subluxations of the bony articulation and adjacent structures, more especially those of the vertebra column and pelvis, for the purpose of restoring and maintaining health.
