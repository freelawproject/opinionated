On January 16, 1979, the minor (bom June 26,1972) and her mother commenced this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The plaintiffs on November 23, 1984, filed a motion to amend by adding as defendants the architects and engineers on an adjoining project, a school. The plaintiffs have settled their claims against the original defendants, the BHA and all other defendants with the exception of the city of Boston and J. T. Scully Constmction Corp. (they play no part in this appeal). The motion to add as defendants, Whitney, Atwood, Norcross Associates, Inc. (WAN), architects, and Borek Associates, Inc. (Borek), mechanical engineers, alleges their negligence \u201cin constructing, designing, installing, and maintaining the defective hot water system\u201d with resultant injury to the plaintiffs. The motion was allowed on January 23, 1985. The sole issue is the correctness of the allowance of this motion. We hold that it was error to allow the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 2B (1984 ed.), provides in part that \u201c[ajctions of tort for damages arising out of any deficiency or neglect in the design, planning, construction or general administration of an improvement to real property shall be commenced only within three years next after the cause of action accrues; provided, however, that in no event shall such actions be commenced more than six years after the performance or furnishing of such design, planning, constmction or general administration.\u201d The constmction of the school was commenced in 1974 and was completed in March, 1977. Though the action was commenced within three years after the cause of action accmed, the motion to add WAN and Borek was filed more than six years after the construction was completed. The plaintiffs argue that their action against WAN and Borek should not be barred. They argue that their claim is alive on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>two grounds: (1) the minority of the plaintiff operates to toll \u00a7 2B; and (2) the motion to add WAN and Borek \u201crelates back\u201d to the date of original entry of the action, which was within three years of the injury and within six years of the completion of construction. We shall treat them in this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">1. <em>Tolling of the statute. </em>By statute, if a person is a minor when a right to bring an action first accrues, the action may be commenced within the time limited in the appropriate statute of limitations reckoned from the time that the minor reaches legal age. G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 7 (1984 ed.). The plaintiffs argue that this statute tolls the running of \u00a7 2B and permits their action against WAN and Borek. They are mistaken as to the effect of \u00a7 2B. We dealt rather exhaustively with \u00a7 2B in <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>386 Mass. 701 (1982), wherein we took pains to distinguish \u00a7 2B, a statute of repose, from a statute of limitations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court spoke to this issue as follows: \u201cThis case raises the issue of the application and constitutionality of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, a statute that places a time limit on the liability of architects and contractors. General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 2B, is not a statute of limitations but a statute of repose. A statute of limitations normally governs the time within which legal proceedings must be commenced after the cause of action accrues. See, e.g., <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>381 Mass. 611, 618-619 (1980). A statute of repose, however, limits the time within which an action may be brought and is not related to the accrual of any cause of action. The injury need not have occurred, much less have been discovered. See, e.g., <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>North Bergen, </em>61 N.J. 190, 199-200 (1972). As a statute of repose, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2B, precludes recovery against those within the protection of the statute for any injury which occurs more than six years after the performance or furnishing of the design, planning, construction, or general administration of an improvement to real property.\u201d <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, supra </em>at 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number><em>Klein </em>continues on to say that though \u00a7 2B is phrased in language similar to a statute of limitations, its effect is to abolish the remedy and not merely to bar the action. <em>Klein, supra </em>at 702-703 n.3. The tolling statute, however, affects only a statute of limitations. Whatever claims the plaintiffs might have had against WAN and Borek, those claims were unenforceable in March, 1983, six years from the project\u2019s completion. Hence, when the plaintiffs sought to add WAN and Borek there existed no viable claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">This result is entirely consistent with the legislative intent to limit the duration of the liability of architects and engineers. <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Catalano, supra </em>at 709. Fairness demands that a defendant at some time should be secure in the knowledge that the \u201cslate has been wiped clean.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>North Bergen, supra </em>at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">There is support for our conclusion in other jurisdictions which have a statute of repose similar to \u00a7 2B. See <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Altus, </em>67 N.J. 106 (1975); <em>Howell </em>v. <em>Burk, </em>90 N.M. 688 (1977); <em>Mahathy </em>v. <em>Ingram, </em>584 S.W.2d 521 (Tex. Civ. App. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">2. <em>\u201cRelation back.\u201d </em>The plaintiffs argue that this motion to add WAN and Borek should \u201crelate back\u201d to the day of filing the complaint. They seek to invoke Mass. R. Civ. P. 15 (c), 365 Mass. 761 (1974), which provides: \u201cWhenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment (including an amendment changing a party) relates back to the original pleading.\u201d They argue that the \u201crelation back\u201d concept was accepted in Masachusetts even before the enactment of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure. They cite <em>Wadsworth </em>v. <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>352 Mass. 86, 88-89 (1967), in which this court approved the addition of the Boston Gas Company as a defendant at a time when an original action against Boston Gas Company would have been barred by the statute of limitations. The theory of \u201crelation back\u201d on which the court premised its holding in <em>Wadsworth, </em>the plaintiffs argue, was codified by rule 15 (c). As far as the argument goes, it appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>to be correct. However, <em>Wadsworth </em>and the other cases cited by the plaintiffs uniformly dealt with the doctrine of \u201crelation back\u201d as it is affected by a statute of limitations. The present case, as we have noted, implicates a statute of repose which is of an entirely different legal genre.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Quite recently, the Appeals Court addressed this precise question of the interplay between \u00a7 2B and rule 15 (c) (though without a minor in the picture) in <em>James Ferrera &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Samuels, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 170 (1985). Drawing heavily on <em>Klein, </em>that court noted \u201ca marked difference between a statute of limitations and a statute of repose, a difference that is important in our resolution of the issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173. Before concluding that rule 15 (c) would not permit the addition of a defendant after the period of the statute of repose had expired, that court said that \u201c[t]he bar of a statute of repose is absolute, whereas the bar of a statute of limitations is conditional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It concluded its treatment of the issue by observing that an application of the \u201crelation back\u201d doctrine \u201cwould have the effect of reactivating a cause of action that the Legislature obviously intended to eliminate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We hold that it was error to allow the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to add WAN and Borek at a time when the statute of repose had eliminated the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. The order allowing the plaintiffs to add WAN and Borek as parties is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b533-6\"> We recognize that part of \u00a7 2B is a statute of limitations, i.e., that part which provides that an action of tort for damages arising out of any \u201cdeficiency or neglect in the design .... of an improvement to real property shall be commenced only within three years next after the cause of action accrues.\u201d However, this part is not the problem in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
