Almost seven years later a Superior Court judge allowed the company\u2019s motion to dismiss under Mass. R. Civ. P. 41 (b) (2), 365 Mass. 804 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>(1974), for failure to prosecute, and judgment was thereupon entered for the company. Without seeking reconsideration or other relief from judgment, such as a rule 60 (b) motion, 365 Mass. 828 (1974), the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. The Appeals Court vacated the judgment of dismissal, in a summary order without opinion, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 1113 (1985). We allowed the company\u2019s application for further appellate review. The question before us is whether the trial judge properly exercised his discretion in dismissing the complaint for lack of prosecution. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The proceedings in Superior Court show that the plaintiffs\u2019 only affirmative prosecutorial action was the filing of their complaint. Shortly after the complaint was filed, the company moved for dismissal. A judge of the Superior Court denied that motion on October 11, 1978, and denied the company\u2019s motion for reconsideration on November 20, 1978. Thereafter, the company answered the complaint on December 26, 1978. The company initiated discovery on January 11, 1979, by propounding requests for admissions to all plaintiffs. Those requests were never answered. On that same day, the company also moved for leave to propound interrogatories to the plaintiffs. On July 19, 1982, that motion was allowed, with the plaintiffs\u2019 assent. The interrogatories were served but the plaintiffs made no timely response. After the company filed an application for dismissal under rule 33 (a), as amended, 368 Mass. 905 (1976), on September 28, 1982, the parties were able to stipulate to an enlargement of the time for filing answers to interrogatories until November 9,1982. The record indicates that at least twelve plaintiffs filed answers within that time period. On July 18, 1984, after nearly two years of inaction by the plaintiffs, the company moved to dismiss for failure to prosecute. After hearing argument, the judge granted the motion to dismiss on the ground that, in the six and one-half years since the filing of the action, the plaintiffs had not \u201cinitiated <em>any </em>prosecutorial activity whatsoever: there has been no discovery conducted by plaintiffs, no depositions, no document requests, no requests for admissions and no interrogatories, nor even an attempt to certify a class\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>The allowance or denial of a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute is committed to the judge\u2019s sound discretion.

There is no error of law amounting to an abuse of discretion simply because a reviewing court might have reached a different result; the standard of review is not substituted judgment. See <em>Castellucci </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>372 Mass. 288, 292-293 (1977); <em>Nabhan </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Salisbury, </em>12 Mass.

See <em>State Realty Co. of Boston, Inc. </em>v. <em>MacNeil Bros. Co., </em>358 Mass. 374, 379 (1970); <em>Massachusetts Gen.

Of \u201cancient origin,\u201d that power is critical to the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases and the calendar as a whole. <em>Link </em>v. <em>Wabash R.R., supra </em>at 630-631. <em>State Realty Co. of Boston, Inc., supra </em>at 379. \u201cAs with most rulings by a judge regarding the management of a case, \u2018[o]nly in rare instances can it be ruled that there has been an abuse of discretion amounting to [an] error of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Merles </em>v. <em>Lerner, </em>391 Mass. 221, 223-224 (1984), quoting <em>Bresnahan </em>v. <em>Proman, </em>312 Mass. 97, 101-102 (1942). Indeed, abuse of discretion is \u201carbitrary determination, capricious disposition, or whimsical thinking,\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>235 Mass. 482, 496 (1920), or \u201cidiosyncratic choice,\u201d <em>Berube </em>v. <em>McKesson Wine &amp; Spirits Co., 7 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 426, 433 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>(1979), quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 122 comment g (Tent. Draft No. 6, 1979). See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 74 comment g (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The decision of the Superior Court judge was not one of those rare cases. It did not rest on whimsy, caprice, or arbitrary or idiosyncratic notions. While we are mindful that dismissal is a harsh result, rule 41 (b) (2) would be ineffective if a judge were unable to exercise his discretion to dismiss a case for want of prosecution when six and one-half years had elapsed without any form of affirmative prosecutorial activity. In <em>State Realty Co. of Boston, Inc., supra, </em>we stated that: \u201cLitigants must act with reasonable diligence to bring their litigation to a final conclusion. Because of the volume of litigation pending before all levels of the judicial branch, it is essential that it devote its time and efforts to those litigants who prosecute their cases with reasonable diligence, and that it deny further consideration of cases which the litigants have unreasonably failed, neglected or refused to prosecute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 379. In that case we held that the Superior Court judge was justified in dismissing for want of prosecution a case which had sat dormant on the docket for eleven years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 378-379. Several Federal courts have acknowledged that many years of prosecutorial inactivity is sufficient to justify dismissal. See <em>Harrelson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>613 F.2d 114, 116 (5th Cir. 1980) (5 years); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Telfon Communications Corp., </em>589 F.2d 959, 967 (9th Cir. 1978) (6 years). See also <em>Jafree </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>590 F.2d 209, 211 (7th Cir. 1978). The dismissal in this case was within the proper discretion of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">\n<em>Judgment of the Superior Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b657-6\"> Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 41 (b) (2), 365 Mass. 804 (1974), provides in part, \u201c[T]he court may, <em>in its discretion, </em>dismiss any action for failure of the plaintiff to prosecute . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b658-7\"> We also held that Rule 85 of the Superior Court (1954) which provided for dismissal of cases where there was a period of four years of inaction was appropriately applied in that case. <em>State Realty Co. of Boston, Inc. </em>v. <em>MacNeil Bros.
