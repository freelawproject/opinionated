The plaintiff sought a declaration pursuant to G. L. c. 231A of the amount of underinsured motorist benefits available to Robert A. DeCenzo due to the death of his son, Ward R. DeCenzo. A Superior Court judge ruled that DeCenzo\u2019s benefits were limited to the highest amount of underinsured coverage in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>one policy. The Appeals Court affirmed. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>DeCenzo, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 973 (1984). We allowed the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review, and we also affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In February of 1979, DeCenzo\u2019s son was fatally injured while a passenger in an automobile which was within the policy definition of an underinsured motor vehicle. At that time, each of DeCenzo\u2019s three family automobiles was covered by a separate Massachusetts automobile insurance policy issued by Lum-bermens Mutual Casualty Co. (Lumbermens). Each policy provided optional underinsured coverage of up to $25,000 per person for the policyholder and members of his household.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> DeCenzo paid separate $14 premiums under each of these three policies for this coverage. DeCenzo applied to Lumbermens for $75,000, the total maximum underinsured motorist benefits under the three policies. At the time of the accident, two forms of automobile insurance policies existed, a 1978 version and a 1979 version, both containing an \u201canti-stacking\u201d provision pertaining to covering underinsurance benefits. Clause 6 of the 1978 version provides: \u201c[sjometimes two or more auto policies cover the same accident. If all the policies are with us, the most we will ordinarily pay is the highest dollar limit in any one policy.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">On appeal to this court, DeCenzo relies heavily on <em>Cardin </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>394 Mass. 450 (1985), which was not decided until after the Appeals Court rendered its decision. In <em>Cardin </em>we examined the validity under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, of the \u201cregular use exlusion\u201d in the plaintiff\u2019s uninsured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>motorist coverage and held that \u201cany exclusion to uninsured motorist coverage is contrary to the language and policy of [that statute] and is therefore unenforceable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452. We also stated that \u201c[w]e recognize that the effect of our decision will be to allow insured motorists to \u2018stack\u2019 their uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 456. DeCenzo argues that <em>Cardin </em>is dispositive of his case, suggesting that the \u201canti-stacking\u201d provisions covering underinsured motorist benefits in his motor vehicle liability policies therefore contravene G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, and so may not be given effect. See <em>Surrey </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co., </em>384 Mass. 171, 173 (1981). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Our decision in <em>Cardin </em>was compelled by our analysis of the language and policy of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, in existence in 1983. See, e.g., <em>id. </em>at 456 (\u201cWe conclude that the propriety of stacking is a policy decision best left to the Legislature, and that the strict command of the statute precludes the insurer\u2019s attempt to avoid stacking uninsured motorist coverage\u201d), and <em>id. </em>at 455 (\u201cThe statute does not refer to exclusions at all\u201d and to sanction reductions in coverage would be \u201c \u2018wholly inconsistent\u2019 with the broad remedial purpose of the statute\u201d). De-Cenzo\u2019s son\u2019s accident, however, occurred in 1979. Both the language and the policy of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, which compelled the result in <em>Cardin, </em>were different in 1979. Most significantly, underinsured motorist coverage in 1979 was <em>optional. </em>G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (1), as amended by St. 1973, c. 380. As we noted in <em>Cardin, </em>such coverage was mandatory in 1983. <em>Id. </em>at 457 n.5. G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, as amended through St. 1980, c. 532, \u00a7 1. The compulsory nature of underinsurance coverage in 1983 was essential to our reasoning in <em>Cardin. </em>See <em>id. </em>at 454-455. An additional indication of a broadening of legislative purpose between 1979 and 1983, relative to un-derinsured motorist coverage, is the fact that the definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle coverage\u201d was expanded to include underinsured motorists. G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (2), as amended through St. 1980, c. 532, \u00a7 2. See also <em>Cardin, supra </em>at 451 n.l. In 1983, insurers were required to make an offer of additional <em>underinsured </em>motorist coverage of $15,000 per person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>and $40,000 per accident. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113C, as amended through St. 1971, c. 520, \u00a7 1. In 1979, no insurer was required to make optional underinsured motorist coverage available in amounts greater than $5,000 per person or $10,000 per accident. G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, as amended by St. 1973, c. 380; G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, sixth par., as amended through St. 1976, c. 266, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In view of the above it is apparent that our refusal in <em>Cardin, supra </em>at 455, to \u201csanction reductions in coverage for which the Legislature has not provided,\u201d has no application to the case at bar. In 1979, legislative policy did not invalidate reductions or limitations on underinsured motorist coverage. See <em>Royal-Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>385 Mass. 1013 (1982) (upholds a \u201cregular use exclusion\u201d barring recovery of optional underinsured motorist benefits for a 1978 accident).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The defendant\u2019s coverage is determined by the terms of his policy and is therefore limited to the highest amount in any one policy unless one of his other arguments prevails. He argues that the \u201canti-stacking\u201d language of clause 6 does not apply because all the policies covering the accident were not with Lumbermens. Finally, he contends that the separate premiums paid for underinsured motorist coverage under each policy entitle him to a multiple recovery. For the reasons stated in the Appeals Court opinion these arguments do not prevail. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>DeCenzo, supra </em>at 974-975.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\"> DeCenzo\u2019s son was a member of his household.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b709-8\"> Clause 6 in the 1979 version provides, \u201cYou may have two or more auto policies with us covering the same claim. In that case, the most we will pay is the highest amount payable under the applicable coverage in any one of these policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">At trial there was a dispute as to whether DeCenzo knew of the terms of the 1979 version of the policy before the accident occurred. The judge did not resolve the question of which version of the policy governed, as he ruled that even under the 1978 language, which was less favorable to Lumbermens than the 1979 version, DeCenzo could only recover $25,000. At oral argument before this court, counsel for the insurer stated that Lum-bermens is now willing to rely on the 1978 policy. Accordingly, discussion of the language of clause 6 hereinafter refers to the quoted text of the 1978 policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
