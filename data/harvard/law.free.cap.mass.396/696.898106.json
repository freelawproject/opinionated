That statute, which authorizes the regulation of maximum rents of \u201ccontrolled rental units\u201d in the city of Cambridge, excludes from the definition of \u201ccontrolled rental units,\u201d all \u201crental units [as to] which a governmental unit, agency, or authority . . . regulates the rents.\u201d The defendant argues that its apartments are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and as such are exempt from rent control by the board. We conclude to the contrary and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">There are no material facts in dispute. On November 15, 1984, the defendant purchased the Crimson Court Apartments. The purchase was financed by the proceeds of a mortgage loan by Colonial Mortgage Service Company, doing business as Colonial National Mortgage Company (Colonial Mortgage). The loan to the defendant was guaranteed by HUD pursuant to \u00a7 223(f) and \u00a7 207 of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715n(f) (1982), \u00a7 1713(b)(2) (1982 &amp; Supp. H 1984). As required by HUD, the defendant agreed that the apartments be operated in accordance with HUD regulations. The regulatory agreement provides that the defendant cannot charge rents \u201cin excess of those approved in writing by the mortgagee [Colonial Mortgage] in accordance with the administrative requirements of [HUD].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In November, 1984, the defendant notified the tenants that their units were no longer subject to Cambridge rent control.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The notice offered new tenancies, with rents in excess of the maximum rents established by the board. The defendant rented at least one unit at the higher rates. The board then brought this action in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">The board sought a declaration that the apartments were subject to Cambridge rent control, and an injunction to enjoin the defendant from charging rents in excess of those approved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>by the board. Thereafter the board moved for a preliminary injunction, and the defendant moved for summary judgment. Since the parties stipulated that there was no dispute of material fact, the hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction was consolidated with a determination on the merits pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 65 (b) (2), 365 Mass. 833 (1974). In a memorandum opinion dated March 28, 1985, the judge ruled that the Crimson Court Apartments were subject to Cambridge rent control. Judgment was entered and the court granted the requested permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The Federal regulatory scheme which implements \u00a7 223 (f) and \u00a7 207 of the National Housing Act is the starting point of the analysis. First, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.17 (1985) defines an \u201celigible mortgagor\u201d under the National Housing Act as one who is \u201cregulated or restricted by [HUD] as to rents.\u201d Under the regulations, then, the defendant, as such a mortgagor, is subject to HUD regulation. The form of that regulation is specified by 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.18 (1985), which provides that (under certain conditions applicable here) the mortgagor will enter a regulatory agreement with the mortgagee for the term of the mortgage. Pursuant to that section, the defendant entered into the November 15, 1984, regulatory agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The regulatory agreement provides that rents must be approved by the mortgagee, here Colonial Mortgage, \u201cin accordance with the administrative requirements of [HUD].\u201d Title 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.19 (e) (1985) provides that: \u201cNo charge shall be made by the mortgagor for the accommodations (rents), facilities or services offered by the project<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in excess of those approved by [HUD].\u201d That section also establishes the way rents are to be calculated. In particular, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.19 (e) (3) (1985) provides for the calculation of appropriate rents when the units have been subject to rent control: \u201cAny state or local law, ordinance or regulation regulating the rents of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>projects subject to this paragraph may be preempted only as provided in Part 246 [24 C.F.R. \u00a7 246] of this chapter.\u201d Title 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 246.1 (a) (1985) provides that: \u201cThe regulation of rents from [unsubsidized<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> insured projects like the Crimson Court Apartments] is preempted under these regulations only when the Department determines that the delay or decision of the local rent control board . . . jeopardizes the Department\u2019s economic interest in a project covered by [Subpart B].\u201d The regulations further provide that local rent control levels will prevail in the normal course: \u201cThe Department will generally not interfere in the regulation of rents by a rent control board ... for unsubsidized projects with mortgages insured ... by HUD.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 246.5 (1985) [Subpart B],</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">To seek preemption under 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 246.5, a mortgagor must first apply to a local rent control board for an increase, and only then, if the increase is either not granted or is insufficient, can HUD preemption be sought. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 246.6 (a), (b) (1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After suit was filed, the defendant sought National Housing Act preemption,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> even though the board granted an increase (less than that which was sought).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The issue is whether or not HUD \u201cregulates\u201d the rents at the Crimson Court Apartments within the meaning of St. 1976, c. 36, \u00a7 3 <em>(b) </em>(3) (ii), under the Federal regulatory scheme through which HUD can choose to preempt local rent control, but only in unusual cases, and on a case-by-case basis. The defendant argues that our recent decision in <em>Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge </em>v. <em>Cambridge Tower Corp., </em>394 Mass. 809 (1985), \u201cmandates a finding that the rents at Crimson Court Apartments are regulated by HUD within the meaning of Section 3 (b) (3) (ii) of Chapter 36.\u201d To the contrary, that case supports our holding that the Crimson Court Apartments are subject to Cambridge rent control.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>First, the defendant argues that, although the applicable Federal regulations do not preempt local rent control, St. 1976, c. 36, \u00a7 3 <em>(b) </em>(3) (ii), exempts the Crimson Court Apartments because the applicable Federal regulations, and the regulatory agreement, provide that rents may be charged only in accordance with those Federal regulations. That argument, however, overlooks the obvious interplay between the Federal regulations and c. 36, \u00a7 3 <em>(b) </em>(3) (ii). The defendant essentially suggests that we construe c. 36, \u00a7 3 <em>(b) </em>(3) (ii), to mean that Federal law \u201cregulates\u201d rents even when it provides that rents shall be set by local boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In <em>Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge </em>v. <em>Cambridge Tower Corp., supra </em>at 813-815, we rejected a similarly narrow reading of the word \u201cregulates.\" In that case we held that the Federal regulations implementing \u00a7 221 (d) (4) of the National Housing Act [23 C.F.R. \u00a7 221.531 (c) (1984), see 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715/(d)(4) (1982)] did not constitute regulation within the meaning of St. 1976, c. 36, \u00a7 3 (b) (3) (ii). The prior HUD regulation [24 C.F.R. \u00a7 221.531(c) (1983)] was amended in 1983 to provide that \u201cthe mortgagor shall determine the charge for accommodations, facilities, or services offered by the project.\u201d 48 Fed. Reg. 16674 (1983). 24 C.F.R \u00a7 221.531 (c) (1984). The new regulation was specifically designed to end HUD\u2019s discretionary rent control of properties mortgaged under \u00a7 221(d)(4) of the National Housing Act. 48 Fed. Reg. 16670 (1983). See <em>Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge </em>v. <em>Cambridge Tower Corp., supra </em>at 812, 813. Amended regulation 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 221.531 (c) (5) (1984) provided that \u201c[a]ny state or local law, ordinance or regulation regulating the rents of projects subject to this paragraph may be preempted only as provided in Part 246 of this chapter [24 C.F.R. \u00a7 246 (1984)].\u201d The \u201cdispositive\u201d Federal regulations in <em>Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge, supra </em>at 813, provided that rents be set by mortgagors, subject to local rent control and subject to potential HUD preemption under Part 246.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That situation is parallel to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>the case at hand, and we follow <em>Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge </em>by holding that the applicable Federal regulatory scheme does not \u201cregulate\u201d rents in this case within the meaning of c. 36, \u00a7 3 <em>(b) </em>(3) (ii). <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Second, the defendant argues that since <em>Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge </em>v. <em>Cambridge Tower Corp. </em>held that the <em>amended </em>regulations did not \u201cregulate\u201d within the meaning of c. 36, \u00a7 3 <em>{b) </em>(3) (ii), the prior regulations, allegedly similar to those applicable here, did so \u201cregulate.\u201d The short answer is that the only issue considered in <em>Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge </em>was whether the amended regulations triggered the exemption of St. 1976, c. 36, \u00a7 3 <em>(b) </em>(3) (ii). <em>Id. </em>at 812. We did not consider the prior regulatory scheme in any comprehensive way in <em>Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge, </em>nor is anything in that holding predicated on the premise that the prior Federal regulatory scheme in fact \u201cregulated\u201d the rents. Furthermore, it is unnecessary to consider the prior regulatory scheme since the amended regulatory scheme in <em>Rent Control Bd. of Cambridge </em>tracks the one at hand so as to make that case dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-15\"> The Crimson Court Apartments consist of sixty residential units located at 375-375A Harvard Street in Cambridge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b713-8\"> Crimson Court Apartments have been subject to rent control since 1970.

The only sense in which HUD regulates rents is by providing for regulation by local rent control boards (except under unusual circumstances). The plain meaning of the word \u201cregulate\u201d does not incorporate such an arrangement. We read \u201cregulates\u201d to mean actively and affirmatively regulating.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
