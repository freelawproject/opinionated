(\u201cSouthwind\u201d) sued to collect on a contract and to seek a determination of its rights as a lien-holder and as a possible beneficiary of an insurance policy. Mistakenly characterizing this as a declaratory judgment action, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> concluded that abstention was warranted by the presence of ongoing state litigation involving the same subject matter, issues, and essentially the same parties. Accordingly, the district court dismissed Southwind\u2019s suit after applying the abstention standards for declaratory judgment actions. As Southwind seeks various forms of coercive relief, however, the correct inquiry is provided by <em>Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United </em>States<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Construction Corp.,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>under which only the clearest of justifications warrants abstention. As we conclude that the district court thus applied the wrong standard in deciding to abstain, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-16\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-17\">Southwind entered into a contract with either Bergen Acceptance Corporation (\u201cBAC\u201d) or Defendant-Appellee Bergen Aviation, Inc. (\u201cBAI\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cBergen Companies\u201d), or both, to perform certain repairs on a Douglas DC-3 aircraft.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The repairs took longer and cost more than originally anticipated. Not surprisingly, disagreements developed between Southwind and the Bergen Companies. Eventually, Southwind sent presuit notice to BAI by certified mail. In this notice, Southwind threatened to take legal action unless certain documents were received by March 5, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-18\">On March 4, 1993 \u2014 the last day before the threatened suit filing date \u2014 BAC (the other Bergen Company) filed suit preemptively in Texas state court. Two months later, BAC\u2019s state complaint was amended to add BAI as a plaintiff. In the intervening period, South-wind had filed suit in federal court against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>BAI only.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, in the state suit both BAC and BAI are plaintiffs and Southwind is the defendant; while in the federal suit South-wind is the plaintiff and BAI is the sole defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">Both the federal suit and the state suit involve claims arising out of purported breaches of the contract to repair the DC-3. In the federal suit, Southwind predicated federal subject matter jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. Southwind sued to collect on the contract, to impose a temporary injunction, and to seek a declaration of its rights as a lien-holder and as a possible beneficiary of an insurance policy. Southwind also requested attorney\u2019s fees under the applicable state statute. After inquiring into the amount-in-controversy requirement, the district court concluded that it had subject matter jurisdiction over South-wind\u2019s suit, and BAI does not challenge this conclusion on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Despite having jurisdiction, however, the district court decided to abstain. Construing Southwind\u2019s suit as a declaratory judgment action, the district court applied the abstention standards applicable to such cases. Specifically, the district court observed that\u2014 under our opinion in <em>Magnolia Marine Transport Co. v. LaPlace Towing </em>Corp.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\u2014 such abstention is appropriate when the claims of all parties may be satisfactorily adjudicated in the state court proceeding. As Southwind\u2019s and BAI\u2019s claims could be adequately resolved in the ongoing state court proceeding, the district court concluded that abstention was appropriate here. Consequently, the district court ordered dismissal of Southwind\u2019s suit, and Southwind timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-17\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-18\">We apply one of two different tests when reviewing a district court\u2019s exercise of its discretion to abstain because of the presence of ongoing parallel state litigation, depending on the substantive nature of the litigation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When a district court is considering abstaining from exercising jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action, it must apply standards derived from <em>Brillhart v. Excess Insurance Co. of America.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Brillhart </em>the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-19\">Ordinarily, it would be uneconomical as well as vexatious for a federal court to proceed in a declaratory judgment suit where another suit is pending in state court presenting the same issues, not governed by federal law, between the same parties. Gratuitous interference with the orderly and comprehensive disposition of a state court litigation should be avoided.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-20\">Consistent with <em>Brillhart, </em>abstention from a declaratory judgment action is ordinarily appropriate when the state offers an adequate alternative forum in which to resolve the particular dispute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>In contrast, when actions involve coercive relief the trial court must apply the standards enunciated by the Court in <em>Colorado </em>River<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and reaffirmed in <em>Moses H. Cone.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Although district courts likewise have \u201cdiscretion\u201d to abstain under these circumstances, such discretion is narrowly circumscribed by \u2014 as the Court stated in <em>Colorado River </em>\u2014 their \u201cvirtually unflagging obligation ... to exercise the jurisdiction given them.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Consequently, a district court should abstain under these circumstances only in the \u201cexceptional\u201d case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court reaffirmed <em>Colorado River </em>in <em>Moses H. Cone, </em>making clear that <em>Colorado River </em>states an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d test and reiterating that <em>\u201c\u2018[o]nly the clearest of circumstances will warrant dismissal.\u2019 </em>\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">In the instant case, the district court characterized Southwind\u2019s suit as a \u201cdeclaratory judgment action.\u201d Accordingly, it concluded that abstention by dismissal was appropriate as \u201call pending issues could be effectively and satisfactorily adjudicated in the state civil action.\u201d But the district court erred as a matter of law in classifying South-wind\u2019s suit as a \u201cdeclaratory judgment action.\u201d Although some of the relief sought by Southwind is declaratory in nature, South-wind also requests coercive remedies for the. breach of contract in the form of damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and injunctive relief. Inclusion of these coercive remedies indisputably removes this suit from the ambit of a declaratory judgment action.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">The district court\u2019s mistake in classifying the ease as a declaratory judgment action led it to apply the wrong standard. The court has therefore never had an opportunity to exercise its discretion regarding abstention under the appropriate standards. Consequently, we must remand this cause to the district court so that it may decide in the first instance whether abstention is warranted here in light of the appropriate standards of <em>Colorado River </em>and <em>Moses H. Cone.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">. The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge, who made findings and recommendations regarding the jurisdiction and abstention issues.
