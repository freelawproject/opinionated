(Stats. 1905, p. 28, as amended by Stats. 1907, p. 273; Stats. 1921, p. 1323.) The material issues made by the petition, and the return, are identical with those presented and considered by the court in <em>In the Matter of the Application </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number><em>of Twing, ante, </em>p. 261 [204 Pac. 1082]. Section 2 of the act, for the alleged violation of which Twing was arrested, and section 3, under which this petitioner was charged, relate to the same subject and must be construed together. So considered, what we have said in the former case applies in this. On the authority of that decision it follows that the complaint in this case, as in that, states no offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The petitioner must be discharged, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Waste, J., Shaw, C. J., Wilbur, J., Lawlor, J., Shurtleff, J., Richards, J., <em>pro tem., </em>and Sloane, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
