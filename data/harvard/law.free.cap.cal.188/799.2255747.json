We have, heretofore, had similar attacks made upon local ordinances of this character and our decisions therein are against the petitioners on all the points presented in this case with relation to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>validity of this ordinance. (See <em>In re Polizzotto, ante, </em>p. 410 [205 Pac. 676]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>54 Cal. App. 531 [202 Pac. 344]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Capelli, </em>55 Cal. App. 461 [203 Pac. 837]; <em>Ex parte Kinney, </em>53 Cal. App. 792 [200 Pac. 967], and <em>Ex parte Volpi, </em>53 Cal. App. 229 [199 Pac. 1090].)</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">The claim that the judgment is void because the intoxicating liquor was found on the premises without previously having obtained a search-warrant for the discovery thereof is answered by the decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mayen, ante, </em>p. 237 [205 Pac. 435], On the authority of these cases the petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Shaw, C.
