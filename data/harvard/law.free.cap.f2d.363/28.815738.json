'We conclude that the search was incident to a lawful arrest, and it was, therefore, legal. With respect to the contention that there had been an illegal detention before appellant was taken before a committing magistrate, it is noted that no facts were alleged in the petition that would warrant the trial court\u2019s holding a hearing on the question of voluntariness of the statement made by him to the police officers. Thus, there is no basis for a holding that appellant was deprived of any constitutional right as a result of such detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
