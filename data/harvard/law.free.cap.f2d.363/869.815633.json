The appellants averred that they were denied equal protection of the laws; that they could not enforce and were denied their equal civil rights in the County Court; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>and that they were being prosecuted for an act performed under authority of laws providing for equal rights of citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">The State of Mississippi denied the allegations in the removal petitions and moved to remand the causes to the County Court for Forrest County.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">The district court granted the motions to remand.
