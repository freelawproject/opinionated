United States, 377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed. 246.\u201d Lyles v. Beto, 379 U.S. 648, 85 S.Ct. 613, 13 L.Ed.2d 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-26\">We have reconsidered this case in light of Massiah and in light of Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653. We conclude that the opinion of the Supreme Court in Johnson and Cassidy, Petitioners, v. State of New Jersey, 1966, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882, rules this case. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>trial in this case began long before June 13, 1966, the cut off date now announced by the Supreme Court for the application of the requirement of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The only substantial issue left in this case being the question whether the eliciting of a voluntary confession from the appellant while in custody in the police station at a time when he had neither counsel nor had been advised of his right to counsel deprived him of his constitutional rights under the Sixth Amendment, that issue has now been foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
