Munich v. United States, 9 Cir., 337 F.2d 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">The government thereupon chose to tidy up its original indictment by dismissing the old one and reindicting Munich. Upon a trial Munich was convicted. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-14\">His one substantial point not really precluded by prior decisions of this court or of the Supreme Court of the United States is that at the trial the government could not produce the narcotics which Munich was charged with selling. The heroin which was the subject of the sale had been regularly destroyed or disposed of in accordance with established procedures and statutes applicable when presumptively narcotics are no longer needed as evidence. Thus, we have a corpus delicti problem, or a half brother of one.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-15\">The government produced good evidence as to nature of what Munich sold, i.e. virtually everything possible except the narcotics. The appellant claims, however, that he lost an advantage to which he was entitled. If so, in this case, it would have to be in the field of making one\u2019s own test of the substance or some phase of cross examination of a witness. The possibility of such prejudice on the facts here seems too remote.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-16\">If there were some suggestion of connivance designed to put Munich at a disadvantage, we would not hesitate to reverse. And, it would be far different from Munich\u2019s case if there had been some careless handling of the substance. But all Munich has is a fortuitous (from his standpoint) circumstance. If Scott\u2019s case (People v. Scott, 176 Cal.App.2d 458, 1 Cal.Rptr. 600) is right in principle, and we think it is, this is an a fortiori case, even though this is a \u201creal\u201d evidence case and Scott\u2019s was a \u201ccircumstantial\u201d one. The ultimate evidence in both cases was absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-17\">If one reads the transcript one finds counsel for defendant was able to make such a searching examination of the expert witnesses, handicapped as they were with no \u201ccorpus,\u201d that one\u2019s practical appraisal is that the government was at some disadvantage with the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-18\">We are fortified in our conclusion by United States v. Pullings, 7 Cir., 321 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>287. In Pullings, the defendant did have a special reason for the presence in evidence of the wrapper in which the \u201clost\u201d marijuana was originally found. Thus, Munich\u2019s is a stronger case for affirmance. See also Ware v. United States, 8 Cir., 259 F.2d 442, and Lebron v. United States, 1 Cir., 241 F.2d 885, cert. denied, 354 U.S. 911, 77 S.Ct. 1298, 1 L.Ed.2d 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Other points, ably presented, we do not find substantial. And, we conclude that there was nothing clearly erroneous with the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">The evidence was overwhelming but for the absence of the clincher: the heroin itself. And its nature was made clear by the embarrassed experts with no heroin to exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
