Hence, there might not be any opportunity for confusion by members of the general public. The question of likelihood of confusion under Section 2(d) of the statute is not, however, restricted to a determination as to whether or not only the general public is likely to be confused. We must consider other classes of purchasers, and in this case, the beauty parlor operators \u25a0 and beauty supplies distributors. * * * In this regard, even assuming that the registrant may not at the present time be marketing its goods through beauty shops, the registrations are not so restricted nor are the goods of such nature that the registrant could not alter its channels of trade and sell the goods to beauty shops directly or through beauty supplies distributors. If and when the registrant may decide to fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>low this cause of distribution, the goods of both parties would be known to the beauty parlor operators and distributors, and considering the substantial identity of the marks here involved, it is concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that such purchasers would mistakenly assume that these goods originate with the same producer. The fact that applicant and registrant might use their house marks in connection with their product marks is of no moment herein. See: Frances Denny v. Elizabeth Arden Sales Corporation, 120 USPQ 480 (CCPA, 1959).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5X\">We have reviewed the record in light of appellant's allegations of error but find no reversible error in the proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\"> Whether registrant will or will not alter its present sales patterns is purely a matter of conjecture, but admittedly an element to be weighed in matters of this nature. We do not give that factor controlling weight here, but in view of the competing marks and the obvious similarities in the goods involved, we think the board on the facts here properly rejected the application.</p>\n<p id=\"avm-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b985-23\">. 143 USPQ 456.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
