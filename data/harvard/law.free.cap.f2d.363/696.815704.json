SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b745-22\">Appellant was indicted for second degree murder and convicted of manslaughter. She alleged trial court error (1) in admitting in evidence appellant\u2019s prior convictions of disorderly conduct,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> vagrancy<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and soliciting prostitution<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; (2) in admitting into evidence a knife found in the patrol wagon some time after appellant was a passenger therein; (3) in charging the jury with respect to decedent\u2019s arrest for assaulting a police officer; and (4) in permitting the prosecutor to question a key defense witness regarding prior inconsistent statements, which the witness denied, without showing any basis for the questions, at the time they were asked or later in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-25\">Since we reverse for a new trial on other grounds, we find it unnecessary to pass on the allegations of error with respect to the charge and the prosecutor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>questions to the defense witness.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We find that the knife was properly admitted in evidence, it having been accurately described by an eye witness to the homicide before the knife was found and identified by him on trial as being similar to the homicide weapon. The prior record of appellant, however, should not have been admitted in evidence to impeach her testimony over her objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">This court has recognized that evidence of prior convictions must be received with caution, for such evidence \u201cnot only permits the prosecutor to throw doubt upon the defendant\u2019s testimony regarding the facts of the case being tried, but also may result in casting such an atmosphere of aspersion and disrepute about the defendant as to convince the jury that he is an habitual lawbreaker who should be punished and confined for the general good of the community.\u201d Richards v. United States, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 354, 357, 192 F.2d 602, 605, 30 A.L.R.2d 880 (1951), <em>cert. denied, </em>342 U.S. 946, 72 S.Ct. 560, 96 L.Ed. 703 (1952). Even cautionary instructions \u201ccannot prevent the jury from considering prior actions in deciding whether appellant has committed the crime charged. The courts need not rest on the assumption that juries can compartmentalize their minds and hear things for one purpose and not for another.\u201d Awkard v. United States, 122 U.S.App.D.C. 165, 170, 352 F.2d 641, 646 (1965).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">Since the adoption in 1901 of 14 D.C.Code \u00a7 305,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> this court has never expressly determined whether the term \u201ccrime\u201d in that statute encompasses so-called petty offenses to which the right of trial by jury does not apply. Indeed, on two occasions we have indicated that the question is an open one. Jones v. United States, 119 U.S.App.D.C. 213, 214-215 n. 4, 338 F.2d 553, 554-555 n. 4 (1964) <em>(per curiam); </em>Sanford v. United States, 69 App.D.C. 44, 46, 98 F.2d 325, 327 (1938) <em>(per curiam). </em>We have held that \u00a7 305 does not apply to convictions involving violations of municipal ordinances. Clawans v. District of Columbia, 61 App.D.C. 298, 62 F.2d 383 (1932). In so holding, we relied on Schick v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>States, 195 U.S. 65, 70, 24 S.Ct. 826, 49 L.Ed. 99 (1904), where the Supreme Court construed the word \u201ccrimes\u201d in the jury trial provision of Article III <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the Constitution as excluding petty offenses. <em>Clawans, supra, </em>61 App.D.C. at 299, 62 F.2d at 384. Thus the rationale of our holding in <em>Clawans </em>is not based on the fact that the impeachment evidence admitted there involved municipal ordinances, but rather that the violations of municipal ordinances, being petty offenses, were not triable to a jury and thus were not included in the \u201ccrimes\u201d referred to in \u00a7 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">In the present case the prosecutor was permitted by the trial court, over the objection of defense counsel, to impeach appellant\u2019s credibility by referring to thirteen prior convictions of petty offenses \u2014 vagrancy, disorderly conduct and soliciting prostitution. Although these are District of Columbia Code offenses, as distinguished from municipal ordinances, none of them is triable by jury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 16 D.C.Code \u00a7 705(b) (Supp. V, 1966). See District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U.S. 617, 625-629, 57 S.Ct. 660, 81 L.Ed. 843 (1937). Consequently \u00a7 305 is not applicable to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Our holdings in Murray v. United States, 53 App.D.C. 119, 288 F. 1008, <em>cert. denied, </em>262 U.S. 757, 43 S.Ct. 703, 67 L.Ed. 1218 (1923), Bostic v. United States, 68 App.D.C. 167, 94 F.2d 636 (1937), <em>cert. denied, </em>303 U.S. 635, 58 S.Ct. 523, 82 L.Ed. 1095 (1938), and Campbell v. United States, 85 U.S.App. D.C. 133, 176 F.2d 45 (1949),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> relied on by the Government, are not to the contrary. As far as available records disclose, all of those cases involved misdemeanors punishable by more than ninety days in jail and therefore triable to a jury. 16 D.C.Code \u00a7 705(b). In view of the disposition made herein, it is unnecessary to consider appellant\u2019s contentions predicated on (Luck v. United States, 121 U.S.App.D.C. 151, 348 F.2d 763 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-15\">. 22 D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 1107, 1112(a), 1121 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b745-26\">. 22 D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 3302, 3304 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b745-27\">. 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2701 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b746-5\">. But see Jackson v. United States, 111 U.S.App.D.C. 353, 356, 297 F.2d 195, 198 (1961) (concurring opinion of Judge Burger) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">\u201cNo effort was then made by defense counsel to follow this line of questioning with proof of the alleged \u2018facts\u2019 or of the assumptions implicit in the questions. To be sure, it might have been awkward for the lawyer to take the stand and testify, but if he was not prepared to do this, even if it meant withdrawing from the case he should not have asked the questions. Coun\u25a0sel asking such questions with no intention of following them up if the \u00bfanswers were negative, would be subject to severe censure. We assume in this case that it was a thoughtless \u2018shot in the dark\u2019 attributable perhaps to lack of experience in the highly practical and difficult art of trial advocacy. Utterances similar to this when made by a prosecutor have led us to reverse criminal convictions. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">See also Reichert v.
