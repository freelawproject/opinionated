Williams, brought this action against the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, under Section 205(g) of the Social Security Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to obtain judicial review of a final decision of the Secretary denying his application to establish a period of disability and for disability insurance benefits under Sections 216 (i) and 223 of the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court first remanded for additional findings as to the claimant\u2019s capacity to engage in substantial gainful activity consistent with his age, education, experience, training, and physical and mental capacities. After taking additional evidence, the Secretary found that the claimant\u2019s chief impairments were obesity and an arthritic condition of the back. These impairments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>would prevent only heavy physical activity. The Secretary concluded that the claimant could perform numerous existing jobs that do not have requirements beyond his physical and mental capabilities. The claimant did not establish that his impairments, singularly or in combination, would preclude him from engaging in substantial gainful activity. The district court held <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the Secretary\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, and it granted summary judgment for the government. We have carefully reviewed the evidence and findings and find this judgment is correct. We affirm. See Clinch v. Celebrezze, 5 Cir. 1954, 328 F.2d 778; Celebrezze v. O\u2019Brient, 5 Cir. 1963, 323 F.2d 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b918-14\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b918-23\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7416(i), 423.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b919-26\">.
