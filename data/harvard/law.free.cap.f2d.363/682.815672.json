His claim is that the employment caused a mental breakdown, and it is not disputed that he was found to suffer schizophrenic reaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-15\">The Deputy Commissioner found that the schizophrenic reaction suffered by Appellant did not arise out of his employment with Appellee District Parking Management Co. and that Appellant had not given the required written notice to his employer within the statutory period. 44 Stat. 1431, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 912 (1964). The District Court sustained the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s findings and granted Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-16\">Two doctors testified, one an internist and the other a psychiatrist. The internist expressed an opinion that Appellant\u2019s illness arose out of his employment as a parking lot attendant; the psychiatrist testified that he could not say that Appellant\u2019s illness was caused by his employment, and that \u201cSince we do not know the cause, I would have to say that I cannot answer the question whether there is a causal relation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-17\"> Section 20 of \u25a0 the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 44 Stat. 1436, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920 (1964), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-18\">In any proceeding for the enforcement of a claim for compensation under this Act <em>it shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence </em>to the contrary\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-19\">(a) That the claim comes within the provisions of this Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-20\">(b) That sufficient notice of such claim has been given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-21\">* * * [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>This provision places the burden on the employer to go forward with evidence to meet the presumption that injury or illness occurring during employment was caused by that employment. Del Vecchio v. Bowers, 296 U.S. 280, 56 S.Ct. 190, 80 L.Ed. 229 (1935). The employer offered no substantial evidence that Appellant\u2019s injury was not work-related and hence has not met the burden imposed by the statute. <em>Cf. </em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Donovan, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 331, 221 F.2d 886 (1955); Robinson v. Bradshaw, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 216, 206 F.2d 435 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">As to the statutory notice requirement, Section 12(d), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 912(d), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">Failure to give such notice shall not bar any claim under this Act (1) if the employer (or his agent in charge of the business in the place where the injury occurred) * * * had knowledge of the injury or death and the deputy commissioner determines that the employer * * * has not been prejudiced by failure to give such notice * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The Deputy Commissioner found that \u201cthe employer did not have knowledge of the alleged injury or illness,\u201d but the undisputed testimony of both Appellant\u2019s wife and his immediate superior was that the wife had notified the supervisor on the first day of his absence that Appellant was ill. Both testified that the supervisor had gone to Appellant\u2019s house to pick up the receipts from operation of Appellee\u2019s parking lot, which Appellant had carried home the day he became ill, contrary to his regular custom of turning receipts over to the supervisor at the close of business each day. Thus, the employer clearly had knowledge not only of the fact of Appellant\u2019s illness but also of the fact that he probably became ill on the job. There is no evidence in the record that the employer lacked knowledge of Appellant\u2019s illness or that he had been prejudiced by the lack of a formal written notice. In holding Appellant\u2019s claim barred for failure to give notice the Deputy Commissioner failed to apply the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause remanded with directions to set aside the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s order denying compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
