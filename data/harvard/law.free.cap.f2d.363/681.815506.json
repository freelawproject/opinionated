It is that the trial court abused its discretion \u2014 to the point of plain error within the meaning of Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P. \u2014 by permitting the prosecution to bring out on cross-examination of appellant a prior conviction for the last of these offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">It may well be true, as appellant argues, that this prior conviction played some part in shaping the jury\u2019s conclusions. The question of whether the gun in the case belonged to the complaining witness or to appellant was contested at length in the testimony, and presumably occupied a central place in the jury\u2019s view of the whole case. But that this was likely, to happen must have been evident in advance, and yet the defense made no effort, before appellant took the witness stand, to raise with the trial court the question of whether this prior conviction should be kept out in order to assure the availability to the jury of the accused\u2019s version of the events in dispute. See Luck v. United States, 121 U.S.App. D.C. 151, 348 F.2d 763 (1965). And even when the prosecutor, with commendable sensitivity to the significance of the matter, interrupted his cross-examination for the purpose of approaching the bench to inform the court and defense counsel that he was about to ask about the prior convictions, no objection of any kind was made. The usual instruction was given to the jury to confine its consideration of the prior convictions to the issue of credibility; and the closing argument of the Government to the jury was devoid of reference to them. Under these circumstances, we are not disposed to characterize as plain error an alleged abuse of a discretion which was never invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b730-6\">. A prior conviction of appellant for petty larceny wax also elicited at. the same time, but appellant lias not relied on this specifically as error on which we are asked to ground reversal. lie does note that it presents \u201ca serious question,\u201d assertedly for the reason that petty larceny is not a crime \u201cinvolving dishonesty.\u201d We do not need to dissect this contention since the basis on which we dispose of the claim founded upon the other prior conviction applies with equal, if indeed not greater, force to this.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
