DAWKINS, Jr., District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b214-14\">This appeal is from the convictions of four defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who were jointly in-dieted in five counts for separate violations of the liquor laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury returned guilty verdicts against two of the appellants on two counts and against the other two on three counts. The appeal may be disposed of upon two of appellants\u2019 specifications of error: (1) the admission of hearsay evidence creating undue prejudice in the minds of the jury, uncured by the trial court\u2019s lengthy instructions to disregard, and (2) the government attorney\u2019s improper argument before the jury. We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-20\">The facts do not require detailed examination. Briefly stated, federal officers on December 9, 1964, placed an unregistered still under surveillance within approximately 100 yards of the home of two of the appellants. After watching the still for about two hours without observing any activities there, the officers approached the house and asked to see one of the occupants. Upon being informed that an investigation was being made of an illegal whiskey distillery, two of the appellants separately replied in such a manner as to focus suspicion upon them and cause their immediate arrest. In the immediate vicinity of the house the agents observed a number of empty jugs which had earlier contained moonshine, and an automobile in which a full gallon container of unstamped alcohol was found. Upon discovery of the whiskey in the automobile, the two appellants, husband and wife, who owned it were arrested. Following each arrest, the agent advised each of the appellants of his right to remain silent or to confer with counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-21\">In addition, a large stash of sugar and containers was found some 30 yards from the house, along with other evidence linking together the automobile, the illegal still, and the occupants of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>During the course of the prosecutor\u2019s direct examination of the agent who had made the arrests, he inquired as to the agent\u2019s prior knowledge concerning the automobile in which the unstamped whiskey had been found. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the court allowed testimony that the agent had been told by a confidential informer that the same car, identified by color and by its license number, had been used to transport illicit whiskey and sugar between Tallahassee, Florida, and Walton County, Florida. The testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\">\u201cQ Now then, this automobile, did you know anything about this particular automobile prior to that time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">MR. TONEY: Objection; I\u2019m anticipating, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">MR. CARROUTH: What is the objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">THE COURT: He\u2019s anticipating an answer about information, I suppose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">MR. CARROUTH: That\u2019s what I intend to develop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">THE COURT: I <em>overrule </em>the objection at this point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\"><em>Q Mr. Carrouth: </em>Go ahead. Did you have any knowledge of that particular automobile prior to this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-12\">A Yes sir. As I approached the dwelling house\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-13\">MR. TONEY: Objection. The answer yes or no would be responsive, Your Honor please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-14\"><em>Q Mr. Carrouth: And if you did have any </em>information about this car, state what you had ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-15\">MR. TONEY: Objection; hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-16\">THE COURT: I <em>overrule </em>the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-17\"><em>Q Mr. Carrouth: </em>Go ahead, Mr. Hardman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-19\">A Yes sir, I had had previous information concerning the car; and, as I approached the dwelling house for the original interview, I recognized the car as the one that I had previously, had previously been described to me on November 26, 1964. I had received information from a confidential informer, who had previously\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-22\">MR. TONEY: Objection, Your Honor. This is the same type of objection, I realize, but I want to make it clear in the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-24\">THE COURT: I <em>overrule </em>the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-25\"><em>A The Witness: </em>\u2014 who had previously proved reliable to me, that a blue-green 1964 Galaxy Ford, license No. 13-W-6942, was being used to transport illicit whiskey and sugar between Tallahassee, Florida, and Walton County, Florida.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-26\">Thereupon a defense motion for a mistrial was overruled; but the trial judge subsequently found the testimony to have been improperly admitted, and instructed the jury at length to disregard the agent\u2019s statement as to what some other person had told him.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-27\">Appellants contend that the damage was done, that they had been unduly prejudiced in the eyes of the jury by this admittedly irrelevant, hearsay evidence. We agree. In our recent decision in Landsdown v. United States, 348 F.2d 405 (5 Cir. 1965), we held that where law enforcement personnel testified that they had received a radio call in connection with attempts to sell some jewelry by two suspects, one of which was the appellant there, and that a burglary complaint had come in over the telephone, such testimony was irrelevant to the case, inadmissible as hearsay, and so unduly prejudicial as to constitute <em>plain error </em>under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-28\">Perhaps more nearly in point is Mattson v. United States, 7 F.2d 427 (8 Cir. 1925), where a conviction for violation of the Prohibition laws was reversed because the agent had asserted that he had had many complaints that the defendant was selling liquor. It was held that the agent\u2019s statement was \u201cclearly inadmissible and fatally prejudicial to the case of the defendant, because it was bald hearsay, or hearsay of hearsay.\u201d See also Whiting v. United States, 296 F.2d 512 (1 Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Although it is the general rule, Conner v. United States, 322 F.2d 647 (5 Cir. 1963), that an erroneous admission of evidence is cured by instructions that the jury disregard it, where the substantial rights of the defendant were not adversely affected \u2014 that is, where his guilt is clear and error, if any occurred, was harmless \u2014 we are of the opinion that the erroneous admission of the informer\u2019s statement here was so unduly prejudicial as to constitue reversible error notwithstanding the court\u2019s subsequent instructions to disregard.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Turning now to a consideration of certain remarks made by the prosecuting attorney in his closing argument to the jury, in rebuttal to defense counsel\u2019s argument, we find the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">\u201cMR. CARROUTH: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201cBefore you forget and while its fresh on your mind, can you recall anything that Mr. Thompson said about the innocence of his clients, anything right now while you have it fresh on your mind. Mr. Thompson stood up here for 20 minutes and put these officers on trial. That\u2019s all he talked about; to my best recollection, he never said one time \u2018my clients are innocent\u2019; he never mentioned that. He put these officers on trial and said they were slow in making their cases and had to make some more cases and all sorts of things for 20 minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">\u201cMr. Toney did mention one or two little things besides that but he also put the United States Government on trial. He put the FBI and everybody else. He forgot to mention, after he mentioned about all of these agencies that the Federal Government has to make these scientific cases, he forgot to mention that there\u2019s a lot of other things too before we take anybody\u2019s liberty away from them. <em>These officers, when they make a case, they\u2019ve got to convince our office that they\u2019ve got a case and then </em>we\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">MR. TONEY: Just a moment! Your Honor, I object to counsel giving his opinion. It\u2019s not proper for [a] lawyer to give an opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-12\">MR. CARROUTH: It\u2019s not opinion; it\u2019s a fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-13\">MR. TONEY: He said he passed on the evidence and made a conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-14\">THE COURT: What we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re trying a case because the grand jury brought an indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-15\">MR. CARROUTH: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-16\">THE COURT: That\u2019s all there is to talk about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-17\">MR. CARROUTH: And then these cases are presented to the grand jury, and then they\u2019re presented to the Court and <em>there\u2019s all kinds of rulings the Court makes before you get it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-18\">MR. TONEY: Objection, Your Honor. I think its immaterial to go into these matters as to what happened out of the presence of the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-20\">MR. CARROUTH: I was just rebutting, Your Honor, the fact that he said the FBI and everybody else made these investigations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-21\">THE COURT: I think that\u2019s appropriate response to your argument, Mr. Toney, that part of it.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-22\">There is substantial support for appellants\u2019 contention that the prosecuting attorney is precluded from stating his individual belief in the guilt of the accused. In Dunn v. United States, 307 F.2d 883, 885 (5 Cir. 1962), we held in reversing a conviction for income tax evasion: \u201cIt is improper for counsel to express his personal opinion or to state facts of his own knowledge, not in evidence, and not a part of the evidence to be presented; or to make unwarranted inferences or insinuations calculated to prejudice the defendant.\u201d See also Steele v. United States, 222 F.2d 628 (5 Cir. 1955). In Greenberg v. United States, 280 F.2d 472 (1 Cir. 1960), the government attorney had vigorously argued his belief in the evidence and the consequent guilt of the accused. Quoting Canon 15 of the Canons of Professional Ethics of the American Bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Association,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court reversed a tax evasion conviction, holding that it was error to allow the prosecuting attorney to express his opinion or belief in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">On the other hand, in Henderson v. United States, 218 F.2d 14, 19, 50 A.L.R.2d 754 (6 Cir. 1955), cert. denied 349 U.S. 920, 75 S.Ct. 660, 99 L.Ed. 1253, it was held not to be misconduct on the part of the United States attorney \u201cto <em>express </em>his individual belief in the guilt of the accused if such belief is based solely on the evidence introduced and the jury is not led to believe that there is other evidence, known to the prosecutor but not introduced, justifying that belief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The government contends that the remarks in question were proper rebuttal to defense counsel\u2019s comments concerning the immense availability to the prosecutor of investigators, monetary resources, chemical analysis and the like. Concededly, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were not as flagrant as those in <em>Dunn </em>or <em>Greenberg, </em>but we believe the applicable rule to have a broader base than merely the exclusion of personal opinions as to guilt. As noted in those cases, the inquiry should be whether the prosecutor\u2019s expression might reasonably lead the jury to believe that there is other evidence, unknown or unavailable to the jury, on which the prosecutor was convinced of the accused\u2019s guilt. This is precisely the case here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Notwithstanding whether the United States Attorney\u2019s remarks standing alone would require a reversal, but taking for their likely effect upon the jury, it is manifest that this argument, coupled with insinuation that the government had additional information by way of a reliable informer, although inadmissible before them, would have an unduly prejudicial effect. It is more than probable that this led the jury to believe that the whole governmental establishment had already determined appellants to be guilty on a glut of evidence which, by technical legalisms, was not put before them. Consequently it is our conclusion that the prosecuting attorney\u2019s argument was plainly unwarranted and clearly injurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">We have examined the appellants\u2019 other specifications of error and conclude that each is lacking in substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">For the reasons set forth, the judgments of conviction are reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-15\">.
