On the contrary, however, the record clearly shows an oral warning by the interrogating officer as well as a similar warning in the first paragraph of appellant\u2019s written statement. Second, the defense of entrapment, which was not raised at the trial, is clearly untenable. The agents simply caught him red-handed in the act of delivering large quantities of illicit whiskey.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"apx-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
