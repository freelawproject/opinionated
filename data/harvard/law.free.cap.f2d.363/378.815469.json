Appellant is a state prisoner. In 1929, he was convicted in California State Superior Court of first degree murder and two counts of first degree robbery, the sentences to run consecutively. Appellant alleges that he pleaded guilty, was sentenced, and took no appeal. He now asserts (1) that his consecutive sentences were illegal; (2) that the change of consecutive sentences to concurrent sentences was illegal; (3) that he was deprived of counsel at the time of his arrest, and subsequent interrogation \u2014 not at his arraignment or trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-29\">By reason of the change of appellant\u2019s sentences from consecutive to concurrent, appellant apparently was released on parole by the California authorities, for on June 13, 1960, appellant alleges he was convicted on two counts of assault with a deadly weapon (Cal.Penal Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>\u00a7 245) after being charged with assault to commit murder (Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 217). He alleges he appealed in forma pauperis; and his appeal was denied. (People v. Fleming, 1S1 Cal.App.2d 163, 12 Cal.Rptr. 530 (1961).)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The California law provides for consecutive sentences, as here imposed, for first degree robbery, \u201cconsecutive to each other and each consecutive to the charge of first degree murder.\u201d (Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 669.)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The California law provides for the trial judge to sentence \u201cfor the term prescribed by law\u201d \u2014 which is set by an Adult Authority. (Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 1168.) That Authority has the right to \u201cdetermine and redetermine\u201d the sentence originally fixed. (Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 3020.) This is not a \u201cusurpation of judicial authority\u201d as appellant contends. Further, appellant was benefited by such modification, not injured, not legally wronged, and cannot complain. Ex Parte Kepford, 125 Cal.App. 675, 14 P.2d 145 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">By appellant\u2019s plea of guilty when represented by counsel in the trial court in 1929, any error relating to previous statements was waived. No allegation exists that any statement previously made by appellant was introduced against him, or influenced his plea, or led to the discovery of any evidence against him. Thus Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964) has no application.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-11\">\u201c \u2018The conviction and sentence which follows a plea of guilty are based solely and entirely upon said plea and not upon any evidence which may have been improperly acquired by the prosecuting authorities.\u2019 Thomas v. United States, 290 F.2d 696-697 (9th Cir. 1961).\u201d Quoted in Wallace v. Heinze, 351 F.2d 39 at 40 (9th Cir. 1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">Appellant has failed to exhaust his state remedies. His only excuse for failing to seek relief there is his belief such action \u201cwould be of no use.\u201d Such a conclusion on his part does not prove his point.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b427-16\">Appellant raises questions of internal prison regulations and conduct (in his \u201cDemurrer to Appellee\u2019s Reply Brief\u201d) which are not cognizable by courts of law. United States v. Marchese, 341 F.2d 782, 789 (9th Cir. 1965), rehearing denied March 4, 1965, cert. denied 382 U.S. 817, 86 S.Ct. 41, 15 L.Ed.2d 64 (1965); Stroud v. Swope, 187 F.2d 850, 851 (9th Cir. 1951), cert. denied 342 U.S. 829, 72 S.Ct. 53, 96 L.Ed. 627 (1951); Numer v. Miller, 165 F.2d 986 (9th Cir. 1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
