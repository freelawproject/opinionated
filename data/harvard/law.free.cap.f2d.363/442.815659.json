The District Court construed Art. 101 of the Annotated Code of Maryland as extending the employer\u2019s immunity to its insurer, so that the insurer\u2019s liabilities are limited to payment of the workmen\u2019s compensation benefits due under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-22\">With that construction we agree, for reasons stated in the opinion of the District Court. Donohue v. Maryland Cas. Co., D.Md., 248 F.Supp. 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
