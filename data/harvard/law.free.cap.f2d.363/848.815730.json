The district court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-10\">\u201cThis Court\u2019s ruling in Carrizosa v. Wilson, (Judge Zirpoli) No. 43323 (July 23, 1965) [D.C., 244 F.Supp. 120], forecloses further discussion of the [petitioner\u2019s] allegation, which is based in fact upon a retrospective application of Escobedo v. [State of] Illinois, 378 U.S. 478 [84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977] (1964).\u201d (The right to counsel.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">For two reasons, the judgment of the district court must be, and is, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that the <em>Escobedo </em>rule had no retroactive effect was correct. In Johnson et al. v. State of New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S. Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (decided June 20, 1966), the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-15\">\u201cWe hold that <em>Escobedo </em>affects only those eases in which the trial began after June 22, 1964, the date of that decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-16\">Thus, paraphrasing <em>Johnson, </em>we must hold: The conviction assailed here was obtained at a trial completed long before <em>Escobedo </em>was rendered, and the rulings of that case is therefore inapplicable to the present proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b897-18\">Appellant was charged with two counts of murder. He was represented by the public defender at the preliminary hearing. One witness at the scene of the double shooting testified that she was present with appellant and the two victims, and no one else, in her home where and when the killings occurred. Another eye witness who heard the shots described appellant\u2019s flight from the scene. Both were vigorously examined on appellant\u2019s behalf. Appellant\u2019s written statement was introduced in evidence,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and appellant was bound over for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-20\">At the time of the trial, appellant, represented by private counsel of his choice, pleaded guilty. Thus, because of his plea of guilty made when represented by counsel, the appellant stands convicted, not because of a confession or statement, but by reason of his plea alone. This forecloses any collateral attack. Wallace v. Heinze, 351 F.2d 39 (9th Cir. 1965); Thomas v. United States, 290 F.2d 696-697 (9th Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-29\">. Appellant freely admitted the shootings. The last sentence in his statement reads: \u201cI can\u2019t understand why [you ask for] all the details when I\u2019ve told you I\u2019m guilty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
