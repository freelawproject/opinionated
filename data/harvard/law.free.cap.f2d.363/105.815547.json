As one basis for its decision the district court, finding that at the time he confessed petitioner had not been supplied with counsel, held that Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 1964, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977, governed and was to be retrospectively applied. In the light of Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882, (6/20/66), this ruling was error. We, accordingly, turn to the court\u2019s alternative ground, that the nature of petitioner\u2019s claim was of greater consequence, and beyond <em>Escobedo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-15\">On December 23, 1954 a man was beaten with a cudgel, from which beating he died the next day. The afternoon following, petitioner inquired whether the victim had died, and upon receiving an affirmative answer, went to the police station and said he wanted to give himself up. He was taken forthwith to a justice of the peace. Petitioner repeated that he wished to confess. The justice told him he need make no statement and that what he said could be used against him. Petitioner, nevertheless, confessed to the crime. This confession was introduced at the trial, and petitioner was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-16\">This is not a post-Esco&amp;edo confession; nor had petitioner requested an attorney. He seems to have had only the single motive of unburdening himself. However, it is now his position that because this was a preliminary hearing he' was constitutionally obliged to be furnished with counsel. This we must consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-17\">In Hamilton v. State of Alabama, 1961, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114, a defendant was arraigned on a charge of murder. No counsel was present. He pleaded not guilty, but was found guilty. In reversing his conviction the Court said that under Alabama law arraignment is a \u201ccritical stage\u201d in a criminal proceeding. Certain pleas must be made then, or never. So must any attack upon the grand jury. To the state\u2019s answer that in this case no prejudice had been shown, the Court answered that such an inquiry was not open; \u201cthe degree of prejudice can never be known.\u201d 368 U.S. at 55, 82 S.Ct. at 159. Thereafter, in White v. State of Maryland, 1963, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193, the Court took certiorari \u201climited to the point of law raised in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Hamilton v. State of Alabama.\u201d In this case petitioner had been brought before a magistrate for a preliminary hearing. He was \u201carraigned,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and pleaded guilty. At this proceeding he had no counsel. Later he was formally arraigned, at which time he had counsel, and pleaded not guilty. At the ensuing trial his earlier guilty plea was introduced in evidence. In reversing his conviction the Court said, at p. 60, 83 S.Ct. at p. 1051,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\">\u201cWhatever may be the normal function of the \u2018preliminary hearing\u2019 under Maryland law, it was in this case<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as \u2018critical\u2019 a stage as arraignment under Alabama law. For petitioner entered a plea before the magistrate and that plea was taken at a time when he had no counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u201cWe repeat what we said in Hamilton v. [State of] Alabama, supra, [368 U.S.] at 55 [82 S.Ct. 157] that we do not stop to determine whether prejudice resulted: \u2018Only the presence of counsel could have enabled this accused to know all the defenses available to him and to plead intelligently.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In the case at bar the proceeding before the justice of the peace was for the purpose of determining probable cause to hold the defendant for trial. 34 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 76 (1956). While doubtless petitioner\u2019s statement served to facilitate a finding of probable cause, so it would have had it been made to the police, Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882, (6/20/66), or to the district attorney, Escute v. Delgado, 1 Cir., 1960, 282 F.2d 335, cert. den. 365 U.S. 883, 81 S.Ct. 1033, 6 L.Ed.2d 193. No plea was provided for, or was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">No condemnation has been applied, retrospectively, to such a situation. In speaking of White v. State of Maryland in Pointer v. State of Texas, 1965, 380 U.S. 400, 402, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 1067, 13 L.Ed.2d 923, the Court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-13\">\u201cSince the preliminary hearing there, as in Hamilton v. State of Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, [82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114], was one in which pleas to the charge could be made, we held in White as in Hamilton that a preliminary proceeding of that nature was so critical a stage in the prosecution that a defendant at that point was entitled to counsel. But the State informs us that at a Texas preliminary hearing such as is involved here, pleas of guilty or not guilty are not accepted and that the judge decides only whether the accused should be bound over to the grand jury and if so whether he should be admitted to bail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">The Court, describing this difference \u201csignificant,\u201d then decided the case on another ground. With this background we agree with respondent that where no plea was called for or made, and no prejudice was shown, White does not require compulsory furnishing of counsel. United States ex rel. Cooper v. Reincke, 2 Cir., 1964, 333 F.2d 608, cert. den. 379 U.S. 909, 85 S.Ct. 205, 13 L.Ed.2d 181; DeToro v. Pepersack, 4 Cir., 1964, 332 F.2d 341, cert. den. 379 U.S. 909, 85 S.Ct. 198, 13 L.Ed.2d 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">Finally, it might be appropriate to quote from Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, (6/13/66),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-16\">\u201cConfessions remain a proper element in law enforcement. Any statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence. * * * There is no requirement that police stop a person who enters a police station and states that he wishes to confess to a crime, or a person who calls the police to offer a confession or any other statement he desires to make. Volunteered statements of any kind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>are not barred by the Fifth Amendment and their admissibility is not affected by our holding today.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">We are not, of course, talking of in-custody .statements, <em>post-Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Judgment will be entered vacating the judgment of the District Court, and remanding the action with instructions to discharge the writ and remand petitioner to custody.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-8\">. The Maryland practice relating to preliminary hearings permitted, but did not require the entry of a plea. Cf. Wood v. United States, 1942, 75 U.S.App.D.C. 274, 128 F.2d 265, 141 A.L.R. 1318, whore the entry of a plea was obligatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-19\">.
