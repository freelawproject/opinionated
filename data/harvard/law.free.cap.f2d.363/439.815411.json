In this appeal, he questions (1) the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction; and (2) the completeness of the court\u2019s instructions to the jury on the requirements of possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-23\">We find that the evidence as a whole is sufficient to support both counts of the conviction. The evidence of dominion and control satisfies this Court\u2019s standard for possession of unstamped liquor. See Handford v. United States, 5 Cir. 1957, 249 F.2d 295. The circumstantial evidence of removal and concealment was sufficient for the jury to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt. See Clark v. United States, 5 Cir. 1961, 293 F.2d 445, 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-24\">The appellant argues that the instructions on \u201cpossession\u201d were defective in that the judge did not draw a specific distinction between dominion and control of the liquor and mere presence at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>the stash. We have often observed that specific mention of this distinction is desirable in section 5205(a) (2) possession charges. See, e. g., Handford v. United States, supra 247 F.2d at 297. The appellant requested instructions that expressly noted the distinction. Nonetheless, we find that the instructions given \u201csubstantially covered\u201d the requirements of possession in language that would prevent the jury\u2019s mistaking \u201cmere presence at the scene\u201d for dominion and control of the liquor. See Pine v. United States, 5 Cir. 1943, 135 F.2d 353, 355, cert. denied, 320 U.S. 740, 65 S.Ct. 40, 88 L.Ed. 439; cf. Teate v. United States, 5 Cir. 1961, 297 F.2d 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
