On a prior \u00a7 2255 motion alleging mental incompetency at the aforementioned times, the Court below conducted a full and extensive hearing and concluded that Appellant was competent. United States v. Mancuso, D.C., 1957, 152 F.Supp. 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-20\">The District Court reasoned that since upon the hearing of Appellant\u2019s prior \u00a7 2255 motion, he had been judicially found to be mentally competent at these various times, he could not at those same times have been, as now claimed, under the influence of drugs. Since none of the moving papers in the present \u00a7 2255 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>proceeding undertook to show how Appellant could be under the influence of drugs and yet, at one and the same time, mentally competent, the Court\u2019s conclusion was correct that the record revealed that Appellant was entitled to no relief. Thus, no further hearing was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
