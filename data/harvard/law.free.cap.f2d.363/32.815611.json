On a total of seven counts charging fraud by mail, Appellant pleaded guilty to each and was sentenced thereunder. By his \u00a7 2255 motion he alleges that he was mentally incompetent at the time of his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-17\">The District Court denied relief noting that in June 1964 Appellant was found mentally competent to stand trial in a judicial proceeding under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4244, and that Appellant\u2019s subsequent plea of guilty was freely and voluntarily made. The petition made no factual showing that Appellant\u2019s mental condition had changed between the date of the judicial hearing and the filing of the present motion. The record fully supports the District Court\u2019s action, and, accordingly it is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
