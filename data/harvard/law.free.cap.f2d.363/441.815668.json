United States, 284 F.2d 122 (10 Cir. 1960) in favor of that of Morrison v. United States, 355 F.2d 218 (6 Cir. 1966). While the taxpayers\u2019 position was not without some basis in the language of section 1231 prior to the 1958 amendment <em>(Maurer </em>applied the statute as it existed before the amendment), we think that amendment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> clearly indicated Congress\u2019 intention that the taxpayers\u2019 loss should not be excluded from treatment under section 1231. The judgment of the Tax Court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b489-29\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-18\">.
