Its action against appellees, a small drive-in chain, was for trademark infringement, unfair competition, and breach of contract. The District Court found and held that there had been unfair competition and breach of contract, for which damages were awarded. The appeal is here because the trial court found no trademark infringement and denied injunctive relief in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-21\">McDonald\u2019s operates some 670 drive-in hamburger stands throughout the Country. It had a registered service mark, being large yellow parabolic arches used in the design of its buildings and accompanying signs. McDonald\u2019s charged defendants with infringement of this mark. As stated, the District Court found to the contrary. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-22\">In trademark infringement eases the plaintiff must prove only that there is a \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d, American Foods, Inc. et al. v. Golden Flake, Inc., 5 Cir., 1963, 312 F.2d 619. As to such likelihood here, plaintiff relied on photographs of the signs used by the parties, plus the testimony of one of its officers. Defendant countered with testimony from the architect who designed his signs in addition to numerous persons experienced in advertising. The trial court found that defendant\u2019s sign was designed subsequent to, and to conform with, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>building design, that there were three panels in this sign as compared to plaintiff\u2019s one, that there was no geometric similarity in the two signs, and that plaintiff had failed to prove any likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"> The decision of factual issues is for the trial court. The findings below are supported by substantial evidence which the trier of the fact had a right to accept. We must affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
