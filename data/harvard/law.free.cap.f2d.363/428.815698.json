He alleges three errors in this appeal: (1) Insufficient evidence of dominion and control to support the conviction; (2) prejudicial emphasis in the charge to the jury on the indictment and the definition of \u201cjoint possession\u201d; and (3) illegal search and seizure of the unstamped whiskey.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-26\"> We find no reversible error in this case. The evidence of dominion and control of the whiskey is sufficient to support the verdict of guilty. See Handford v. United States, 5 Cir. 1957, 249. F.2d 295. The charge describes the indictment and the definition of \u201cjoint possession\u201d with sufficient clarity. The judge specifically cautioned the jury against drawing an unfavorable inference from his repetition of any element of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>instructions. See Garner v. United States, 6 Cir. 1957, 244 F.2d 575, cert. denied, 355 U.S. 832, 78 S.Ct. 47, 2 L.Ed. 2d 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The court did not err in denying the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of whiskey seized without a warrant. The facts that had come to the attention of the arresting officers were \u201csufficient, in the circumstances, to lead a reasonably discreet and prudent man to believe that liquor [was] illegally possessed in the automobile to be searched.\u201d Husty v. United States, 1931, 282 U.S. 694, 701, 51 S.Ct. 240, 242, 75 L.Ed. 629, 632. The seizure of the whiskey followed a familiar pattern. An informer reported to government agents that he would drive automobiles containing untaxed liquor to a rendezvous with the arresting officers. He did. See Bruner v. United States, 5 Cir. 1961, 293 F.2d 621. The trial judge had ample opportunity to affirm the informer\u2019s record of reliability; the informer testified at the trial. Cf. Bruner v. United States, supra, 293 F.2d at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
