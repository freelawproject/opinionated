The search was incident to an arrest made when the auto was stopped between eight and nine miles north of the Mexican border.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The auto and the defendants had come across the border from Mexico the previous day.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Prior to the trial, and on January 15, 1965, defendant Tona pleaded guilty to the lesser charge (failure to register as a narcotic user) and was dismissed as a defendant from this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Defendants Thomas and Bock moved to suppress the seized heroin, alleging an illegal search and seizure in that the searching officers did not have probable cause to believe the defendants had or were about to commit a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">The government resisted the motion, urging probable cause existed for the search (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 482). The trial judge upheld the government\u2019s position that probable cause existed. This was alleged as error, both on the first motion for new trial, and on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">We find no merit in this contention. Appellant relies heavily on the <em>Cervantes </em>case (Cervantes v. United States, 263 F.2d 800 (9th Cir. 1959) and 278 F.2d 350 (9th Cir. 1960)), but the government correctly points out that in <em>Cervantes </em>there was no personal observation by the government officers following the receipt of the informer\u2019s information- \u2014 while here there was, i. e., the observation of the meetings with the two taxicab drivers and the numerous border crossings. As the trial court carefully pointed out, there were seven factors involved, which we number as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: The Court finds [1] that on the basis of the information supplied to Mr. Aros by the informant, [2] whom the Court also finds was a reliable informant, [3] on the basis of the testimony regarding the movements of the parties involved in the vehicle, [4] their motel arrangements, [5] on the basis of the arrival of the cabs from across the Line on the night or early morning of November 30th, [6] on the basis of the identification of Tona as a person addicted, the Court finds that the agents had a reasonable ground to believe [7] when the car was moving out of Nogales and away from Nogales on the morning of November 30th that there was being conveyed or transported in the vehicle narcotics, and therefore the stopping of the vehicle and searching of the vehicle was a reasonable search and not an unlawful search. Accordingly, the Motion to Suppress is denied.\u201d (R.T., Vol. II, L 8-22.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">We therefore hold there was probable cause for the search \u2014 i. e., \u201ca reasonable cause to suspect there was merchandise which was imported contrary to law\u201d within the auto.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Prior to the start of trial, on March 17, 1965, the government, in the presence of the jury, dismissed the indictment as to the two female defendants. This is charged as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Thus defendants Thomas and Ortega alone went to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Tona, an admitted addict, testified Ortega wanted him (Tona) to obtain narcotics. Tona \u201cbelieved\u201d Thomas took part in this conversation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Tona testified both Thomas and Ortega bought heroin, but that Thomas\u2019 bundle alone was that discovered in the search of the auto. Tona admitted on cross-examination that he had been promised a chance to plead to a lesser sentence if he would testify against the other defendants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">At the end of the government\u2019s case, the trial court ordered a judgment of acquittal as to Ortega.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-25\"> Thomas, the sole remaining defendant, was convicted by the jury. Although the evidence is close and sometimes conflicting, and with much of it given by persons known to be addicted to narcotics, there exists sufficient evidence, looking at the issues most favorable to the government\u2019s position (as we must on appeal after a jury\u2019s conviction) to uphold the defendant Thomas\u2019 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-26\">We must note there are before us two appeals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The second appeal being from the denial of a second motion for new trial, made on the basis of newly discovered evidence, i. e., the asserted recantation by the defendant Ortega of his testimony given at the trial; his \u201cnew\u201d testimony that it was <em>his </em>heroin that was discovered in the search of the Thomas auto. The court denied the motion for a new trial, characterizing Ortega as \u201can evasive and perjurious witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>We need not agree with the trial judge\u2019s estimate of defendant Ortega; neither do we disagree. Ortega was certainly not a convincing witness, either at the trial, or on the second motion for new trial. Suffice it to say with respect to a matter involving so largely a matter of discretion resting in the trial judge, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling denying the second motion for a new trial. The denial of the motion for new trial in case Number 20650 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Having found there was probable cause for the search of appellant\u2019s car, that the evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction, and that there was no abuse of discretion in denying each motion for a new trial, we reach appellant\u2019s fourth and fifth alleged errors' \u2014 - the court\u2019s refusal to give the jury certain proposed instructions, defendant\u2019s numbers three and four.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">It is conceded proffered instruction number three is not the law. See: Wox-berg v. United States, 329 F.2d 284 (9th Cir. 1964); Kaplan v. United States, 329 F.2d 561 (9th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Appellant\u2019s Requested Instruction Number Four <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is a proper instruction in many cases, and particularly in those eases where circumstantial evidence alone is presented against a defendant. Its value decreases somewhat in direct ratio to the amount of direct evidence produced. Here there existed direct evidence. It would be difficult to say, as a matter of law, that the evidence against the defendant in this case was \u201cchiefly\u201d circumstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">The jury was carefully and properly instructed <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on the..burden of proof where the evidence before the trier of fact is capable of two interpretations, one consistent with guilt; one consistent with innocence. We think the instructions as a whole were adequate, and we find no reversible error in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">We come to appellant\u2019s last point, which compels us to reverse. To savor the import of the prosecution\u2019s questions, we desire to quote from the record exactly what was said.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-14\">On cross-examination of defendant Thomas, the Assistant United States Attorney asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-15\">\u201cQ. Did you ever tell him<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> when he asked you why you wanted nar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>cotics you would supply sources, you had to supply or sources you had to dispose of in, say, Northern California, San Francisco, around there?\u201d (RT 406, L 18-21.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">We assume this was an attempted foundation for impeachment by proof of a prior inconsistent statement. We assume it was not impeachment on a collateral matter, and that it was relevant. Wigmore on Evidence, 3d ed., Yol. Ill \u00a7 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">(It should be noted that although the one-time defendant Tona was examined at length and vigorously cross-examined (RT 29-149), no foundation was laid, or attempted to be laid, at that time for impeachment of Thomas by asking Tona concerning any previous statement made by Thomas.)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">When this \u201cfoundation question\u201d was asked by the prosecutor, the trial judge very properly inquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">\u201cQ. Does [government] counsel avow you will show if the answer is negative, you will produce testimony of that statement ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">\u201cA. MISS DIAMOS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">\u201cQ. THE COURT: On that basis counsel may proceed.\u201d (RT 407.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Counsel for appellant, outside the hearing of the jury, then pointed out that Exhibit 3 (the statement taken by the government from Tona) did <em>not </em>support the government\u2019s position. And the trial judge very properly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-11\">\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, the whole thing will be blown out of the water.\u201d (RT 407.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-20\">Accepting the challenge, government counsel continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-21\">\u201cQ. Then you did not reply to him [Tona] that you had sources or methods of disposal in Northern California and San Francisco?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-22\">\u201cA. No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-23\">\u201cQ. Nor did you have that type conversation ever with Tona? (sic)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-24\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-25\">\u201cQ. At no time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-26\">\u201cA. No.\u201d (RT 409, L 5-13.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-27\">This was an inadequate and poorly formed question. There was a variance in content between the two questions. If we concede the person was named, the time and place were not. Robinson v. United States, 144 F.2d 392 (6th Cir_ 1944). McCormick, Evidence (1954),. Chapter 5, \u00a7\u00a7 36, 37; Wigmore on Evidence, 3d ed., Vol. Ill \u00a7\u00a7 1017, 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-28\">There was no real inconsistency between appellant\u2019s denial and the purported impeaching testimony. Wigmore, supra, \u00a7 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-29\">Thus defendant Thomas was accused of having previous dealings with, and a market for, narcotics. This was use of a statement not usable as substantive evidence of the facts stated. The crime of selling (or giving away) narcotics in the past was inferred. Without proof of either a previous conviction or even a. previous arrest as to such a crime, the-government prosecutor offered the impeachment, for which the foundation had been allegedly so laid.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-30\">We next turn to the supposed impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Tona was called in rebuttal, by the government, and testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\">\u201cQ. Do you recall having a conversation with him concerning the heroin and what Mr. Thomas was going to do with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">\u201cA. We had a conversation, yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">\u201cQ. Do you recall it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">\u201cA. Yes, ma\u2019am, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">\u201cQ. Do you recall what Mr. Thomas said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">\u201cA. Well, he just told me he was taking it back with him, that he had some people waiting for him up there, I don\u2019t know whether it was him or the heroin they were waiting for.\u201d (RT 428, L 14-23.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">Actually, as the government well knew, as was brought out on cross-examining Tona on this rebuttal testimony, Tona had made a statement to the government agents on February 8, 1965, which not only failed to support the question, but stated precisely the opposite. It read, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-11\">\u201cQuestion. Did Thomas ever tell you he was a user of heroin ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-12\">\u201cAnswer. No, he didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-13\">\u201cQuestion. Why did they<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> want to buy this heroin?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-14\">\u201cAnswer. I wouldn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-15\">\u201cQuestion. Did they ever say what they were going to do with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_n\">\u201cAnswer. No, they didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-16\">\u201cQuestion. As far as you know, you don\u2019t know why they bought it or who they bought it for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-17\">\u201cAnswer. No, I don\u2019t.\u201d (Original Statement, Ex. 3, p. 26, I. 5-19.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-18\">At the trial, Tona was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-19\">\u201cWere those questions asked of you under oath and did you give those answers at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-20\">\u201cA. I believe so, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-21\">\u201cQ. At that time when you were being questioned about the use of the narcotics, did you tell Mr. Aros and Mr. Gordon and Mr. Lindberg about the statement that you have just made here in court, you know what I am referring to, did you tell them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-23\">\u201cA. About this statement ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-24\">\u201cQ. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-25\">\u201cA. No, sir, I didn\u2019t.\u201d (RT 430, L 23 to 431, L 19, incl.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-26\">Despite the existence of this statement and the knowledge by the government of the worthlessness of the alleged impeachment, the following dialogue took place immediately:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-27\">\u201cREDIRECT EXAMINATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At6\">\u201cBY MISS DIAMOS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-28\">\u201cQ. Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-29\">\u201cA. Because I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I was asked too fast the questions. I didn\u2019t have time to think of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-30\">\u201cQ. Were the questions too general?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-31\">\u201cMR. PODRET: Objection, Your Hon- or, leading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-32\">\u201cA. Too general, yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-33\">\u201cTHE COURT: The question is leading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-34\">\u201cMISS DIAMOS: I beg the Court\u2019s pardon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-35\">\u201cQ. Were the questions particularized, were they taken step by step or general questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-36\">\u201cA. They were just general questions. \u201cMISS DIAMOS: No further questions.\u201d (RT 431, L 21 to 432, L 9, incl.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-37\">This clearly was improper. The questions were leading. They were of little value, if any. The whole procedure was inadequate impeachment; and the government should have known it.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-38\">On appeal, appellee asserts merely that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-39\">\u201cAppellant now contends this was not a connecting up \u2014 that the avowal [made to the trial judge] was not substantiated by the evidence. It is respectfully submitted that it is, and that counsel did not raise this at the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>level. See RT 432, through the end.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Brief, p. 19.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">We cannot agree that such maneuvers of the government in a trial can be so easily explained away. No sufficient showing was made to substantiate the avowal of government counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">It is true appellant did not again urge specifically the objection previously urged when the government\u2019s avowal and representation was made to the .trial court. Defense counsel did move for a directed verdict of acquittal; and inferentially at least, touched upon the point here involved by reference to character witnesses and their impeachment by proof of an alleged crime involving \u201cdrugs\u201d charged but never proved against defendant Thomas.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Here we have the traditional ringing of a bell that could not be unrung. It was before a jury. An impeachment was attempted to show the defendant Thomas had admitted traffic in Northern California in narcotic drugs. A more devastating blow to a defense can hardly be imagined. Motivation, previously lacking for the crime charged, is supplied. The alleged impeaching question was unskillfully and inexactly and ineptly worded. The attempt to explain and justify the asking of it borders on the puerile.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">In a close case such as this, depending partly at least, if not chiefly, on circumstantial evidence \u2014 and with no proof of actual purchase or personal possession in Thomas (except from the lips of a codefendant who escaped conviction and was eager to benefit himself), we cannot say this procedural error was not prejudicial to the appellant\u2019s rights. We find here a square corner the government failed to turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">A completely ineffectual impeachment that fails to impeach is as much a prosecution error as no attempt at impeachment whatsoever.

Appellant\u2019s Requested Instruction Number Four:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">\u201cWhen the case which has been made out by the state against a defendant rests entirely or chiefly on circumstantial evidence and in any case before the jury may find a defendant guilty, basing its finding solely on such evidence, each fact which is essential to complete a chain of circumstances that will establish the defendants\u2019 guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b210-9\">. The court gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">\u201cIf the evidence in the case is susceptible of two constructions or interpretations, each of which appears to you to be reasonable, and one of which points to the guilt of the defendant and the other to his innocence, it is your duty under the law to adopt that interpretation which will admit of the defendant\u2019s innocence and reject that which points to his guilt. You will notice that this rule applies only when both of the two possible opposing conclusions appear to you to be reasonable. If on the other hand one of the possible conclusions should appear to you to be reasonable and the other to be unreasonable, it would be your duty to adhere to the reasonable deduction and reject the unreasonable. Bearing in-mind, however, that even if the reasonable deduction points to a defendant\u2019s guilt, the entire proof must carry the convincing force required by law to support a verdict of-guilty.\u201d (RT 4G1, L 17, to 462, L 7)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b210-18\">. \u201chim\u201d was Tona \u2014 the original defendant who had agreed to turn state\u2019s evidence in return for a guilty plea to a lesser charge and the original defendant who made the purchase of the heroin, and the only defendant with unquestioned possession of the narcotics at one time.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-19\">In this connection, the testimony of Tona is interesting: see n. 4, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-20\">In a thirty-eight page statement given by Tona to the government on February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>8, 1965, he contradicted his trial testimony in two important particulars:</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">\u201cQ.
