Homosexual behavior, despite Sigmund Freud<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and other noted authors,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> remains such a fervently debated issue that too often emotions on both sides obscure reason. But, the craft of judging requires a personal detachment \u2014 as far as it is humanly possible \u2014 so that issues which are apt to overwhelm the emotions may be approached in the dispassionate manner fitting for a judicial determination. See Learned Hand, \u201cFifty Years of Federal Judicial Service,\u201d published in Handbook for Judges (1961). Our function in this case, therefore, is not to approve or disapprove of the conduct we are examining; nor is it necessary for us to determine the mores of the community. Rather, our duty is simply to interpret a statute and to make the traditional determination as to its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Clive Michael Boutilier petitions for review of a final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals directing his deportation to Canada as one who upon entry into this country was a homosexual and, thus, was afflicted with a \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d within the meaning of section 212(a) (4) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1952 (Act), 8 U.S.C. (1964 ed.) \u00a7 1182(a) (4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, we uphold the order of the Board and dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The basic facts, which were not seriously disputed, lend themselves to simple statement. Boutilier, a native and citizen of Canada, was admitted into the United States for permanent residence on June 22, 1955 at the age of 21. Since that time, with the exception of short trips outside the country, he has continuously resided here and has been gainfully employed as a building maintenance man, most recently by a large company in Manhattan. Boutilier's mother and stepfather also live in New York and .three of his five brothers and sisters reside in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">In September 1963, as part of Bou-tilier\u2019s application to file a petition for citizenship, he submitted an affidavit to a naturalization examiner forthrightly admitting that he had been arrested in October 1959 on a charge of sodomy, in violation of New York Penal Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 40, \u00a7 690. Boutilier noted that he had been discharged on his own recognizance and that the charge was reduced to simple assault and ultimately dismissed when the complaining party failed to appear in court. Boutilier freely acknowledged that the circumstances leading to the arrest involved acts of anal sodomy and fellatio with a minor \u2014 a 17-year-old male.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">This affidavit was forwarded to the Immigration Service and, in January 1964, an Immigration Officer informed Boutilier that the government desired additional information. Submitting another sworn statement, Boutilier revealed the full history of his sexual deviate behavior. He stated that his first homosexual experience occurred in Canada when he was approximately 14 years of age; the act was involuntary and Bou-tilier played a passive role. However, from the time he was 16 until he came to the United States 5 years later, Bou-tilier voluntarily engaged in homosexual activity on an average of 3 or 4 times a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>year.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These experiences all involved fellatio and Boutilier was generally the active participant. After Boutilier entered this country in 1955, his homosexual conduct continued with approximately the same frequency. Indeed, Boutilier shared an apartment with a male with whom he had sexual relations and, as the result of Boutilier\u2019s admitted homosexual condition and a Selective Service psychiatric examination, he was classified 4-F by the Selective Service System.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Immigration officials dispatched this second and more complete statement to the United States Public Health Service for its expert views as to whether there were grounds for concluding that Bou-tilier was excludable from the United States when he entered in 1955. After reviewing this document, the Public Health Service issued a certificate stating that, on the basis of the information furnished, it was of the opinion that Boutilier \u201cwas afflicted with a class A condition, namely, psychopathic personality, sexual deviate, at the time of his admission to the United States for permanent residence on June 22nd, 1955.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Armed with this certificate and the supporting documents, the government commenced deportation proceedings. At hearings held before a Special Inquiry Officer, Boutilier declined an opportunity for an <em>in personam </em>examination by Public Health Service doctors. He did, however, introduce two letters<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> from privately retained psychiatrists which were received in evidence without objection by the government.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, it was substantially agreed between the parties that this additional material would not cause the Public Health Service to change its certification and, accordingly, no purpose would be served by calling a Public Health Service doctor to testify. Based on the evidence and stipulations, the Special Inquiry Officer concluded that Boutilier had been a homosexual at the time of entering the United States and, thus, was excludable as one afflicted with a \u201cpsychopathic personality.\u201d On this basis, the Special Inquiry Officer ordered Boutilier deported, noting that the phrase \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d as used in section 212(a) (4) of the Act is not a medical formulation but is a legal term of art evincing a Congressional purpose to exclude from this country any alien who is shown to be a homosexual. After an unsuccessful appeal to the Board of Im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>migration Appeals, Boutilier asks us to vacate the order of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Boutilier now urges that an actual medical examination by the Public Health Service was an indispensable prerequisite to its opinion that he was afflicted with a \u201cpsychopathic personality.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In support of this position, Boutilier relies on section 234 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1224, which directs that certification of the physical and mental condition of \u201carriving aliens * * * shall be made by medical officers of the United States Public Health Service, who shall conduct all medical examinations and shall certify, for the information of the immigration officers and the special inquiry officers, any physical and mental defect or disease observed * * See also 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 34.1. Boutilier urges that if an exclusion proceeding is to be valid, adherence to these procedures is required. See United States ex rel. Johnson v. Shaughnessy, 336 U.S. 806, 69 S.Ct. 921, 93 L.Ed. 1054 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">While this contention possesses surface plausibility, it is spurious and has a fatal flaw: it glosses over the basic and fundamental distinction between exclusion and deportation proceedings. Boutilier\u2019s ouster was directed because he was \u201cex-cludable\u201d in 1955 as one afflicted with a \u201cpsychopathic personality.\u201d But, this is not to say that the process by which his expulsion was ordered was an exclusion proceeding. On the contrary, section 241 (a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. (1964 ed.) \u00a7 1251 (a), expressly provides that \u201c[a]ny alien in the United States * * * shall * * * <em>be deported </em>who * * * at the time of entry was within one or more of the classes of aliens excludable by the law existing at the time of such entry * * * \u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Thus, section 234 and the cases and regulations which Boutilier cites are not in point; they describe requirements which are applicable solely to exclusion proceedings and have nothing to do with deportation procedures \u2014 our main concern here and the path to be followed is laid down in section 242(b) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b). We note, in this connection, that Boutilier does not claim that the government failed to comply with the rules and regulations which guide the conduct of deportation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">The confusion between \u201cexclusion\u201d and \u201cdeportation\u201d is also at the root of Boutilier\u2019s argument that he is being expelled on a non-statutory ground. Boutilier asserts that while affliction with a \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d may furnish a basis for exclusion, this term does not authorize deportation. We find no merit in this suggestion. Section 241, as we have noted, authorizes the deportation of any alien who could have been excluded upon entering the United States. While this form of \u201cdelayed exclusion\u201d has not been altogether free from criticism, see Note, Limitations on Congressional Power to Deport Resident Aliens Excludable as Psychopaths at Time of Entry, 68 Yale L.Jour. 931, 935 (1959), without the provision, an imprimatur would be placed on deception of immigration officials at time of entry. Developments in the Law: Immigration and Nationality, 66 Harv.L.Rev. 643, 682 (1953). The function served by deportation in cases where the petitioner was excludable is to furnish a backstop or cheek designed to intercept those whom Congress believed should not have been admitted into the United States in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">Despite Boutilier\u2019s arguments to the contrary, we believe the term \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d as employed in section 212(a) (4) reflects a Congressional purpose to prevent alien homo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>sexuals from obtaining admission into this country. It was employed as a term of art to be interpreted by what Congress intended as a guide, and not to be left to the vagaries and honest but conflicting theories of psychiatry for determination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The legislative history of the Act of 1952 and of the various bills and resolutions which gave rise to it leaves no room for doubt that Congress intended to exclude homosexuals and would have expressly so provided if the Public Health Service had not advised that the term \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d alone was sufficient to accomplish this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Prior to 1952, the Immigration laws employed the language \u201cpersons of constitutional psychopathic inferiority,\u201d as those subject to exclusion, section 3 of the Act of February 5, 1917, 39 Stat. 875; but, the 1952 Act changed this terminology to the more modern concept of \u201cpsychopathic personality.\u201d Initially, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary reported that \u201cthe purpose of the provision against \u2018persons with constitutional psychopathic inferiority\u2019 will be more adequately served by changing that term to \u2018persons afflicted with psychopathic personality,\u2019 and that the classes of mental defectives should be enlarged to include homosexuals and other sex perverts.\u201d S.Rep.No.1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 345 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">As a result, a series of proposed bills were drafted, each of which provided for the exclusion of \u201caliens afflicted with psychopathic personality\u201d and \u201caliens who are homosexuals or sex perverts.\u201d See, e. g., S. 3455, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7 212(a) (1950); S. 716, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 212(a) (1951). In S. 2550, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7 212 (1952), however, express reference to \u201caliens who are homosexuals or sex perverts\u201d was eliminated for the following reason:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">Existing law does not specifically provide for the exclusion of homosexuals and sex perverts. The provisions of S. 716 which specifically excluded homosexuals and sex perverts as a separate excludable class does not appear in the instant bill. The Public Health Service has advised that the provision for the exclusion of aliens afflicted with psychopathic personality or a mental defect which appears in the instant bill is sufficiently broad to provide for the exclusion of homosexuals and sex perverts. <em>This change of nomenclature is not to be construed in any way as modifying the intent to exclude all aliens who are sexual deviates, </em>S.Rep.No.1137, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 9 (1952) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">While S. 2550 was not enacted, the report accompanying H.R. 5678, the bill which ultimately became the Act of 1952, contained similar reference to observations by the Public Health Service. Commenting on the medical aspects of a predecessor bill (H.R. 2379, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., \u00a7 212(a) (1951)), which had placed \u201chomosexuals or sex perverts\u201d in a separate excludable category, the Public Health Service recommended that this separate rubric be eliminated and that the phrase \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d\u2014 the terminology ultimately enacted \u2014 be employed. The Service noted that this phraseology would satisfy the Congressional objective of excluding homosexuals and perverts because ordinarily sexual deviation was a manifestation of a psychopathic personality. In reporting out the bill, which was to become the 1952 Act, the House Judiciary Committee indicated that, with an exception not here relevant, it had accepted the Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Health Service\u2019s recommendations. H.R. Rep.No.1365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 46-48 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Thus, on the basis of this brief survey of the legislative history of section 212 (a) (4), it seems fairly clear that Congress utilized the phrase \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d not as a medical or psychiatric formulation but as a legal term of art designed to preclude the admission of homosexual aliens into the United States. \u201c[W]hatever the phrase \u2018psychopathic personality\u2019 may mean to the psychiatrist, to the Congress it was intended to include homosexuals and sex perverts. It is that intent which controls here.\u201d Quiroz v. Neelly, 291 F.2d 906, 907 (5th Cir. 1961). See also, Ganduxe y Marino v. Murff, 183 F.Supp. 565 (S.D.N.Y.1959), affirmed without opinion sub nom. Ganduxe y Marino v. Esperdy, 278 F.2d 330 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 824, 81 S.Ct. 61, 5 L.Ed. 2d 53 (1960) ; United States v. Flores-Rodriguez, 237 F.2d 405, 412-413, n. 2 (2d Cir. 1954) (concurring opinion).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\"> Our review of the legislative history of section 212(a) (4) also disposes of Boutilier\u2019s contention that the Public Health Service exceeded its statutory authority by classifying all homosexuals as persons \u201cafflicted with psychopathic personality.\u201d Paragraph 6-b of the United States Public Health Service Manual provides that in the category of psychopathic personality \u201cwill be classified those applicants who are diagnosed as sexual deviates.\u201d While some psychiatrists believe that .all homosexuals cannot properly be termed psychopaths,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Paragraph 6-b also notes that the phrase \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d is a \u201clegal\u201d term. Moreover, as we have observed, since Congress intended to exclude homosexual aliens, the Public Health Service cannot be faulted for implementing this statutory purpose by utilizing an automatic rule which functions in such a way as to accomplish this objective.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-14\">Placing principal reliance on Fleuti v. Rosenberg, 302 F.2d 652 (9th Cir. 1962), remanded on other grounds, 374 U.S. 449, 83 S.Ct. 1804, 10 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1963), Boutilier vigorously maintains that section 212(a) (4) is void for vagueness and that the order directing his deportation deprived him of due process. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has found this argument persuasive and, citing Fleuti, has recently adhered to this view in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion, Lavoie v. United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, 360 F.2d 27 (9th Cir. 1966). At the heart of Boutilier\u2019s argument is the notion that the term \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d lacked sufficient precision to convey adequate warning to him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>that post-entry homosexual conduct was proscribed. Upon examining the rationale of the void-for-vagueness doctrine, however, we conclude that it is inapplicable to section 212(a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"> Although it is a legal fiction that everyone is presumed to know the law, that precept does not always come to the aid of the prosecutor nor work against the transgressor. A corollary of this doctrine is that legislation must be sufficiently precise to afford adequate notice of the standards by which the individuals affected are required to guide themselves. \u201cThe underlying principle is that no man shall be held criminally responsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.\u201d United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 617, 74 S.Ct. 808, 812, 98 L.Ed. 989 (1954). While the void-for-vagueness doctrine is principally employed in the interpretation and application of criminal statutes, it is also relevant in considering legislation imposing civil sanctions. Jordan v. De George, 341 U.S. 223, 71 S.Ct. 703, 95 L.Ed. 886 (1951);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Small Co. v. American Sugar Refining Co., 267 U.S. 233, 45 S.Ct. 295, 69 L.Ed. 589 (1925); Miller v. Strahl, 239 U.S. 426, 36 S.Ct. 147, 60 L.Ed. 364 (1915) ; see generally, Note, Due Process Requirements of Definiteness in Statutes, 62 Harv.L.Rev. 77 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">We do not quarrel with Boutilier\u2019s contention that the term \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d is not a model of clarity. There is no denial that Congress sought assurance that the phrase would encompass homosexuals and sex perverts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And, while the Public Health Service counseled that \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d was sufficiently broad to fulfill the Congressional objective of excluding sexual deviates, the Service candidly advised that, in terms of medical reference, the definition was \u201cvague and indefinite,\u201d and that \u201cno more appropriate expression can be suggested at this time.\u201d H.R.Rep.No. 1365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 46-47 U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News, p. 1700 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">But all this does not establish that section 212(a) (4) is defective under the void-for-vagueness doctrine. The provision was never designed to regulate conduct; its function was to exclude aliens possessing certain <em>characteristics. </em>Had Boutilier, after entering the United States in 1955, commenced leading a life of impeccable morality, section 212(a) (4) would still have been applicable to authorize his deportation. And, we emphasize that the section does not focus on Boutilier\u2019s post-entry behavior but on his condition at the time of entry into the United States. It is beyond contest that he was a homosexual long before leaving Canada. It is not without significance also that in <em>Fleuti, </em>the Court noted \u201cthe examining officer chose to rely heavily upon post-entry behavior.\u201d It may well be that the Court found it necessary, therefore, to determine whether the term \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d was sufficiently precise to afford adequate warning to Fleuti. In the case before us, however, while the Special Inquiry Officer credited Boutilier\u2019s sworn statement which described in detail the full history of his homosexual behavior, there is not the slightest indication that the Officer failed to understand that section 212(a) (4) was directed solely at a pre-entry condition. For these reasons, we do not consider <em>Fleuti </em>authoritative, and we believe that the order directing Boutilier\u2019s deportation did not constitute a denial of due process on the void-for-vagueness doctrine or any other grounds. We find that the clear design of Congress was to exclude homosexuals from entry into the country and this it has done in section 212(a) (4) by the use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>words \u201cpsychopathic personality.\u201d It is not our function to sit in judgment on Congress\u2019 wisdom in enacting the law. \u201cCourts must reconstruct the past solution imaginatively in its setting and project the purposes which inspired [the law] * * * \u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> L. Hand, \u201cThe Contribution of an Independent Judiciary to Civilization,\u201d published in The Spirit of Liberty (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">We have considered Boutilier\u2019s other contentions and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The petition for review is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-7\">. \u201cHomosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function produced by a certain arrest of sexual development.\u201d Freud, \u201cLetter to an American Mother,\u201d published in 107 Am.

In pertinent part, it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-15\">[Boutiiier\u2019s] sexual structure still appears fluid and immature so that he moves from homosexual to heterosexual interest as well as abstinence with almost equal facility.

My own feeling is that his own need to fit in and be accepted is so great that it far surpasses his need for sex in any form.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b539-16\">. The government noted, however, that it considered the phrase \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d appearing in Dr. Ullman\u2019s letter to be used in a medical frame of reference and not as a legal term of art.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b540-10\">. It could be urged that Boutilier is es-topped from making this contention in view of bis rejection of the government\u2019s offer to have the Public Health Service conduct an <em>in personam </em>examination. But, in view of the serious consequences of a deportation order and the government\u2019s failure to press this point, we shall make our determination on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b541-6\">.

The committee reports of both houses state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">To resolve any doubt the Committee has specifically included the term \u201csexual deviation\u201d as a ground of exclusion in this bill. H.R.Rep. No. 745, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 16 (1965). S. Rep. No. 748, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 19 (1965).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b542-10\">. See e. g. n. 6, supra.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-11\">Dr. Paul G. Smith who signed the certification of Boutilier\u2019s condition as a \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d testified that modern psychiatric theory does not espouse the proposition that a sexual deviate is <em>ipso facto </em>a constitutional psychopathic inferior or a psychopathic personality. Matter of Anne-Lise Cop-po, a deportation proceeding, file No. A-6845593 \u2014 New York (December 8, 1965).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-16\">But, as we have noted, in the context of this case, psychiatric definitions are not determinative of the legal jrarport of the term \u201cpsychopathic personality.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b542-17\">. We also reject Boutilier\u2019s contention that there was insufficient evidence of his \u201cpsychopathic personality at the time of his entry into the United States to justify deportation. Boutilier\u2019s sworn statement describing in detail his homosexual activities in Ganada provided more than ample proof of his excludable condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b543-6\">. In De <em>George, </em>the Supreme Court determined that the phrase \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d appearing in the predecessor of section 241, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a) was not unconstitutionally vague. Significantly, section 241 which authorizes deportation of aliens wlio are convicted of at least two crimes involving \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d attempts, unlike section 212(a) (4), to regulate post-entry conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b543-9\">. See discussion of the legislative history of section 212(a) (4), supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b544-8\">. The dissent, while possessing <em>ad hominem </em>appeal, falls into error by improperly shifting the focus from a legal exegesis to a medical explanation of the term \u201cpsychopathic personality.\u201d As Judge Moore noted in his dissent in United States ex rel. Paktorovics v. Murff, 260 F.2d 610, 618 (2d Cir. 1958), \u201cemotional reaction should not blind us to the fact that our immigration policy has been, and still should be, declared by Congress, and enforced by such officers of government as are so designated by Congress.\u201d Unfortunately, our dissenting colleague has failed to follow his own caveat.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Although his plea for \u201cclemency\u201d is quite moving, it is illustrative of the ease with which one can succumb in a case such as this to the temptation of permitting the emotions to overwhelm reason and enacted law. Congress has made its judgment, for better or worse, respecting the exclusion of homosexuals which we are not at liberty to alter. The dissent\u2019s parade of distinguished liis-torical personages allegedly possessing homosexual attributes does not detract one iota from that conclusion. Indeed, under the current version of section 212 (a) (4), see n. 10, supra, there is little doubt that some of these eminent gentlemen would be excludable.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">Thus, while the house of horrors erected by our dissenting brother stimulates the imagination and arouses our sympathy, it is largely irrelevant. Congress studiously avoided turning this into a medical problem and did not authorize immigration officials to conduct a detailed psychiatric examination into the nature, frequency and variety of a particular homosexual\u2019s acts; rather, it enacted a deareut rule of law: it determined that pre-entry homosexual behavior was to be a ground for exclusion. And, neither citations to the Sonnets of Michelangelo and Campanella, to the New York Times, nor even to Annie Get Your Gun will aid us in our statutory interpretation or change this simple fact of life.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b544-6\">MOORE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Amd\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The majority upholds the deportation of a young man who arrived in this country in 1955, who has worked hard and gainfully ever since, who is respected in his work, and most of whose close relatives \u2014 including his mother, his stepfather, and three of his five brothers and sisters \u2014 reside in this country. The majority does so on the grounds that at the time the petitioner entered this country at the age of 21, he could have been excluded as one \u201cafflicted with psychopathic personality\u201d under \u00a7 212(a) (4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (4), since he had had a number of homosexual experiences before coming to this country. The majority manifestly agrees with the Board of Immigration Appeals \u201cthat the term \u2018psychopathic personality\u2019 is a term of art and that it includes an alien upon mere proof that he is a homosexual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAEx\">Petitioner\u2019s homosexual experiences were revealed not in any proceeding at the time of original entry but solely as a voluntary disclosure some 8 years after entry (September 1963) in connection with a petition for naturalization. The admission of an arrest for sodomy in October 1959 (charge reduced and ultimately dismissed) led to a request for further information which petitioner again supplied voluntarily. The most adverse conclusion which can be derived from petitioner\u2019s statements is that petitioner engaged in sexual activity on a quite infrequent basis with both men and women during the five-year period before his coming to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">Both the procedure and the statutory interpretation used by the immigration authorities in this deportation proceeding are not only offensive to, but, in my opinion, completely lacking in, due process, for interrelated reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Appellant was adjudged \u201cafflicted with psychopathic personality\u201d without any formal examination by qualified psychiatrists. The majority states that appellant\u2019s history was referred to the Public Health Service \u201cfor its expert views as to whether there are grounds for concluding that Boutilier was excludable * * The word-picture suggests a careful and particularized analysis by distinguished psychiatrists to determine whether appellant was so disturbed as to be \u201cafflicted with psychopathic personality.\u201d Nothing could be further from what actually happened. The Public Health Service simply looked at appellant\u2019s statement in which he admitted having had homosexual experiences before he came to this country, and automatically stamped him a \u201cpsychopathic personality, sexual deviate,\u201d following the directive of the Public Health Service manual that under the category of psychopathic personality \u201cwill be classified those applicants who are diagnosed as sexual deviates.\u201d This was not the result of process, \u201cdue\u201d or otherwise; it was the result of a mere fiat in a Public Health Service manual which labels as \u201cpsychopathic personalities\u201d many who upon proper psychiatric examination might be found to possess no psychopathic symptoms.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">This lack of careful case-by-case determination cannot be upheld simply because this is a proceeding to deport rather than a proceeding to exclude. If anything, greater procedural safeguards are constitutionally required in cases of deportation than in cases of exclusion, because of the greater hardship involved in uprooting an alien from a country once he has developed economic and social ties there and slackened or severed those which bound him to his country of origin. Compare United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537, 70 S.Ct. 309, 94 L.Ed. 317 (1950) (alien can be excluded without a hearing) with The Japanese Immigrant Case, 189 U.S. 86, 101, 23 S.Ct. 611, 47 L.Ed. 721 (1903) (alien sought to be deported is constitutionally entitled to a hearing) and Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding, 344 U.S. 590, 73 S.Ct. 472, 97 L.Ed. 576 (1953) (resident alien seeking re-entry is constitutionally entitled to a hearing); see also Wong Yang Sun v. McGrath, 339 U.S. 33, 70 S.Ct. 445, 94 L.Ed. 616 (1950) (administrative hearing in deportation case must conform to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">The lack of careful \u2014 in fact the lack of any \u2014 medical examination and analysis was not peculiar to the proceedings against the present petitioner, but results from a long-standing statutory interpretation, promulgated by the immigration authorities and embodied in the Public Health Service manual, that mere proof of homosexuality constitutes a demonstration of the existence of \u201cpsychopathic personality.\u201d Under such circumstances, it would have been futile for the petitioner to request an examination by a board of Public Health Service doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">I cannot impute to Congress an intention that the term \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d in the 1952 amendments of the Immigration and Nationality Act be construed to cover anyone who had ever had a homosexual experience. Professor Kinsey estimated that \u201cat least 37 per cent\u201d of the American male population has at least one homosexual experience, defined in terms of physical contact to the point of orgasm, between the beginning of adolescence and old age. Kinsey, Pomeroy &amp; Martin, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male 623 (1948). Earlier estimates had ranged from one per cent to 100 per cent. Id. at 616-622. The sponsors of Britain\u2019s current reform bill on homosexuality have indicated that one male in 25 is a homosexual in Britain.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To label a group so large \u201cexcludable aliens\u201d would be tantamount to saying that Sappho,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Leonardo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>da Vinci,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Michelangelo,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Andre Gide,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and perhaps even Shakespeare,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> were they to come to life again, would be deemed unfit to visit our shores. Indeed, so broad a definition might well comprise more than a few members of legislative bodies.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">At most, the legislative history of the 1952 amendments indicates that Congress intended to exclude those who were \u201csexual deviates\u201d at the time of entry into this country, see S.Rep. No. 1137, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 9 (1952). The term \u201csexual deviate\u201d suggests someone with a long-lasting and perhaps compulsive orientation towards homosexual or otherwise \u201cabnormal\u201d behavior. The Public Health Service report on which the House \u2022Judiciary Committee relied in its discussion of the bill as finally enacted, see H. R. Rep. No. 1365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 46-8 (1952), indicates a narrower definition of the term \u201cpsychopathic personality.\u201d That report states that \u201cpsychopathic personalities\u201d are \u201cdisorders of the personality * * * characterized by developmental defects or pathological trends in the personality structure manifest by lifelong patterns of action or behavior,\u201d and that those \u201cpsychopathic personalities\u201d who are \u201cill primarily in terms of society and the prevailing culture * * * frequently [evidently not always] include those * * * suffering from sexual deviation.\u201d U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News, pp. 1700-1701, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. (1952). This legislative history suggests that Congress contemplated an inquiry in each case, to be performed by skilled psychiatrists, into whether the homosexual activity of a given individual amounted to such a \u201cdisorder of the personality\u201d as to constitute \u201cpsychopathic personality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Even assuming that Congress intended the term \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d to cover anyone who was a sexual deviate at the time of entry, petitioner had no way of knowing that \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d meant what Congress intended it to mean. \u201cPsychopathic personality\u201d may not be so vague as to be meaningless in all applications, as some have suggested, see Note, Limitations on Congressional Power to Deport Resident Aliens as Psychopaths at Time of Entry, 68 Yale L.J. 931 (1959), even though the Public Health Service itself has admitted that the term is \u201cvague and indefinite.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 1365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 46-7 (1952). The term \u201cnecessitates a personal estimate of community mores,\u201d ibid, at 943 n. 46; but so does the term \u201cmoral turpitude,\u201d held not unconstitutionally vague in Jordan v. De George, 341 U.S. 223, 71 S.Ct. 703, 95 L.Ed. 886 (1951). Moreover, the term has been given some concreteness by judicial definition. See United States v. Flores-Rodriguez, 237 F.2d 405, 411 (2d Cir. 1956); United States ex rel. Leon v. Murff, 250 F.2d 436, 439 (2d Cir. 1937). However, the courts have said that those afflicted with \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d are \u201cindividuals who show a life-long * * * tendency not to conform to group customs, and who habitually misbehave so flagrantly that they are continually in trouble with the authorities.\u201d <em>Flores-Rodriguez, </em>supra, 237 F.2d at 411 (discussing the earlier statutory term \u201cconstitutional psychopathic inferiority,\u201d but suggesting that it was largely interchangeable with \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d) ; see <em>Leon, </em>supra, 250 F.2d at 439 (citing a Public Health Service regulation apparently no longer in effect providing that \u201c[t]here shall be certified as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>cases of constitutional psychopathic inferiority all psychopathic characters such as * * * persons who because of eccentric behavior, defective judgment or abnormal impulses are in repeated conflict with social customs and constitutional authorities\u201d); see also Note, 68 Yale L.J. 931, 940 (1959) (\u201cidentifying characteristic\u201d of \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d \u201cis a long-standing pattern of culturally unacceptable behavior\u201d). In the present case, there was no evidence to show that petitioner\u2019s sexual deviation was such as to put him in repeated conflict with the authorities. His discussion of his homosexual activities before and after his entry into this country indicates that they were consensual acts between adults, almost always in private places. Contrast <em>Flores-Rodr\u00edguez, </em>supra (blatant exhibitionist solicitation in public places). In short, neither the term \u201cpsychopathic personality\u201d nor its interpretations by the courts prior to petitioner\u2019s entry gave petitioner \u201csufficiently definite warning * * * when measured by common understanding and practices,\u201d Jordan v. De George, 341 U.S. 223, 231-232, 71 S.Ct. 703 (1951), that his conduct could serve as a basis for exclusion or deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Had the petitioner known that sexual deviation <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> at the time of entry would be automatic grounds for exclusion, there is considerable reason to believe that he could have modified his behavior so that he could not be considered a deviate at the time of entry. He was young, intelligent, and responsible. While he had engaged in homosexual acts from the age of 16 to the age of 21, he had also had sexual relations with women three or four times during this period. Dr. Montague Ullman, Director of Psychiatric Services in the Maimonides Hospital of Brooklyn and Professor of Psychiatry at the State University of New York, described petitioner\u2019s condition as late as March 1965 in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">\u201cThe patient has sexual interest in girls and has had intercourse with them on a number of occasions. * * * His sexual structure still appears fluid and immature so that he moves from homosexual to heterosexual interests as well as abstinence with almost equal facility. His homosexual orientation seems secondary to a very constricted, dependent personality pattern rather than occurring in the context of a psychopathic personality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Another psychiatrist who examined petitioner, Dr. Edward F. Falsey, concluded that petitioner \u201cis not psychotic\u201d and that \u201cthe prognosis in therapy is reasonably good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">In brief, petitioner has been ordered deported because of the existence at the time of his entry into this country of a psychological condition which he probably would have been able to correct had he had any reasonable warning that the existence o'f the condition could serve as a basis for exclusion or, still more drastic, for deportation after entry. He received no warning. I agree with the Ninth Circuit that to uphold a deportation order under these circumstances is repugnant to due process. Fleuti v.
