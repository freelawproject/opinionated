SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b320-28\">These cases are before the court on petitions filed by both the union and the employer to review a final order of the National Labor Relations Board. The Board has filed, a cross-petition to enforce its order requiring the company to bargain in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Pursuant to a secret ballot election, the union was certified on October 5, 1961, as the collective bargaining representative of all production employees at the employer\u2019s Danville, Virginia, plant. After four years of bargaining and two orders from the Board requiring the employer to cease and desist from refusing to bargain collectively with the union, the second of which included the provision that the employer also cease and desist from \u201cinterfering with, restraining or coercing employees in the exercise of their right to self-organization * * no agreement has been reached. It is the second order which is the subject of these proceedings, the first order having been summarily enforced on July 17, 1964, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit after the company filed no exceptions to the trial examiner\u2019s findings or proposed order. See 61 Stat. 147 (1947), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The narrow issue presented by the present proceeding, according to the trial examiner, is \u201cwhether, as the General Counsel contends, [the employer\u2019s] position on the Union\u2019s demands for a cheek off was a mere device to frustrate agreement on a contract, or whether, as [the employer] contends, it was merely engaging in \u2018hard bargaining,\u2019 with no intention of preventing an agreement.\u201d The trial examiner concluded that the employer\u2019s refusal to grant a check-off was \u201cfor the purpose of frustrating agreement with the Union and hence [the employer had] engaged in bad-faith bargaining.\u201d The Board, through a three-member panel convened pursuant to Section 3 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the National Labor Relations Act, adopted the trial examiner\u2019s findings, conclusions, recommendations and proposed order.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">The employer, citing Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951), maintains that the trial examiner\u2019s finding that the company refused to agree to a dues check-off provision in order to frustrate an agreement is not supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. It argues that, while Section 8(d) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Act requires good faith bargaining, it does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession. Our study of the record, however, convinces us that the Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, and that the company\u2019s adamant refusal to consider a union dues check-off for those employees who individually requested it did indeed frustrate the bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">In the prior proceeding, in which the Board likewise found violations of Sections 8(a) (5)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (l)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ***of the Act, in addition to making unilateral changes in working conditions which it had refused to grant the union, the company had also refused to agree to an arbitration provision while insisting on a no-strike clause. This insistence, the Board found, demonstrated bad faith bargaining on the part of the company contrary to the observation in Textile Workers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448, 455, 77 S.Ct. 912, 917, 1 L.Ed. 2d 972 (1957), that \u201c * * * the agreement to arbitrate grievance disputes is the <em>quid pro quo </em>for an agreement not to strike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">In spite of the Board\u2019s order in the prior proceeding, it was not until ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>months and 20 bargaining sessions following its issuance that the company receded from the position which the Board had found to amount to an unfair labor practice. When bargaining was resumed after the Board\u2019s prior order, some 14 items were open and unresolved. At the time of the final meeting on September 10, 1964, only three items remained unresolved, the union having given in on all of the others.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Throughout the negotiations, both before the prior order and subsequent to it, the union had insisted on a dues checkoff. The union maintains no office in Danville, that area being serviced from Roanoke, Virginia, a distance of about 85 miles. Moreover, the 300 company employees live within a radius of from 35 to 40 miles from Danville. Thus without a check-off, or some adequate substitute therefor, the collection of dues would have presented the union with a substantial problem of communication and transportation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-18\">The company admitted that it had no general policy against a dues check-off; that indeed in some of its divisions the bargaining agreements so provide.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The company admitted, too, that the refusal to check off union dues at the Danville plant was not based on inconvenience.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a matter of fact, the Danville plant was checking off from the salaries of its employees for purchase of United States savings bonds, dependents\u2019 coverage under health insurance, United Fund, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>a Good Neighbor Fund.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The company\u2019s position, as stated by its counsel and by its chief negotiator, was simply that \u201cour purpose in denying check-off was that we were not going to aid and comfort the union.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">It is clear from the record in this case that the prior order of the Board, drawn, as is the order in suit here, in terms of the statute,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> requiring the company to bargain in good faith, was ineffective. Instead of starting a new Section 10(b)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> proceeding, the Board no doubt could have requested the Fourth Circuit to cite the company for contempt for continuing failure to bargain in good faith. Certainly a succession of Section 10(b) proceedings resulting in Board orders cast in statutory language is not the answer where refusal to bargain persists. In order to eliminate further frustration of the purposes of the Act,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the union suggests that the Board should have included in its order a provision requiring the company to withdraw its objection to the dues check-off. Moreover, \u2022 the union suggests that, since the company not only refused the check-off but also refused to allow the union to collect dues during non-working hours on nonworking areas of the company premises,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> a further provision should be included in the Board\u2019s order protecting this statutory right as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>It is true, as the company contends, that under Section 8(d)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> it cannot be compelled to agree to a proposal or make a concession. But neither can refusal to make concessions be used \u201cas a cloak * * * to conceal a purposeful strategy to make bargaining futile * N. L. R. B. v. Herman Sausage Co., 5 Cir., 275 F.2d 229, 232 (1960). \u201cCollective bargaining, then, is not simply an occasion for purely formal meetings between management and labor, while each maintains an attitude of \u2018take it or leave it\u2019; it presupposes a desire to reach ultimate agreement, to enter into a collective bargaining contract.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Insurance Agents\u2019 Intern. Union, 361 U.S. 477, 485, 80 S.Ct. 419, 425, 4 L.Ed.2d 454 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\"> While it is clear from the record that the company had no reason, other than to frustrate the bargaining procedure, to refuse to accept the dues checkoff,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> it is not necessary to include a specific reference to the check-off in the Board\u2019s order.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Nor, in the circumstances of this case, is it necessary to provide in the order that the union shall have the right to collect dues during nonworking hours on non-working areas of the company\u2019s premises.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In any contempt proceeding, the record made before the Board in both Section 10(b) proceedings will be available to this court. Thus we will be in a position to make a judgment based not only on the Board\u2019s order, but on the entire record of this company\u2019s performance at the bargaining table.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">Affirmed and enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-5\">. 73 Stat. 542 (1959), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b321-6\">. 61 Stat. 142 (1947), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b321-7\">. 61 Stat. 141 (1947), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b321-8\">. 61 Stat. 140 (1947), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1).

When parties began meeting in October of 1963, how many items were there that the union was demanding; before they would agree to a contract?</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">A.

What\u2019s happening to those issues that you didn\u2019t refer to in your testimony earlier?</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">A. In the hopes of getting an agreement, the union gradually held twenty meetings, and dropped all those demands except those I mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">The examiner reported that subsequent to the Board\u2019s prior order \u201ceach of the parties withdrew certain of its bargaining proposals.\u201d With reference to the company\u2019s concessions, the examiner is apparently referring to the withdrawal of the company\u2019s no-strike clause demand without arbitration, which withdrawal was required by the Board\u2019s prior order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b322-13\">.

If after such good-faith bargaining the parties reach an agreement or an impasse, the requirements of the Act will have been fulfilled. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">This footnote is inconsistent with the trial examiner\u2019s finding that the company\u2019s refusal to grant a check-off was \u201cfor the purpose of frustrating agreement with the Union and hence [the company had] engaged in bad-faith bargaining.\u201d To suggest that in further bargaining the company may refuse a check-off for some other reason, not heretofore advanced, makes a mockery of the collective bargaining required by the statute.

MILLER, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"aj-dedup-0\">dissenting in No. 19,507:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">It is my view that the Labor Board\u2019s decision, here under review, is not supported by substantial evidence when the record is considered as a whole in the manner described and prescribed by Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). Consequently, I cannot agree with my brothers of the majority when they say in their opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\">\u201c * * * Our study of the record, however, convinces us that the Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, and that the company\u2019s adamant refusal to consider a union dues checkoff for those employees who individually requested it did indeed frustrate the bargaining.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The union was just as adamant in refusing to sign a contract which did not contain a checkoff clause or some other means of company aid in collecting union dues. Its representative informed the Company\u2019s negotiator of this firm purpose, and counsel for the Board\u2019s General Counsel (the charging party) told the examiner that his inquiry showed the union would not sign a contract without a checkoff. Thus, the union never intended to bargain on that issue; it simply stated it must have a dues collection provision or there would be no contract. In these circumstances, it is difficult for me to understand how it can be said that the Porter Company\u2019s position on the checkoff issue \u201cdid indeed frustrate the bargaining.\u201d Because of the union\u2019s attitude on the issue \u2014 its stated determination not to negotiate in good faith with respect to it \u2014 bargaining as to a checkoff provision was impossible from the beginning. Yet it is the Company, not the union, which has been found guilty of an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The examiner\u2019s decision, adopted by the Board, dwelt on the union\u2019s need for a checkoff which could be granted by the Company without inconvenience to itself. And the majority opinion notes the union\u2019s consistent insistence on a dues checkoff and attempts to justify it by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">\u201c * * * The union maintains no office in Danville, that area being serviced from Roanoke, Virginia, a distance of about 85 miles. Moreover, the 300 company employees live within a radius of from 35 to 40 miles from Dan-ville. Thus without a check-off, or some adequate substitute therefor, the collection of dues would have presented the union with a substantial problem of communication and transportation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALO\">But the record shows the union has a mailing address at the home of a member in Danville. Members could mail their dues to that address or to the office in Roanoke, or dues could be collected at the monthly union meetings. Moreover, it was shown that the union has a potential income of $1,500 per month from the Danville members, which would seem to justify the establishment of a small office in that town where dues could be paid. Thus there was no real necessity for the union\u2019s unalterable insistence on a checkoff clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Nevertheless, the examiner said in his decision :<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-11\">\u201c * * * I f\u00a1nfj an(j conclude that with respect to the issue of checkoff, Respondent [the Company] bargained with the Union from October 23, 1963, through September 10, 1964, in bad faith and thereby violated Section 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">He also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-13\">\u201c * * * My careful consideration of the entire record convinces me that Plant Manager Jones, Respondent\u2019s chief negotiator, took the position he did with respect to the checkoff issue, for the purpose of frustrating agreement with the Union, and hence engaged in bad-faith bargaining. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">He said he based the foregoing conclusion upon three \u201cfactors,\u201d which I here reproduce, largely in his own words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-15\">1.

Jones, the Company\u2019s negotiator, while testifying in the present proceeding, \u201cconvinced me that his attitude toward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>collective bargaining had not changed since he testified in the prior case.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\">2. \u201cJones\u2019 explanation for [sic] his refusal to agree to any of the Union\u2019s suggestions for the collection of its dues, namely, that he did not wish to give aid and comfort to the Union by assisting it in collecting dues, if not actually a false reason, evidences an attitude inconsistent with the obligation imposed upon an employer by the Act.\u201d This reason for refusing to agree to a checkoff tended, the examiner said, to disparage or discredit the union in the eyes of the employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">3. \u201cIn the instant case Respondent seeks to explain away the fact that at other plants it has contracts with unions which provide for a checkoff, by arguing, in substance, that those provisions were brought about by reason of the economic strength of the union there involved, and urges that the Union\u2019s remedy in this ease was to call a strike rather than prosecute an unfair labor practice charge. Not only does such a position by an employer run counter to the objectives of the Act which Congress set forth in its statement of \u2018Findings and Policies\u2019 (see Section 1 of the Act), but it also demonstrates that Respondent\u2019s purpose was to forestall reaching an agreement with the Union by the expedient of disparaging the latter in the eyes of the employees. Cf. Sunbeam Plastic Corporation, 144 NLRB 1010. This would seem to be particularly true in view of Respondent\u2019s admission that checking off union dues would impose no burden upon it, and its admitted checkoff for Government Bond and United Givers Fund, neither of which seem particularly necessary for the promotion of Respondent\u2019s business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Thus it is apparent the examiner based his conclusion that the Company had bargained in bad faith upon three \u201cfactors,\u201d none of which rises to the level of proof: (a) that Jones\u2019s demeanor showed anti-union animus, and (b) that two of the positions taken by the Company during bargaining tended to disparage or discredit the union in the eyes of the employees. Nothing else in the record was pointed out by the examiner as supporting his conclusion, and I have discovered nothing which in the slightest degree supports it. His conclusion, then, stands or falls on the validity of the antiunion animus and union disparagement \u201cfactors\u201d which he expressly set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">Antiunion animus on the part of an employer, even if shown by the record, is not an unfair labor practice. Metal Processors\u2019 Union, etc. v. N. L. R. B., 119 U.S.App.D.C. 78, 81, 337 F.2d 114, 117 (1964). For that reason, the first of the three \u201cfactors\u201d upon which the examiner relied to support his conclusion of bad-faith bargaining falls of its own weight, even if the examiner\u2019s holding of Jones\u2019s alleged antiunion animus had been borne out by the record. But here the examiner did not purport to base his finding of antiunion animus on any evidence in the record, but merely on his own statement that \u201cJones\u2019 demeanor while testifying in the immediate proceeding convinced me that his attitude toward collective bargaining had not changed since he testified in the prior case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">The \u201cprior case\u201d to which the examiner referred arose from a complaint charging the Porter Company with bad-faith bargaining because, after 28 bargaining sessions between November 3, 1961, and November 27, 1962, the parties had not reached an agreement. The recommended order of the examiner in the prior case, issued with his decision on September 20, 1963, required the Company, upon request, to bargain with the union. Without waiting for the Board\u2019s decision,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Company began almost immediately to bargain with the union as ordered by the examiner in the prior case. The parties met in 21 bargaining sessions, beginning October 23, 1963, and ending September 10,1964. These meetings, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>subject of the present proceeding, were fruitful. Of the 14 issues which were open and unresolved when the meetings began October 23, 1963, 11 were resolved by the process of bargaining, so that only three remained unresolved at the adjournment of the final session on September 10, 1964. These were wages, health and life insurance, and checkoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">The examiner in the earlier case did not find that Jones had antiunion animus; the present examiner decided that for himself from a reading of the prior examiner\u2019s decision, and then concluded that Jones\u2019s demeanor in the present proceeding showed he still had that animus. The present examiner said in this connection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">\u201cI fully recognize that because an employer engaged in bad-faith bargaining in one set of negotiations, it does not necessarily follow that the employer\u2019s subsequent bargaining negotiations were conducted in bad faith. I merely hold that an employer\u2019s bad-faith bargaining in the prior negotiations is a factor to be considered, along with the other circumstances of the case, in determining whether his subsequent bargaining was in good faith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Although the examiner found that, with respect to the checkoff issue the Company bargained with the union in bad faith and ordered resumption of bargaining, he expressly disclaimed any intention to require the Company to agree to aid in the collection of dues. Footnote 9 to the examiner\u2019s decision contains the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">\u201cThis is not to say that in the resumed bargaining sessions which I shall recommend, Respondent will be required to agree to some form of checkoff. I only find and conclude that on that issue Respondent did not heretofore bargain in good faith, and that it should be required to do so. If after such good-faith bargaining, the parties reach an agreement or an impasse, the requirements of the Act will have been fulfilled. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Thus the examiner gave lip service to Section 8(d) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7. 158(d), which is in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">\u201cFor the purposes of this section, to bargain collectively is the performance of the mutual obligation of the employer and the representative of the employees to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment * * * <em>but such obligation does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession </em>* * (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">But his decision that, by not agreeing to a dues collection provision, which he thought the union badly needed and which would cause it no inconvenience, the Company had not bargained in good faith, left no room for doubt that what he termed good-faith bargaining would require the Company to yield on the checkoff issue. This is, of course, contrary to the express provision of the statute quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">This leaves for consideration the other two \u201cfactors\u201d upon which the examiner based his conclusion of bad-faith bargaining on the part of the Company. First, as he put it,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-13\">\u201cJones\u2019 explanation for his refusal to agree to any of the Union\u2019s suggestions for the collection of its dues, namely, that he did not wish to give aid and comfort to the Union by assisting it in collecting dues, if not actually a false reason, evidences an attitude inconsistent with the obligation imposed upon an employer by the Act. The very act of bargaining with a union, thus granting it recognition as the representative of the employees, in and of itself gives aid, comfort, assistance and prestige to that Union. But the policies of the Act, and the basic principles upon which it rests, require an employer to give this kind of \u2018aid and comfort\u2019 to the designated representatives of its employees. For, as the Board had held in a somewhat comparable situation, it is inconsistent with the bargaining obligation which the Act imposes upon an employer for the latter to conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>negotiations with the statutory representative in such a manner as to disparage or discredit the statutory representative in the eyes of its employee constituents. General Electric Company, 150 NLRB No. 36.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The second \u201cfactor\u201d was another statement of the Company, to which I have heretofore referred. The examiner said it showed the employer\u2019s purpose \u201cwas to forestall reaching an agreement with the Union by the expedient of disparaging the latter in the eyes of the employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The examiner was indeed hard put to it when he concocted these two \u201cfactors\u201d as bases for his conclusion. He confused the union with its members and erroneously thought an employer is somehow required to avoid any act which may disparage or discredit a union in the eyes of the employees. The Act is for the benefit of employees and not unions and, as Mr. Justice Rutledge said, \u201cNothing in the Act requires an employer to maintain a union\u2019s prestige * * <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Additionally, I point out that the examiner did not expressly find that the Company said or did anything which actually disparaged or discredited the union; he merely said disparaging or discrediting a union is inconsistent with an employer\u2019s duty under the Act. As Mr. Justice Rutledge said, 326 U.S. at 399, 66 S.Ct. at 216, \u201cSomething more than supposition should underlie a conclusion which supports a finding of unfair practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The fact that the examiner\u2019s three \u201cfactors\u201d fall so far short of supporting his conclusion of bad-faith bargaining on the part of the Company, and the further fact that the record considered as a whole is devoid of support for his conclusion, lead me to think the examiner was actuated by antimanagement animus. The three-member panel of the Board which rubber-stamped the examiner\u2019s decision either did so without examining the record or, I suggest, shared his antimanagement animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Before concluding, I call attention to the following statement in the majority opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">\u201c * * * When bargaining was resumed after the Board\u2019s prior order, some 14 items were open and unresolved. At the time of the final meeting on September 10,1964, only three items remained unresolved, <em>the union having given in on all of the others.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">The italicized clause is erroneous. Even the examiner did not go so far; on this subject, his decision said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-12\">\u201c * * * During the negotiations which followed, each of the parties withdrew certain of its bargaining proposals, so that upon adjournment of the final meeting on September 10, only 3 items remained unresolved. These were wages, health and life insurance, and checkoff. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">I have heretofore quoted a portion of the examiner\u2019s footnote 9 to show that even he realized he could not order the Company to agree to a checkoff because Section 8(d) of the Act provides that the mutual obligation of an employer and a union to confer in good faith</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-14\">\u201c * * * does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-16\">With respect to this the majority opinion says in footnote 16:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-17\">\u201cFootnote 9 in the trial examiner\u2019s findings reads in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-18\">\u201c \u2018This is not to say that in the resumed bargaining sessions which I shall recommend, Respondent will be required to agree to some form of check off. I only find and conclude that on that issue Respondent did not heretofore bargain in good faith, and that it should be required to do so. If after such good-faith bargaining the parties reach an agreement or an impasse, the requirements of the Act will have been fulfilled. * * * \u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>This footnote is inconsistent with the trial examiner\u2019s finding that the company\u2019s refusal to grant a check-off was \u2018for the purpose of frustrating agreement with the Union and hence [the company had] engaged in bad-faith bargaining.\u2019 To suggest that in further bargaining the company may refuse a check-off for some other reason, not heretofore advanced, makes a mockery of the collective bargaining required by the statute. Since the text of the trial examiner\u2019s decision controls, Footnote 9 should be disregarded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Thus, in holding the examiner\u2019s footnote 9 should be disregarded, the majority hold in effect that Section 8(d) of the Act should be disregarded, and that the Company should be held in contempt if, on remand, it does not agree to a contractual provision for some sort of Company aid in the collection of union dues.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">I have seldom seen a record so barren of support for the decision of the examiner and the Board, and I earnestly dissent from the majority opinion which upholds that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">I concur in the affirmance of No. 19,-492.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\">. Without discussion or comment, a three-member panel of the Board adopted the examiner\u2019s findings, conclusions and recommendation. So we must turn to the latter\u2019s decision to ascertain the findings and conclusions which the Board adopted as its own.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\">.
