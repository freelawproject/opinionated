We have done that. No matter what you do with this defendant, gentlemen of the jury, my conscience is clear; but, gentlemen of the jury, it is up to you to do your duty. It is up to you gentlemen to do your duty and if this evidence convinces you \u2014 evidence of the State convinces you of the guilt of the defendant, to bring in a verdict of guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Gentlemen, we prosecute these cases for the good of the community. I know that you gentlemen want to live in a peaceful, law-abiding community where your children will be safe; and although you may have boys who overstep the bounds sometimes and may not be as courteous as you might, we all try to make our children courteous and to respect their elders, and we try to keep our boys from being rowdy, like these children were that night. But gentlemen of the jury, the fact that these boys were a little rowdy out there in the street and might have been indiscreet, gave this defendant no right to go out there and shoot them, or go out there and assault them, use his pistol; and if that boy had died, gentlemen of the jury, this defendant would have been guilty of murder in the first degree. So, gentlemen, for the sake of the community, for the sake of the law ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Here the prosecutor was interrupted, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">\u201cMr. Whitaker: If your Honor please, I object to that and ask the Court to instruct the jury not to consider that remark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">\u201cThe Court: All right. (To the jury) Gentlemen, disregard that last statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">It is not clear how much of these paragraphs was covered by the Court\u2019s admonition, but it appears to have been adT dressed to the last uncompleted sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The argument was not responsive to the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">There had been no claim of any right or justification of the shooting of the little boy. There was no question but that the boy had been shot by someone without justification or lawful excuse. The defendant testified that he did not do the shooting, was not present when it happened and knew nothing about how it happened, or who did it. So the matter of justification or excuse was not involved. This departure from the proper course of conduct of the trial, of itself, would probably not warrant the quashing of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">The third question, however, presents a more serious departure from the essential requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">The record shows that after the jury retired under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>charge of the Court to consider of their verdict, and after having spent several hours in the jury room, the jury returned to the court room and the following incidents occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">\u201cA juror (Addressing the Court). A question came up; some contend that part of the testimony was one thing, and some contend another thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t think it is proper for you to reveal your deliberations, until you come back in with a report. I cannot discuss the testimony with you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">(Thereupon the jury again retired, and later returned into court with the following)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">\u2018Verdict of the Jury</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au\">\u2018Tampa, Florida, Nov. 5, 1938.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">\u2018We, the jury, find the defendant, W. R. Furr, guilty of aggravated assault as charged in the information. So say we all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">J. Floyd Griffin, Foreman.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">It is clear that the jury gave the court to understand that some jurors remembered the testimony of some witness or witnesses one way, while others remembered ito another, and that it was necessary for a fair trial that this misunderstanding be cleared up.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">Section 320 of the Florida Criminal Procedure Act provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-13\">\u201cJurors May Return to Court Room for Instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-14\">\u201cAfter the jurors have retired to consider their verdict if they desire additional instruction upon any point of law arising in the cause, or to have any testimony ahout which they are in doubt or disagreement, read to them, they shall, upon their request, be conducted into the court room by the officer who has them in charge and there the court shall give them such additional instruction or shall order such testimony read to them. Such instruction may be given and such testimony read only after notice to the prosecuting attorney and to counsel for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">It was the duty of the trial court when the jury returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>into court room after having deliberated in the jury room for several hours .and made the announcement to the trial court, \u201cA question came up; some contend that part of the testimony was one thing and some contend another thing,\u201d to then ascertain which witness it was whose testimony was the subject of disagreement and, if that witness had given any material testimony, to then have the testimony of such witness read to the jury. If all testimony of such witness was irrelevant and immaterial, then the court should have so advised the jury and that they might disregard the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">It, therefore, follows that certiorari is awarded and the challenged judgment is quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b270-6\">BROWN, C.
