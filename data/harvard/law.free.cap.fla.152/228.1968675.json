Lively, 108 Tex. 393,194 S. W. 937; \u201cA check made payable to a fictitious person with the knowledge of the maker is payable to bearer, and a bank which paid the check would be protected in its payment to any one presenting it. But a check which is made payable to a fictitious person without the knowledge of the maker is not payable to bearer, and it is the duty of the bank before paying it to ascertain the existence and the identity of the payee, and, failing to do so, to refuse its payment.\u201d Under the negotiable instruments law a note is payable to the bearer \u201cwhen it is payable to the order of a fictitious or non-existing person, and such fact was known to the person making it so payable.\u201d Paragraph (3), Section 674.11, Florida Statutes, 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Having given the rule which the appellant claims as support for his contention and the part of the statute of this State with reference to the status of a negotiable instrument bearing the name of a fictitious payee we now proceed to an analysis of the declaration in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">It was stated there that the appellee, a banking corporation, charged to the account of the plaintiff a check drawn by him and payable to \u201cBrowns Electric Shop, Zephyrhills, Fla.\u201d There was attached to the check \u201can invoice to be receipted for by Brown\u2019s Electric Shop, Zephyrhills, Fla.\u201d and, so it was alleged, the bank was directed \u201cby instructions contained upon said check\u201d not to pay it unless the invoice attached \u201cwas receipted by Brown\u2019s Electric Shop, Zephyr-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>hills, Fla.\u201d Parenthetically, copies of the check and invoice were made parts' of the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">It was then averred that no such business actually existed or was being operated at the town stated and that this was not known to the drawer. There followed in the declaration the charge that a duty devolved upon the bank \u201cto ascertain whether in truth and in fact there was such a payee\u201d as we have given in quotations and to pay the check only to that precise payee \u201cbut that said bank paid said check relying upon a fictitious endorsement \u2018Brown\u2019s Electric Shop.\u2019 \u201d Although no mention had theretofore been made in the declaration of \u201cSadler\u2019s I. G. A. Store,\u201d it was then averred that the plaintiff \u201cwas led to believe\u201d that said organization had received from \u201cBrown\u2019s Electric Shop\u201d certain machinery described in the invoice \u201cand, therefore, this plaintiff [appellant] extended\u201d to the former credit in the amount of the check but that, contrary to appellant\u2019s belief, \u201cSadler\u2019s I.G.A. Store\u201d did not receive from \u201cBrown\u2019s Electric Shop\u201d the machinery described and \u201cSadler\u2019s I.G.A. Store did not pay said credit so extended\u201d with the result that the plaintiff was damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We think that the following is a fair interpretation of the transaction disclosed by the check, the invoice and the allegations of the declaration: The appellant, trading as \u201cJohnston Fixture Co.,\u201d issued to \u201cBrown\u2019s Electric Shop\u201d a check on the appellee bank for five hundred dollars, the purchase of certain equipment delivered by that business to \u201cSadler\u2019s I.G.A. Store,\u201d and extended a credit in that amount to the latter. Inscribed on the instrument was the warning: \u201cDo not Pay Unless Receipted Invoice Is Attached to This Check ...\u201d The invoice described the equipment, contained a receipt for five hundred dollars signed \u201cBrown Elec. Shop by L. E. Brown,\u201d and bore the statement \u201cthat the [equipment] of this invoice has been satisfactorily installed and the terms of the guarantee from Brown Electric Shop are satisfactory to me\u201d which was signed \u201cSadlers I.G.A. Store W. H. Sadler.\u201d' Endorsed on the check were \u201cBrown Elec. Shop By L. E. Brown\u201d and \u201cW. H. Sadler.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>We think that the allegations of the declaration, considered with the instruments made a part of it, completely refute the position of the plaintiff that the check was issued to a fictitious or nonexisting person, as contemplated by the rule which we stated at the outset, and that such fact was unknown to the drawer at the time thereby placing the responsibility on the bank for the amount paid by it to the payee.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Decision of this controversy hinges on a correct definition of the term \u201cfictitious payee\u201d as used in the statute and the decisions. The payee described in the pleading did not fall in that category. It is evidently the appellant\u2019s contention that he need allege and prove only the mythical character of Brown\u2019s Electric Shop and his own ignorance of its nonexistence in order to fix responsibility on the bank for honoring the check. This theory has been adopted by him despite the allegations of the declaration outlining a not unusual transaction. If we were to adopt his view we would lose sight of the essential characteristics of a payee who is fictitious. The distinction is well drawn in Soekland v. Storch, 123 Ark. 253, 185 S. W. 262, Ann. Cas. 1918 A 668, where it was written \u201cWhenever the name is inserted as payee without any intention that payment shall be made only in conformity therewith, the payee then becomes a fictitious person. In other words under the rule a fictitious payee means a fictitious person, who though named as payee in the note, has no right to it, or the proceeds of it, because it was not so intended when the note was executed. Therefore whether the paper is to be considered as having a fictitious payee depends upon the knowledge or intention of the party against whom it is attempted to assert the rule, and not upon the actual existence or nonexistence of a payee of the same name as that inserted in the instrument; so that on the one hand a real person may be fictitious, and on the other a non-existing person may be real within this rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Thus, it would seem that the emphasis is not placed on the actual existence of the payee but upon the intention of the drawer and the right of the payee to the proceeds. It was said by the supreme court of South Carolina that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>reference in the statute to a \u201cfictitious or nonexisting person\u201d meant one \u201cwho, though named as payee in a check, has the right to it, or the proceeds of it, <em>because the drawer of it so intended, </em>and it, therefore, matters not whether the name of the payee used by him be that of one living or dead or of one who never existed.\u201d Bourne v. Maryland Casualty Co., 185 S. C. 1, 192 S. E. 605, 611. In Norton v. City Bank &amp; T. Co. (1923; C.C.A. 4th) 294 F. 839, 844, the court said that \u201ca negotiable instrument is drawn to a fictitious payee whenever the payee named in it has no right to it, and its maker does not intend, that such payee shall take anything by it,\u2019\u2019fictitiousness therefore depending on the intention of the maker and the payee\u2019s right to the proceeds. Emphasizing the proposition' that an existing person may be a fictitious payee, the supreme court of Missouri, in First Nat. Bank v. Produce Exch. Bank, 338 Mo. 91, 89 S.W. (2nd) 33,.said that \u201cthe payee named in an instrument will be deemed fictitious though designating an existing person, if there was no intent he should have a beneficial interest in the paper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Our construction of the pleading and the exhibits is that L. E. Brown, trading as Brown\u2019s Electric Shop, delivered property to appellant\u2019s debtor and that the drawer intended him to receive the money in exchange for the goods. Bourne v. Maryland Casualty Co., supra. There was no irregularity in using the trade name as payee. Renfrow v. Anthony, 253 Ill. App. 123. It is true that the pleader asserts that its debtor did not receive the property for which the check was given but this allegation is contradicted by the receipt on the invoice made a part of the pleading and signed by that very debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Judging the entire transaction we think that the payee named here was not fictitious and that there is no responsibility on the part of the bank to pay to the plaintiff the amount of the check which actually is represented by a charge against \u201cSadler\u2019s I.G.A. Store.\u201d It appears from the conclusion of the declaration that that business is the one indebted to the plaintiff for the amount of the check and the court is not advised by the pleadings why the responsibility should not be placed there. It is a fair deduction that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>loss to the plaintiff was occasioned by the failure of \u201cSadler\u2019s I.G.A. Store,\u201d as alleged in the declaration, to \u201cpay said credit so extended to it by this plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">We think the declaration wholly fails to state any cause of action against the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b265-7\">BROWN, C.
