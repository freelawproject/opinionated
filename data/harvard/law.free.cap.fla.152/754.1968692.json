Stats. 1941, authorizing the operation for 1942-43 of a hotel known as the \u201cGreen Lantern Hotel,\u201d consisting of nine bedrooms. Double beds were in each of seven rooms, while two double beds were in each of the other two. It is admitted that the \u201cGreen Lantern Hotel\u201d had accommodated on designated nights, and possessed the capacity on each night, to sleep \u201cten or more persons.\u201d Compton was convicted in the County Judge\u2019s Court of Washington County for the violation of Section 205.37, Fla. Stats. 1941. Persons \u2022 operating a hotel and paying an occupational license under Section 205.29, are specifically excepted from the provisions of Section 205.37, <em>supra. </em>The evidence shows that Compton is within the exception <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Section 205.29, <em>supra, </em>classifies certain enumerated businesses designated as boarding houses, lodging houses, tourist camps, cabin camps, auto courts or hotels, \u201chaving beds for ten or more, persons,\u201d for taxation purposes. The tax assessed against each of the businesses, so operated, shall be fifty cents per room. We are unable to read into the Act that one person <em>only </em>shall sleep in a single bed located in a separate room, as here contended, but more than one guest may be accommodated by sleeping together in a double bed and more than one double bed can or may be placed in a single room, but for taxation purposes the Legislature intended that each hotel, tourist camp, cabin and lodging house must have and possess sufficient beds as a minimum to accomodate \u201cten or more persons\u201d during the night. The Green Lantern Hotel operated by Compton, it is admitted, accommodated and had beds for \u201cten or more persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">Counsel for appellant contends that the sufficiency of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>evidence to sustain the judgment of conviction entered in the County Judge\u2019s Court of Washington County cannot be raised by habeas corpus, as was done in the case at bar, but the proper and only method of review is by an appeal from the judgment of conviction so entered to the circuit court in conformity with the statutes applicable thereto. It has not been shown by the record that the petitioner ever violated the statute cited and the lower court so held. The answer to this contention is the cases of Watson v. Stone, 148 Fla. 516, 4 So. (2nd) 700; McCreary v. State ex rel. Garrison, 124 Fla. 330, 168 So. 422; McLeod v. Chase, 95 Fla. 736a, 116 So. 858-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b788-5\">BUFORD, C.
