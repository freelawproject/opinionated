T. Frank Hobson as Judge of the Circuit Court for the Sixth Judicial Circuit h'as filed in this Court a certificate under Rule 38, in a case pending in his court, entitled as above. The certificate gives a condensed summary of the allegations of a bill in equity, consisting of about three type written pages, which bill was filed in said court and a motion to dismiss the same was filed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">Then follows the following certified questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-11\">\u201cDoes this Court of equity, under the facts alleged, havt jurisdiction, or is it authorized to grant the relief prayed?\u201d A question of this kind is not within the contemplation of Rule 38, which provides, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-12\">\u201cOnly questions or propositions of law that can be answered without regard to other issues may be so certified and they must be definitely and concisely stated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">As a general rule, only single, definite and distinct questions or propositions of law can be certified to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">It is entirely proper, and indeed required by the rule, that the certificate shall also contain the style of the case, and a \u201cstatement of facts\u201d showing the nature of the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>and the circumstances out of which the questions of law arise.
