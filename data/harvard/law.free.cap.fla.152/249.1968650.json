Maturity dates of the bonds are specified. The first bond is payable March 1st 1943 and the last is payable March 1st 1972. Seventy bonds are in the principal sum of $1,000.00 each and fourteen are in the principal sum of $500.00 each.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The decree of the Circuit Court of Hillsborough County, Florida, of August 4, 1925 forever set at rest the validity of the original bond issue in the sum of $240,500.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">The appellant poses the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">\u201cHas the District the power to prepare and file a \u2018Supple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>mental or Revised Drainage Tax Record\u2019 as authorized by the Resolution of the Board of Supervisors of said District which is part of the record, it appearing that there is no \u2018Drainage Tax Record\u2019 on file in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court at this time?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Appellant suggests that this question should be answered in the negative and by way of argument, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">\u201cSec. 298.36, formerly Sec. 17, Chap. 6458, Laws of Florida, 1913, as amended by Chap. 12040, Acts of 1927, required the Board to \u2018levy a tax of such portion of said benefits\u2019 as were assessed against the property, and to prepare, \u2018in the form of a well bound book\u2019 a list of these taxes with other information, such book to be entitled \u2018Drainage Tax Record of .................... Drainage District, .....\u25a0\u201e............ County Florida,\u2019 which should be filed in the office of the Secretary and become a permanent record therein. Sec. 298.41, formerly Sec. 22, Chap. 6458, Laws of Florida, 1913, as amended by Chap. 9129, Acts of 1923, and Chap. 12040, Acts of 1927, provided that the lien for such taxes should be evidenced by a certificate attached to certain tables which should be included in a well bound book filed in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court, and it also was designated as \u2018Drainage Tax Record.\u2019 The record in this case shows that no such book is in existence in the Clerk\u2019s Office; it does not show whether such a book was actually prepared or not. The record does show that the bonds were issued and are outstanding, and that they have been purchased by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which has agreed to accept refunding bonds in lieu thereof at the price at which the bonds were purchased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">There is no provision of Chap. 298, which is a compilation of the law relating to drainage districts, which authorizes the preparation of such Supplementary or Revised Drainage Tax Record. This is the question which is raised by the appeal. Can the District authorize the preparation of such a record at this time and make it the basis of the refunding bonds?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">The alleged irregularity in the proceedings followed in re, the collection of the tax with which to pay principal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>interest on the original bonds does not go to the validity of either the original or refunding bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The mere fact that the District is belatedly complying with the statute, supra, by preparing its tax record and filing same in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court does not in anywise affect the validity of the bonds. The fact that the tax record now prepared and filed, or to be filed, in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court is called or identified as \u201cSupplemental or Revised Drainage Tax Record\u201d is of no consequence. If it is such a record as is required by the statute, supra, it will suffice as evidence and notice of the lien on the lands therein described to secure the payment of the refunding bonds which constitute the only obligation here under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">No reversible error appearing in the record, the decree is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b287-8\">BROWN, C.
