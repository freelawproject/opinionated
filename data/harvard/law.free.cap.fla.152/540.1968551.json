Walker and Guido Dapos guilty, but that the State failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the guilt of the defendant Mrs. Russell T. Walker, therefore, the judgment against Russell T. Walker and Guido Dapos is affirmed and that against Mrs. Russell T. Walker reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b573-11\">TERRELL, CHAPMAN, THOMAS and ADAMS, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b573-12\">BUFORD, C.

They appeal. The State relies entirely upon circumstantial evidence to support the judgment. Is it sufficient? I think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-15\">It is so v/ell settled in this jurisdiction as to need no citation of authority that when circumstantial evidence is relied upon for conviction in a criminal case; the circumstances, when taken together, must be of a conclusive nature and tendency, leading on the whole to a reasonable and moral certainty that the accused, and no one else, committed the offense. It is not sufficient that the facts create a strong probability of, and be consistent with, guilt; they must be inconsistent with innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>At most, all that the evidence does in this case is point to the probability of guilt. This is not enough. Parish, et al., v. State, 98 Fla. 877, 124 So. 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the judgments should be reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b574-5\">BUFORD, C.
