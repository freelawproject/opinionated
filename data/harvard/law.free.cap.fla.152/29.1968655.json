State, 72 Fla. 16, 72 So. 370, which contention, if supported by the record, would be supported by our holding in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">In this case there was no direct and positive testimony that the alleged victim had never been married but this element of the offense may be proven by circumstantial evidence the same as any other material fact may be proved. We find from the record the proof of sufficient facts and circumstances to base the positive conclusion that at the time of the commission of the crime the little girl, then fourteen years of age, had never been married. The jury was justified in finding so from the evidence adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-14\">On consideration of the whole record, we find no reversible error reflected and the judgment should be and is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-15\">So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b62-17\">BROWN, C.
