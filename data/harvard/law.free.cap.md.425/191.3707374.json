Joanna Davis, Petitioner, was ordered by the Circuit Court for Wicomico County to pay her ex-husband Michael A. Petito, Jr., Respondent, $30,773.54 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, because the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>determined that she was in a better financial position than Mr. Petito, due to her having received pro bono representation by the Sexual Assault Legal Institute (SALI),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> whereas Mr. Petito had accumulated over $70,000 in legal fees as a result of retaining private counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s order in a reported opinion, <em>Davis v. Petito, </em>197 Md.App. 487, 14 A.3d 692 (2011), even though Ms. Davis had argued that the trial court\u2019s order discounting any perceived value associated with her representation contravened this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Henriquez v. Henriquez, </em>413 Md. 287, 992 A.2d 446 (2010), in which we interpreted Section 12-103 to permit an attorneys\u2019 fee award to a prevailing party, who also had received pro bono legal representation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We granted certiorari, 420 Md. 81, 21 A.3d 1063 (2011), to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acb\">In determining an award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees in a custody case, Family Law Article \u00a7 12-103(b)(2) of the Maryland Code requires the courts to consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the financial status and needs of each party. In assessing the parties\u2019 financial status and needs, and ultimately ordering the Mother to pay $30,773.54 of the Father\u2019s legal expenses, was it appropriate for the lower court to consider the fact that the Mother was represented <em>pro bono </em>and to disregard her day-to-day financial needs, particularly as they relate to caring for the Child?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>We shall hold that the consideration that one party was represented on a pro bono basis, in order to award attorneys\u2019 fees to the other party who had retained counsel was erroneous under Section 12-103, and we shall order a remand to the trial court for reconsideration of the statutory factors in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Joanna Davis and Michael Petito were married on December 12, 1998 and have one daughter, Sophia, born on October 22, 2003. In April of 2006, the Circuit Court for Wicomico County granted them an absolute divorce and awarded them joint legal custody but primary physical custody of the child to Ms. Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">In December of 2008, Ms. Davis, through retained counsel, filed an Emergency Complaint for Immediate Custody, Injunctive Ex Parte and Pendente Lite Relief, in which she sought sole legal and physical custody of Sophia, because she alleged that Mr. Petito had sexually abused the child. Mr. Petito denied the allegations, initially without counsel and later, after having retained private counsel, filed a Counter Complaint for Modification of Custody, seeking joint physical and legal custody of Sophia and a decrease in his child support payments; he also specifically requested attorneys\u2019 fees. Eventually, Ms. Davis could not afford to pay an attorney and secured the services of SALI on a pro bono basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">A hearing ensued but, after the first five days, the Circuit Court Judge determined that Ms. Davis had not established by preponderance of the evidence that there was \u201cany form of sexual abuse\u201d by Mr. Petito; specifically, she found that \u201cnone of [Ms. Davis\u2019s] experts are able to offer consistent credible opinions as to what exactly happened,\u201d while she found \u201cconvincing and credible\u201d the testimony of Mr. Petito\u2019s expert, who was offered \u201cfor the general proposition that the minor child\u2019s statements in this case are insufficient to support a finding of sexual abuse.\u201d The parties then presented both oral and written comments regarding the award of attorneys\u2019 fees under Section 12-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>As to attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, Mr. Petito submitted a request for $76,052, arguing that the judge should award him the total amount under Section 12-103, because Ms. Davis lacked substantial justification to seek a modification in child custody. He also asserted that Ms. Davis had \u201cfinancial circumstances [that] far exceeded] Mr. Petito\u2019s financial circumstances\u201d because she owned her own home and had pro bono representation, while he did not own property and had had retained private counsel; according to him, the Sexual Assault Legal Institute\u2019s representation of Ms. Davis meant that \u201cher attorneys\u2019 fees have been paid in full whereas Mr. Petito has incurred debts in the sum of $61,340 ... borrowed from his 401 K and incurred significant unsecured liabilities ____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Ms. Davis conversely submitted a request for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in the amount of $14,080.12, representing the amount she paid to her private attorney before she retained SALI. She urged that Mr. Petito was in a better financial position to pay for attorneys\u2019 fees because his family had given him interest-free loans, whereas Ms. Davis had \u201cno ability to pay [his] counsel fees,\u201d having \u201cless than $2,000.00 in cash.\u201d She maintained that she had substantial justification to bring her claim based on the allegations of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The judge awarded Mr. Petito $30,773.54 in attorneys\u2019 fees,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> reasoning that Mr. Petito had substantial justification for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>defending himself in this proceeding and that Ms. Davis\u2019s financial circumstances were better than that of Mr. Petito because she had been represented on a pro bono basis, whereas Mr. Petito had incurred significant debt as a result of retaining private counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">The Court may order attorneys fees under Family Law Article \u00a7 12-103, <em>Annotated Code of Maryland, </em>but not before considering the financial status of each party, the needs of each party, and whether there was substantial justification for bringing or defending the proceeding. <em>Lieberman v. Lieberman, </em>81 Md.App. 575, 601 [568 A.2d 1157] (1990). The Court acknowledges that each party has expended significant financial resources as a result of this case. Mr. Petito, however, has suffered disproportionate financial hardship from these proceedings. His counsel was privately retained, unlike Ms. Davis\u2019s representation, which has been without charge since October 2009. He has exhausted his savings, credit, and taken loans in excess of $10,000 from his family. There can be no doubt that the needs of both parties are high, especially in light of the resources expended in these proceedings. The Court finds that Mr. Petito had a substantial justification in defending himself in these proceedings, initiated by Ms. Davis. While the Court recognizes the struggle that any parent must have when believing their child has been sexually abused, particularly when the suspected abuser is the other parent, the Court ultimately was unable to make a finding that the evidence supported that sexual abuse occurred. Without defending himself, Mr. Petito risked losing his parental relationship with Sophia. By contrast, Ms. Davis was represented pro bono by SALI, and should bear shared responsibility for the legal fees according to her income in light of the full record herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Ms. Davis thereafter filed a Motion to Alter or Amend the Order, arguing that the judge\u2019s consideration of the pro bono <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>status of Ms. Davis\u2019s representation in awarding Mr. Petito attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under Section 12-103 was erroneous in light of our holding in <em>Henriquez, </em>413 Md. 287, 992 A.2d 446, which had been filed within days before the judge\u2019s ruling. Ms. Davis argued that \u201cit is without significance that Ms. Davis is currently under retainer with a legal services organization,\u201d and the Circuit Court should have instead focused on Ms. Davis\u2019s financial circumstances and needs, namely her inability to afford to pay Mr. Petito\u2019s fees; the judge denied Ms. Davis\u2019s Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Ms. Davis timely appealed to the Court of Special Appeals,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which affirmed the trial court\u2019s order in a reported opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>197 Md.App. 487, 14 A.3d 692 (2011), concluding that the Circuit Court Judge properly considered the impact of the disparity in the cost of the parties\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees on each party\u2019s financial status, needs and substantial justification for bringing or defending the proceeding. The Circuit Court\u2019s consideration that Ms. Davis was represented pro bono was limited to \u201caccounting] for the amount of fees she had paid or was obligated to pay being substantially lower than what Petito would pay.\u201d 197 Md.App. at 533, 14 A.3d at 718. The intermediate appellate court rejected Ms. Davis\u2019s challenge that the Circuit Court Judge did not consider the relative needs of the parties, because the Circuit Court Judge considered the parties\u2019 monthly incomes and amounts of attorneys\u2019 fees incurred and determined that Mr. Petito\u2019s justification in defending himself in the proceeding was more substantial than Ms. Davis\u2019s justification in bringing it, and therefore justified his incurrence of more attorneys\u2019 fees than Ms. Davis as well as the court\u2019s decision that she share in the payment of the fees. <em>Id. </em>at 533,14 A.3d at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in child support proceedings is controlled by Section 12-103 of the Family Law Article, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 The court may award to either party the costs and counsel fees that are just and proper under all the circumstances in any case in which a person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">(1) applies for a decree or modification of a decree concerning the custody, support, or visitation of a child of the parties; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">(2) files any form of proceeding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-10\">(i) to recover arrearages of child support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">(ii) to enforce a decree of child support; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\">(iii) to enforce a decree of custody or visitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>(b) <em>Required, considerations. </em>\u2014 Before a court may award costs and counsel fees under this section, the court shall consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">(1) the financial status of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">(2) the needs of each party; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">(3) whether there was substantial justification for bringing, maintaining, or defending the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">(c) <em>Absence of substantial justification. </em>\u2014 Upon a finding by the court that there was an absence of substantial justification of a party for prosecuting or defending the proceeding, and absent a finding by the court of good cause to the contrary, the court shall award to the other party costs and counsel fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Section 12-103 is an exception to the \u201cAmerican rule,\u201d the general rule in Maryland that requires litigants to be responsible for their own legal fees, <em>Thomas v. Gladstone, </em>386 Md. 693, 699, 874 A.2d 434, 437 (2005) (\u201cUnder the common law \u2018American Rule\u2019 applied in Maryland, the prevailing party in a lawsuit may not recover the attorneys\u2019 fees as an element of damages or costs unless ... there is a statute that allows the imposition of such\u201d). Before making an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, Section 12-103 requires the trial court to consider the parties\u2019 financial status, needs and whether there was a substantial justification for bringing, maintaining or defending a proceeding. <em>Petrini v. Petrini, </em>336 Md. 453, 468, 648 A.2d 1016, 1022 (1994). The present disagreement centers on the impact of one party having pro bono representation rather than privately-retained counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Ms. Davis contends that the judge erred by considering the fact that SALI\u2019s legal services were of no cost to her as enhancing her ability to contribute to Mr. Petito\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees. Ms. Davis argues that Mr. Petito\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees award contradicts our decision in <em>Henriquez, </em>in which we recognized that legal representation on a pro bono basis should be considered indicative of meager financial status and needs that prevent an individual from affording an attorney. She asserts that ordering her to pay the attorneys\u2019 fees of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>party who was capable of affording private counsel frustrates the purpose of pro bono legal service, which is to \u201cfacilitate access to the judicial system by alleviating the financial burden of paying for an attorney.\u201d Finally, Ms. Davis contends that the trial court erroneously failed to consider her needs, particularly relating to caring for Sophia, and limited finances in ordering the attorneys\u2019 fees award to Mr. Petito.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Mr. Petito, in support of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion and the trial court\u2019s order, argues that <em>Henriquez </em>does not apply to this case and that the trial court\u2019s consideration of SALI\u2019s pro bono services was to point out the disproportionate financial statuses of the parties. Specifically, Mr. Petito argues that the trial court correctly concluded that he had \u201cexhausted his savings and credit, and was forced to take loans from family members in order to pay his legal expenses\u201d whereas Ms. Davis \u201ccontinues to have legal services provided free of charge.\u201d Finally, he maintains that a reversal in favor of Ms. Davis would introduce a new rule of law that \u201cwould allow individuals to use <em>pro bono </em>services as a shield to protect against awards of attorneys\u2019 fees.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In considering an award under Section 12-103, the \u201cabsence of substantial justification of a party for prosecuting or defending the proceeding,\u201d would, without good cause, result in an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to the other party, so long as those fees and costs are reasonable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under Section 12 \u2014 103(b), however, substantial justification is but one consideration in the triad, the others being financial status and needs, to support fee shifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The award of attorneys\u2019 fees in this case lumped the perceived values of the respective attorneys\u2019 fees together and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>then applied a formula to assess Mr. Petito\u2019s fees. The judge conflated Mr. Petito\u2019s substantial justification for defending the custody proceeding with Ms. Davis\u2019s use of pro bono legal services in bringing the claim, reasoning that \u201cMr. Petito risked losing his parental relationship with Sophia,\u201d and \u201c[b]y contrast, Ms. Davis was represented pro bono by SALI, and should bear shared responsibility for the legal fees according to her income____\u201d Substantial justification for each party\u2019s position, however, is measured by the issues presented and the merits of the case, not the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">In 1993, the Legislature repealed and reenacted Section 12-103 in order to introduce the mandatory award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under subsection (c). 1993 Session Laws, Chapter 514. Testimony provided in the file for House Bill 381, which contained the current language of subsection (c), reflects that its purpose was to address the inability of custodial parents to finance judicial enforcement of court-ordered child support. <em>See </em>Memorandum of Delegate Ellen R. Sauerbrey, Additional Testimony on HB 381, Alimony and Child Support \u2014 Mandatory Award of Expenses (Feb. 16, 1993), quoting Testimony of Jill Coleman (\u201cBut without child support coming in, who has the money to pay a lawyer to collect child support? This means that non-payment of child support is actually a powerful way of evading the obligation to pay child support.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">In support of House Bill 381, Judge Rosalyn B. Bell of the Court of Special Appeals, as a member of the Governor\u2019s Task Force on Family Law, provided written testimony that custodial parents, who were entitled to receive court-ordered child support payments, often did not because the non-custodial parent refused to pay, knowing that the custodial parent could not afford to hire an attorney and enforce the order. While judges already had discretion to award attorneys\u2019 fees, many did not choose to exact this toll:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">The Task Force often heard the same complaint from divorced persons, including single heads of households, that court-awarded alimony and child support cannot be collected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>because the proceedings necessary to enforce such awards are simply too expensive. In many instances, the responsible party is aware of the expenses involved in enforcement and ignores the court\u2019s directive to pay alimony or child support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">At the present time, the law allows the court to award such expenses, but the reality is that this is rarely done, because enforcement never appears to be a \u201cproblem.\u201d By requiring the court to award costs and counsel fees, the Bill facilitates collection of alimony and child support. This helps a large segment of our children and their custodians. This Bill also assists those persons who, after years of being out of the workplace, are unable to earn sufficient salaries to provide for themselves, let along enforce an alimony award to which they are entitled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Letter from the Honorable Rosalyn B. Bell, to Delegate Joseph F. Vallario, Jr., Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee (Feb. 8, 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Cases interpreting Section 12-103(b) generally also relate substantial justification to the merits of the case. In <em>Lieberman v. Lieberman, </em>81 Md.App. 575, 600, 568 A.2d 1157, 1169 (1990), Judge Rosalyn B. Bell, in reviewing the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to Ms. Lieberman, considered whether Ms. Lieberman had substantial justification to bring the action and concluded that \u201cthe trial judge did find for Ms. Lieberman which carries with it an implicit finding of very substantial justification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 600, 568 A.2d at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Prevailing on the merits is a sufficient, but not a necessary, element of substantial justification in bringing, maintaining or defending a proceeding. Substantial justification under Section 12-103(b) may require a consideration of the merits of each party\u2019s position, including the non-prevailing party. In <em>Broseus v. Broseus, </em>82 Md.App. 183, 570 A.2d 874 (1990), yet another custody battle between spouses, the trial court granted child custody to Dr. Broseus. Dr. Broseus and Ms. Broseus incurred attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $71,823 and $48,905.17, respectively, and the trial court, observing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>language of Section 12-103 permitted an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to either party, awarded Ms. Broseus $5,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees. Dr. Broseus appealed and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed, reasoning that \u201c[j]ust because appellant [Dr. Broseus] prevailed on the custody issue does not preclude an award to appellee [Ms. Broseus], so long as there was substantial justification for bringing or defending the proceeding under ... \u00a7 12-103.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200, 570 A.2d at 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Essentially, substantial justification, under both subsections (b) and (c) of Section 12-103, relates solely to the merits of the case against which the judge must assess whether each party\u2019s position was reasonable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A judge, after finding substantial justification, then must proceed to review the reasonableness of the attorneys\u2019 fees, and the financial status and needs of each party before ordering an award under Section 12 \u2014 103(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In this case, the value of Mr. Petito\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees also controlled the judge\u2019s perception of the financial status and needs of both parties. In factoring the needs of Mr. Petito, the Circuit Court Judge considered both the amount paid to his private counsel, $76,052, as well as the debt he incurred to pay for those fees, including loans from his family. In so doing, the judge considered the attorneys\u2019 fees for Mr. Petito twice. Ms. Davis\u2019s SALI representation was valued at zero and Ms. Davis\u2019s needs, such as her lack of savings or disposable income, however, were not considered in the award of attorneys\u2019 fees. The judge divided the amounts paid by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>parties to their respective private counsel according to their relative income. No comparison, beyond their incomes, apparently was undertaken by the judge to determine the financial status and needs of each of these parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">What we derive from the statute is that financial status and needs of each of the parties must be balanced in order to determine ability to pay the award to the other; a comparison of incomes is not enough.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Henriquez, </em>413 Md. at 301, 992 A.2d at 455 (upholding the Circuit Court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees to Mrs. Henriquez because the court \u201cengaged in balancing under Section 12-103, finding that Mrs. Henriquez was \u2018wholly dependent\u2019 and \u2018virtually penniless,\u2019 warranting an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, given Mr. Henriquez\u2019s financial ability\u201d); <em>Jackson v. Jackson, </em>272 Md. 107, 112, 321 A.2d 162, 165-66 (1974) (concluding that the financial status of Mr. Jackson, who was ordered to pay an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to his ex-wife, \u201ccertainly permitted the award\u201d); <em>Lemley v. Lemley, </em>109 Md.App. 620, 633-34, 675 A.2d 596, 602 (1996) (vacating an award of attorneys\u2019 fees where the non-prevailing party represented himself pro se and earned half of the income earned by the prevailing party, concluding that \u201c[i]t is unreasonable to require Mr. Lemley to pay for the benefit of professional counsel for the opposing party, while being unable to afford that benefit for himself\u2019); <em>Sczudlo v. Berry, </em>129 Md.App. 529, 552-53, 743 A.2d 268, 280-81 (1999) (remanding to the trial court for further consideration because a disparity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>in the parties\u2019 income, without more, was insufficient to support an attorneys\u2019 fees award under Section 12-103(b)). The term \u201cneeds\u201d could include that which has not been paid to attorneys, pursuant to retainer agreements. <em>Lieberman, </em>81 Md.App. at 600, 568 A.2d at 1170 (observing that a party\u2019s needs could be impacted by fees to an attorney that remain outstanding).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Section 12-103 contemplates a systematic review of economic indicators in the assessment of the financial status and needs of the parties, as well as a determination of entitlement to attorneys\u2019 fees based upon a review of the substantial justification of each of the parties\u2019 positions in the litigation, mitigated by a review of reasonableness of the attorneys\u2019 fees. The only time that the relative amounts of the parties\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees should be considered is when both are determined to have a substantial justification for their positions; after which, it is clear from <em>Henriquez, </em>413 Md. at 287, 992 A.2d at 446, pro bono legal services must be valued.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">We remand this ease to the Circuit Court for a reconsideration of the attorneys\u2019 fees award under Section 12-103. If the Circuit Court determines that Ms. Davis lacked substantial justification for bringing her child custody modification claim and absent a finding of good cause to the contrary, then under Section 12-103(c), the reasonableness of Mr. Petito\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees would then be the only consideration. If the Circuit Court finds under Section 12-103(b), however, that Ms. Davis and Mr. Petito each had substantial justification for bringing or defending their respective positions in the proceeding, then the Circuit Court must value the legal services afforded to both parties, according to <em>Henriquez, </em>and determine their reasonableness, after which the Circuit Court must proceed to assess Ms. Davis\u2019s and Mr. Petito\u2019s financial status and needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

In the Memorandum Opinion, the trial judge explained her calculation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">Mr. Petito requested $34,983 in attorneys\u2019 fees from Ms. Davis. This request was based on total fees, including expert witness fees, of $76,052. Multiplying Ms. Davis\u2019s income percentage of 46%, as stated in the child support guidelines, to the $76,052 yields $34,983 ($76,052 * .46). However, Ms. Davis incurred $9,153 in fees to Lenora Mihavetz, Esq., who was her attorney prior to retaining the Sexual Assault Legal Institute. We find it equitable to offset the $9,153 already paid by Ms. Davis from the balance due to Mr. Brennan, which leaves $66,899 to be divided among the parties ($76,052-$9,153).

Did the trial court err in disqualifying the Mother's expert?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">2. Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(4) provides a hearsay exception for statements made for the purposes of medical diagnosis and treatment. This Court has held that statements made by children under the age of five qualify for this exception. Did the trial court err in holding that Rule 5-803(b)(4) did not apply to statements made by the Child to her therapist based primarily on the fact that the Child was five at the time the statements were made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">3. In determining an award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees in a custody case, Family Law Article \u00a7 12-103(b) requires the courts to consider (1) the financial status of each party; (2) the needs of each party; and (3) whether there was a substantial justification for bringing or defending the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">a. The Mother's needs include maintaining the Child\u2019s primary residence, for which she is obligated to make mortgage payments. The Father lives rent-free and incurs only ordinary living expenses.
