Specifically, we must decide whether an employee in that circumstance must assume at the end of the fifteen-day period that the appeal has been denied and take any further appeal within ten days thereafter. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) read the pertinent provisions as requiring any further appeal to be taken within 10 days of a deemed denial. The Circuit Court for Somerset County and Court of Special Appeals agreed. So do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In November 2008, Vanessa Fisher, Petitioner, was in the employ of the Eastern Correctional Institution, Respondent. Petitioner was notified in December 2008 that her employment was terminated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner submitted a timely written appeal of her termination to the head of her principal unit, Gary D. Maynard, Secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s filing consisted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>of a letter sent by Petitioner\u2019s counsel to the Secretary that briefly described the factual circumstances of the incident leading to termination of Petitioner\u2019s employment and summarily outlined the argument against termination. After requesting relief in the form of reinstatement and back pay, counsel\u2019s letter concluded: \u201cI await your response.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">On February 5, 2009, having received no response, Petitioner, through counsel, sent a second letter to Secretary Maynard inquiring into \u201cthe status of this proceeding.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s counsel wrote again on July 29, 2009, noting Secretary Maynard\u2019s lack of response and requesting a decision at the Secretary\u2019s \u201cearliest convenience.\u201d Counsel added: <em>\u201cIf </em>I have not received your decision by August 7, 2009, I shall assume you have decided to uphold [Petitioner\u2019s] termination, albeit without written opinion, and file an appeal on her behalf to the Office of Administrative Hearings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">On August 20, 2009, Petitioner, through counsel, sent a letter to the Secretary of DBM. In it, Petitioner stated that she had assumed from Secretary Maynard\u2019s silence that \u201cher appeal has been denied pursuant to ... \u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(2),\u201d and Petitioner \u201cnow seeks to have this matter appealed to the Secretary of [DBM].\u201d After attempting to resolve the matter through the settlement conference process, the Secretary of DBM forwarded the appeal to the Office of Administrative Hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Respondent filed a motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, a motion for summary decision. Respondent asserted that the appeal to DBM was untimely because Petitioner did not file it \u201c[w]ithin 10 days after receiving a decision\u201d from Secretary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Maynard, as required by \u00a7 ll-110(a)(l). Citing the language of \u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(2) that \u201c[a] failure to decide an appeal in accordance with this subtitle is considered a denial from which an appeal may be made,\u201d Respondent argued that Secretary Maynard\u2019s failure to issue a decision within 15 days was a denial of Petitioner\u2019s appeal and, because Petitioner transmitted her appeal approximately 230 days after it was \u201cdeemed denied\u201d by operation of law, her appeal was untimely under \u00a7 11 \u2014 110(a)\u2019s 10-day limitation, necessitating dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Petitioner offered several arguments in response. She first argued that \u00a7 11 \u2014 109(e)(2) mandates that the head of a principal unit \u201cshall\u201d issue a decision, making issuance of a decision a mandatory duty. In Petitioner\u2019s view, Secretary Maynard\u2019s fulfillment of that mandatory decision-making duty was a prerequisite to her taking a further appeal to the Secretary of DBM. Petitioner relied for that argument on \u00a7 11-110(a)(1), which provides that an appeal may be filed only \u201c[wjithin 10 days <em>after receiving a decision </em>under \u00a7 11-109 of this subtitle.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Petitioner further argued that her appeal to the Secretary of DBM was timely because, for eight months after taking her appeal to Secretary Maynard, she had corresponded repeatedly with him to resolve the appeal, in accordance with the declaration in \u00a7 11 \u2014 108(d) that each party \u201cshall make every effort to resolve an appeal at the lowest level possible.\u201d Petitioner maintained that only when she deemed her efforts at resolution to have failed (having received no response from Secretary Maynard for 230 days) did she take a further appeal to the Secretary of DBM.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The ALJ disagreed with Petitioner\u2019s interpretation of the statutory provisions. The ALJ noted in the order dismissing the appeal that, under the plain language of \u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(2), \u201c[t]he consequence of the head of the principal department\u2019s failure to obey the \u2018shall\u2019 in [\u00a7 ll-109(e)(2) ] ... is that an employee can proceed with the appeal process without having to wait for a decision that might never come.\u201d The ALJ further noted that Petitioner spent a fruitless eight months attempting to resolve her appeal at Secretary Maynard\u2019s level because \u201cany decision [by Secretary Maynard] rendered after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>the fifteen-day period [of \u00a7 11 \u2014 109(e)(2) ] would have been a legal nullity.\u201d The ALJ added that, \u201cif it were \u2018mandatory\u2019 for the head of the principal department to actually render a decision, the language of [\u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(2) ] would be rendered superfluous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Petitioner filed in the Circuit Court for Somerset County a Petition for Judicial Review. That court affirmed the decision of the ALJ. The Court of Special Appeals later affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court, holding in an unreported opinion that the court did not err in affirming the ALJ\u2019s dismissal of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">We issued a writ of certiorari, <em>Fisher v. Eastern Correctional Institution, </em>423 Md. 450, 31 A.3d 919 (2011), to address the following question presented by Petitioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">Whether the lower court correctly dismissed [Petitioner\u2019s] appeal on the grounds that, by allowing the Secretary of her agency additional time to meet his statutory responsibility to decide her appeal, she inadvertently rendered her appeal untimely?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">At base, this case is one of statutory construction, the rules for which are well known. We have said time and again that \u201cthe paramount object of statutory construction is the ascertainment and effectuation of the real intention of the Legislature.\u201d <em>In re Gloria H., </em>410 Md. 562, 579-80, 979 A.2d 710, 720 (2009) (quoting <em>W. Correctional Inst. v. Geiger, </em>371 Md. 125, 140, 807 A.2d 32, 41 (2002)). The process of statutory interpretation begins with the plain language of the statute, where we \u201cread[ ] the statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u201d <em>Moore v. State, </em>424 Md. 118, 127, 34 A.3d 513, 518 (2011) (quoting <em>Ray v. State, </em>410 Md. 384, 404, 978 A.2d 736, 747-48 (2009)). If the plain language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, the process ends and \u201cno further sleuthing of statutory interpretation is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>needed.\u201d <em>Breslin v. Powell, </em>421 Md. 266, 287, 26 A.3d 878, 891 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">When the words of the statute are ambiguous, we resolve the ambiguity using a wider range of interpretive aids, including legislative history, prior case law, statutory purpose and statutory structure. <em>Briggs v. State, </em>413 Md. 265, 275, 992 A.2d 433, 439 (2010) (quoting <em>Rosemann v. Salsbury, Clements, Bekman, Marder &amp; Adkins, LLC, </em>412 Md. 308, 315, 987 A.2d 48, 52 (2010)). We may also consider the \u201crelative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.\u201d <em>Gardner v. State, </em>420 Md. 1, 9, 20 A.3d 801, 806 (2011) (quoting <em>State v. Johnson, </em>415 Md. 413, 422, 2 A.3d 368, 373 (2010)). Finally, we are guided by the presumption that \u201cthe Legislature intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law, such that no part of the statute is rendered meaningless or nugatory.\u201d <em>Smack v. Dep\u2019t of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>378 Md. 298, 306, 835 A.2d 1175, 1179 (2003) (quoting <em>Witte v. Azarian, </em>369 Md. 518, 525, 801 A.2d 160, 165 (2002) (quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The ambiguity that prompts our use of these aids can arise when the words of the section at issue themselves are \u201csubject to more than one reasonable interpretation,\u201d <em>Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs v. Marcas, L.L.C., </em>415 Md. 676, 685, 4 A.3d 946, 951 (2010) (quoting <em>Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 276, 987 A.2d 18, 29 (2010)), and therefore \u201cdo not clearly disclose the legislative intention,\u201d <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 305, 835 A.2d at 1179. Ambiguity may also arise when \u201cthe words are clear and unambiguous when viewed in isolation, but become ambiguous when read as part of a larger statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Lockshin, </em>412 Md. at 276, 987 A.2d at 29. In every case, \u201cthe statute must be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is absurd, illogical, or incompatible with common sense.\u201d <em>Lark v. Montgomery Hospice, Inc., </em>414 Md. 215, 228, 994 A.2d 968, 976 (2010) (quoting <em>Lockshin, </em>412 Md. at 276, 987 A.2d at 29).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>The three sections at issue in this case are \u00a7\u00a7 11-108, 11-109, and 11-110. The parties do not disagree about the meaning of \u00a7 11-110; indeed, that section is plain when read both in isolation and together with other provisions of the subtitle. The parties sharply diverge, however, in their respective interpretation and application of \u00a7\u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(2) and ll-109(e)(2). Petitioner interprets those two sections together to mean that the 10-day period set forth in \u00a7 ll-110(a) within which a disciplined employee must act (if she desires to take a further appeal to the Secretary) is not triggered unless and until the head of the relevant principal unit issues a written decision. Petitioner\u2019s interpretation of the statutory scheme rests on the apparent mandate of \u00a7 ll-109(e)(2) that, \u201c[w]ithin 15 days after receiving an appeal, the head of the principal unit <em>shall issue </em>to the employee <em>a unitten decision </em>that addresses each point raised in the appeal.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Any other interpretation, argues Petitioner, would \u201cshift[]\u201d impermissibly \u201cthe burden of proceeding with the appeal ... [to the employee].\u201d Petitioner reads \u00a7 11-108(b)(2) as permitting the employee to identify the point at which a failure to decide is a deemed denial: either at the end of the 15-day period or, presumably, some period of time thereafter determinable by the disciplined employee without any standard. For that construction of \u00a7 ll-108(b)(2), Petitioner looks to the words that the \u201cfailure to decide ... is considered a denial from which an appeal <em>may </em>be made.\u201d (Emphasis in Petitioner\u2019s Brief.)</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">In that same vein, Petitioner also argues that the language of \u00a7 ll-110(a)(l) \u2014 \u201c[w]ithin 10 days <em>after receiving a decision under \u00a7 11-109 of this subtitle </em>\u201d \u2014 makes issuance of a written decision a prerequisite to the filing of an appeal with the Secretary of the DBM. (Emphasis in Petitioner\u2019s Brief.) Petitioner maintains, moreover, that she was justified in waiting 230 days before taking her appeal to the Secretary of DBM because she was trying, through her counsel\u2019s several letters to Secretary Maynard, to \u201cmake every effort to resolve an appeal at the lowest level possible,\u201d as directed by \u00a7 11-108(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Respondent interprets quite differently the language of \u00a7\u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(2) and 11 \u2014 109(e)(2). According to Respondent, the plain language of these provisions when read together triggers under all circumstances the \u00a7 11 \u2014 110(a)(1) 10-day period within which the employee seeking further administrative review must act in order to obtain such review. This is so, Respondent argues, regardless of whether the head of the principal unit issues a written decision within the 15-day period prescribed by \u00a7 11 \u2014 109(e)(2), or the failure to do so is deemed a denial by operation of \u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(2). Respondent takes issue with Petitioner\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 ll-108(b)(2). Respondent asserts that this subsection does not grant the employee the discretion to deem as a denial, or not, the failure of the head of the principal unit to issue a written decision, because the language of the subsection mandates that \u201ca failure to decide an appeal in accordance with this subtitle <em>is considered a </em>denial.... \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">We conclude that Respondent has the better part of the argument. To begin, we accept Petitioner\u2019s contention (with which Respondent seems to agree) that \u00a7 ll-109(e)(2) is cast in facially unambiguous \u2014 and seemingly mandatory\u2014 terms: \u201cWithin 15 days after receiving an appeal, the head of the principal unit <em>shall issue </em>to the employee a written decision that addresses each point raised in the appeal.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The apparent clarity of that provision, though, dims in light of the equally unambiguous language of \u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(2), which expressly allows that a decision may not issue: \u201cA failure to decide an appeal in accordance with this subtitle is considered a denial from which an appeal may be taken.\u201d Each of the two provisions, \u201cclear and unambiguous when viewed in isolation, ... become ambiguous when read as part of a larger statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Lockshin, </em>412 Md. at 276, 987 A.2d at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The ambiguity is readily resolved by employing the rules of statutory construction. As we undertake that task, we bear in mind the rule that various statutory provisions covering the same subject matter are to be construed, if at all possible, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>that together the sections harmonize with one another and no section is rendered nonsensical or nugatory. <em>Smack, </em>378 Md. at 306, 835 A.2d at 1179. The construction of \u00a7\u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(2) and ll-109(e)(2) that best adheres to these rules of interpretation is the one urged by Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">The most commonsensical way to interpret the two seemingly inconsistent provisions is to read \u00a7 ll-109(e)(2) to mean that, regardless of the reason for a failure of decision within the allotted period of fifteen days \u2014 be it error, negligence, or, more likely, a determination by the head of the principal unit not to issue a written decision \u2014 the failure of decision is, by operation of \u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(2), a denial of the appeal. Any other interpretation, short of one that is strained and, in the end, nonsensical, would render nugatory \u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">We reject the construction of \u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(2) offered by Petitioner. To repeat, \u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(2) reads: \u201c[a] failure to decide ... is considered a denial from which an appeal may be made.\u201d Petitioner, relying on the word \u201cmay\u201d at the end of the subsection, reads the entire text of the subsection as permitting the employee to elect when it comes into play. We do not read \u201cmay\u201d as Petitioner does. The word \u201cmay\u201d does not qualify whether a non-decision is deemed a denial of an appeal. Rather, \u201cmay\u201d merely acknowledges that the employee is not obligated to appeal an adverse decision. In fact, the word \u201cmay\u201d is found in every provision within Subtitle 1 of Title 11 that addresses the employee\u2019s right of appeal. <em>See </em>\u00a7 11 \u2014 109(c) (\u201cAn employee or employee\u2019s representative may file with the head of the principal unit a written appeal of a disciplinary action\u201d); \u00a7 ll-110(a)(l) (\u201cWithin 10 days after receiving a decision under \u00a7 11-109 of this subtitle, an employee or an employee\u2019s representative may appeal the decision in writing to the Secretary [of DBM]\u201d); \u00a7 ll-113(b)(l) (\u201cAn employee or an employee\u2019s representative may file a written appeal of a disciplinary action with the head of the principal unit\u201d). <em>See also </em>\u00a7\u00a7 12-204(a) &amp; 12-205(a) (using the word \u201cmay\u201d in describing the employee\u2019s right of appeal under the employee grievance process codified in Title 12 of the State Personnel and Pension Article). It would be unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>able to construe the word \u201cmay\u201d in both the disciplinary and grievance statutes as vesting the employee with the right to appeal while relieving the employee of the obligation of timely noting the appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Our construction of \u00a7\u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(2) and ll-109(e)(2) is supported by the legislative history. Before 1996, the process by which an employee in the classified service could appeal a termination decision was codified at Article 64A, \u00a7 33 of the Maryland Code (1957, 1983 Repl.Vol.). Article 64A, \u00a7 33 provided that, once cause for discipline was found and written charges were filed with the Secretary of Personnel,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> those charges \u201cshall within ninety days after filing, be heard, investigated and determined by the Secretary.\u201d The Secretary was directed to render his or her decision on the charges within 45 days after a hearing was formally held, or within 45 days after all legal memoranda were filed. Md.Code, art. 64A, \u00a7 33. Reaching those statutory benchmarks was difficult because the Secretary could only hear, investigate and determine so many terminations at once. Consequently, according to summary documents attached to the House Bill that repealed and replaced Article 64A, \u00a7 33, the single-source decision process resulted in an employee waiting an average of 225 days for an appeal to be resolved. <em>Summary of Changes attached to H.B. 77b, </em>1996 Reg. Session (Md. Gen. Assembly 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">To alleviate this and other inefficiencies, in June 1995 then-Governor Glendening issued Executive Order 01.01.1995.15, establishing a Task Force to Reform the State Personnel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Management System. The Executive Order requested from the Task Force a report and proposed legislation that \u201ccreat[ed] ... a modern human resources management system which streamlines and simplifies the State\u2019s personnel policies and provides for the consistent application of human resources management principles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The Task Force provided in January of 1996 its \u201cReport to the Governor\u201d (Report), which proposed, in part, a new, tiered decision-making process for disciplinary appeals that aimed to dispose of appeals in a responsive, flexible and effective manner. The Report\u2019s recommendations, including those for restructuring the appeal process, \u201cwere subsequently introduced in the General Assembly as the State Personnel Management System Reform Act of 1996.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]\u201d <em>Geiger, </em>371 Md. at 146, 807 A.2d at 44. \u201cThe Reform Act generally reflected] the Task Force recommendations and was passed in substantially the same form as proposed by the Task Force.\u201d <em>Reier v. State Dep\u2019t of Assessments and Taxation, </em>397 Md. 2, 28, 915 A.2d 970, 985 (2007) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Pertinent to this case, \u00a7\u00a7 11-109 and 11-110 were adopted directly from the Report by the Legislature without significant modification. <em>Compare </em>The Report, pp. 45-48, <em>with </em>\u00a7\u00a7 11-109 &amp; 11-110. Section 11-108 was introduced during the legislative process in the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The General Assembly\u2019s nearly verbatim enactment of the recommendations in the Report reflects the legislature\u2019s intent to effectuate the Task Force\u2019s original stated goal: \u201ccreation of a modern human resources management system which streamlines and simplifies the State\u2019s personnel policies and provides for the consistent application of human resources management principles.\u201d Executive Order 01.01.1995.15. Our construction of \u00a7\u00a7 ll-108(b)(2) and ll-109(e)(2) gives effect to that goal. It is significant that the General Assembly included \u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(2) as the bill moved through the legislature. The General Assembly\u2019s action evidences an apprecia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>tion for the notion that the head of a principal unit could not, or even should not, author in every appeal presented to him or her \u201ca written decision that addresses each point raised in the appeal,\u201d much less do so within fifteen days of receipt of the appeal. As we have construed it, \u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(2) ensures that an employee\u2019s appeal of disciplinary action is always ripe for pursuit of further appellate review exactly 15 days after filing. The legislative history also supports our rejection of Petitioner\u2019s construction of \u00a7 11-108, which would have granted employees an additional, discretionary waiting period before taking a further appeal. Not only would Petitioner\u2019s construction have been unworkable, but its effect would have returned the appellate process to its pre-1996 state.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">All that we have discussed leads to but one conclusion, and thus the holding of this case: Regardless of whether the head of the principal unit issues a written decision within fifteen days after receipt of the employee\u2019s appeal in accordance with \u00a7 11 \u2014 109(e)(2), or the appeal is denied by operation of \u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(2), the employee who desires to take a further appeal must do so within ten days after the earlier of these occurrences, pursuant to \u00a7 11 \u2014 110(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Before ending, we must briefly address one additional matter. Both Petitioner and Respondent dedicate portions of their briefs to disputing whether Secretary Maynard\u2019s failure to issue a written opinion violates the Accardi<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> doctrine. The doctrine, as both parties recognize, provides that \u201can administrative decision is subject to invalidation when the agency\u2019s \u2018failure to exercise its own discretion, [is] contrary to existing valid regulations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pollock v. Patuxent Inst. Bd. of Review, </em>374 Md. 463, 467 n. 1, 823 A.2d 626, 628 n. 1 (2003) (quoting <em>U.S. ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, </em>347 U.S. 260, 268, 74 S.Ct. 499, 98 L.Ed. 681 (1954)). In Supreme Court cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>subsequent to <em>Accardi, </em>the doctrine has been refined to a rule providing that \u201can administrative agency [must] generally follow its own procedures or regulations.\u201d <em>Id., </em>823 A.2d at 628 n. 1. Petitioner argues that the doctrine applies in the case before us because the agency overtly refused to follow its own regulation when Secretary Maynard failed to issue a decision in accordance with the direction of \u00a7 11 \u2014 109(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">We decline to resolve the parties\u2019 dispute because Petitioner\u2019s <em>Accardi </em>argument was neither presented in her petition for a writ of certiorari, nor fairly embraced in the question presented in that petition. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(b); <em>see also Robinson v. Balt. Police Dep\u2019t, </em>424 Md. 41, 49, 33 A.3d 972, 977 (2011) (declining to decide the petitioner\u2019s <em>Accardi </em>challenge because the \u201c[petitioner did not present the argument in a separate question in his petition for certiorari, and the argument is not embraced by the question he did present\u201d); <em>Garner v. Archers Glen Partners, Inc., </em>405 Md. 43, 60-61, 949 A.2d 639, 649 (2008) (\u201c[S]ince the time when this Court\u2019s jurisdiction became largely dependent upon the issuance of a writ of certiorari, we have consistently held that, in a case decided by an intermediate appellate court, we shall not consider an issue unless it was raised in a certiorari petition, a cross-petition, or the order by this Court granting certiorari.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

We also disagree with Petitioner's argument that \u00a7 11-108(d), providing that \u201d[e]ach party shall make every effort to resolve.an appeal at the lowest level possible,\u201d justifies the eight-month delay in filing the appeal. Section 11-108(d) cannot reasonably be read as Petitioner would like. Simply put, \u00a7 11-108(d) does not allow employees the discretion to delay a further appeal for as long as they might wish, while corresponding with administrative actors in an attempt to resolve the appeal. The statutory scheme forecloses such protracted conduct by creating an outer limit of time for decision-making and taking an appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b741-8\">.
