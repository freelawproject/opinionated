At trial, the State offered into evidence an audiotape of a prior statement by a State\u2019s witness, Sheila Billings, without explicitly offering at that time a theory for its admission. The trial court admitted that audiotape, among other items of physical evidence, saying that it was admissible as either a prior consistent statement or a prior inconsistent statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">Petitioner asks us to decide whether the court erred in admitting the audiotape statement of Ms. Billings, given that the State did not offer the grounds for admission and the court did not make explicit findings regarding admissibility. We are also asked to decide whether the trial court erred in sending to the jury room during deliberations, absent a specific request from the jury, the audiotape statement of Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Billings and other prior audiotape statements that were admitted into evidence. For the following reasons, we hold that the trial court did not err in either respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">This case arises out of the death of Tidell Harris, who was shot during the early morning hours of June 1, 2004. The next day, Kerwayne Stanton was arrested on drug related charges. He informed the arresting officer that he had witnessed the shooting the previous night. The police transported Stanton to the police station, where he spoke with Detective Ron Ciraolo. Based on information that Stanton supplied, Detective Ciraolo prepared two photographic arrays. Stanton identified the photographs of the Petitioner, Elliott McClain, also known as \u201cGoo\u201d or \u201cGooh,\u201d and Kevin Fletcher, known as \u201cPooh,\u201d as depicting the two gunmen who shot Harris, known as \u201cPopcorn\u201d (hereafter, \u201cthe victim\u201d). Stanton then provided a recorded statement of his account of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">During the days that followed, Detective Ciraolo separately questioned Fletcher and Petitioner at the police station. Fletcher gave a recorded statement in which he implicated himself and Petitioner in the shooting of the victim. Petitioner, at his interview, told Detective Ciraolo the following: he was at Sooner\u2019s Bar on the night of the shooting; the victim came into the bar, remained there for a short time, then left; thereafter, Petitioner heard gunshots outside, looked out the window, and saw a man lying in the street; Petitioner then told Sheila Billings, a server at the bar, to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Several months later, Detective Ciraolo conducted an audio-taped interview of Sheila Billings. Billings told Detective Ciraolo that, on the night of the shooting, Petitioner and the victim were in the bar; the victim left about thirty minutes before Petitioner himself left the bar; then a girl ran into the bar and said that the victim had been shot, outside. The audiotape contains the following exchange between Detective Ciraolo and Billings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>[Ciraolo]: Um, Miss Billings, do you remember or can you remember after Gooh [Petitioner] left the bar about how much time went by before the girl came running back in saying that ah ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">[Billings]: Well, ah, when the girl ran in I believe that was before he left. Ah, it was about, now I might be wrong on this, it, it was either just right, right after she came in and said it or it was right before and I\u2019m not real clear on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">[Ciraolo]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">[Billings]: Okay, so I\u2019m not so, I believe it was, no I\u2019m . wrong. It was like thirty minutes. He left and it\u2019s right before he was, that girl came in, when she ran in and said he was shot and he had left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">[Ciraolo]: So ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">[Billings]: And he never, he never came back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-10\">[Ciraolo]: So he was already out of the bar ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-11\">[Billings]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-12\">[Ciraolo]: when the girl came in ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-13\">[Billings]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-14\">[Ciraolo]: and told you ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-15\">[Billings]: That\u2019s correct, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-16\">[Ciraolo]: Okay, um, it\u2019s a little confusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-17\">[Billings]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-18\">[Ciraolo]: Just to clarify, Popcorn [the victim] left ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-19\">[Billings]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-20\">[Ciraolo]: Gooh [Petitioner] left ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-21\">[Billings]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-22\">[Ciraolo]: Sometime after that the girl came in and said he was shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-23\">[Billings]: Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-24\">At trial, the State called Billings to testify about the events of June 1, 2004. Contrary to her audiotaped statement to Detective Ciraolo, in which she stated that Petitioner left the bar after the victim but before the report that the victim had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>been shot, Billings answered \u201cyes,\u201d when asked whether Petitioner was still in the bar when the girl ran in and said someone had been shot. The State then attempted to show Billings a transcript of her November 2004 interview with Detective Ciraolo, and, upon defense counsel\u2019s request, the following bench conference took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">[Defense]: Your Honor, I object to giving the witness anything to refresh her recollection. She testified to something, and she does not need the document to refresh her recollection for any purpose. She was asked a question, and she answered it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">[The Court]: Well, if she answered the question inconsistently or incorrectly with regard to her previous statement, the State can certainly put the statement in front of her, and see if that refreshes her recollection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">[Defense]: Very good. But there\u2019s no foundation which would suggest that we needed that, Your Honor, so to allow her to review the document before that question is asked is problematic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">[The Court]: I disagree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">[Defense]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">[The Court]: You all have had an opportunity to review the statement, I mean I assume \u2014 what\u2019s your proffer, [State]? Why are you putting the statement in front of her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">[State]: She advised the police that Goo [Petitioner] left after Popcorn [the victim], and it was before the individual came in and said somebody had been shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-12\">[Defense]: The statement actually says that Goo [Petitioner] was in the bar. The statement says that Goo [Petitioner] was in the bar when the person came in, and then after police questioning she says, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really recall which.\u201d So it\u2019s not a matter of whether or not she recalls as she is sitting here today; it\u2019s a question of whether or not the State can show that the police managed to turn her statement around into something more ambiguous, and that\u2019s inappropriate as a purpose for her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>reviewing this statement at this point in time, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">[The Court]: Well what does the statement say, [State]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">[State]: Would you like a copy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">[The Court]: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">(State hands document to the Court.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">[The Court]: And you direct me to what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">[State]: Well, really, the whole thing, but more towards the end, where they ask her\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">[The Court]: Well, where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-12\">[State]: On page 2, it said \u201cDid somebody follow Popcorn out of the bar?\u201d She said, \u201cGoo.\u201d As it goes on, there is one portion where she is unclear, however, she does ultimately say that Goo followed Popcorn out of the bar, and that Goo was not in the bar when the individual came in and said somebody had been shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-13\">[The Court]: Well this doesn\u2019t say Goo followed Popcorn out of the bar. It says \u2014 thirty minutes afterwards?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-14\">[State]: That\u2019s what she said initially, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-15\">[The Court]: And your proffer is, that means that Goo followed Popcorn out of the bar because he left thirty minutes after Popcorn did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-16\">[State]: My whole point in calling her is to show that you can\u2019t hear the shots from the bar, and to show that the Defendant was not in the bar when the individual came in and said that Popcorn had been shot. Because as I\u2019m sure Your Honor recalls from the Defendant\u2019s statement, he said when the shots rang out, he heard them, and he was looking Ms. Sheila [Billings] in her face. However, in the statement to police, she stated that Goo was not in the bar when the individual came in and said somebody had been shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-17\">[The Court]: All right. I\u2019m going to overrule the objection. She can look at her statement\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-18\">Billings reviewed the transcript of her statement to police and stated that it refreshed her recollection. She then testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>fled that Petitioner left the bar before the woman came in and said Harris had been shot. The State asked Billings whether the police had told her what to say during the audiotaped interview. To that question, Billings answered, \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Following Petitioner\u2019s re-cross examination of Billings, the State moved to admit the taped statement into evidence, without specifying a basis for admission. Counsel for Petitioner entered a general objection, and the trial judge replied, simply, \u201cOverruled. In it comes.\u201d At that point, the audiotape was played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">After closing arguments, the trial court considered whether to send to the jury room the taped statements of Billings, Stanton (the arrestee who identified the photos of Petitioner and Fletcher as the men who were involved in the shooting), and Fletcher \u2014 the latter two of which also had been admitted into evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State advocated for the audiotapes to be sent to the jury room, citing Maryland Rule 4-326(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Counsel for Petitioner argued that sending the tapes to the jury room would be prejudicial insofar as it would allow the jury to listen repeatedly to them. The trial court, when describing the three taped statements, stated: \u201cThey were all admitted as either ... prior inconsistent statements or statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>consistent that were admitted to rehabilitate after cross examination.\u201d A bit later the court said, in reference to the taped statements of Billings and Stanton, that both \u201cwere offered into evidence by the State pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-802.1(a) and/or (b)....\u201d The court then ordered the tapes sent to the jury room, explaining that the tapes are items of evidence that the jurors \u201care entitled to review and are required to consider in the course of their deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The jury found Petitioner guilty of first degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and related handgun offenses. Petitioner appealed and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the convictions in an unreported opinion. He then petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we granted, to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">1. Where a witness\u2019s taped statement to police is offered and used for the purpose of refreshing recollection, may an appellate court affirm the admission of the tape into evidence under the theory that the statement was admissible as both a prior inconsistent statement and a prior consistent statement, where the prosecutor did not offer the statement under these hearsay exceptions, and where the trial court did not make the requisite findings of fact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">2. May a trial court, over defense counsel\u2019s objection, send testimonial exhibits to the jury room at the beginning of deliberation where the jury did not ask to review those exhibits?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Petitioner claims that the trial court erred in admitting Billings\u2019s taped statement into evidence. He contends that the statement was used only to refresh Billings\u2019s recollection, pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-612, and was inadmissible under that Rule. The State, however, does not argue that Billings\u2019s statement was admissible under Rule 5-612. The State instead argues that Billings\u2019s statement was admissible under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Maryland Rule 5-802.1,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as either a prior inconsistent, or prior consistent, statement. In so arguing, the State acknowledges that the prosecution did not give a theory of admission when offering the statement into evidence. Petitioner counters that the prior statement does not satisfy the requirements of Rule 5-802.1, and the trial court failed to make requisite findings of fact necessary to admit evidence under that Rule. We conclude, for the reasons that follow, that the court admitted the audiotape as a prior inconsistent statement, under Rule 5-802.1(a), and the court did not err in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The State first produced the transcript of Billings\u2019s prior statement, at trial, after Billings testified that Petitioner was in the bar when the woman entered and said the victim had been shot. During the ensuing bench conference, counsel for Petitioner objected \u201cto giving the witness anything to refresh her recollection.\u201d The court responded: \u201cWell, if she answered the question <em>inconsistently or incorrectly with regard to her previous statement, </em>the State can certainly put the statement in front of her, and see if that refreshes her recollection.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The State explained that it called Billings as a witness \u201cto show that the Defendant was not in the bar when the individual came in and said that Popcorn had been shot ... [and] in the statement to police, [Billings] stated that Goo [Petitioner] was not in the bar when the individual came in and said somebody had been shot.\u201d The court then overruled Petitioner\u2019s objection, allowing Billings to review her prior statement. In short, the bench <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>conference included references both to refreshing Billings\u2019s recollection, and to the inconsistency between her initial testimony at trial and her statement to Detective Ciraolo.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">When the State later offered Billings\u2019s audiotaped statement into evidence, the court admitted the statement without articulating the basis for doing so. We reject the possibility that the court admitted the taped statement as a statement used to refresh recollection. Indeed, given the absence of any express ruling to the contrary, we readily can \u2014 and do\u2014 indulge the presumption that the trial court knew full well that the audiotaped statement was not admissible under a theory of refreshed recollection. <em>See Germain v. State, </em>363 Md. 511, 534, 769 A.2d 931, 944 (2001) (\u201cWhen a party uses an earlier statement of his own witness to refresh the witness\u2019 memory, the only evidence recognized as such is the testimony so refreshed; and the party may not put the statement in evidence ....\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Rappy, </em>157 F.2d 964, 967 (2d Cir.1946)). Removing any doubt in that regard is that the trial court, when deciding whether to send to the jury room the taped statements of Billings and Stanton, said the statements of those two witnesses \u201cwere offered into evidence by the State pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-802.1(a) and/or (b)....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Petitioner seizes upon the statement we have just quoted to argue that the court incorrectly \u201clumped\u201d together the audio-taped statements of Billings and Stanton by characterizing both as having been admitted into evidence as prior inconsistent and/or prior consistent statements. That mis-characterization, Petitioner claims, is the result of the State\u2019s failure to provide a ground for admission of Billings\u2019s taped statement. Petitioner, however, does not point to any evidence clearly suggesting that Billings\u2019s statement was admitted under any Rule other than 5-802.1. In the absence of any such evidence proving otherwise, we take the trial court at its word.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">We are equally convinced that the trial court admitted the audiotaped statement as a prior inconsistent statement under Rule 5-802.1(a). Indeed, the discussion among the court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>counsel that preceded the court\u2019s admission of Billing\u2019s audio-taped statement reflects the court\u2019s acceptance of the State\u2019s proffer that the audiotaped statement would be inconsistent with Billings\u2019s initial testimony. The next question, then, is whether the court correctly admitted Billings\u2019s audiotaped statement under Rule 5-802.1(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In order to be admissible under section (a) of the Rule, the prior statement must be \u201cinconsistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony\u201d and either: (1) made under oath at a qualifying proceeding; (2) made in writing and signed by the declarant; or, pertinent to the facts of this case (3) \u201crecorded in substantially verbatim fashion by stenographic or electronic means contemporaneously with the making of the statement....\u201d As for the former requirement, Billings told Detective Ciraolo that Petitioner had left the bar before the woman entered and said the victim had been shot. That is inconsistent with her initial testimony at trial that Petitioner was in the bar when the woman entered. As for the pertinent latter requirement, Billings\u2019s prior statement was audiotape-recorded by the police during an interview with her; therefore, the audiotape offered by the State is \u201csubstantially verbatim,\u201d recorded by \u201celectronic means,\u201d and \u201ccontemporaneous! ] with the making of the statement.\u201d The prior statement, therefore, satisfies the requirements of Rule 5-802.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Petitioner argues that the statement was not inconsistent because, after being shown the statement to refresh her recollection, Billings amended her testimony to say that Petitioner left the bar before the woman entered; therefore, at the time the statement was admitted into evidence after recross examination, it was not inconsistent with the amended testimony. Petitioner\u2019s argument incorrectly discounts Billings\u2019s initial, unequivocal testimony that Petitioner did not leave the bar after the victim left but before the woman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>entered. That initial testimony, though subsequently amended, could have influenced the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">When a jury is presented with such conflicting testimony from a single witness, courts cannot speculate as to which side of the contradiction the jury will assign greater credibility. <em>See Bellamy v. State, </em>403 Md. 308, 332, 941 A.2d 1107, 1121 (2008) (explaining that \u201cwhat evidence to believe, what weight to be given it, and what facts flow from that evidence are for the jury ... to determine\u201d) (quoting <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 224, 571 A.2d 1251, 1260-61 (1990)). In this case, the trial court\u2019s allowing the prior statement into evidence provided an additional source from which the credibility of the inconsistent portions of Billings\u2019s testimony could be considered. <em>See </em>6 Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Practice: Maryland Evidence State and Federal </em>\u00a7 613:l(a) (2d ed. 2001) (stating that, when a witness\u2019s testimony is inconsistent with a prior statement of the witness, \u201c[t]he inference may then be made that the witness could not have been correct both times and may be wrong at trial, either because of faulty memory or deliberate prevarication\u201d). When determining whether inconsistency exists between testimony and prior statements, \u201cin case of doubt the courts should lean toward receiving such statements to aid in evaluating the testimony.\u201d Kenneth S. Broun, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 34, p. 153 (6th ed. 2006). <em>Cf. </em>Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook \u00a7 </em>1302[F] (4th ed. 2010) (\u201cFlat contradiction ... is not the only test of inconsistency.... [CJontrast in emphasis upon the same facts, even a different order of treatment, are also relevant to the cross-examining process of testing the credibility of a witness\u2019 trial testimony.\u201d (quoting <em>Jencks v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 657, 667, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1957))). For purposes of Rule 5-802.1(a), Billings\u2019s prior statement to Detective Ciraolo was inconsistent with her initial testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Petitioner further argues that, even if the prior statement of Billings otherwise satisfied the requirements of Rule 5-802.1(a), the trial court erred by not making express findings, on the record, that those requirements were met. Spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>eifically, Petitioner interprets Rule 5-104(a) as demanding that such findings be made expressly before a prior statement may be admitted into evidence. The State disagrees, asserting that the language of Rule 5-104(a) contains no such requirement and pointing out that this Court in <em>Davis v. State, </em>344 Md. 331, 339, 686 A.2d 1083, 1086 (1996), held that no explicit finding of inconsistency is required for admission of evidence under Rule 5-802.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Rule 5-104(a) provides: \u201cPreliminary questions concerning ... the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court....\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In support of his interpretation of the Rule, Petitioner cites <em>Corbett v. State, </em>130 Md.App. 408, 746 A.2d 954 (2000). In <em>Corbett, </em>the Court of Special Appeals was asked to determine if, when a witness testifies that he or she does not remember a particular event, that testimony is, for purposes of Rule 5-802.1(a), \u201cinconsistent\u201d with an earlier written statement by the witness about the event. <em>Id. </em>at 421, 746 A.2d at 960. The Court of Special Appeals held that the inability to remember is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the prior statement if such memory loss is falsely professed in order to avoid testifying on the matter at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 425-26, 746 A.2d at 963. The Court of Special Appeals explained that it was \u201cconfronted with an absence of any finding on the issue\u201d of whether the witness\u2019s memory loss was feigned or genuine. <em>Id. </em>at 426, 746 A.2d at 963. As a result, the Court of Special Appeals concluded: \u201cThe court erred in permitting [the witness\u2019s] statement to come into evidence as a prior inconsistent statement without first making a finding on that preliminary, predicate issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 426-27, 746 A.2d at 963 (citing Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>5-104). Nowhere, however, does the <em>Corbett </em>Court require that such a finding be made on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Unlike in <em>Corbett, </em>the facts of this case demonstrate that the trial court made a finding, albeit implicitly, on the admissibility of Billings\u2019s audiotaped statement as a prior inconsistent statement. During the bench conference that preceded the court\u2019s allowing the statement into evidence, the court itself inquired whether Billings testified \u201cinconsistently or incorrectly\u201d when compared with her prior statement, and evidently, based on the State\u2019s proffer, found that the two were inconsistent. Later, the court announced that the audiotaped statement was admitted under Rule 5-802.1. The court\u2019s comments certainly indicate, even if not expressly, that the court admitted the statement as a prior inconsistent statement under the Rule. We presume, moreover, that the court recognized its obligations to satisfy itself of the existence of the two prerequisites for admission of the statement under that Rule. <em>See Davis, </em>344 Md. at 339, 686 A.2d at 1086 (stating that the trial court\u2019s determination of inconsistency in witness statements was implied, when supported by the record, because \u201cjudges are presumed to know and, properly to have applied, the law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Corbett </em>emphasized that \u201cthe decision whether a witness\u2019s lack of memory is feigned or actual is a demeanor-based credibility finding that is within the sound discretion of the trial court to make,\u201d and such a decision cannot be made \u201cfrom the cold record.\u201d 130 Md.App. at 426, 746 A.2d at 963. In the instant case, however, there is no need for the trial court to have made a \u201cdemeanor-based credibility finding.\u201d Unlike the witness in <em>Corbett, </em>Billings did not assert an inability to remember the events surrounding the shooting; moreover, the \u201ccold record\u201d itself demonstrates the inconsistency between Billings\u2019s initial testimony and her prior audiotaped statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Finally, Rule 5-802.1, unlike some other Rules, does not require explicitly that findings be placed on the record, and we decline to read into the Rule such a requirement. <em>See Powell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>v. State, </em>394 Md. 632, 641 n. 7, 907 A.2d 242, 247 n. 7 (2006) (citing Maryland Rules 4-222(c), 4-314(a)(3) and 4-342(g) \u2014 the language of each of which explicitly requires the court to make findings on the record \u2014 as support for holding that a Rule will not be interpreted to include such a requirement when it contains no explicit language mandating that findings be placed on the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">We hold that the trial court committed no error by admitting into evidence the taped recording of Billings\u2019s prior statement to Detective Ciraolo.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Next, Petitioner argues that the trial court erred when, at the beginning of the jury\u2019s deliberations, the court sent to the jury room the audiotaped statements of Billings, Stanton, and Fletcher. Petitioner\u2019s argument is two-fold: (1) sending the audiotapes violated Rule 4-326(b)\u2019s prohibition on sending \u201cdepositions\u201d to the jury room because the taped statements were, for all relevant intents and purposes, depositions; and (2) Rule 4-326(c)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> allows evidence to be sent to the jury only upon request, and in this case the jury made no such request to have the audiotapes. For the reasons discussed below, we hold that the court did not err in sending the audiotaped statements to the jury room.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Rule 4-326(b) provides that, \u201c[ujnless the court for good cause orders otherwise,\u201d jurors may take to the jury room \u201cthe charging document and exhibits that have been admitted in evidence, except that a deposition may not be taken into the jury room without the agreement of all parties and the consent of the court.\u201d Section (c) of Rule 4-326 states that a court \u201cmay make available to the jury testimony or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>evidence requested by it.\u201d Recently, in <em>Adams v. State, </em>we explained the scope of sections (b) and (e):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">We construe Rule 4-326(b) as meaning precisely what it says: that, \u201cunless the court for good cause orders otherwise,\u201d exhibits admitted into evidence may be taken to the jury room by the jury while it deliberates. For the Rule to have meaning apart from section (c), the \u201cgood cause\u201d order must relate to specific exhibits and be made as to it or them prior to the jury being excused to deliberate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">Section (c) applies only where the request by the jury is for \u201ctestimony\u201d or \u201cother evidence,\u201d not admitted as an exhibit, and not therefore permitted to accompany the jury to the jury room.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">415 Md. 585, 599-600, 4 A.3d 499, 507-08 (2010). In other words, section (b) of Rule 4-326 presumes all exhibits in evidence, except for depositions, may go to the jury room unless \u201cgood cause\u201d exists to withhold them from the jury. Here, the audiotapes in question had been admitted into evidence as exhibits, and, therefore, section (b) guides our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">We decline to endorse Petitioner\u2019s argument that the audio-taped statements are \u201cdepositions\u201d for purposes of section (b). When interpreting the Maryland Rules, \u201cif the language of a rule is clear and unambiguous, it will be applied thusly in a common-sense manner.\u201d <em>Brown v. Daniel Realty Co., </em>409 Md. 565, 585, 976 A.2d 300, 311 (2009). The term \u201cdeposition\u201d in Rule 4-326(b) is clear and specific, as evidenced by the detailed descriptions in Rule 4-261 of when a \u201cdeposition\u201d may be taken in a criminal case, the manner in which it shall be taken, and the circumstances under which it may be used at trial. Specifically, Rule 4-261 (d) instructs that \u201c[t]he procedure for taking a deposition shall be as provided by Rules 2-401(f), 2-414, 2-415, 2-416, and 2447(b) and (c).\u201d The audio-taped statements in this case do not meet those procedural requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Under Rule 2-414(a), a \u201cdeposition\u201d conducted in Maryland \u201cshall be taken before any person authorized to administer an oath.\u201d In addition, under Rule 2-415(a), \u201c[t]he deponent shall be put on oath by the officer before whom a deposition is taken....\u201d In none of the three taped statements at issue was the witness placed under oath by anyone, let alone by a \u201cperson authorized to administer an oath.\u201d Accordingly, the statements are not \u201cdepositions\u201d for purposes of Rule 4-326(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Under Rule 4-326(b), \u201c[ejxhibits admitted into evidence may go to the jury room absent some specific reason, <em>i.e., </em>good cause, to exclude them.\u201d <em>Adams, </em>415 Md. at 601, 4 A.3d at 508. Whether \u201cgood cause\u201d exists to withhold admitted evidence from the jury is a determination left to the discretion of the trial court and will only be overturned on appeal if the trial court abused that discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 589, 4 A.3d at 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">In the present case, the trial court heard arguments from both sides before sending the audiotapes to the jury room. Defense counsel asserted that \u201cit prejudices my client with the tapes being played repeatedly in the jury room without benefit of testimony.... They do not have that to deliberate with in the jury room and this tape that\u2019s being pounded on these jurors over and over and over, it becomes problematic.\u201d In subsequently ruling that the tapes would be provided to the jury, the court explained that \u201cwe\u2019re not forcing the jurors to listen to the tapes. It\u2019s as any other piece of evidence. It\u2019s up there for their review should they choose to review it.\u201d The court then highlighted other evidence that would be sent to the jury room along with the audiotapes, including exhibits submitted by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">From this record, it is clear to us that the trial court considered and reasonably rejected the Defense\u2019s argument concerning potential \u201cgood cause\u201d for withholding the tapes from the jury. We therefore hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sending to the jury room the taped statements of Billings, Stanton, and Fletcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\">.

I disagree and, therefore, dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The petitioner, Elliott McClain, was convicted, by a jury, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, of the first degree murder of Tidell Harris, conspiracy to commit that murder, and related handgun offenses. The convictions arose out of a shooting that occurred outside of Sooner\u2019s Bar in Baltimore. Kerwayne Stanton, who had been arrested for possession of controlled dangerous substances, identified the petitioner, also known as \u201cGoo\u201d, and Kevin Fletcher, identified as \u201cPooh,\u201d from photo arrays as the two men who shot Mr. Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Unlike Mr. Fletcher, who, in an audio-taped statement, implicated himself and the petitioner in the shooting,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the petitioner denied any involvement at all. Indeed, although he admitted being at Sooner\u2019s Bar on the night of the shooting, and witnessing the victim enter the bar and leave shortly thereafter, he informed Detective Ciraolo, the investigating detective, that he was still in the bar when he heard gunshots <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>outside and, only later, saw the victim lying in the street. The petitioner also said that he instructed Sheila Billings, a barmaid who was working on the night of the shooting, to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Detective Ciraolo subsequently interviewed Sheila Billings. She gave a statement, which was audio-taped, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">\u201c[Ciraolo]: Um, Miss Billings, do you remember or can you remember after Gooh [the petitioner] left the bar about how much time went by before the girl came running back in saying that ah ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">\u201c[Billings]: Well, ah, when the girl ran in I believe that it was before he left. Ah, it was about, now I might be wrong on this, it, it was either just right, right after she came in and said it or it was right before and I\u2019m not real clear on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">\u201c[Ciraolo]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-9\">\u201c[Billings]: Okay, so I\u2019m not so, I believe it was, no I\u2019m wrong. It was like thirty minutes. He left and it\u2019s right before he was, that girl came in, when she ran in and said he was shot and he had left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-10\">\u201c[Ciraolo]: So ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-11\">\u201c[Billings]: And he never, he never came back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-12\">\u201c[Ciraolo]: So he was already out of the bar ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-13\">\u201c[Billings]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-14\">\u201c[Ciraolo]: When the girl came in ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-15\">\u201c[Billings]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-16\">\u201c[Ciraolo]: and told you ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-17\">\u201c[Billings]: That\u2019s correct, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-18\">\u201c[Ciraolo]: Okay, um, it\u2019s a little confusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-19\">\u201c[Billings]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-20\">\u201c[Ciraolo]: Just to clarify, Popcorn [the victim] left ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-21\">\u201c[Billings]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-22\">\u201c[Ciraolo]: Gooh [the petitioner] left ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-23\">\u201c[Billings]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\u201c[Ciraolo]: Sometime after that the girl came in and said he was shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">\u201c[Billings]: Right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">At trial, the prosecution called Ms. Billings as a witness. She testified that she was familiar with both the petitioner, and Mr. Harris, the victim. She remembered the victim entering the bar on the night of the shooting, but not being permitted to stay, he left soon thereafter. She recalled, also, that the petitioner was present at Sooner\u2019s Bar at that time. She then testified that, at a later point during the night, a girl ran into the bar and informed her that the victim had been shot; she had not heard the gunshots over the loud music in the bar. When asked whether the petitioner was still in the bar when the girl came in and informed her that the victim had been shot, she answered \u201cyes,\u201d stating that he was, indeed, present with a friend. That was contrary to her statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The State\u2019s attempt to provide Ms. Billings with a transcript of her November, 2004 statement to refresh her recollection prompted the petitioner\u2019s objection, resulting in a bench conference. At the bench, the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">\u201c[Defense]: Your Honor, I object to giving the witness anything to refresh her recollection. She testified to something, and she does not need the document to refresh her recollection for any purpose. She was asked a question, and she answered it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">\u201c[The Court]: Well, if she answered the question inconsistently or incorrectly with regard to her previous statement, the State can certainly put the statement in front of her, and see if that refreshes her recollection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-10\">\u201c[Defense]: Very good. But there\u2019s no foundation which would suggest that we needed that, Your Honor, so to allow her to review the document before that question is asked is problematic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-11\">\u201c[The Court]: I disagree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-12\">\u201c[Defense]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>\u201c[The Court]: You all have had an opportunity to review the statement, I mean I assume \u2014 what\u2019s your proffer, [State]? Why are you putting the statement in front of her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">\u201c[State]: She advised the police that Goo [the petitioner] left after Popcorn [the victim], and it was before the individual came in and said somebody had been shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">\u201c[Defense]: The statement actually says that Goo [Petitioner] was in the bar. The statement says that Goo [Petitioner] was in the bar when the person came in, and then after police questioning she says, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really recall which.\u201d So it\u2019s not a matter of whether or not she recalls as she is sitting here today; it\u2019s a question of whether or not the State can show that the police managed to turn her statement around into something more ambiguous, and that\u2019s inappropriate as a purpose for her reviewing the statement at this point in time, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">\u201c[The Court]: Well, what does the statement say, [State]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">\u201c[State]: Would you like a copy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">\u201c[The Court]: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">(State hands document to the Court.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-11\">\u201c[The Court]: And you direct me to what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-12\">\u201c[State]: Well, really, the whole thing, but more towards the end, where they ask her \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-13\">\u201c[The Court]: Well, where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-14\">\u201c[State]: On page 2, it said \u2018Did somebody follow Popcorn out of the bar?\u2019 She said, \u2018Goo.\u2019 As it goes on, there is one portion where she is unclear, however, she does ultimately say that Goo followed Popcorn out of the bar, and that Goo was not in the bar when the individual came in and said somebody had been shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-15\">\u201c[The Court]: Well this doesn\u2019t say Goo followed Popcorn out of the bar. It says \u2014 thirty minutes afterwards?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-16\">\u201c[State]: That\u2019s what she said initially, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>\u201c[The Court]: And your proffer is, that means that Goo followed Popcorn out of the bar because he left thirty minutes after Popcorn did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">\u201c[State]: My whole point in calling her is to show that you can\u2019t hear the shots from the bar, and to show that the Defendant was not in the bar when the individual came in and said that Popcorn had been shot. Because as I\u2019m sure Your Honor recalls from the Defendant\u2019s statement, he said when the shots rang out, he heard them, and he was looking Ms. Sheila [Billings] in her face. However, in the statement to the police, she stated that Goo was not in the bar when the individual came in and said somebody had been shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">\u201c[The Court]: All right. I\u2019m going to overrule the objection. She can look at her statement \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">After reviewing the transcript of her statement, Ms. Billings declared her recollection refreshed and proceeded to testify consistently with her statement. In that regard, she responded, when asked, that the petitioner was not in the bar when the girl ran in and informed her that the victim had been shot. She also, again consistently, testified that she could not hear the shooting over the loud music in the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Following this exchange, the petitioner\u2019s cross-examination, and subsequent questioning by the parties, the State moved, without specifying a basis for admission, to admit Ms. Billings\u2019 statement into evidence. The petitioner\u2019s objection was overruled, the trial judge ruling, simply, \u201c[i]n it comes.\u201d Thereafter, the audio-tape of the statement was played for the jury. At the conclusion of the trial, the court approved sending the audio-taped statement to the jury room. In so doing, the trial court concluded that the statements \u201cwere offered into evidence by the State pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-802.1(a) and/or (b),\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the jurors \u201care entitled to review and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>are required to consider [them] in the course of their deliberations.\u201d Op. at 246, 40 A.3d at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The petitioner noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. There, he argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that in accordance with Maryland Rule 5-612,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ms. Billings\u2019 prior statement neither should have been admitted as an exhibit, nor played for the jury after being used to refresh the witness\u2019 recollection. The intermediate appellate court, in an unreported opinion, rejected those arguments and, thus, affirmed the judgments. It agreed with the trial court that Maryland Rule 5-802.1(a) and (b), rather than Rule 5-612, applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The petitioner filed with this Court a petition for writ of certiorari, asking that we answer the following question:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\u201cWhere a witness\u2019s taped statement to police is offered and used for the purpose of refreshing recollection, may an appellate court affirm the admission of the tape into evidence under the theory that the statement was admissible as both a prior inconsistent statement and a prior consistent statement, where the prosecutor did not offer the statement under these hearsay exceptions, and where the trial court did not make the requisite findings of fact?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The majority affirms the decision of the Court of Special Appeals. Like that court, it holds that the trial court correctly admitted Ms. Billings\u2019 statement, audio-tape and transcript, as a prior inconsistent statement, pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-802.1(a). Op. at 247-48, 40 A.3d at 401. The majority reasons that the bench conference, alone, did not clearly indicate the purpose for which Ms. Billings\u2019 statement would be admitted into evidence. Since there were references to refreshing her recollection, as well as to the statement being inconsistent with her prior audio-taped statement, <em>id., </em>apparently giving the trial court the benefit of the doubt, the majority \u201creject[s] the possibility that the court admitted the taped statement as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>a statement used to refresh recollection,\u201d and holds, instead, that \u201cgiven the absence of any express ruling to the contrary, we can readily indulge the presumption that the trial court knew full well that the audio-taped statement would not be admissible under such a theory.\u201d Op. at 248, 40 A.3d at 401. Having concluded that \u201cthe trial court admitted the audio-tape as a prior inconsistent statement under Rule 5-802.1(a),\u201d op. at 247, 40 A.3d at 401, the majority opts not to address the possibility that the statement may have been admitted as a prior consistent statement under Rule 5 \u2014 802.1(b). Op. at 249, n. 4, 40 A.3d at 402, n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">To the petitioner\u2019s contention that the Billings statement could not have been admitted as a prior inconsistent statement because, at the time it was admitted, Ms. Billings\u2019 trial testimony was consistent with her statement, and although she had testified inconsistently on one occasion, and in only one particular, once her recollection was refreshed, she changed her testimony such that it mirrored what was contained in her audio-taped statement, the majority responds that the jury could still have been influenced by her earlier testimony that Mr. McClain was still in the bar when the girl ran in and informed her that there had been gunshots outside. Op. at 249-50, 40 A.3d at 402-03. The majority also disagrees with the petitioner\u2019s argument that, prerequisite to admission of evidence pursuant to Rule 5-802.1(a), preliminary evidentiary findings as to the basis of the offer must be made on the record, in accordance with Rule 5-104(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is satisfied, in that regard, that the trial court implicitly \u201crecognized its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>obligation to satisfy itself of the existence of the two prerequisites for admission of the statement under that Rule,\u201d and that this finding was not required by Rule 5-104(a) to be on the record. Op. at 251-52, 40 A.3d at 403-04. The majority accordingly concludes that the trial court did not commit error when it admitted the audio-taped recording of Ms. Billings\u2019 prior statement into evidence. Op. at 252-53, 40 A.3d at 404-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">I believe that it was improper, after the transcript of Ms. Billings\u2019 statement had sufficiently refreshed her recollection, for the audio-tape of that statement to be admitted as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The trial court erred when it admitted the audio-tape of Ms. Billings\u2019 statement into evidence because it did not qualify for admission under any of the hearsay exceptions. Clearly, it could not be admitted under Rule 5-612; after Ms. Billings\u2019 recollection had been refreshed, it failed to meet the requirements of that rule \u2014 it was not offered \u201cfor the limited purpose of impeaching the witness as to whether the item in fact refreshed the witness\u2019s recollection.\u201d Nor could it be admitted, contrary to the holding of the majority, under Rule 5-802.1(a) \u2014 it simply was not offered and, therefore, could not have been admitted as a prior inconsistent statement. Hearsay, defined as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted,\u201d Md. Rule 5-801, \u201cis not admissible\u201d unless \u201cotherwise provided by these rules or permitted by applicable constitutional provisions or statutes.\u201d Md. Rule 5-802. Ms. Billings\u2019 statement is hearsay. The Maryland Rules provide that such statements, or a portion of them, may be admissible under some circumstances. Rule 5-612, for example, permits a witness, for the State or any party, to use a hearsay statement, in writing, to refresh the recollection of the witness. Should the statement be so used, it is nevertheless inadmissible as evidence, unless those portions that relate to the testimony are introduced \u201cfor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>limited purpose of impeaching the witness as to whether the item in fact refreshes the witness\u2019s recollection.\u201d Md. Rule 5-612. That is not this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Maryland Rule 5-802.1 enunciates five (5) exceptions to this Hearsay Rule, pertaining to prior witness statements, two (2) of which are relevant to the issue in this case. Section (a) permits the admission of a hearsay statement, \u201creduced to writing and ... signed by the declarant,\u201d that is \u201cinconsistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony\u201d and was, as relevant here, \u201crecorded in substantially verbatim fashion by stenographic or electronic means contemporaneously with the making of the statement.\u201d Under Section (b), a prior consistent statement, one that is \u201cconsistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony\u201d is admissible, but only if \u201coffered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of fabrication, or improper influence or motive.\u201d The majority is of the view that the former, rather than Rule 5-612 or Section (b), applies. While I agree that neither Rule 5-612 nor Rule 5-802.1(b) applies, I disagree that Rule 5-802.1(a) does.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The majority\u2019s holding that Ms. Billings\u2019 audio-taped statement was admitted into evidence pursuant to Rule 5-802.1(a), overlooks all indications to the contrary in the record. It also overlooks an incontrovertible fact, that, at the end of the day, when all is said and done, there was no inconsistency between Ms. Billings\u2019 trial testimony and her audio-taped statement. The prosecutor made clear what he hoped to prove with Ms. Billings\u2019 testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">\u201cMy whole point in calling her is to show that you can\u2019t hear the shots from the bar, and to show that the Defendant was not in the bar when the individual came in and said that Popcorn had been shot. Because as I\u2019m sure Your Honor recalls from the Defendant\u2019s statement, he said when the shots rang out, he heard them, and he was looking Ms. Sheila [Billings] in her face. However, in the statement to the police, she stated that Goo was not in the bar when the individual came in and said somebody had been shot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atc\">While she admittedly testified inconsistently when first asked about the petitioner\u2019s whereabouts at the critical time, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>her recollection had been refreshed, her testimony reflected no such inconsistency. Indeed, it mirrored the statement on the critical facts, whether gunshots from outside could be heard inside the bar and the petitioner\u2019s whereabouts when the shots were fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">To begin, we look to how the issue arose. Even a cursory review of the facts underlying this case clearly demonstrates that the State\u2019s purpose in showing the transcript of her statement to the witness was solely to refresh her recollection, something clearly allowed under, and indeed contemplated by, Rule 5-612. Armed with Ms. Billings\u2019 statement that the petitioner was not in the bar when she learned that the victim had been shot, the prosecutor expected her to testify consistently. When she did not, and, in fact, testified that the petitioner was in the bar with a friend, obviously surprised, the prosecutor responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">\u201cI\u2019m going to show you what I have pre-marked for identification purposes as State\u2019s Exhibit Number 5. Can you take a moment and read through that to yourself and tell me if that <em>refreshes your recollection </em>about what occurred that morning of June 1st, 2004.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">It is significant that, notwithstanding the contradiction in her testimony, the prosecutor did not accuse Ms. Billings of fabricating testimony, or recanting her statement; rather, he apparently attributed it, with good reason, as subsequent events proved, to the ambiguity of the statement, and to her being unable to recollect clearly. This initial use of the transcript, after Ms. Billings offered testimony that indicated some difficulty recalling the events on the night of the shooting, without anything further, establishes the purpose for which the State sought to use her out of court statement. The petitioner\u2019s objection is consistent. It was to the State\u2019s refreshing the witness\u2019 recollection. It and the bench conference it precipitated, focused not on the inconsistency of the witness\u2019 testimony, but on the necessity of its being refreshed and the use of her prior statement for that purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">\u201c[Defense]: Your Honor, I object to giving the witness anything to <em>refresh her recollection. </em>She testified to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>something, and she does not need the document to refresh her recollection for any purpose. She was asked a question, and she answered it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">\u201c[The Court]: Well, if she answered the question inconsistently or incorrectly with regard to her previous statement, the State can certainly put the statement in front of her, and see if that <em>refreshes her </em>recollection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">To be sure, the inconsistency of Ms. Billings\u2019 trial testimony, at that point, and the witness\u2019 prior statement was noted, but it was done in the context of what was before the court for decision, whether to allow the State to use the statement to refresh the witness\u2019 recollection. The trial court was the first to reference the inconsistency, and the manner in which it did so is quite instructive, stating: \u201cWell, if she answered the question inconsistently or incorrectly with regard to her previous statement, the State can certainly put the statement in front of her, and see if that refreshes her recollection.\u201d The trial judge thus recognized inconsistency in a witness\u2019 trial testimony and a previously given statement as a basis for seeking to refresh the witness\u2019 recollection. The subsequent discussion by the State, to the extent that it referenced the inconsistency between the testimony and statement, was in the same context and to same effect \u2014 seeking leave to use the statement to refresh the witness\u2019 recollection. Most important, the relief given by the court was what the State sought; the witness was allowed to \u201clook at her statement.\u201d It is also relevant that, having been shown the transcript of the statement, the witness responded to the State\u2019s inquiry, \u201c[d]oes that <em>refresh your </em>recollection?,\u201d \u201c[y]es, it does.\u201d (emphasis added). She confirmed that response, on cross-examination, when the defense counsel showed her the statement a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Of course, the State did not move the witness\u2019 statement into evidence. Indeed, it could not. It had received the ruling it sought and, as a result, as we shall see and explore more fully, recollection having been refreshed, the witness\u2019 testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ny at trial on the point making refreshment of the witness\u2019 recollection necessary was modified so that it was consistent with her prior statement. The petitioner could have, but did not, offer the statement, or any portion of it, to impeach Ms. Billings\u2019 testimony that her recollection was refreshed. Rather, he merely sought to note a continuing objection to the \u201cintroduction\u201d of the document to refresh the witness\u2019 recollection. To be sure, the petitioner attacked Ms. Billings\u2019 reliability \u2014 credibility\u2014as a witness, pointing out the inconsistency and ambiguity in her statement and emphasizing the initial inconsistency of her trial testimony with that statement; however, despite that attack, Ms. Billings continued to testify consistently with her refreshed recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">It was only after Ms. Billings had been examined on direct, cross, re-direct, and re-cross, that the State offered her audio-taped statement into evidence. It did so despite the fact that, on the critical points, as identified by the State, Ms. Billings\u2019 testimony at trial and her audio-taped statement were totally consistent. To reiterate and emphasize, to be sure, on direct, she testified inconsistently on one point, but when her recollection was refreshed by reading her statement, she amended her testimony and, thereafter, testified entirely consistently with the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The majority holds that the audio-taped statement was offered and properly admitted into evidence pursuant to Rule 5-802.1(a). Like the petitioner, I believe that, even if the statement were offered pursuant to Rule 5-802.1(a), its admission was improper: the audio-taped statement is simply not a prior inconsistent statement. Furthermore, the petitioner argues that, in any case, the trial judge failed to make the preliminary findings of fact required by Maryland Rule 5-104(a), prior to admitting the statement into evidence. On these points, also, I agree with the petitioner,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and dissent from the holding of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The statement of a witness who testifies at trial and has been subject to cross examination regarding that statement, may be admitted into evidence pursuant to Rule 5-802.1(a) if the statement is, first, \u201cinconsistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony,\u201d and second, as applicable here, \u201crecorded in a substantially verbatim fashion by stenographic or electronic means contemporaneously with the making of the statement....\u201d Ms. Billings\u2019 statement, it is undisputed, met the second requirement. It did not qualify under the first \u2014 the statement, in fact, must be inconsistent with the testimony of the declarant. In this case, it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">When interviewed by Detective Ciraolo, Ms. Billings explained, in a somewhat confused manner, her recollection of events on the night of the shooting. She first stated that the petitioner was still in the bar when a girl ran in and informed her that the victim had been shot. She then equivocated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>eventually amending her response to say that the petitioner had actually left the bar prior to her learning of the shooting. The detective clarified the sequence of events by a series of questions, the answers to which indicated that the victim left, the petitioner left, and then the girl reported the shooting. While being questioned by the State at trial, Ms. Billings testified to a different sequence \u2014 that the petitioner was still in the bar when the girl reported the shooting. This was clearly inconsistent with her statement. Therefore, in accordance with Rule 5-802.1(a), had she persisted in testifying inconsistently, the State could have impeached her with her prior inconsistent statement, and offered it into evidence. That, however, is not what occurred. Instead, the State, in accordance with Rule 5-612, over the petitioner\u2019s objection, showed Ms. Billings the transcript of her statement, which refreshed her recollection. Her recollection thus refreshed, Ms. Billings did not persist in testifying inconsistently; rather, she amended her prior trial testimony with regard to the petitioner\u2019s whereabouts when the shooting was reported and thereafter continued to testify in accordance with the audio-taped statement. Consequently, there were no grounds for admission of the statement under Rule 5-802.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Holding the statement to be correctly admitted as a prior inconsistent statement, despite the witness\u2019 amendment of her testimony, after her recollection has been refreshed, is not only factually incorrect, but it contravenes the purpose of Rule 5-802.1(a). See <em>Stewart v. State, </em>342 Md. 230, 242, 674 A.2d 944, 950 (1996) (\u201cThe purpose of impeachment evidence is not to establish guilt, but to attack the credibility of a witness who has offered detrimental testimony.\u201d); <em>Bradley v. State, </em>333 Md. 593, 605-06, 636 A.2d 999, 1005 (1994) (\u201cImpeachment may be thought of as a shield [which] ... protects a party from unfavorable testimony by neutralizing that testimony ... [and] should not be used as a sword to place otherwise inadmissible evidence before the jury....\u201d). The Rule ensures that the jury is able to determine the credibility of a witness on the basis of complete information. By allowing the State to introduce Ms. Billings\u2019 statement into evidence, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the State had already used it, successfully, to refresh the recollection of the witness, is not only wrong and illogical, it gives the State an unfair advantage. Furthermore, and most troublesome, if the majority is correct, any testimony by a witness that is inconsistent with a prior statement, whether inadvertent or corrected, as here, by having recollection refreshed, automatically will warrant the admission of the statement, thus permitting the party, here, the State, who has been able to present the very evidence it was entitled to present, to \u201cgild the lily,\u201d and buttress its case further, with evidence that is otherwise inadmissible. That would also render Rule 5-612 surplusage and meaningless. Why should there be a Rule permitting a party to refresh a witness\u2019 memory with his or her prior inconsistent statement if the statement will be admissible, at the behest of the party who would benefit from its admission, as substantive evidence, in any event? The prohibition against the admission of hearsay evidence seeks to safeguard the accuracy and reliability of the trial process by ensuring that the jury is able to judge a witness\u2019 credibility while hearing his or her account, first-hand. <em>See Nance v. State, </em>331 Md. 549, 559, 629 A.2d 633, 638 (1993) (\u201cAs it derives its value not solely from the credit given to witnesses reporting it, but to the perception, veracity, and competency of the declarant, hearsay evidence is generally not admissible as affirmative proof of guilt.\u201d). The majority\u2019s holding erodes this purpose by weakening the safeguards set in place by Rule 5-802.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The Court should have overturned the holding of the Court of Special Appeals, and concluded that the trial court committed error when it admitted the audio-taped statement of the witness as substantive evidence subsequent to the witness\u2019 recollection already being refreshed, and there being no preliminary findings establishing that it was, in fact, admissible under any exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-10\">. At trial, Mr. Fletcher recanted his statement. He acknowledged that he had entered into a plea agreement with the State, but testified that he did not remember seeing the petitioner on the date of the incident, and, furthermore, that he did not even remember being present outside of Sooner's Bar on the date of the shooting. Mr. Fletcher conceded that the information he had provided to Detective Ciraolo had been fabricated, but maintained that it was because the detectives had promised him a reduced sentence in exchange for a statement implicating himself and the petitioner in the shooting. In addition, he stated, that he had been assaulted by the officers that took him into custody, prior to making his audio-taped statement, and also, that he was denied the opportunity to speak to his mother, or to an attorney, upon request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\">.

In this regard, also, the majority holds that the trial court did not err because \"Rule 4-326 presumes all exhibits in evidence, except for depositions, may go to the jury room unless 'good cause' exists to withhold them from the jury,\u201d and, furthermore, that the tapes cannot be considered \"depositions\u201d within the meaning of the rule.

In offering Ms. Billings\u2019 audio-taped statement, the State said only: \u201cI would ask that State\u2019s Exhibit 5A, the tape of this statement be moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>into evidence.\u201d The petitioner's objection was overruled, the court's entire ruling being, \u201c[i]n it comes.\" The only insight we have as to the basis for both the offer and the admission is supplied by reference to the examination of Ms. Billings, whose statement is at issue. Review of that portion of the proceedings reveals not a word, alter Ms. Billings\u2019 recollection had been refreshed, that would indicate that the State believed that her trial testimony was inconsistent with her audio-taped statement. Even when Ms. Billings testified differently from her statement, the State did not seek to impeach her testimony as inconsistent. Instead, it sought to use her statement to refresh her recollection. After the court overruled the petitioner\u2019s objection to its use of the statement for that purpose, it simply showed her the statement, and, as it had apparently assumed, that did the trick. To be sure, the inconsistent trial statement, the predicate for the ruling that the State could use the witness' statement to refresh recollection, was referenced by the petitioner in cross-examination, as were the ambiguities and inconsistencies in the witness' audio-taped statement, but not to establish an inconsistency between trial testimony and the witness\u2019 prior statement. They were referenced, rather, to undermine her reliability as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The majority is simply wrong in its conclusion that the trial court did not err when it failed to make required preliminary findings that would bring the audio-taped statement under Rule 5-802.1. Rule 5-104(a) provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[preliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness, the existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court....\u201d Accordingly, we have recognized that \u201cthe court\u2019s duty is to determine whether such preliminary facts exist to support the admissibility of evidence.\u201d <em>Crane v. Dunn, </em>382 Md. 83, 92, 854 A.2d 1180, 1185 (2004). \u201cThe court generally applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in making that determination.\u201d <em>Id. See also, Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 175-76, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 2778-79, 97 L.Ed.2d 144, 152-53 (1987). The record demonstrates that the trial court made no such preliminary findings of fact, in concluding that the audio-taped statement was admissible \u201cpursuant to Maryland Rule 5-802.1(a) and/or (b).... \u201d Indeed, the trial court, despite all indications to the contrary, assumed that the State sought to introduce the taped statement under Rule 5-802.1, with no demonstration that this was, in fact, the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The majority infers from the trial judge\u2019s reference to \u201cinconsistency\u201d during the bench conference on the petitioner's objection to the witness\u2019 recollection being refreshed, \"inquir[ing] whether [the witness] testified 'inconsistently or incorrectly' when compared to her prior statement,\u201d that these findings were made. Op. at 252, 40 A.3d at 404. It concludes that \"[t]he court's comments certainly indicate, even if not expressly, that the court admitted the statement as a prior inconsistent statement under ... [Rule 5-802.1].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The majority bases that conclusion on its belief that the trial court \u201cfound that the two were inconsistent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The majority \u201cpresume[s], moreover, that the court recognized its obligations to satisfy itself of the existence of the two prerequisites for admission of the statement under that Rule.\u201d Op. at 252, 40 A.3d at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The inconsistency finding was a limited \"finding,\u201d if a finding at all, as I have pointed out, <em>supra, </em>and as the transcript of the bench conference makes clear. In context, as we have seen, the trial court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">\"Well, if she answered the question inconsistently or incorrectly with regard to her previous statement, the State can certainly put the statement in front of her, and see if that refreshes her recollection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2B\">Moreover, the argument that flows from it is not persuasive. The context in which the \"inconsistent\u201d reference was made was, as indicated, during a bench conference prompted by the petitioner\u2019s objection to the State's use of the witness\u2019 prior statement to refresh her recollection; that was the focus of the discussion, not whether her testimony was inconsistent with her statement. That there was inconsistency was clear, what was not clear was the reason for it, whether it was intentional or the product of faulty memory. That question was resolved by allowing the State to refresh the witness\u2019 recollection, the very antithesis of impeaching with a prior inconsistent statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">The majority misapplies Rule 5-104(a). I submit that it is not sufficient for the trial court to make preliminary findings of fact without indicating in the record what they are, what findings have been made and are being relied on. The petitioner is correct when he proffers that \"the trial court did not make any of the preliminary findings of fact required under Md. Rule 5-802.1(a)....\u201d (Brief of petitioner, 19.) Drawing an inference, in this regard, is even more problematic when, as here, the record is clear that the only issue addressed by the court was the permissibility of using a prior statement to refresh recollection, a matter implicating only Rule 5-612.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
