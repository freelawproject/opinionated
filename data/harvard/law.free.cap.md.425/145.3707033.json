The trial court granted the State defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on the ground that the NSLA merely establishes a subsidized lunch program for the benefit all children at participating schools, and does not impose a specific statutory duty of care towards children with food allergies. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the dismissal. After examining the statute at issue, we agree with the determinations of the trial and intermediate appellate courts and therefore also affirm the dismissal, as a negligence action may not be maintained in the absence of a demonstrable duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Liana Pace, a five-year-old kindergarten student, suffered an anaphylactic<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reaction after being exposed to peanut butter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>at lunchtime. It is alleged that at the beginning of the school year, Liana\u2019s mother, Nicole Pace, informed Hillcrest Elementary School in Frederick, Maryland, about her daughter\u2019s severe allergy to peanuts. In October, Liana\u2019s allergist provided the school nurse with a pre-measured dose of epinephrine to be used in the event Liana was exposed to peanut products.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">On November 9, 2005, Liana went to the school cafeteria without a lunch or sufficient funds in her cafeteria account to purchase a lunch. In these instances, Hillcrest Elementary would serve students a \u201ccredit lunch\u201d consisting of either a bologna sandwich or a peanut butter sandwich. These lunches were subsidized by federal funds administered by the State of Maryland under the National School Lunch Act (\u201cNSLA\u201d). On this particular day, a cafeteria worker gave Liana a peanut butter sandwich. Liana resisted eating the sandwich, informing the worker that she was not allowed to have peanut butter. The worker mistook her protests as misbehavior and ordered her to eat the sandwich. Liana complied. The child immediately began experiencing an anaphylactic reaction; her airway and eyelids began to swell, and she became lethargic and confused. Approximately a half an hour later, she was taken to the nurse\u2019s suite and her mother was contacted. Ms. Pace told the nurse to administer the epinephrine dose. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Pace arrived at the school and rode with her daughter in an ambulance from the elementary school to Frederick Memorial Hospital, where Liana was observed and eventually released.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Following the allergic episode, Liana began to \u201cexperience symptoms of extreme psychological perturbation and post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>traumatic distress,\u201d exhibit \u201cregressive behavior such as thumb sucking and withdrawal\u201d and, ultimately, fear attending school. As a result, at the close of 2005, Ms. Pace withdrew Liana from Hillcrest Elementary and moved with her daughter to Michigan to reside with Liana\u2019s maternal grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">On November 8, 2006, Nicole Pace (hereinafter \u201cMs. Pace\u201d or \u201cPetitioner\u201d) filed suit on behalf of her daughter in the Circuit Court for Frederick County against the State of Maryland, the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE), the State Superintendent of Schools, (hereinafter \u201cthe State defendants\u201d or \u201cRespondents\u201d), the Board of Education of Frederick County, the Superintendent of the Frederick County Public Schools, the principal of Hillcrest Elementary, and three unnamed cafeteria workers (hereinafter \u201cthe County defendants\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While Ms. Pace asserted a variety of claims against the County defendants, her complaint included only a single count of negligence against the State defendants, based on an alleged breach of a statutory duty under the National School Lunch Act (NSLA). It alleged in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">19. [The State] [defendants ... are under a regulatory duty pursuant to COMAR 13A.06.01.01 to administer the State\u2019s public school lunch programs in accordance with the provisions of the [NSLA], codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1751 <em>et seq. </em>(2006). The statutory provisions of the Act impose an affirmative duty on the State of Maryland to tailor school lunch program menus and foods offered to individual students according to their \u201cindividual dietary and medical\u201d needs. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1758 (2006). The Code of Federal Regulations also requires monitoring by the states to ensure compliance with the statute. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 15b; 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.10(g)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">20. The explosive nature of peanut allergy, moreover, is specifically well-known to the State, which has developed extensive policies for the management of anaphylactic reac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>tions; however, the State has not applied these metrics and administrative strategies to the management of individual dietary needs of students in school lunch programs, statewide. The State, therefore, has breached its statutory duty under the [NSLA]. This is all the more egregious, because the State has an extensive policy for after-the-fact management of anaphylactic reactions, yet no specific administrative protocol in place to minimize dietary exposures in school lunch programs so such exposures do not occur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">21. As a result of the State\u2019s negligence, school administration and cafeteria staff at the Hillcrest Elementary School did not have the proper dietary \u201cflagging\u201d regimen or administrative program in place, to notify cafeteria workers of Liana\u2019s extreme allergic sensitivity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">22. As a result of the State\u2019s negligence, school administration at the Hillcrest Elementary School did not have a uniform plan implemented to inform cafeteria workers, who served Liana the very foodstuff she could not tolerate, which produced the life-threatening anaphylactic reaction and accompanying fear and severe emotional distress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">On February 27, 2007, the State defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that they were not proper parties to the action because the State\u2019s role under the NSLA is limited to reimbursement and periodic monitoring, while the local school boards actually operate the school lunch program within their districts. They also moved to dismiss on the ground of governmental immunity. On March 15, 2007, Ms. Pace filed a response to the motion to dismiss reiterating her allegation that the NSLA places an independent duty on the State \u201cto administer school lunch and free feeding programs in accordance with individual student dietary and medical needs,\u201d and cited to several federal regulations not included within the complaint. On this same day, Ms. Pace filed an amended complaint that corrected typographical errors, but otherwise made clear that it \u201cincorporate^ the allegations of the original Complaint essentially verbatim.\u201d The Circuit Court held a hearing on the State defendants\u2019 motion on June 20, 2007, and in a later-filed opinion and order, determined that Ms. Pace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>it is not disputed that the State had a statutory obligation to establish a free feeding program and to ensure that it was implemented in the schools. This program includes a provision to ensure that the needs of children with special dietary needs are met. However, the State did not have a specific statutory duty to control the acts of the school employees or to ensure that each child received the correct food.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Ms. Pace appealed the trial court\u2019s dismissal, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the ruling. <em>Pace v. State, </em>195 Md.App. 32, 5 A.3d 1121 (2010). The intermediate appellate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">[W]e conclude that the circuit court did not err in concluding that the NSLA does not impose a special duty upon the State defendants to exercise a greater degree of care for students with food allergies than the general level of care for health and safety the State defendants exercise for all students in public schools.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-8\"><em>Pace, </em>195 Md.App. at 52, 5 A.3d at 1132.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">We granted Petitioner\u2019s writ of certiorari, <em>Pace v. State, </em>418 Md. 190, 13 A.3d 798 (2011), which asked us to determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABi\">Whether the trial court erred in granting the State Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss, finding that the State had no duty of care to the Plaintiff\u2019s daughter], rather than a special or statutory duty to ensure her \u2018individual,\u2019 \u2018special\u2019 dietary needs were met and to protect her from discrimination on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the basis of either race or disability in the administration of the school lunch program[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">We answer that question in the negative and therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">To sufficiently plead a cause of action for negligence in Maryland, a plaintiff must \u201callege with certainty and definiteness, facts and circumstances sufficient to set forth (a) a <em>duty </em>owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, (b) a <em>breach </em>of that duty and (c) injury <em>proximately </em>resulting from that breach.\u201d <em>Pendleton v. State, </em>398 Md. 447, 458, 921 A.2d 196, 202-03 (2007) (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Scott v. Jenkins, </em>345 Md. 21, 28, 690 A.2d 1000, 1003 (1997)). Thus, the initial requisite element is that \u201cthere must exist a duty which is owed by the defendant to the plaintiff to observe that care which the law prescribes in the given circumstances. . . .\u201d <em>Jackson v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., </em>176 Md. 1, 5, 3 A.2d 719, 721 (1939). As we have said \u201c[t]he existence of a duty is a matter of law to be determined by the court and, therefore, is an appropriate issue to be disposed of on motion for dismissal.\u201d <em>Bobo v. State, </em>346 Md. 706, 716, 697 A.2d 1371, 1376 (1997); <em>accord Pendleton, </em>398 Md. at 461, 921 A.2d at 204 (\u201cWhether a legal duty exists is a question of law, to be decided by the court.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Valentine v. On Target, Inc., </em>353 Md. 544, 549, 727 A.2d 947, 949 (1999) (\u201cGenerally, whether there is adequate proof of the required elements needed to succeed in a negligence action is a question of fact to be determined by the fact finder; but, the existence of a legal duty is a question of law to be decided by the court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">\u2018When reviewing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, trial and appellate courts must assume the truth of all well-pleaded, relevant, and material facts in the complaint and any reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Muthukumarana v. Montgomery County, </em>370 Md. 447, 474, 805 A.2d 372, 388 (2002) (internal quotation omitted); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>accord Pendleton, </em>398 Md. at 458-59, 921 A.2d at 203; <em>Debbas v. Nelson, </em>389 Md. 364, 372, 885 A.2d 802, 807 (2005); <em>Horridge v. St. Mary\u2019s County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Services, </em>382 Md. 170, 175, 854 A.2d 1232, 1234-35 (2004); <em>Porterfield v. Mascari II, Inc., </em>374 Md. 402, 414, 823 A.2d 590, 597 (2003). \u201cDismissal is proper only if the alleged facts and permissible inferences, so viewed, would, if proven, nonetheless fail to afford relief to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Ricketts v. Ricketts, </em>393 Md. 479, 492, 903 A.2d 857, 864 (2006); <em>accord Valentine, </em>353 Md. at 548, 727 A.2d at 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">In the instant case, the trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, based on the absence of a well-pled statutory duty in the State defendants to prevent the harm that occurred. We review that ruling to \u201cdetermine whether the trial court was legally correct, examining solely the sufficiency of the pleading.\u201d <em>Bobo, </em>346 Md. at 709, 697 A.2d at 1373; <em>Ricketts, </em>393 Md. at 492, 903 A.2d at 865. Therefore, in order for Petitioner\u2019s suit to have properly survived a motion to dismiss, the complaint must have sufficiently alleged that the State defendants owed Liana a duty in tort. We shall hold that the trial court was legally correct in its dismissal, and therefore affirm under the reasoning discussed, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Duty is a foundational element in a claim of negligence because, as we have said, \u201cnegligence is a breach of a duty owed to one, and absent that duty, there can be no negligence.\u201d Ash<em>burn v. Anne Arundel County, </em>306 Md. 617, 627, 510 A.2d 1078, 1083 (1986); <em>accord Pendleton, </em>398 Md. at 461, 921 A.2d at 204 (\u201c[W]hen analyzing a negligence action it is customary to begin with whether a legally cognizable duty exists.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Bobo, </em>346 Md. at 714, 697 A.2d at 1375 (\u201c[T]he existence of a duty is the threshold question.\u201d); <em>W. Va. Central R. Co. v. Fuller, </em>96 Md. 652, 666, 54 A. 669, 671 (1903) (\u201c[TJhere can be no negligence where there is no duty that is due----\u201d). This Court has adopted Prosser and Keeton\u2019s definition of duty as \u201can obligation, to which the law will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>give recognition and effect, to conform to a particular standard of conduct toward another.\u201d <em>See Remsburg v. Montgomery, </em>376 Md. 568, 582, 831 A.2d 18, 26 (2003) (quoting W. Page Keeton et al., <em>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 53 at 356 (5th ed. 1984)); <em>Horridge, </em>382 Md. at 182, 854 A.2d at 1235; <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 627, 510 A.2d at 1083. As Prosser and Keeton note, \u201cduty is not sacrosanct in itself, but is only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is entitled to protection.\u201d W. Page Keeton et al., <em>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 53 at 358 (5th ed. 1984) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have explained that in order to determine whether a duty exists, relevant considerations necessarily include \u201cthe nature of the harm likely to result from a failure to exercise due care, and the relationship that exists between the parties.\u201d <em>Jacques v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>307 Md. 527, 534, 515 A.2d 756, 759 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">As a general rule, a person \u201cis under no special duty to protect another from ... acts by a third person, in the absence of statutes, or of a special relationship.\u201d <em>Horridge, </em>382 Md. at 183, 854 A.2d at 1239 (quoting <em>Scott v. Watson, </em>278 Md. 160, 166, 359 A.2d 548, 552 (1976)); <em>accord Valentine, </em>353 Md. at 551-52, 727 A.2d at 950-51; <em>Bobo, </em>346 Md. at 715, 697 A.2d at 1376; <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 628, 510 A.2d at 1083. Petitioner concedes that there was no special relationship between Liana and the State defendants in the instant case because the State was neither involved in the underlying incident, nor did the State defendants have any specific knowledge of Liana\u2019s particular allergy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioner claims, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>that the State defendants may be held independently liable for the underlying events based upon a statutory duty owed to Liana under the NSLA. Respondents argue, conversely, that the only duties included in the NSLA are duties owed to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The public duty doctrine provides that \u201cwhen a statute or common law Imposes upon a public entity a duty to the public at large ... the duty is not one enforceable in tort.\u2019 \u201d <em>Muthukumarana, </em>370 Md. at 486, 805 A.2d at 395 (internal quotation omitted). A frequently cited example is that \u201cthe \u2018duty\u2019 owed by the police by virtue of their positions as officers is a duty to protect the public,\u201d <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 628, 510 A.2d at 1084 (citations omitted), and is thereby not enforceable in tort by a member of the public claiming that the police failed to protect them, specifically. <em>Muthukumarana, </em>370 Md. at 486-87, 805 A.2d at 395. The public duty doctrine does not apply, however, where a court concludes that \u201ca statute or court order has created a <em>special duty </em>or specific obligation to a particular class of persons rather than to the public at large.\u201d <em>Muthukumarana, </em>370 Md. at 487, 805 A.2d at 396 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation omitted); <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 635, 510 A.2d at 1087 (noting that in order to find a duty flowing to an individual plaintiff, the statute must \u201cset forth mandatory acts clearly for the protection of a <em>particular class </em>of persons rather than the public as a whole\u201d (emphasis in original) (internal quotation omitted)). Therefore, in order to invoke a statutory duty as grounds for a negligence claim, \u201cthe plaintiff must show that it was within the class of persons the legislation was intended to protect and that the alleged injury was the type of harm which the statute was intended to prevent.\u201d <em>Remsburg, </em>376 Md. at 584, 831 A.2d at 27 (quoting <em>Geo. Byers Sons, Inc. v. East Europe Import Export, Inc., </em>463 F.Supp. 135, 138 (D.Md.1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>This Court has analyzed this requirement on several occasions, and each party in the instant case touts one of our precedents, explained <em>infra, </em>as applicable to the statutory language at issue. Petitioner argues that she has satisfied her burden to show that the NSLA was intended to protect children with special dietary needs and that the harm Liana suffered was of the type the statute was designed to prevent. In this argument, she relies on our holding in <em>Horridge v. St. Mary\u2019s County Department of Social Services, </em>382 Md. 170, 854 A.2d 1232 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">In <em>Horridge </em>we determined that the complaint at issue presented a well-pled allegation of a statutory duty owed by the State to a specific class of individuals. Under the facts presented in the pleading, a father who was aware that his nineteen-month-old son was being abused by the child\u2019s mother or her boyfriend, repeatedly reported the attacks to the Department of Social Services. <em>Horridge, </em>382 Md. at 176, 854 A.2d at 1235. In response, however, the state agency engaged in only cursory investigations of his allegations, accused Mr. Horridge of being a \u201cdisgruntled parent,\u201d and finally directed him to stop calling the Department. <em>Horridge, </em>382 Md. at 177, 854 A.2d at 1235. Then, tragically, eight days after the last report was made and ignored, the child was beaten to death. <em>Horridge, </em>382 Md. at 177, 854 A.2d at 1236. The trial court granted the State defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, noting that any statutory duty to protect children identified as being abused was owed to the public generally and, therefore, was not enforceable in tort. <em>Horridge, </em>382 Md. at 175, 186-87, 854 A.2d at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">This Court reversed, noting that under the pertinent statute, Maryland Code \u00a7 7-706 of the Family Law Article, the Department of Social Services was required to respond to <em>each </em>reported incident of child abuse or neglect and take affirmative steps, including actually seeing the child and deciding on the safety of the child within 24 hours of a report. <em>Horridge, </em>382 Md. at 184-85, 854 A.2d at 1240. It was clear that the statute\u2019s \u201cessential purpose ... was to protect a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>specific class of children, identified or identifiable before the fact from statutorily mandated reports, from a specific kind of harm likely to occur if the statutory duty is ignored.\u201d <em>Horridge, </em>382 Md. at 192, 854 A.2d at 1244. We explained that, unlike statutes which create only a public duty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">The duties imposed on DSS by FL \u00a7 5-706 and the implementing regulations of the Department of Human Resources are far more specific and focused. They require a prompt investigation of <em>each </em>reported incident of child abuse. The duty to act is mandatory; the steps to be taken are clearly delineated; and, most important, the statute makes clear in several places that the sole and specific objective of the requirement is the protection of a specific class of children \u2014 those identified in or identifiable from specific reports made to DSS and those also found in the home or in the care or custody of the alleged abuser. This is not an obligation that runs to everyone in general and no one in particular. It runs to an identified or identifiable child or discrete group of children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\"><em>Horridge, </em>382 Md. at 189-90, 854 A.2d at 1243 (emphasis in original); <em>c.f. Hayes v. State, </em>183 Md.App. 742, 754, 756, 963 A.2d 271, 278, 280 (2009) (holding that the same statute discussed in <em>Horridge </em>\u201cdoes not create a legally cognizable duty to a parent accused of abuse,\u201d as it \u201cwould not further the protection of children from abuse or neglect.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The State defendants, in the instant case, by contrast, argue that their responsibility under the NSLA is unlike that presented in <em>Horridge, </em>but rather, is analogous to those statutes interpreted in our case law to invoke the public duty doctrine and thereby bar tort claims by an individual plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>Pendleton v. State, </em>398 Md. 447, 921 A.2d 196 (2007), a child was abused by a roommate after he was placed by the State into a duly licensed group home. The victim\u2019s father, as next friend, argued on behalf of his son that the State owed a duty to the child to ensure his safety while in the group home. As support for this assertion, he cited Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl. Vol), \u00a7 5-526(c) of the Family Law Article, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">(c) <em>Compliance with licensing laws </em>\u2014 The Department, or the Department\u2019s designee, may not place a child in a residential group home or other facility that is not operating in compliance with applicable State licensing laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\"><em>Pendleton, </em>398 Md. at 466, 921 A.2d at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">We held that the statute did not create a duty to individual children. Rather, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">Child welfare services pursuant to statute are services to the general public.

Indeed, the NSLA is administered federally by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service, which provides funding and commodities to the states, which in turn disburse the items to participating local school boards. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1756-1757 (2006). The Maryland Department of Education (MSDE) administers the program state-wide, COMAR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>13A.06.01.01(A)(1), by disbursing federal subsidies to participating school districts, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1757(a) (2006), and overseeing the program through audits and inspections to ensure compliance with federal eligibility and nutritional requirements. <em>See </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.18.

The only portion of the NSLA Petitioner presents which, in fact, mentions anything about special dietary needs is 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.10(g)(1) (2006). This regulation is entitled: \u201cNutrition standards and menu planning approaches for lunches and requirements for afterschool snacks,\u201d and subsection (g) answers the question: \u201cWhat exceptions and variations are allowed in meals?\u201d It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">(1) <em>Exceptions for medical or special dietary needs. </em>Schools must make substitutions in lunches and afterschool snacks for students who are considered to have a disability under 7 C.F.R. part 15b and whose disability restricts their diet.

Substitutions must be made on a case by case basis only when supported by a statement of the need for substitutions that includes recommended alternate foods, unless otherwise exempted by FNS. Such statement must, in the case of a student with a disability, be signed by a physician or, in the case of a student who is not disabled, by a recognized medical authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">7 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.10(g)(1) (2006). This language, Petitioner contends, creates a duty for the State to \u201cset policy for schools relating to the individual dietary needs of every student eating lunch at school.\u201d She asserts that \u201cthe purpose of the plain language of the controlling regulations is transparent: the reason special provision is made for students with disabilities is not only to accommodate those disabilities, but to protect children who are disabled and/or have \u201cspecial dietary needs.\u201d On the contrary, this section is insufficient to create a statutory duty to children with special dietary needs for two reasons. First, the plain language makes clear that the entire subsection applies to the local schools, not the states, as these two entities have differing responsibilities under the NSLA and are defined differently under the statute. <em>See </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.2 (2006). Second, it is clear that the language is permissive rather than mandatory, such that schools <em>may </em>provide substitutions for non-disabled children who have special dietary needs, but need not do so. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.10(g)(1) (2006).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In other words, contrary to Petitioner\u2019s argument, substitutions made for non-disabled students under this section are, in fact, only discretionary accommodations. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>agree with the analysis of the intermediate appellate court; Petitioner has not persuaded us that these provisions \u201cimpose a duty upon the State defendants that would make them liable for failing to ensure that no cafeteria worker ever fed peanut butter to a child who is allergic to peanuts.\u201d <em>Pace, </em>195 Md.App. at 45, 5 A.3d at 1128.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Petitioner next points to 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.18(g)(2), and argues that the regulation makes the State \u201cthe sole party ... charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the work of protecting children against incidental, harmful exposure to food stuffs is delivered with requisite care.... \u201d She interprets the oversight provision as \u201cprovid[ing] for administrative review, imposing specific \u2018hands on\u2019 operational monitoring requirements upon the State,\u201d and thereby, establishing a duty owed to food-allergic children, which \u201cliterally jumps off the page.\u201d The relevant language from which Petitioner gleans this interpretation is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">(g) <em>Critical areas of review. </em>The performance standards listed in this paragraph are deemed critical since compliance in these areas is directly linked to the service of a reimbursable lunch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">(2) For each school reviewed, the State agency must:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">(i) For the day of the review, observe the serving line(s) to determine whether all required meal elements (food items/components, menus items or other items, as applicable) as required under \u00a7 210.10 are offered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">7 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.18(g)(2) (2006). Petitioner asserts that this regulation demonstrates that the Maryland State Department of Education must \u201chave direct operational oversight and \u2018food component\u2019 control ... visit schools, [and] actively observ[e] the serving lines in school cafeterias.\u201d Additionally, she argues that \u201c[T]he purpose of the [S]tate\u2019s oversight role under \u00a7 210.18(g)(2) is specific to ensuring that the protection offered to the protected class of students is <em>delivered </em>to that protected class.\u201d (emphasis by Petitioner). By referencing \u201cprotection\u201d to a \u201cprotected class\u201d we assume Petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>means to allege that, pursuant to this regulation, the State defendants must ensure the lunchtime nutritional safety of students with food allergies. As Respondents argue, \u201c[t]he Paces presumably see this [review] as the State\u2019s opportunity to ensure that the local school cafeteria personnel provide substituted foods for children with food allergies.\u201d There is nothing, however, in the plain language of this subsection which would impose a duty on the State to protect children with allergies from the foods that plague them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Further, any such assertion that the State does, in fact, have this duty, is belied by the fact that the regulation requires the State to engage in review only once every five-year period. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.18(c)(1) (2006). This is hardly indicative of a Congressional intent that the State monitor the day-to-day placement of potential allergens on serving lines, develop a flagging regimen for allergic students, or otherwise take responsibility for the food sensitivities of particular children. Rather, it seems clear to us that the section makes provision for audits every five-years in order to ensure a school\u2019s compliance with federal meal service standards under the NSLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">We agree with the intermediate appellate court\u2019s determination that \u201cthe statutes and regulations upon which [Petitioner] base[s] [her] claim of special duty are simply not phrased with the sort of specificity that supports the imposition of liability upon the State.\u201d Pace, 195 Md.App. at 49, 5 A.3d at 1131; <em>c.f. Horridge, </em>382 Md. at 189, 193, 854 A.2d at 1245 (holding that the statute at issue made \u201cabundantly clear as to be beyond cavil\u201d the legislature\u2019s intent to place \u201cspecific and focused\u201d obligations on the State to protect an identified subset of children); <em>see Remsburg, </em>376 Md. at 584, 831 A.2d at 27 (\u201cEvidence of negligence may be established by the breach of a statutory duty when the plaintiff is a member of the class of persons the statute was designed to protect and the injury was of the type the statute was designed to prevent.\u201d (internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>quotation omitted)).

Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s claim cannot be sustained as a matter of law. The NSLA does not impose a statutory duty on the State defendants to identify students with special dietary needs, develop a flagging regimen, or otherwise guard against individual exposure to food allergens.

That section reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\u00a7 1758. Program requirements</p>\n<p id=\"AHa\">(a) Nutritional requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>(1) (A) Lunches served by schools participating in the school lunch program under this chapter [42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1751-1769] shall meet minimum nutritional requirements prescribed by the Secretary on the basis of tested nutritional research, except that the minimum nutritional requirements\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">(i) shall not be construed to prohibit the substitution of foods to accommodate the medical or other special dietary needs of individual students; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-10\">(ii) shall, at a minimum, be based on the weekly average of the nutrient content of school lunches.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">As the intermediate appellate court noted in the present case, although this section references special dietary needs, \u201cit does not mandate that the State take any particular action to ensure that a child such as Liana is never fed any food containing peanuts.\" <em>Pace, </em>195 Md.App. at 43, 5 A.3d at 1127. We agree with that analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b197-6\">. As Respondents point out, recent commentary to 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.10 sheds light on the meaning of the largely unchanged terms by stating that 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.10(g) \u201crequire[s] school food authorities (SFAs) to make food substitutions for children whose disabilities restrict their diet and give[s] school food authorities <em>discretion </em>to make food substitutions for students with medical or other special dietary needs which do not constitute disabilities.\u201d Fluid Milk Substitutions in the School Nutrition Programs, 73 Fed.Reg. 52903 (Sept. 12, 2008) (emphasis added). Ms. Pace concedes that peanut allergies have not been held to constitute a disability, <em>see Land v. Baptist Medical Center, </em>164 F.3d 423 (8th Cir.1999), and thus it is clear that any accommodation a school gives to such students is discretionary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b199-5\">. It is worth noting that, under 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.10(k)(3)(ii) (2006) \"nuts and seeds and their butters\u201d may be served to children as \"meat alternatives\u201d under the Program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b200-6\">. After conducting our own research, our conclusion is the same as that of the intermediate appellate court, as we also \"have been unable to find any reported case anywhere in the country in which a student has sued a state for monetary damages to compensate for a food-related injury that was allegedly caused by a violation of either the NSLA or regulations adopted pursuant to that statute.\u201d <em>Pace, </em>195 Md.App. at 45 &amp; n. 1, 5 A.3d at 1128 &amp; n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
