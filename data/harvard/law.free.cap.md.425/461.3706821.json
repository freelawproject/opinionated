These infinitesimally small particles vibrate like the plucked strings of a subatomic guitar. How they vibrate determines whether they are leptons or quarks, which form atoms, which form elements, and so forth. Reginald Stringfellow\u2019s theory, on the other hand, hypothecates that his objection to a voir dire question proposed by the prosecutor and given by the trial judge during jury selection was like a string, vibrating well beyond the empaneling of the jury. Petitioner, the State, and Respondent, Mr. Stringfellow (Stringfellow), disagree whether Stringfellow\u2019s objection was a lepton or a quark. That is, the State argues that Stringfellow\u2019s unsuccessful objection to the question went to the composition of the jury, which objection he waived (for purposes of appellate review) by accepting, without qualification or reservation, the jury chosen pursuant to the questioning. Stringfellow counters that the nature of his objection was incidental to the composition of the jury and, notwithstanding his acceptance of the jury, his objection is preserved for appellate consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Our case law instructs that an overruled objection to a voir dire question, where the nature of the objection was directed to the composition of the jury, is waived when the objecting party accepts thereafter the jury, without qualification. Here, Stringfellow objected timely to the trial judge asking the venire about their views regarding whether the State must demonstrate that it employed certain scientific investigative techniques and/or scientific evidence before any member of the venire could convict him. Stringfellow argued that the question would prejudice the venire against him and diminish the State\u2019s burden of proof. We conclude that Stringfellow\u2019s objection went to the composition of the jury. Thus, when he accepted (after his objection was overruled and the question propounded) the jury, without qualification, he waived any future opportunity to complain on appeal about the objected-to question and its potential effect. Even assuming that the objection was not waived, the asking of the voir dire question proved harmless error on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The State\u2019s evidence at trial told the following tale. On the evening of 21 November 2009, plainclothes Baltimore City police officers, in an unmarked vehicle, patrolled the 5300 block of Beaufort Avenue in Baltimore City. They observed a person, later identified as Stringfellow, holding a handgun. They drove toward him. When Stringfellow noticed the approaching vehicle, he dropped the handgun and ran off. The officers caught Stringfellow, arrested him, and recovered the handgun. The State charged Stringfellow with two crimes: (1) possessing a regulated firearm after having been convicted of a disqualifying crime, and (2) wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">On the first day of what was to be Stringfellow\u2019s jury trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, the judge considered voir dire questions proposed by the parties. Among the State\u2019s proposals was its question 14, which inquired whether any member of the venire believed that the State must use certain scientific evidence and/or scientific investigative tech<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>\u00f1iques before a potential juror could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Initially, the judge seemed disinclined to ask question 14, prompting the following exchanges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acx\">PROSECUTOR: Then my Question 14.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">COURT: Yeah. You always ask me for that and I always tell you no, then I always give it to you. So I\u2019ll probably do the same thing this time. I\u2019ll give it to you in voir dire. I won\u2019t give it to you in jury instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: I would object to it being asked in voir dire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">COURT: Of course you would. I understand, but it\u2019s a fair question to ask.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">COURT: We\u2019ll take it \u2014 here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. I\u2019ll give the instruction over the objection of the defense and we\u2019ll see where we go with it because it may not become relevant at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">But because the question reads[, \u201cD]oes any member of the panel believe the [Sjtate is required to utilize specific investigative techniques such as [fingerprints\u201d] \u2014 we won\u2019t say DNA because it\u2019s not relevant here .... [\u201c]in order for the defendant to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.[\u201d] If a juror believes that they are required to do that, we know that it is not the law. And if that\u2019s their belief then that is something both sides have a right to know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">The judge propounded ultimately the State\u2019s question 14 as \u201cDoes any member of the panel believe that the State is required to utilize specific investigative or scientific techniques such as fingerprint examination in order for the defendant to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt?\u201d No response was recorded from anyone in the venire.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">Immediately after posing State question 14, the judge continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-11\">If selected as a juror, you\u2019re required to render a fair and impartial verdict based upon the evidence presented in the courtroom and the law as I describe it to you in my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>instructions at the end of this case. Is there any member of the jury panel who feels as if as a matter of your own personal conscience you disagreed with the law, you would disregard the law and instead follow your conscience?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Four venire members responded affirmatively to this query; none of them served on the jury. After completion of voir dire and jury selection, and before the judge\u2019s courtroom clerk swore the jury, the clerk asked the parties if the jury was acceptable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">CLERK: Jury panel acceptable to the State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5W\">PROSECUTOR: Yes. The jury panel is acceptable to the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">CLERK: Acceptable to the defense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The judge observed, \u201cThe panel is acceptable to both sides. That\u2019s fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">As part of his defense, Stringfellow highlighted that the police officers failed to have examined the confiscated handgun for latent fingerprints. In an effort to suggest that it would have been relatively simple for the arresting officers to request a fingerprint analysis of the weapon, Stringfellow offered in evidence (and the judge admitted over the State\u2019s objection) a blank police fingerprint-analysis-request form, which required a box to be checkmarked to request a fingerprint analysis of an item of evidence. In the absence of such an examination (and notwithstanding the eyewitness testimony of the officers who saw Stringfellow holding the handgun on 21 November 2009 on Beaufort Avenue), Stringfellow urged that the State failed to link him conclusively to the handgun. He reiterated the lack-of-fingerprint-evidence argument, over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">The judge gave several final jury instructions at the close of all the evidence. Among them, he said, \u201cI may have commented on evidence or asked a question of a witness. You should not draw any inferences or conclusions from my comments or questions either as to the merits of the case or as to my views regarding the witness.\u201d He stated also that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>State had the burden to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Stringfellow was guilty. \u201cHowever,\u201d the judge cautioned, \u201cif you are not satisfied of the defendant\u2019s guilt to that extent, then reasonable doubt exists and the defendant must be found not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The jury convicted Stringfellow on both counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> String-fellow appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. He argued that the propounding of the State\u2019s voir dire question 14 prejudiced the jurors against him by imputing his guilt, devaluing fingerprint evidence, and lowering the State\u2019s burden of proof. <em>Stringfellow v. State, </em>199 Md.App. 141, 146, 20 A.3d 825, 829 (2011). The State countered that Stringfellow failed to preserve for appellate review the bases of his voir dire objection by accepting, without qualification, the empaneled jury. <em>Stringfellow, </em>199 Md.App. at 146 n. 1, 20 A.3d at 829 n. 1. In rejecting the State\u2019s waiver argument, the panel of the Court of Special Appeals agreed with Stringfellow that the nature of his objection did not require renewal of his objection (or otherwise qualify his acceptance of the jury) contemporaneously with the trial court empaneling the jury. <em>Stringfellow, </em>199 Md.App. at 146 n. 1, 20 A.3d at 829 n. 1. On the merits of Stringfellow\u2019s contentions regarding the error of giving the State\u2019s voir dire question 14, the panel concluded that the question deprived Stringfellow of a fair and impartial jury. The intermediate appellate court concluded also that propounding question 14 was not harmless error because, given its precedent conclusion that the jury was prejudiced, the error influenced improperly the verdict. <em>Stringfellow, </em>199 Md.App. at 154, 20 A.3d at 833. The panel reversed and remanded the case to the Circuit Court for a new trial. <em>Stringfellow, </em>199 Md.App. at 151, 20 A.3d at 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The State filed timely a petition for a writ of certiorari. We granted the State\u2019s petition, <em>State v. Stringfellow, </em>421 Md. 557, 28 A.3d 644 (2011), to consider two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Did Stringfellow waive his prior objection to the voir dire question, asked to the venire, when he accepted the empaneled jury without qualification? [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">If Stringfellow did not waive his prior objection and assuming also that the judge erred in asking the voir dire question, was the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under the circumstances of the case? [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">We conclude that, given the nature and objective of String-fellow\u2019s objection to the voir dire question, he failed to preserve for appellate review the grounds of the objection when he accepted the empaneled jury, without qualification or reservation. Even had Stringfellow preserved his objection, and assuming that propounding the pre-emptive \u201canti-CSI effect\u201d question was error, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, given the record of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ADL\">A. Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Generally, a party waives his or her voir dire objection going to the inclusion or exclusion of a prospective juror (or jurors) or the entire venire if the objecting party accepts unqualifiedly the jury panel (thus seated) as satisfactory at the conclusion of the jury-selection process. <em>Gilchrist v. State, </em>340 Md. 606, 617, 667 A.2d 876, 881 (1995) (citing, among other cases, <em>Mills v. State, </em>310 Md. 33, 40, 527 A.2d 3, 6 (1987)). Conversely, a voir dire objection that is incidental to the inclusion/exclusion of a prospective juror or the venire is not waived by accepting a jury panel at the conclusion of the jury-selection process; rather, such an objection is preserved for review on direct appeal. <em>Gilchrist, </em>340 Md. at 618, 667 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>882 (citing <em>Couser v. State, </em>282 Md. 125, 130, 383 A.2d 389, 392 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Objections related to the inclusion/exclusion of prospective jurors are treated differently for preservation purposes because accepting the empaneled jury, without qualification or reservation, \u201cis directly inconsistent with [the] earlier complaint [about the jury],\u201d which \u201cthe party is clearly waiving or abandoning.\u201d <em>Gilchrist, </em>340 Md. at 618, 667 A.2d at 881-82. Objections related indirectly to the inclusion/exclusion of prospective jurors are not deemed likewise inconsistent and are deemed preserved for appellate review. Although the difference between the two categories of objections may appear slight, it is important in light of the waiver implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">We have concluded that the following types of voir dire objections were aimed directly at the inclusion/exclusion of a prospective juror or the venire and were waived when the objecting party accepted the jury without contemporaneous renewal of his or her complaint: (1) an objection to a judge\u2019s refusal to strike prospective jurors for cause, <em>Mills, </em>310 Md. at 39-40, 527 A.2d at 6; (2) an objection to the exclusion of a juror because of his beliefs about capital punishment, <em>Foster v. State, </em>304 Md. 439, 450-51, 499 A.2d 1236, 1241-42 (1985); (3) a defendant who failed to object to unacceptable venire members after using all of his peremptory strikes, <em>White v. State, </em>300 Md. 719, 729-30, 481 A.2d 201, 205-06 (1984); (4) an objection to a venire not selected randomly from registered-voter lists, <em>Glover v. State, </em>273 Md. 448, 451-52, 330 A.2d 201, 203-04 (1975); and, (5) an objection to prejudicial remarks made by the prosecutor in earshot of the venire, <em>Neusbaum v. State, </em>156 Md. 149, 162-63, 143 A. 872, 878 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">On the other hand, the following objections were deemed incidental to the inclusion/exclusion of prospective jurors and, therefore, not waived by the objecting party\u2019s unqualified acceptance thereafter of the jury panel: (1) an objection to a prior jury panel, where the judge excused that prior jury panel and called a second one from which was selected the jury that convicted the defendant, <em>Gilchrist, </em>340 Md. at 617-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>18, 667 A.2d at 881-82; (2) an objection, made during voir dire, to being refused permission to inspect a prosecutor\u2019s notes on prospective jury members, <em>Couser, </em>282 Md. at 129, 383 A.2d at 391-92; and, (3) an objection to a judge refusing to ask a proposed voir dire question, <em>Marquardt v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 95, 142-43, 882 A.2d 900, 927-28 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Stringfellow\u2019s objection \u2014 that the State\u2019s voir dire question, if asked, would bias the venire members against him and diminish the State\u2019s burden of proof \u2014 tracks most closely in purpose and design the objections in <em>Glover </em>and <em>Neusbaum. </em>Stringfellow\u2019s objection implied necessarily that the venire members would be incapable of sitting on the jury and evaluating the evidence (or lack of certain evidence) fairly and objectively because the pertinent voir dire question \u201cpoisoned\u201d the venire by implying, among other things, that Stringfellow was guilty. In <em>Neusbaum, </em>the prosecutor described, in the presence of the venire, the defendant as a hit-and-run driver. 156 Md. at 153, 143 A. at 874. Neusbaum asked for the venire to be replaced because the remark prejudiced the venire against him. <em>Neusbaum, </em>156 Md. at 153, 143 A. at 874. In <em>Glover, </em>the sheriff collected 25 supplemental venire members from the area surrounding the courthouse because of an insufficient initial jury pool. 273 Md. at 449, 330 A.2d at 202. Glover argued that the additional venire members were unsuitable to sit on the jury because they were not selected randomly from registered-voter lists, in accordance with then Article 51, \u00a7 9(e) of the Maryland Code (1957, 1972 Repl.Vol., 1973 Cum.Supp.). <em>Glover, </em>273 Md. at 451, 330 A.2d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Like the objections in <em>Neusbaum </em>and <em>Glover, </em>Stringfellow\u2019s objection asserted that the venire members, if the relevant question was posed, would be unfit to sit as jurors in his trial; therefore, his objection went to the inclusion of prospective jurors on the jury selected ultimately. Objections of this nature are waived if not preserved appropriately at the time the trial court empanels the jury. Here, Stringfellow accepted, without reservation or qualification, the jury. Consequently, Stringfellow failed to preserve his voir dire objection for future consideration on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Our conclusion disapproves necessarily an aspect of <em>McFadden v. State, </em>197 Md.App. 238, 253, 13 A.3d 68, 76-78 (2011), a case, similar factually to the present one, that the Court of Special Appeals relied upon to reject the State\u2019s waiver argument. The jointly-tried defendants in <em>McFadden </em>complained prefatorily that a proposed voir dire question, ultimately propounded, suggested that they were guilty. 197 Md.App. at 248, 13 A.3d at 74. They noted timely their objection, but later accepted the jury without qualification. <em>McFadden, </em>197 Md.App. at 250, 13 A.3d at 75. The <em>McFadden </em>court concluded that the defendants preserved their voir dire objection nonetheless for two reasons. First, defense counsel, in not renewing their objection at the time they accepted the jury, \u201cwas merely obedient\u201d to the court\u2019s prior overruling of their objection. <em>McFadden, </em>197 Md.App. at 253, 13 A.3d at 77. Obeisance to the trial court\u2019s ruling on the objection, however, should not be the crux of such an analysis. Second, the <em>McFadden </em>court used as authority for its position <em>Fowlkes v. State, </em>117 Md.App. 573, 701 A.2d 862 (1997). <em>Fowlkes </em>concluded that an objection to the judge\u2019s refusal to propound a requested voir dire question was incidental to the composition of the jury. The objection was preserved therefore for appellate review, despite the objecting party\u2019s unqualified acceptance of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\"><em>Fowlkes, </em>however, is inapposite. The propounded, purportedly prejudicial, voir dire question in <em>McFadden </em>(like the subject voir dire question in the present case) is not analogous to the unpropounded voir dire question in <em>Fowlkes. </em>The purpose of voir dire, which means literally \u201cto say the truth,\u201d is to \u201censure a fair and impartial jury\u201d and to filter out prejudiced venire persons. <em>Charles &amp; Drake v. State, </em>414 Md. 726, 733, 997 A.2d 154, 158 (2010) (citations omitted). A prejudicial voir dire question, when propounded, may inject the very prejudice that voir dire attempts to filter out. <em>Charles &amp; Drake, </em>414 Md. at 739, 997 A.2d at 162. Therefore, an objection to a propounded, purportedly prejudicial, voir dire question relates directly to the composition of the jury. An unpropounded voir dire question, like a defused bomb, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>cannot likewise prejudice the venire. Thus, the two types of objections are distinct, and <em>Fowlkes </em>does not support the conclusion in <em>McFadden </em>that both types are preserved for appellate consideration without renewed objection when the jury is empaneled.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Stringfellow argues also that the trial court must offer to call a new venire, and have the offer rejected, before the objecting party will be deemed to have waived a previous objection that relates directly to the composition of the jury. In <em>Neusbaum, </em>the judge offered to call a new venire after the defendant objected to the present venire, complaining that the present venire was prejudiced. Neusbaum declined the offer and, on appeal, we deemed his objection waived. We disagree with Stringfellow\u2019s interpretation of <em>Neusbaum. </em>Here, the courtroom clerk asked Stringfellow, in the routine manner, \u201cIs the jury acceptable to the defense?,\u201d but did not offer to call a new venire. The courtroom clerk\u2019s query to Stringfellow whether the jury was acceptable was a sufficient invitation or incentive for Stringfellow to renew his objection to the seated jury or to qualify his acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Finally, Stringfellow imagines that requiring an aggrieved party to reiterate an objection to the potential 12-member jury (and any alternates), after jury selection, \u201csubverts the orderly jury selection process.\u201d By comparison, the Courts and Judicial Proceeding Article and the Maryland Rules permit a party to challenge an improper juror or jury array until the trial court receives evidence. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 8-409(b)(l) (LexisNexis 2006); Md. Rule 4-312(a)(3), (d)(2). Moreover, a party can object to racially-based juror challenges until trial commences. <em>United States v. Clark, </em>409 F.3d 1039, 1043 (8th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Parham, </em>16 F.3d 844, 847 (8th Cir.1994)). Stringfellow has not persuaded us that our conclusion in this case subverts the orderly jury-selection process.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">B. Harmless Error</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that String-fellow had not waived his objection to the voir dire question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>and that it was error for the trial judged to pose the pertinent question <em>(See Stabb v. State, </em>423 Md. 454, 31 A.3d 922 (2011) and <em>Atkins v. State, </em>421 Md. 434, 26 A.3d 979 (2011)),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the result here would be the same because we are persuaded that there is no reasonable possibility that the erroneously propounded voir dire question contributed to the guilty verdict, i.e., asking the question was harmless error on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Stringfellow claims that there were two impermissible effects flowing from the offending voir dire question: 1) that the jurors\u2019 \u201conly option was to find Mr. Stringfellow guilty,\u201d and 2) that excusing the absence of scientific investigative techniques and/or scientific evidence, e.g., the failure to test the handgun for latent fingerprints, diminished the State\u2019s burden to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In a harmless error analysis in a criminal case, the State, as the prevailing party, must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not \u201c \u2018contribute! ] to the rendition of the guilty verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lee v. State, </em>405 Md. 148, 164, 950 A.2d 125, 134 (2008) (citing <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976)). This means that a reviewing court, upon an independent review of the record, \u201c \u2018must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility\u2019 \u201d that the assumed error caused impermissibly the guilty verdict. <em>Lee, </em>405 Md. at 164, 950 A.2d at 134 (quoting <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Assuming error in the present case, the error was not reiterated during jury instructions or other comments from the bench while the jury was present. While the error occurred during an important part of the trial process, the judge\u2019s management of closing argument ameliorated significantly any prejudice to Stringfellow. The judge permitted Stringfellow\u2019s attorney to make a closing argument, over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>State\u2019s objection, about how the police officers\u2019 failure to request testing of the confiscated handgun for latent fingerprints created reasonable doubt. The judge overruled the prosecutor\u2019s objection immediately and in front the jury. Empowered by the judge\u2019s overruling of the State\u2019s objection, Stringfellow argued to the jury that the officers had the ability to test the handgun, but failed to do so. The failure to request a fingerprint analysis became, in defense counsel\u2019s words, \u201ca big issue because I submit to you if they had dusted, if they had tried to lift fingerprints, they would not have found Mr. Stringfellow\u2019s prints on that gun.... I think that\u2019s very, very important.\u201d Stringfellow\u2019s attorney concluded by imploring the jury to find Stringfellow \u201cnot guilty because there is doubt in this case.... \u201d Thus, the judge\u2019s management of closing argument defused any prejudicial impact of the erroneously propounded voir dire question.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Although of less weight in persuading us that the error was harmless, we observe that two jury instructions in particular contributed to alleviating the sting of the error. We assume that jurors follow a judge\u2019s instructions. <em>Alston v. State, </em>414 Md. 92, 108, 994 A.2d 896, 905 (2010) (quoting <em>State v. Moulden, </em>292 Md. 666, 678, 441 A.2d 699, 705 (1982)); <em>see also Donaldson v. State, </em>416 Md. 467, 499, 7 A.3d 84, 103 (2010) (quoting <em>Spain v. State, </em>386 Md. 145, 160, 872 A.2d 25, 34 (2005)). We minimize in our analysis, however, the effect of general jury instructions because of our belief that they tend to have relatively attenuated curative effect. <em>Donaldson, </em>416 Md. at 499, 7 A.3d at 103 (quoting <em>Lawson v. State, </em>389 Md. 570, 601-02, 886 A.2d 876, 894-95 (2005)). Further, even curative instructions, when not given contemporaneously with the commission of the error, are of diminished curative value potentially. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The judge propounded, contemporaneous with the erroneous voir dire question (whether merely fortuitously or as an intended \u201ccure\u201d), a conjoined instruction \u2014 question, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>If selected as a juror, you\u2019re required to render a fair and impartial verdict based upon the evidence presented in the courtroom and the law as I describe it to you in my instructions at the end of this case. Is there any member of the jury panel who feels as if as a matter of your own personal conscience you disagreed with the law, you would disregard the law and instead follow your conscience?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">As a consequence of the affirmative response, the judge screened four venire members from serving as jurors. Additionally, toward the end of trial, the judge admonished the jury during his final instructions, \u201cI may have commented on evidence or asked a question of a witness. You should not draw any inferences or conclusions from my comments or questions either as to the merits of the case or as to my views regarding the witness.\u201d He instructed the jury also that the State had the constant burden to prove that Stringfellow was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and that \u201cif you are not satisfied of the defendant\u2019s guilt to that extent, then reasonable doubt exists and the defendant must be found not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Atj\">These instructions were correct statements of law. The judge gave the follow-on instruction/voir dire question immediately after the erroneous voir dire question. Although the final jury instructions were not given contemporaneously with the commission of the error, the judge gave them <em>after </em>he propounded the voir dire question. This is meaningful because in <em>Donaldson </em>we discredited general jury instructions that came <em>before </em>the error occurred. 416 Md. at 499-500, 7 A.3d at 102-103. Therefore, the jury instructions here, although a limited kind of cure, assisted in dislodging any residual bits of potential prejudice concerning the weight of presented (or unpresented) evidence and reminded the jury of the State\u2019s fixed burden of proof. <em>See Spain, </em>386 Md. at 159-60, 872 A.2d at 33-34 (noting the likely diminution of prejudice resulting from pertinent jury instructions combined with other error-reducing factors); <em>see also United States v. Brown, </em>441 F.3d 1330, 1354-55 (11th Cir.2006) (stating that, on plain error review, any potential misconception stemming from an ambiguous voir dire question was corrected with explicit, legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>correct jury instructions); <em>United States v. Noone, </em>913 F.2d 20, 33-34 (1st Cir.1990) (concluding that a voir dire question that discredited prosecution\u2019s witnesses was corrected with final jury instructions). The most significant factor, however, that convinces us that the error did not contribute to the guilty verdicts in Stringfellow\u2019s case was the judge\u2019s allowance of Stringfellow\u2019s relevant closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY.

I write on this topic because our jurisprudence regarding waiver has wide-ranging consequences, and we must be cautious in its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Our precedents do not support finding that Stringfellow, after clearly stating his objection to the \u201cCSI\u201d question and obtaining the court\u2019s ruling, proceeded to waive that objection simply by answering affirmatively when the court asked, at the conclusion of jury selection, whether the defense was satisfied with the jury. I see the Majority\u2019s decision as extending <em>Neusbaum </em>beyond its intended scope, in a manner that fails to serve any valid policy goal. The question and answer at issue here were just a final opportunity, routinely provided by circuit courts, for the parties to raise new objections to the jury and obtain the court\u2019s ruling. This procedure is not intended to lengthen the trial by having counsel repeat objections already stated or trap the unwary litigant who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>believes his objection has received its Ml and final consideration by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">As the Majority acknowledges, only objections \u201cdirected to the composition of the jury\u201d are waived by later accepting the jury as empaneled. Maj. Op. at 465, 469-70, 42 A.3d at 29, 32. This is because, as we explained in <em>Gilchrist v. State,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">When a party complains about the exclusion of someone from or the inclusion of someone in a particular jury, and thereafter states without qualification that the same jury as ultimately chosen is satisfactory or acceptable, the party is clearly waiving or abandoning the earlier complaint about that jury. The party\u2019s final position is directly inconsistent with his or her earlier complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">Nevertheless, where the objection was not directly aimed at the composition of the jury ultimately selected, we have taken the position that the objecting party\u2019s approval of the jury as ultimately selected did not explicitly or implicitly waive his previously asserted objection, and his objection was preserved for appellate review. (Citations and quotation marks omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\"><em>Gilchrist v. State, </em>340 Md. 606, 618, 667 A.2d 876, 881-82 (1995) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The Majority places Stringfellow\u2019s objection in this narrow category, opining that his objection to the trial court\u2019s question went to the jury\u2019s \u201ccomposition.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">Like the objections in <em>Neusbaum </em>and <em>Glover, </em>String-fellow\u2019s objection asserted that the venire members, if the relevant question was posed, would be unfit to sit as jurors in his trial; therefore, his objection went to the inclusion of prospective jurors on the jury selected ultimately.... A prejudicial voir dire question, when propounded, may inject the very prejudice that voir dire attempts to filter out. Therefore, an objection to [a] propounded, purportedly prejudicial, voir dire question relates directly to the composition of the jury. (Citations and quotation marks omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">Maj. Op. at 471, 472, 42 A.3d at 33, 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">This logic is strained to the point of being false, because it misconstrues what actually occurred in the courtroom. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Stringfellow objected to the question posed by the trial court, saying: \u201cI would object to it being asked in voir dire.\u201d Maj. Op. at 466, 42 A.3d at 30. This was not an objection to any specific \u201cvenire members ... unfit to sit as jurors\u201d for having heard the question. Rather, the objection was to <em>anyone </em>chosen to sit as a juror who had heard the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">For an objection to relate to the \u201ccomposition\u201d of a collection of things, whether jurors or marbles, it must refer to which component parts are included or how they are chosen. <em>See The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Lam guage </em>(4th ed.2006) (defining \u201ccomposition\u201d as \u201c[t]he combining of distinct parts or elements to form a whole ... [t]he manner in which such parts are combined or related ... [gjeneral makeup ... a mixture or compound ... [ajrrangement of artistic parts so as to form a unified whole\u201d). On the other hand, an objection to something that taints an entire collection, without changing its component parts, has nothing to do with its \u201ccomposition.\u201d Like paint splattered on a collection of marbles, a prejudicial question heard by the entire venire simply does not affect the jury\u2019s \u201ccomposition.\u201d In the case of a jury, \u201ccomposition\u201d refers to which jurors are included and how they are chosen, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthe exclusion of someone from or the inclusion of someone in a. particular jury[.]\u201d <em>Gilchrist, </em>340 Md. at 618, 667 A.2d at 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><em>Gilchri,st\u2019s </em>rule limiting waiver to objections \u201cdirectly aimed at the composition of the jury\u201d makes sense, because only such objections can fairly be said to be inconsistent with accepting the jury. <em>Gilchrist v. State, </em>340 Md. at 618, 667 A.2d at 881-82. When the objection does not relate to the composition of the jury, accepting the jury is \u201cnot inconsistent\u201d with the prior objection, and does not constitute waiver. <em>Id.; see also Couser v. State, </em>282 Md. 125, 129-30, 383 A.2d 389, 391-92 (1978) (holding that defense counsel\u2019s objection to the court\u2019s refusal to allow her to inspect the prosecutor\u2019s notes on prospective jury members was not directly aimed at the jury\u2019s composition, and therefore was not waived by accepting the jury); <em>McFadden v. State, </em>197 Md.App. 238, 252, 13 A.3d 68, 76 (2011) (\u201cThe State\u2019s reliance on <em>Gilchrist </em>... is misplaced, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>appellants\u2019 claim of error does not lie upon the inclusion or exclusion of a prospective juror.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">As in <em>Gilchrist, Couser, </em>and <em>McFadden, </em>Stringfellow\u2019s objection, which was to the trial court\u2019s proposed course of action, was not inconsistent with his later acceptance of the jury. Simply reviewing the cases cited by the Majority in which waiver was found reveals that Stringfellow\u2019s situation is meaningfully different. The cases in which waiver was found involved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">(1) an objection to a judge\u2019s refusal to strike prospective jurors for cause, <em>Mills, </em>310 Md. at 39-40, 527 A.2d at 6; (2) an objection to the exclusion of a juror because of his beliefs about capital punishment, <em>Foster v. State, </em>304 Md. 439, 450-51, 499 A.2d 1236, 1241-42 (1985); (3) a defendant who failed to object to unacceptable venire members after using all of his peremptory strikes, <em>White v. State, </em>300 Md. 719, 729-30, 481 A.2d 201, 205-06 (1984); (4) an objection to a venire not selected randomly from registered-voter lists, <em>Glover v. State, </em>273 Md. 448, 451-52, 330 A.2d 201, 203-04 (1975); and, (5) an objection to prejudicial remarks made by the prosecutor in earshot of the venire, <em>Neusbaum v. State, </em>156 Md. 149, 162-63, 143 A. 872, 878 (1928).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Maj. Op. at 470, 42 A.3d at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The first three cases clearly involved objections related to the composition of the jury, <em>i.e., </em>which jurors should be included and how they should be chosen. This is entirely different from Stringfellow\u2019s objection to the trial court\u2019s announced intention to ask the venire about the \u201cCSI effect.\u201d In the fourth case, the defendant objected to the inclusion of certain persons who were gathered in the streets by the sheriff to make up for the insufficient number of jurors in the venire. Again, this objection clearly went to the composition of the jury, unlike Stringfellow\u2019s objection to the trial court\u2019s proposed question. The last case, <em>Neusbaum, </em>found waiver for a different reason. The defendant did not waive his objection by accepting the jury, but rather waived by declining the trial court\u2019s offer to have a new panel of jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>[W]hen he had an opportunity of having an entirely new panel, but refused it and elected to take the panel the members of which had heard the remark, he cannot now be heard to say that they were prejudiced or unfair, and, while there was error in the ruling involved in the exception, defendant by accepting the panel when he could have had a new one admitted that it occasioned no injury, and it is not reversible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><em>Neusbaum v. State, </em>156 Md. 149, 163, 143 A. 872, 878 (1928), <em>superseded, by statute on other grounds, </em>Maryland Code (1957, 1987 RepLVol., 1991 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 388, <em>as recognized in Forbes v. State, </em>324 Md. 335, 339, 597 A.2d 427, 429 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Mr. Neusbaum\u2019s waiver took the form of refusing the offer of a new panel, not simply stating that he accepted the panel. <em>Id.; see also White v. State, </em>300 Md. 719, 758, 481 A.2d 201, 220 (1984) (Cole, J., dissenting) (\u201cNor is this case like <em>Neusbaum </em>... where the trial court ... offered counsel the opportunity to start over with an entirely new panel\u201d). Unlike Neusbaum, Stringfellow was not offered a new venire untainted by the objectionable \u201cCSI\u201d question.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Limiting the <em>Neusbaum </em>rationale to cases in which a new panel is offered makes sense because, unlike the other cases cited by the Majority, Neusbaum\u2019s objection was not to the jury\u2019s composition. Therefore, simply accepting the jury, as we explained in <em>Gilchrist, </em>would not have been inconsistent. Refusing an entirely new jury, however, was inconsistent with Neusbaum\u2019s objection, because empaneling a new jury would have removed any prejudice caused by hearing the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks. <em>See Neusbaum, </em>156 Md. at 163, 143 A. at 878 (\u201c[Dlefendant by accepting the panel when he could have had a new one admitted that [the remarks] occasioned no injury[.]\u201d). Thus, without the offer of a new panel, Neusbaum\u2019s acceptance could not fairly be said to be inconsistent with his prior objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">In all of the cases where a prior objection was waived by accepting the jury, the acceptance was directly inconsistent with the prior objection. In some cases, this was because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>objection was to the composition of the jury, and accepting the jury as composed was inconsistent. In other cases, like <em>Neusbaum, </em>it was because the objection related to a taint on the whole jury, and refusing the offer of a new panel was inconsistent. None of these cases presented the issue here, where Stringfellow\u2019s objection was to a \u201cCSI\u201d question that, he claimed, tainted the entire venire, and no new jury panel was offered. I would not find waiver because the trial court did not offer to empanel a new jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Finding the issue preserved, I conclude that it was error for the Circuit Court to ask the voir dire question. <em>See Stabb v. State, </em>423 Md. 454, 456-57, 31 A.3d 922, 923 (2011) (holding that a \u201cCSI\u201d instruction was error); <em>Atkins v. State, </em>421 Md. 434, 437-38, 26 A.3d 979, 980 (2011) (same). Although these cases involved jury instructions, rather than voir dire questions, we should not treat as legitimate a message sent to the jury during voir dire, when we have held that same message is prejudicial when given during jury instructions. Ultimately, however, I agree with the Majority that the error was harmless, for the reasons stated in its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Judge BATTAGLIA has authorized me to state that she joins in this concurring opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
