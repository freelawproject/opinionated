The saga began in 1991 when the predecessor in title to the subject property to the Petitioner, HNS Development, LLC (\u201cHNS\u201d), and the County government failed to resolve conclusively whether certain development restrictions would be placed on parcels including and adjacent to the historic Langenfelder Mansion in Kingsville, Maryland. The \u201crestrictions\u201d under consideration implicated preservation of the Mansion\u2019s historic character and the scenic view of it from Bel Air Road. During the review process of the development plan for what became the Longfield Estates subdivision, the County, in light of textual recommendations expressed in the extant Master Plan regarding protection of scenic views, required easements for certain parcels in the subdivision to protect the view of the Mansion, but stopped short of establishing the same provisions with regard to two proposed parcels containing and immediately adjacent to the Mansion. Instead of easements or other forms of clear restrictions on development of these two parcels, the County Office of Planning requested that a note be placed on the development plan indicating that the Office of Planning would not support further development on the two parcels because to do so would be in conflict with the Master Plan. Thus, the plat note deferred indefinitely the resolution of what, if any, development might be allowed on the portion of the subdivision surrounding and including the Mansion. The original developer did not contest ultimately imposition of the requested plat note. Time has not cleared the muddied waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">HNS purchased in 2004 the subject two parcels, comprising a total of 13 acres, surrounding the Mansion after develop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>ment of the remainder of Longfield Estates. HNS acquired the parcels with knowledge of the cautionary note on the 1991 development plan. After having its proposed amended development plan (which sought to subdivide the lot containing the Mansion into two parcels and to place a dwelling on one of those lots and another dwelling on the parcel adjacent to the Mansion) rejected by three county agencies, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, and the Court of Special Appeals, HNS asks this Court to conclude that its amended development plan meets the applicable development regulations of the Baltimore County Code and ignore the conceded Master Plan conflict, the latter continuing through the current Master Plan. Respondents, People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County (\u201cPeople\u2019s Counsel\u201d) and the Greater Kingsville Community Association (\u201cGKCA\u201d), argue that the Master Plan conflict provides a stand-alone basis for the County to reject the proposed amended development plan. We agree with Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">I. FACTS AND ANTECEDENT ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Ann Langenfelder owned a 194-acre farm, containing a historic mansion, in Kingsville, Maryland. She sold the majority of the farm to the Longfield Estates Development Corporation (\u201cLEDC\u201d), but retained 13 acres comprised of two parcels, one containing the Mansion (Lot 42) and one adjacent to the Mansion (Parcel A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1990, the Baltimore County Review Group (\u201cCRG\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> approved Phase I of the Longfield Estates development. Phase II of the development was delayed and, when submitted for consideration, referred to the County Planning Board because of a perceived conflict between the development proposal and the extant version (1989-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>2000) of the County Master Plan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The conflict centered on the scenic objectives of the Master Plan\u2019s recommendations to protect the historic Langenfelder Mansion, also known as Rockwood.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">After reviewing the potential Master Plan conflict, the Planning Board recommended that the CRG approve Phase II of the development, but under conditions that altered the location and configuration of some lots and restricted house siting and landscaping on nine lots as a means to maintain the scenic view from Bel Air Road to the Langenfelder Mansion. The nine lots targeted by the Planning Board were empressed with restrictive covenants to ensure that the historic viewshed was maintained. Despite the Planning Board\u2019s conclusion that the nine lots (as proposed by the developer) were in conflict with the Master Plan, it recommended that the County not acquire the properties, which, had the recommendation been to place the land in reservation, may have foreclosed any development on the nine lots and set up a significant showdown with LEDC. Lot 42 and Parcel A were retained by Ann Langenfelder, while the remaining 181 acres (owned by LEDC) were subdivided for single-family residential lots with the restrictive covenants. No definitive restrictive covenants were placed on Lot 42 or Parcel A; however, the following Note 18 was placed on the approved Phase II final development plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">The Baltimore County Office of Planning &amp; Zoning would not support future development on Lot 42 or Parcel \u201cA\u201d. Any future subdivision of Lot 42 and/or Parcel \u201cA\u201d would be considered a conflict with the Master Plan as detailed by the Planning Board\u2019s decision. Lot 42 as shown on the revised CRG Plan is designed in accordance with the Planning Board\u2019s action of January 17, 1991. Furthermore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Office of Planning and Zoning supports and strongly encourages the applicant to seek a conservation easement to restrict future development on Lot 42 and Parcel \u201cA\u201d to permanently protect the integrity of the scenic view.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Phase II of the development plan was approved by the CRG, as recommended by the Planning Board, in 1991 and the development was built-out over the ensuing years.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In 2004, Ann Langenfelder died. Her estate sold Lot 42 and Parcel A to HNS, owned by Mark Storck. Storck was aware of the 1991 Phase II final development plan\u2019s Note 18. Later in 2004, HNS applied for a building permit to erect a dwelling on Parcel A. The Planning Board rejected the building permit as a \u201cclear violation of the approved plan,\u201d relying on Note 18 as support for this position. In 2005, HNS submitted an amended development plan to the CRG, proposing to subdivide Lot 42 into two lots, one for the Mansion and one for a new dwelling, as well as a dwelling on Parcel A. The amended plan was accepted for filing by the CRG on 17 February 2005. Pursuant to B.C.C. \u00a7 22-5603) (1987, 1988-89 Supp.),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the County Department of Public Works (\u201cDPW\u201d) had 30 days after the proposed amended plan was accepted to schedule a meeting of the CRG to consider the proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Prior to the CRG meeting on the proposed amended plan, the Planning Board submitted comments that reiterated its view that Note 18 prohibited development on Lot 42 and Parcel A because, if the parcels were developed or resubdivided, a conflict would arise with the Master Plan, as determined by the Planning Board in 1991. The CRG meeting was not convened until 1 April 2005. At the meeting, HNS argued that the statutory deadline in B.C.C. \u00a7 22-56(b) for holding the CRG meeting (within 30 days of the filing of the amended plan) had passed and, therefore, B.C.C. \u00a7 22-47 provided that the amended development plan should be \u201cdeemed approved\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>by the CRG.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The CRG rejected this argument and denied HNS\u2019s amended development plan, in light of the Planning Board\u2019s comments. Notwithstanding this seeming \u201cvictory,\u201d People\u2019s Counsel and GKCA, both of which opposed approval of the amended plan, filed \u201cprotective\u201d administrative appeals with the County Board of Appeals, presumedly because of HNS\u2019s contention regarding the \u201cdeemed approval\u201d for failure to conduct timely the CRG hearing. A short time later, HNS appealed to the Board of Appeals the CRG\u2019s denial of the amended development plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The Board of Appeals held six days of public hearings between 19 October 2005 and 22 August 2006, culminating with a public deliberation on 9 November 2006. On 6 April 2007, the Board of Appeals issued a written opinion remanding the matter to the Planning Board for further review in determining the meaning and effect of Note 18 in relation to the amended development plan and whether a Master Plan conflict continued. The Board of Appeals retained jurisdiction over the case in order to make a decision on the merits after the Planning Board reached its decision on remand. The Board of Appeals explained that, although its review was de novo (according to Baltimore County Charter \u00a7 603), because the CRG failed to request that the Planning Board make a further determination whether a conflict existed between the proposed amended development plan and Master Plan, \u201ca crucial piece of evidence\u201d was missing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Board of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>believed apparently (despite the Planning Board\u2019s submission of comments prior to the 1 April 2005 CRG meeting) that it could not decide properly the appeal without a formal referral to and response from the Planning Board to determine whether a conflict existed currently.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The Board of Appeals\u2019s opinion addressed also the question of which of the appealing parties bore the burden of showing that the CRG\u2019s action was arbitrary and capricious, procured by fraud, or otherwise illegal. B.C.C. \u00a7 22-61(c). People\u2019s Counsel argued that HNS waived its argument under B.C.C. \u00a7 22-47 that the amended plan was \u201cdeemed approved\u201d because HNS had not raised the claim on or before expiration of the statutory deadline for the CRG hearing to be held. The Board of Appeals rejected this argument, concluding that B.C.C. \u00a7 22-56 provided clear time frames and it was not the developer\u2019s responsibility to compel the CRG to act timely. Based on this conclusion, the Board of Appeals determined that the People\u2019s Counsel and GKCA bore the burden of proof on this issue on appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> People\u2019s Counsel and GKCA filed motions for reconsideration, arguing that the Board of Appeals erred procedurally by ordering a remand of the matter directly to the Planning Board (rather than to the CRG) and by retaining jurisdiction during the remand. All of the parties argued that the proper procedure for the Board of Appeals was to have remanded directly the matter to the CRG with instructions to refer the question of the Master Plan conflict to the Planning Board. The Board of Appeals disagreed and the revisory motions were denied.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">On remand, the Director of the Planning Board, Arnold \u201cPat\u201d Keller, prepared a report for the Board of Appeals, concluding that the proposed amended development plan conflicted with the 1989-2000 and 2010 Master Plans. The Plan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>ning Board adopted Director Keller\u2019s report and concluded that no further subdivision or development were allowed on Lot 42 or Parcel A. Pursuant to B.C.C. \u00a7 22-18(b), the Planning Board forwarded its decision to the County Council on 28 April 2008, but did not recommend that the Council take any action to reserve or acquire the property. The County Council took no action, either to disagree with the determination of a Master Plan conflict or to reserve the property.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Receiving no response from the County Council, the Planning Board sent its findings to the Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">HNS requested a hearing before the Board of Appeals, which was held on 17 December 2008 and 5 February 2009. On 1 July 2009, the Board of Appeals issued an order and opinion affirming the Planning Board\u2019s decision that the amended development plan conflicted with the Master Plan and should not be approved.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The opinion observed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>County Council \u201ctook no action to over-ride the conclusion of the Planning Board\u201d that the amended development plan constituted a conflict with the Master Plan. The Board of Appeals noted further that its review was de novo and, \u201c[a]s such, prior actions and determinations alleged to have occurred by operation of law no longer stand.\u201d The opinion continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">Nevertheless, having received the matter <em>de novo, </em>our referral for the Planning Board determination as to Master Plan conflict was essential to a final decision. The resultant finding of the actual existence of such a conflict can not, under the CRG Rules, be ignored. Therefore, once the Planning Board has now determined that such a conflict with the 2010 Master Plan does in fact exist, and no action having been taken to the contrary by the County Council, it is clear that the requested amendment to the original CRG Plan in this matter can not be allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">On 30 July 2009, HNS filed timely a petition for judicial review. A hearing was held on 13 April 2010 in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The Circuit Court issued its opinion shortly thereafter affirming the Board of Appeals\u2019s decision. On 28 May 2010, HNS appealed timely to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The Court of Special Appeals, in <em>HNS Development, LLC v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>200 Md.App. 1, 24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>A.3d 167 (2011), affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. The intermediate appellate court concluded that, although the CRG failed to act timely, the \u201cdeemed approved\u201d provision of B. C.C. \u00a7 22-47 did not immunize the amended plan in this case from further governmental review because: 1) HNS waived this argument by failing to raise it before the Board of Appeals, 2) B.C.C. \u00a7 22-47 did not contain any language purporting to immunize \u201cdeemed approved\u201d plans at the CRG stage from review on appeal to the Board of Appeals, and 3) the legislative history of B.C.C. \u00a7 22-47 did not suggest that \u201ca matter deemed approved is foreclosed\u201d from further review. <em>HNS, </em>200 Md.App. at 17, 24 A.3d at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded also that the Baltimore County Master Plan \u201cis binding as to development and subdivision plans in Baltimore County\u201d because provisions of the Baltimore County Code direct that \u201cdevelopment of land must conform to the master plan.\u201d <em>HNS, </em>200 Md.App. at 35, 24 A.3d at 188. Considering the gauntlet that a proposed development plan must run, as set out in B.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 22-54 (pre-development conference), 22-56 (DPW review of plan), 22-57 and 22-58 (allowing the CRG to determine if a Master Plan conflict existed), 22-59 (allowing the CRG to refer the question of a possible conflict with the Master Plan to the Planning Board), 22-60 (requiring the Planning Board to make a determination of Master Plan compliance and forward its decision to the County Council for review), 22-61 (making the Planning Board\u2019s determination final if the County Council fails to overrule the Planning Board\u2019s recommendation), and 22-61 (providing for an appeal to the Board of Appeals), the intermediate appellate court rejected HNS\u2019s argument that B.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 22-37 and 22-38, when read together, create \u201cdeemed compliance\u201d with the Master Plan when the other development regulations in the County Code are met. <em>HNS, </em>200 Md.App. at 38, 24 A.3d at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">As to whether HNS\u2019s argument that the County Council\u2019s failure to place in reservation or acquire the subject property after the Planning Board notified it of the Master Plan conflict constituted a taking (without just compensation) of Parcel A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>and Lot 42, the intermediate appellate court concluded that HNS failed to preserve the issue for appeal because it was not \u201craised previously in the CRG process, before the Board on appeal in 2005, through 2006, or before the Planning Board on remand and, as such, was not a part of [the] Planning Board\u2019s April 17, 2008 Report to the Board.\u201d <em>HNS, </em>200 Md.App. at 42-43, 24 A.3d at 192. Even if the issue was not waived, the appellate court concluded that the County\u2019s process for the reservation and public acquisition of land to preclude development did not apply to amendments to previously approved development plans. <em>HNS, </em>200 Md.App. at 42, 24 A.3d at 192-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">HNS filed timely a petition for a writ of certiorari, which we granted, <em>HNS Development, LLC v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>423 Md. 450, 31 A.3d 919 (2011), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">1) Did the county board of appeals impermissibly create a new requirement of Master Plan compliance in addition to that contained in the stated development regulations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">2) Did the county board of appeals impermissibly create upon a finding of Master Plan conflict a means of taking without just compensation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">3) Is the statement on a development plan that a county agency would oppose further development of a parcel and lot the same as an exaction or condition of development as discussed in <em>City of Annapolis v. Waterman, </em>357 Md. 484, 745 A.2d 1000 (2000)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">We hold that, according to the Baltimore County Code, the Master Plan is an inextricable part of the development regulations and, as such, compliance with its recommendations is a binding regulatory requirement of the subdivision and development plan review process in the County. Thus, nonconformity with the Master Plan can provide a valid and an independent basis for denying approval of a proposed amended development plan, compliance with the other requirements of the development regulations notwithstanding. Petitioner\u2019s takings question is waived due to HNS\u2019s failure, under Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>land Rule 8-504(a)(5) and (6), to provide in its brief any argument regarding the appropriate standard of review to apply or any authorities in support of its position. We conclude also that, on the record of this case, there is no justiciable controversy whether Note 18 on the 1991 development plan approval was an impermissible exaction. Moreover, this issue is moot, in light of our conclusion that nonconformity with the Master Plan can serve as an independent reason for rejecting an amended development plan. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">We review directly the action of local government administrative body, notwithstanding the same review by any intervening courts. <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. Cnty. v. Loyola Coll. in Md., </em>406 Md. 54, 66, 956 A.2d 166, 173 (2008). Where findings of fact or discretionary judgments are involved, the scope of our review is <em>narrow </em>\u2014 we do not \u201csubstitute [our] judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Loyola Coll., </em>406 Md. at 66-67, 956 A.2d at 173 (quoting <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. Cnty., </em>336 Md. 569, 576-77, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994)). We will uphold such decisions of the administrative agency so long as they are supported reasonably by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. Cnty. v. Surina, </em>400 Md. 662, 681, 929 A.2d 899, 910 (2007) (quoting, among others, <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Annapolis v. Annapolis Waterfront Co., </em>284 Md. 383, 398, 396 A.2d 1080, 1089 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">When an agency resolves a question of law, however, our review is less deferential. We will not uphold an \u201cadministrative decision which is premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. Cnty. v. Md. Marine Mfg. Co., </em>316 Md. 491, 497, 560 A.2d 32, 34-35 (1989). A \u201cdegree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency\u201d charged with interpreting and enforcing a particular set of statutes or regulations. <em>Surina, </em>400 Md. at 682, 929 A.2d at 911 (quoting <em>Marzullo v. Kahl, </em>366 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Md. 158, 172, 783 A.2d 169, 177 (2001)). Our task is to \u201cascertain and effectuate\u201d the intent of the legislative body and to avoid \u201cconstruction of a statute which is unreasonable, illogical, unjust, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Rockville v. Rylyns Enters., Inc., </em>372 Md. 514, 550, 814 A.2d 469, 490 (2002). To accomplish this task, \u201cwe begin our inquiry with the words of the statute and, ordinarily, when the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, according to their commonly understood meaning, we end our inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We keep in mind that particular provisions of a statute are interpreted in the context of the entire statutory scheme, and \u201cread together and harmonized to the extent possible, reading them so as to avoid rendering either of them, or any portion, meaningless, surplusage, superfluous or nugatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. v. Fitzpatrick, </em>366 Md. 295, 302-03, 783 A.2d 667, 671 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">A. The Master Plan Conflict</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">HNS maintains that the Board of Appeals erred in denying the proposed amended development plan on the basis of the Planning Board\u2019s finding that approval of the plan would conflict with the Master Plan. B.C.C. \u00a7 22-38 states that \u201c[cjompliance with the development regulations hereinafter set forth shall be deemed the fulfillment of the development policies set forth in section 22-37 and purposes set forth in section 22-38.\u201d Therefore, HNS reasons that because the amended development plan met the physical, special, and other development regulations, this achievement alone equated to conformance with all of the development regulations, including the Master Plan. HNS reasons further that the CRG approval process does not require proof of discrete conformance with the Master Plan and that decades of CRG practice demonstrates that compliance with the development regulations alone has \u201cbeen deemed\u201d sufficient to merit approval. On the other hand, Respondents maintain that Master Plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>compliance is a discrete requirement of development plan review. Although the Master Plan textual recommendations are framed as advisory, rather than mandatory, non-conformance with those recommendations remains a proper basis for denying HNS\u2019s amended development plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">We begin our analysis with a brief overview of the role of the Master Plan in Baltimore County. The Baltimore County Master Plan sets forth \u201ccomprehensive objectives, policies, and standards to serve as a guide for the development of the county.\u201d Baltimore County Charter, \u00a7 523. The Office of Planning prepares a proposed Master Plan (and amendments), which the County Council must accept or modify, and then adopts it by resolution. <em>Id. </em>The Master Plan objectives and policies are incorporated into the development purposes and policies set forth in B.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 22-37 (Development Policies) and 22-38 (Development Purposes). B.C.C. \u00a7 22-37 states that \u201cLajll development of land must conform to the master plan and these regulations.\u201d A stated purpose of the development regulations is \u201c[t]o implement the future growth and development of Baltimore County in accordance with the master plan.\u201d B.C.C. \u00a7 22-38(b). As noted by HNS, B.C.C. \u00a7 22-38 provides that \u201c[cjompliance with the development regulations hereinafter set forth shall be deemed the fulfillment of the development policies set forth in section 22-37 and the purposes set forth in section 22-38.\u201d The \u201cdevelopment regulations\u201d are set forth in B.C.C. \u00a7 22-37 through \u00a7 22-119. B.C.C. \u00a7 22-40(b). Compliance with the Master Plan is considered a part of the development plan review and approval process. B.C.C. \u00a7 22-54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">At the time of the review and approval of Phase II of the Longfield Estates subdivision in 1991, development plan review was conducted under a prior iteration of the CRG process, which is no longer in existence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In 2005, when HNS filed its amended development plan, the County Code provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>that proposed amendments to approved development plans be reviewed in the same manner as the original plan.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Prior to a development plan being filed, the Office of Planning and the DPW hold a pre-development conference to provide the applicant with information about policies, standards, or legislation that may affect the subject property. B.C.C. \u00a7 22-54. After the pre-development conference, which may be waived by the applicant, the proposed development plan is submitted to the DPW. If the proposed plan provides the necessary information described in B.C.C. \u00a7 22-55, the DPW forwards the plan to the CRG within 15 days of receipt of the plan. B.C.C. \u00a7 22-56(a). The DPW is to schedule a meeting of the CRG no earlier than 15 days, but no later than 30 days, after the plan is accepted for filing. B.C.C. \u00a7 22-56(b). If a county agency (including the DPW) fails to act within its statutory time frame, the plan is deemed approved, unless an administrative officer provides an excuse in writing within seven days of the time lapsing. B.C.C. \u00a7 22-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">When the CRG meets, if it appears that the proposal conflicts with the Master Plan, the development plan must be referred to the Planning Board. B.C.C. \u00a7 22-59(a)(l). After its review of the potential Master Plan conflict, the Planning Board files concurrently a written decision with the CRG and the Baltimore County Council. B.C.C. \u00a7 22-60(b)(l). Unless the County Council overrules the Planning Board\u2019s determination regarding the Master Plan conflict, the Planning Board\u2019s decision is binding upon the CRG and must be incorporated into the CRG\u2019s final action on a proposed plan. B.C.C. \u00a7 22-60(c). Any person \u201caggrieved or feeling aggrieved by final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>action on a plan\u201d may appeal to the Board of Appeals within 30 days of the date of the final action by the CRG. B.C.C. \u00a7 22-61(a). On review by the Board of Appeals, \u201c[t]he final action on a plan shall be presumed correct and the person aggrieved shall have the burden of persuasion to show that such action was arbitrary or capricious, procured by fraud, or otherwise illegal.\u201d B.C.C. \u00a7 22 \u2014 61(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">HNS\u2019s view that its amended development plan met the \u201cdevelopment regulations\u201d and, therefore, must be deemed in compliance with the ordinance and the Master Plan is an illogical conclusion that imagines a unique conception of \u201cdevelopment regulations\u201d not contemplated by the Code. The development regulations are composed of <em>all </em>of the policies, definitions, procedures, and rules found in B.C.C. \u00a7 22-37 through 22-119. These sections of the code incorporate the Master Plan in multiple locations by stating that: \u201cland must conform to the master plan <em>and </em>these regulations\u201d (B.C.C. \u00a7 22-37(a) (emphasis added)); growth must be implemented \u201cin accordance with the master plan\u201d (B.C.C. \u00a7 22-38(a)); predevelopment conferences must address potential Master Plan intent and conflicts; (B.C.C. \u00a7 22 \u2014 54(b)); the CRG must refer Master Plan conflicts to the Planning Board (B.C.C. \u00a7 22-59(a)(1)); and the Planning Board must dispose of the Master Plan conflict by a certain procedure (B.C.C. \u00a7 22-60(b)(l) &amp; (c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">HNS\u2019s narrow reading of B.C.C. \u00a7 22-38 ignores the integrated role of the Master Plan in the overall land development regulatory scheme. We do not see how, once the Planning Board\u2019s decision (that the proposal reflected in the amended development plan was in conflict with the Master Plan) became binding on the CRG review and approval process, the development could still be in compliance with the development regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The amended development plan could not be in compliance with the development regulations without conforming to the Master Plan. In our view, the language of B.C.C. \u00a7 22-38, which states that \u201c[c]ompliance with the'development regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>tions hereinafter set forth shall be deemed the fulfilment of the development policies in section 22-37 and purposes set forth in section 22-38,\u201d is clear and unambiguous. A development plan must adhere to all of the development regulations and procedures, from B.C.C. \u00a7 22-37 through B.C.C. 22-119, in order to meet the broad goals set forth in B.C.C. \u00a7 22-37, which includes regulations addressing the Master Plan goals. In this statutory context, conformance to the recommendations of the Master Plan rises to the level of a regulatory device, rather than a mere recommendation. A conflict with the Master Plan obliges the CRG to defer to the Planning Board, whose decision must be incorporated in the CRG\u2019s final action on the development plan. When the Planning Board concluded there was a conflict with the Master Plan and recommended denial of the amended development plan, there was no possible way for the amended development plan proposal to be \u201cdeemed in compliance with the\u201d development regulations, its adherence to other requirements in the regulations notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">HNS concedes that the Master Plan and development regulations have a \u201cclose nexus\u201d and that the development regulations contain strategies to achieve the goals of the Master Plan. Those strategies for compliance include the Planning Board process for determining potential Master Plan conflicts. As HNS points out, the textual recommendations of the Master Plan and community plans are rarely site-specific in their language, so the seemingly broad resolution provisions for determining conflicts are necessary to allow the technically competent county personnel to interpret the Master Plan on a site-by-site basis as development proposals are tendered. HNS failed to explain a cogent reason for why the Board of Appeals\u2019s decision to reject an amended development plan, that conflicted admittedly with the Master Plan, was improper in light of clear statutory language that \u201cdevelopment of land must conform to the master plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The Baltimore County Code provides a process where the County Council, as part of the development review process, may place in reservation, for up to 18 months, a portion or all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>of the land involved in a development submission, thus delaying development while the County determines if it should acquire the property. <em>Sycamore Realty Co. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. Cnty., </em>344 Md. 57, 59, 684 A.2d 1331, 1332 (1996). The County Council may acquire through negotiation or condemnation the reserved property for public interest purposes, including open space, environmental preservation, playgrounds, or parks. <em>Id.; see also </em>B.C.C. \u00a7 32-2-301(a) (2003). B.C.C. \u00a7 22-18, titled \u201cEffects of proposals in master plan on applications for building permits or for approval of preliminary subdivision plans,\u201d provides the procedure whereby the Planning Board, or another agency, determines \u201cwhether ... it believes that it would be in the public interest to reserve any portion or all of the land.\u201d If the Planning Board concludes that the County should reserve all or part of the land, it must send a report and recommendation to the County Council. B.C.C. \u00a7 22-18. The County Council has 30 days to \u201cpass a resolution declaring the reservation and describing the land to be reserved.\u201d B.C.C. \u00a7 22-18. If the County Council does not resolve to reserve all or part of the property, the inquiry ends as to whether a reservation is in the public interest, and the property may not be considered again for reservation by the local government for a period of two years. B.C.C. \u00a7 22-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">HNS reasons that, because there is no provision in B.C.C. \u00a7 22-18 for what happens when (as happened here) the Planning Board, in identifying a Master Plan conflict, recommends nonetheless that the County Council <em>not </em>reserve or purchase the subject property, the conclusion that a Master Plan conflict exists has no efficacy. This ignores plainly the import in the development regulations of a Master Plan conflict. When the Planning Board concludes that it is not in the public interest to acquire a property, and the County Council does not override this position, the Planning Board\u2019s conclusion that the amended development plan is in conflict with the Master Plan remains and is binding on the final action taken by the CRG. Nothing in B.C.C. \u00a7 22-18 negates B.C.C. \u00a7 22-60(c); it provides a procedure for determining whether the County should attempt to acquire the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Here the County Council did not act to overrule the Planning Board\u2019s conclusion that the amended development plan conflicted with the 1998-2000 and 2010 Master Plans; therefore, B.C.C. \u00a7 22-60(c) mandates that that decision become part of the final CRG action. Regardless of whether the Board of Appeals erred by retaining jurisdiction over the case (as all parties contend), rather than remanding it back to the CRG (instead of the Planning Board), the end game is the same, in our view. The county agency tasked with determining whether a Master Plan conflict existed made its decision. This decision was not arbitrary or capricious, based as it was on analysis of the prevailing Master Plan at the time of the original development approval of Phase II of the Longfield Estates development in 1991, Note 18 appended to that plan, and the Master Plan in effect when the proposed amended development plan for Lot 42 and Parcel A was considered. HNS does not assert here that the Planning Board concluded improperly that there was a Master Plan conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">HNS strains to make something of the distinction between Master Plan conflict versus conformance. It states that the conflict provisions in the development regulations are in place only as a trigger to allow the County time to acquire properties, found to be in conflict with the Master Plan and desirable for public acquisition, through eminent domain or negotiation. In our view, whether a property, empressed with a reservation, is acquired by the County is a wholly separate process and purpose of the B.C.C., discussed <em>supra. </em>Equally significant, if not of greater importance, the development regulations determine how the County is to be developed over time and place restrictions on developments and subdivisions in order to achieve the long term goals of the Master Plan. Whether conforming development is in the best interest of the County and the public is a separate matter from acquisition of desirable public property. As pointed out by HNS, nine parcels in the original Phase II Longfield Estates development plan were found to be in conflict with the Master Plan initially, but were not acquired by the County, presumably because to do so would not benefit the public. Moreover, the developer modi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>fied its development proposal for these lots so as to ameliorate the conflict and induce the County not to reserve the lots. Acquisition of a property is not the only mechanism for the County to protect its Master Plan goals. Reasonable restrictions on development, including limiting lot sizes, house siting, and numbers of lots, are implemented regularly and are not challenged here by HNS. These restrictions were implemented in the initial Phase II Longfield Estates development plan, approved by the CRG, in order to bring the development into conformance with the Master Plan. The Planning Board is maintaining presently a position it took originally in 1991 with regard to Lot 42 and Parcel A in order to protect the Master Plan-recommended viewshed of a historic property.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s reasoning that when the development regulations incorporate Master Plan compliance the Master Plan itself becomes a regulatory device, rather than a mere guide and recommendation. <em>HNS, </em>200 Md.App. at 34, 24 A.3d at 188. In <em>Rylyns, </em>we concluded that a municipality\u2019s imposition, at the insistence of Montgomery County, of a more restrictive zoning classification on a parcel of newly annexed land than provided by the city\u2019s zoning law was impermissible. 372 Md. at 521, 814 A.2d at 479. We explained in <em>Rylyns </em>that master plans,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW_\">which are the result of work done by planning commissions and adopted by ultimate zoning bodies, are advisory in nature and have no force of law absent statutes or local ordinances linking planning and zoning. Where the latter exists, however, they serve to elevate the status of comprehensive plans to the level of true regulatory devices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">372 Md. at 530, 814 A.2d at 478. In <em>Coffey v. Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Commission, </em>293 Md. 24, 25, 441 A.2d 1041, 1041 (1982), the Prince George\u2019s County Planning Board rejected a proposed subdivision plan because it did not conform to the Master Plan, and we concluded that \u201cwhen subdivision regulations require that a proposed subdivision comply with the master plan, an application for approval of a preliminary subdivision plan that fails to so comply must be rejected.\u201d In <em>Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Plan</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number><em>ning Commission v. Greater Baden-Aquasco Citizens Association, </em>412 Md. 73, 102, 985 A.2d 1160, 1177 (2009), we held that the provisions of a Master Plan were mandatory where Prince George\u2019s County subdivision regulations required that subdivision \u201cplat[s] shall conform to the area master plan, including maps and text, unless the Planning Board finds that events have occurred to render the relevant plan recommendations no longer appropriate.\u201d We find no principled distinction between these cases and the present one.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">B. A Taking Without Just Compensation?</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">HNS argues that, when the Board of Appeals denied the amended development plan solely on the basis of a Master Plan conflict, a taking without just compensation occurred. The Court of Special Appeals concluded that HNS failed to preserve properly this issue for appeal. We disagree with this reasoning because HNS presented, in oral argument to the Board of Appeals at its 17 December 2008 hearing, a vague, but notice-worthy, takings argument.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although we consider the issue preserved (barely), we conclude that this challenge is waived for two reasons. Under Maryland Rule 8-504(a)(5), a brief is to contain \u201c[a] concise statement of the applicable standard of review for each issue, which may appear in the discussion of the issue or under a separate heading placed before the argument.\u201d Moreover, Maryland Rule 8-504(a)(6) requires a brief to supply \u201cargument in support of the party\u2019s position on each issue.\u201d A necessary part of any argument are case, statutory, and/or constitutional authorities to support it. We have said that Maryland Rules \u201care not guides to the practice of law but precise rubrics \u2018established to promote the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>orderly and efficient administration of justice and [that they] are to be read and followed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Isen v. Phoenix Assurance Co., </em>259 Md. 564, 570, 270 A.2d 476, 479 (1970) (quoting <em>Brown v. Fraley, </em>222 Md. 480, 483, 161 A.2d 128, 130 (1960)). Maryland Rule 8-504(c) allows this Court to \u201cdismiss the appeal or make any other appropriate order with respect to the case,\u201d in the event of noncompliance with Md. Rule 8-504(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">The Court of Special Appeals refused repeatedly (based on Md. Rule 8-504(a)(5)) to address issues not briefed properly by a party. <em>See, e.g., Rollins v. Capital Plaza Assocs., 181 </em>Md.App. 188, 202, 955 A.2d 869, 877 (2008) (stating that where a party cited no controlling law to support her position, the court refused to seek out law to sustain her position); <em>Kramer v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt., </em>124 Md.App. 616, 634, 723 A.2d 529, 538 (1999) (refusing to address an issue not supported in the brief by argument or authority); <em>Konover Prop. Trust, Inc. v. WHE Assocs., </em>142 Md.App. 476, 494, 790 A.2d 720, 730 (2002) (stating that where a party failed to cite any relevant law on an issue in its brief, the court refused to \u201crummage in a dark cellar for coal that isn\u2019t there,\u201d or to \u201cfashion coherent legal theories to support appellant\u2019s sweeping claims\u201d (citing <em>Elecs. Store, Inc. v. Cellco P\u2019ship, 127 </em>Md.App. 385, 405, 732 A.2d 980, 990 (1999))). HNS\u2019s brief addressing the question of whether a taking occurred does not cite any constitutional or common law authority for its position.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The brief provides only sweeping accusations and conclusory statements. After reviewing HNS\u2019s brief, we are disinclined to search for and supply HNS with authority to support its bald and undeveloped allegation that the Board of Appeals\u2019s action constituted a taking, no matter how alluring such a sweeping claim may be.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Considering the well-devel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>oped body of law addressing Fifth Amendment takings, including those applied specifically to regulatory takings, this omission is unacceptable and so we deem this argument waived for present purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">C. Is Note 18 an Exaction?</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">HNS argues that Note 18 on the 1991 Longfield Estates, Phase II, final development plan does not rise to the level of an exaction as discussed in <em>City of Annapolis v. Waterman, </em>357 Md. 484, 745 A.2d 1000 (2000), and, therefore, the Board of Appeals could not rely on the Note as a basis for denying the amended development plan. To the contrary, HNS argues that Note 18, by encouraging the owner in 1991 to place conservation easements on the parcels, indicated that there were valuable development rights remaining in Parcel A and Lot 42, and that HNS was entitled to execute those rights now. HNS argues also that Note 18, although not a regulatory taking in and of itself, \u201ccontains the threat that there may ultimately be a county taking under the master plan conflict provisions in the event of a subdivision.\u201d Respondents agree that Note 18 was not an exaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">There is no dispute between the parties that Note 18 is not an exaction and, therefore, we decline to offer an advisory opinion, a practice long forbidden by this Court. <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Randall, </em>209 Md. 18, 27, 120 A.2d 195, 199 (1956) (\u201c[CJourts will not, in the absence of constitutional mandate, render advisory opinions.\u201d (citing <em>Hammond v. Lancaster, </em>194 Md. 462, 71 A.2d 474 (1950))); (\u201c[n]or will the courts render advisory opinions unless there is an actual justiciable controversy between the parties\u201d (citing <em>Tanner v. McKeldin, </em>202 Md. 569, 97 A.2d 449 (1953))). We conclude also that this question is moot in light of our conclusion that nonconformity with the Master Plan provides a valid and independent basis for rejecting the amended development plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
