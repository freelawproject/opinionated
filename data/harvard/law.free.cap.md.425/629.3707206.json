Prior to the hearing, her son was adjudicated to be a Child in Need of Assistance (CINA) based on the same allegations of neglect presented in the administrative action. As a result, the administrative law judge granted the Department\u2019s motion to dismiss Ms. Cosby\u2019s administrative appeal based on collateral estoppel. Ms. Cosby filed a petition for judicial review, arguing that amendments to Maryland Code (1984, 2006 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 5-706.1 of the Family Law Article precluded application of the common law defense. The Circuit Court for Allegany County agreed and reinstated Ms. Cosby\u2019s administrative appeal, however, the Court of Special Appeals reversed that determination. <em>See Dep\u2019t of Human Res. v. Cosby, </em>200 Md.App. 54, 24 A.3d 199 (2011). Upon review of the applicable statutory provision and prior appellate case law, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the provision was not amended so as to preclude the common law defense of collateral estoppel when the elements are otherwise satisfied. Petitioner concedes that the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>quired elements of collateral estoppel are present in the instant case. Therefore, we shall hold that the dismissal of the administrative appeal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">On October 7, 2008, the Department notified Ms. Cosby that, following a Child Protective Services investigation, it had found her responsible for \u201cindicated child neglect.\u201d As a result, Ms. Cosby\u2019s name would be placed into a central registry of child neglectors pursuant to Maryland Code (1984, 2006 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 5-714(e) of the Family Law Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>The underlying basis of the finding according to the Department\u2019s report, was that on September 23, 2008, Ms. Cosby had refused to allow Michael, her 17 year-old adoptive son, who was paralyzed from the waist down, to return home after he and Ms. Cosby\u2019s live-in paramour \u201cgot into a verbal altercation ... [that] became physical in nature.\u201d Ms. Cosby further refused to allow the Department to coordinate a voluntary placement and instead insisted that Michael be placed in foster care \u201cas a punishment.\u201d Due to her refusal to either allow Michael to return home or to grant permission for him to live with a voluntary caregiver, the Department placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Michael into shelter care and filed a CINA petition in the Circuit Court for Allegany County. On December 15, 2008, the Circuit Court granted the petition, adjudicated Michael to be a CINA<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> based on Ms. Cosby\u2019s neglect, and placed him in the care of the Department for transfer into foster care.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Meanwhile, on December 1, 2008, Ms. Cosby challenged the Department\u2019s finding that she was responsible for \u201cindicated child neglect,\u201d by filing a timely request for a contested case hearing before the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d) pursuant to \u00a7 5 \u2014 706.1(b) of the Family Law Article. Following the CINA determination, Respondent moved to dismiss the administrative hearing on grounds of collateral estoppel, arguing that the Circuit Court\u2019s finding of neglect precluded Petitioner from challenging the Department\u2019s determination of \u201cindicated child neglect\u201d based upon the same facts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Cosby filed an untimely opposition, arguing that amendments to \u00a7 5-706.1 of the Family Law Article made clear that a CINA finding does not bar a subsequent administrative appeal. The administrative law judge (ALJ) granted the motion based on collateral estoppel and dismissed the appeal in an order dated March 25, 2009.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In reaching this conclusion, the ALJ relied on the intermediate appellate court\u2019s decision in <em>Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services v. Tamara A., </em>178 Md.App. 686, 943 A.2d 653 (2008) <em>[Tamara A. I] </em>which, as explained <em>infra, </em>held that CINA determinations do, in fact, preclude the re-litigation of issues presented in contested case hearings where the elements of common-law collateral estoppel are satisfied. <em>Tamara I, </em>178 Md.App. at 700-01, 943 A.2d at 660-61. The ALJ stated that \u201c[t]he Court [in <em>Tamara A. I] </em>specifically noted that the definition of child neglect used in the CINA hearing was identical to the definition of child neglect applicable in neglect cases such as the present matter.\u201d The ALJ concluded, therefore, that collateral estoppel barred the contested case hearing because Ms. Cosby had the opportunity \u201cat the CINA hearing to fully litigate the issues in question,\u201d as the CINA conclusion \u201cwas based on the same events giving rise to the child neglect investigation in the present case, <em>i.e. </em>the incident of September 23, 2008 wherein [Ms. Cosby] refused reentry of the [c]hild into [her] home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">On April 2, 2009, Petitioner filed a motion to reconsider, arguing that the ALJ\u2019s decision was incorrect because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Court of Appeals had reversed <em>Tamara A. I </em>prior to the administrative hearing in <em>Tamara A. v. Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services, </em>407 Md. 180, 963 A.2d 773 (2009) <em>[Tamara A. II </em>]. The Department responded that, despite the reversal, <em>Tamara A. I </em>remained persuasive because this Court had specifically declined to review the merits of the decision, but, rather, vacated it as an improper interlocutory appeal. The ALJ agreed with the Department and reaffirmed its decision that Ms. Cosby\u2019s administrative action was barred as a matter of law by collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Ms. Cosby then filed a petition for judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision with the Circuit Court for Allegany County.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On March 5, 2010, after a hearing, the Circuit Court reversed the ALJ\u2019s dismissal and remanded for further proceedings on the contested case based on its reading of both \u00a7 5-706.1 and <em>Tamara A. II. </em>While it recognized that this Court in <em>Tamara A. II </em>\u201cdeclined to address the merits of the case,\u201d it interpreted certain dicta to suggest that Ms. Cosby \u201cwas entitled to further proceedings on her appeal.\u201d Therefore, according to the Circuit Court, \u201cthe ALJ\u2019s reliance upon the analysis and holding of <em>Tamara A. [I] ... </em>was inappropriate in light of the Court of Appeals[\u2019s] reversal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Following this decision, Respondent appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. That court reversed and held that dismissal was the appropriate disposition because collateral estoppel did, in fact, bar Cosby\u2019s administrative appeal. <em>Dep\u2019t of Human Res. v. Cosby, </em>200 Md.App. 54, 24 A.3d 199 (2011). The intermediate appellate court based this conclusion on its interpretation of the legislative history surrounding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>amendments to \u00a7 5-706.1, and its review of the <em>Tamara A. </em>decisions. The court made clear that <em>Tamara A. II </em>\u201cdid not determine whether collateral estoppel would preclude [an] appeal from [an] indicated neglect finding,\u201d but that dicta within the opinion was consistent with such a holding. <em>Cosby, </em>200 Md.App. at 71-72, 24 A.3d at 209-10. We granted Petitioner\u2019s request for a writ of certiorari, <em>Cosby v. Soc. Servs., </em>422 Md. 352, 30 A.3d 193 (2011), to resolve the issues surrounding the interpretation of \u00a7 5-706.1 and the <em>Tamara A. </em>decisions, and now address the following question, as restated by the intermediate appellate court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-4\">Where there was a prior finding of child neglect in a CINA case to which Cosby was a party, did the ALJ err in a subsequent administrative proceeding when he granted the Department\u2019s motion to dismiss Cosby\u2019s appeal of the Department\u2019s finding of indicated child neglect based on collateral estoppel?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">We answer that question in the negative, and therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, as the administrative appeal was properly dismissed on grounds of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\"> The instant case presents an action for judicial review of an administrative decision. In such cases, the Court of Appeals \u201ctake[s] the same posture as the circuit court or the intermediate appellate court, and [we] limit our review to the agency\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Anderson v. General Casualty, </em>402 Md. 236, 244, 935 A.2d 746, 751 (2007) (citation omitted); <em>accord MVA v.

As we explained in <em>Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number><em>Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 67-68, 729 A.2d 376, 380 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">A court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow, it is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-6\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Indeed, we have said that \u201c[i]f there is a need to articulate a \u2018standard\u2019 for judicial review of an agency\u2019s legal rulings, it is sufficient to say that a reviewing court must determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Md. Aviation Admin. v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 574 n. 3, 873 A.2d 1145, 1156 n. 3 (2005) (internal quotation omitted). We recently explained in <em>People\u2019s Insurance v. Allstate, </em>424 Md. 443, 36 A.3d 464 (2012), that \u201c[wjhether [a] statute applies and, if so, how it should be interpreted, are questions of law, and, although an agency\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute that it administers ordinarily is given considerable weight by reviewing courts, the court must make the ultimate legal determination.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Insurance, </em>424 Md. at 457, 36 A.3d at 472; <em>accord Bayly Crossing, LLC v. Consumer Prot. Div., </em>417 Md. 128, 137, 9 A.3d 4, 9 (2010) (\u201cInterpreting the pure meaning of a statute is deemed a question of law ... however, we frequently give weight to an agency\u2019s experience in interpretation of a statute that it administers.\u201d (internal citations and quotations omitted)); <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v.

Nonetheless, if an agency has made an erroneous conclusion of law, it is our duty to correct that conclusion.\u201d (internal citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">In the instant case, the ALJ granted the Department\u2019s motion to dismiss based on collateral estoppel, implicitly interpreting \u00a7 5-706.1, a statute that the Department administers, as not precluding the common law defense. We now review this determination for legal error, giving appropriate weight to the Department\u2019s interpretation of the statute. <em>See Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Aiken, </em>418 Md. 11, 27, 12 A.3d 656, 665 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">We have commented that \u201c[c]ollateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, began life and retains life as a common law doctrine.\u201d <em>Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Cmty. Ass\u2019n, </em>361 Md. 371, 387, 761 A.2d 899, 907 (2000) (quotation omitted). Under the doctrine, \u201c[w]hen an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim.\u201d <em>Murray Int\u2019l Freight Corp. v. Graham, </em>315 Md. 543, 547, 555 A.2d 502, 504 (1989) (quotation omitted). Maryland adheres to a four-part test for the application of collateral estoppel, which we explained in <em>Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Community Association:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\"><em>1. </em>Was the issue decided in the prior adjudication identical with the one presented in the action in question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">2. Was there a final judgment on the merits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-10\">3. Was the party against whom the plea is asserted a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-12\">4.

I, </em>178 Md.App. 686, 943 A.2d 653 (2008) and this Court\u2019s subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>reversal in <em>Tamara A. II, </em>407 Md. 180, 963 A.2d 773 (2009) provide a background for the question that is now squarely before this Court, namely, the proper construction of \u00a7 5-706.1 of the Family Law Article as it applies to collateral estoppel and CINA proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\"><em>Tamara A. I </em>involved facts relatively similar to those at bar. In that case, the Department notified Tamara A. that it had found her to be responsible for indicated neglect of her newborn, based on the same untreated psychological condition that had led to previous CINA adjudications regarding her older children. Tamara A. appealed the Department\u2019s finding by requesting a contested case hearing before the OAH. Meanwhile, the newborn was adjudicated to be a CINA by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County based on Tamara A.\u2019s neglect. See Md.Code 3-801(f) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Following the CINA determination, the Department filed a motion to dismiss the administrative proceeding, arguing that the issue of neglect had been fully litigated during the CINA proceeding and that Tamara A. was, therefore, collaterally estopped from challenging the Department\u2019s finding based upon the same facts. The ALJ denied the motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Department filed a petition for judicial review, which the Circuit Court, and subsequently, the intermediate appellate court granted. On the merits, the Circuit Court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s denial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>motion to dismiss; however, the Court of Special Appeals reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The intermediate appellate court concluded that because the issue of neglect was fully litigated and resolved in the CINA proceeding, the ALJ should have granted the motion to dismiss the administrative action based on collateral estoppel. <em>Tamara A. I, </em>178 Md.App. at 697-701, 943 A.2d at 659-61. The only element of the doctrine that was in dispute was whether the finding of neglect in the CINA proceeding was identical to the finding of neglect required in the administrative appeal. <em>Tamara A. I, </em>178 Md.App. at 698, 943 A.2d at 659. The court made clear that \u201cneglect\u201d was \u201cdefined in precisely the same terms,\u201d under both the CINA statute, Maryland Code (1973, 2006 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 3-801(s) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, and the child abuse and neglect statute, \u00a7 5-701(s) of the Family Law Article.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>Tamara </em>A. <em>I, </em>178 Md.App. at 699-700, 943 A.2d at 660. Therefore, according to the court, the determination of neglect in the CINA case was \u201cidentical to the Department\u2019s finding that Ms. A. [was] responsible for indicated neglect....\u201d <em>Tamara A. I, </em>178 Md.App. at 700, 943 A.2d at 660. Although the statutes and proceedings differed in some respects, the court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">Collateral estoppel does not require that the prior and present proceedings have the same purpose, nor does it mandate that the statutes upon which the proceedings are based have the same goals. The relevant question is whether the fact or issue was actually litigated and decided in a prior proceeding, regardless of the cause of action or claim. If the answer to that question is yes, then, assuming that the remaining factors of the doctrine have been met, collateral estoppel bars re-litigation of the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-6\"><em>Tamara A. I, </em>178 Md.App. at 701, 943 A.2d at 661 (footnote omitted) (internal citation omitted).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the court concluded that \u201c[t]hough the law grants Ms. A. the right to a contested case hearing to have the ALJ decide whether [the] standard has been satisfied, Ms. A. is not entitled to have the finding of neglect decided anew.\u201d <em>Tamara A. I, </em>178 Md.App. at 700, 943 A.2d at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">This Court reversed <em>Tamara A. I </em>in <em>Tamara A. II, </em>407 Md. 180, 963 A.2d 773 (2009), on the grounds that it was an improper interlocutory appeal, unauthorized by Maryland Code, \u00a7 10-222(b) of the State Government Article. <em>Tamara A. II, </em>407 Md. at 194-95, 963 A.2d at 781 (\u201cThe ruling here did not determine any rights or liabilities of the parties ... nor did it have any immediate legal consequences.\u201d). Indeed, the sole issue presented in <em>Tamara A. II </em>was whether the denial of the motion to dismiss was subject to immediate judicial review and we explicitly declined to address whether the ALJ\u2019s decision was correct. <em>Tamara A. II, </em>407 Md. at 187, 963 A.2d at 777. Both parties in the instant case, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>point to a particular section of the opinion, which commented on \u00a7 5-706.1, as supporting their respective arguments regarding its proper construction. We stated in <em>Tamara A. II:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-4\">Indeed, although the correctness of the ALJ\u2019s decision is not presently before us, the statutory construct itself suggests that an appeal of a finding of indicated child abuse or neglect is not necessarily precluded by a CINA determination. FL \u00a7 5-706.1(a) requires DHHS to notify the individual alleged to have abused or neglected a child of its finding and of the opportunity to appeal the finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\">FL \u00a7\u00a7 5 \u2014 706.1(b)(3) and (4) require OAH to stay a hearing in such an appeal if either criminal charges based on the alleged abuse or neglect or a CINA proceeding is pending, until any such proceeding is concluded. If the individual is found guilty of criminal charges arising out of the alleged abuse or neglect, OAH must dismiss the administrative appeal. FL \u00a7 5 \u2014 706.1(b)(3)(ii). Conviction, in other words, <em>does </em>act as an absolute statutory bar to further prosecution of the administrative appeal. That is not the case with respect to a CINA proceeding, however. In sharp contrast, \u00a7 5-706. 1(b)(4)(H) provides that \u201c[a]fter the conclusion of the CINA case, the [OAH] shall vacate the stay and schedule further proceedings in accordance with this section.\u201d Although that provision does not necessarily preclude a collateral estoppel defense in a proper case, it certainly does not support DHHS\u2019s argument that the administrative proceeding must be put on indefinite hold in favor of immediate judicial review if such a defense is rejected by the ALJ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-6\"><em>Tamara A. II, </em>407 Md. at 194-95, 963 A.2d at 781 (emphasis in original) (footnotes omitted). Of course, from this language Petitioner emphasizes the words \u201cthe statutory construct [of \u00a7 5-706.1] itself suggests that an appeal of a finding of indicated child abuse or neglect is not necessarily precluded by a CINA determination.\u201d 407 Md. at 194, 963 A.2d at 781. Respondent, by contrast, quotes the subsequent line, which states that \u00a7 5-706.1 \u201cdoes not necessarily preclude a collateral estoppel defense in a proper case....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>These arguments regarding the proper construction of \u00a7 5-706.1 are now squarely before this Court because, unlike the situation presented in <em>Tamara A.

It is clear that, under the original language there was no right to appeal from an indicated or unsubstantiated abuse or neglect finding if a CINA petition had been filed regarding the alleged abused or neglected child, unless and until that petition was dismissed.

However, if a CINA petition has been filed involving the child alleged to be abused or neglected, the person may appeal to the OAH only if the CINA proceeding is dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-10\">The bill provides a person alleged to have abused or neglected a child with the ability to appeal a finding regardless of whether the CINA proceeding is dismissed or otherwise concluded, unless the person is convicted of a criminal offense arising from the alleged abuse or neglect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">Senate Judicial Proceedings Comm., Bill Analysis, H.B. 791 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">Also included in the bill file is a letter from then-Chief Administrative Law Judge John W. Hardwicke, dated March 24, 1995, to Senator Walter M. Baker, Chair of the Senate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Judicial' Proceedings Committee. The letter communicates OAH\u2019s support for the bill, characterizing it in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">HB 791 corrects an oversight in the existing law governing child abuse and neglect hearings. Current law permits the [child abuse and neglect] hearing to proceed only if the CINA proceeding is dismissed. If a child is adjudicated CINA, OAH has no authority to proceed with the hearing. This has caused some difficulties, <em>particularly when the appellant for the </em>[child abuse and neglect] <em>hearing is not involved in the CINA proceeding or when the matters at issue in the </em>[child abuse and neglect] <em>hearing are not adjudicated or resolved during the CINA proceeding.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">For example, a child is adjudicated CINA due to the neglect of the mother, but the mother\u2019s boyfriend has appealed the local department\u2019s identification of him as an alleged abuser in an indicated or unsubstantiated sex abuse finding. Under existing law, the boyfriend\u2019s [child abuse and neglect] hearing cannot proceed because the CINA proceeding was not dismissed even though the sex abuse issue may never have been discussed during the CINA proceeding. With the passage of HB 791, OAH would be able to proceed with the boyfriend\u2019s [child abuse and neglect] hearing after the CINA proceeding concludes,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXX\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The intermediate appellate court concluded from this legislative history that the purpose of the 1995 amendments \u201cwas to address the inequity created by FL \u00a7 5-706.1 when an individual was denied the right to appeal the Department\u2019s finding of indicated or unsubstantiated abuse or neglect, because the child ... was determined to be [a] CINA, even though the specific issue of abuse or neglect involving the individual was not litigated in the CINA proceeding or the individual was not a party to the CINA proceeding.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Human Res. v. Cosby, </em>200 Md.App. 54, 68-69, 24 A.3d 199, 207-08 (2011). Petitioner, however, disagrees with this analysis and argues that the amendments to \u00a7 5-706.1 precluded the defense of collateral estoppel based on a previous CINA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>finding because, the \u201cremoval [of the requirement that a CINA proceeding be dismissed prior to an administrative hearing] was not limited to parties, types of cases, or any other qualifiers ... no exception was inserted for \u2018common law collateral estoppel.\u2019 \u201d Petitioner urges that \u201c[h]ad the legislature intended to allow administrative hearings only for non-parties, a simple clause would have sufficed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Contrary to Petitioner\u2019s position, under our reading of the statutory amendments and legislative history, it is clear that the amendments did, in fact, work to correct an inherent inequity in the original legislation. Prior to the amendments, if a CINA petition had been filed involving the child victim, the alleged maltreator could not appeal unless and until the CINA petition was dismissed, irrespective of the possibility that he or she may not have been a party to the CINA proceeding or that the facts presented in the CINA petition may have differed from those supporting the Department\u2019s finding. Therefore, as Respondent points out, \u201cthe prior statute exceeded the contours of collateral estoppel to bar appeals that would not be precluded under the common law doctrine,\u201d due either to a lack of identity of the parties or of the issues. The amendments removed this overreach in order to comport with, rather than prohibit, the common law defense, allowing an ALJ to apply the doctrine in a proper case. <em>See Cosby, </em>200 Md.App. at 69-70, 24 A.3d at 208-09 (reasoning that \u201cthe General Assembly has not \u2018specified and plainly pronounced\u2019 a derogation of the doctrine of collateral estoppel\u201d in \u00a7 5-706.1 proceedings); <em>Breslin, </em>421 Md. at 287, 26 A.3d at 891 (noting that \u201c[statutes in derogation of the common law are strictly construed, and it is not to be presumed that the [Legislature by creating statutory assaults intended to make any alteration in the common law other than what has been specified and plainly pronounced.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Petitioner asserts that the ALJ\u2019s dismissal and the intermediate appellate court\u2019s decision in the instant case are inconsistent with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Tamara A. II, </em>407 Md. 180, 963 A.2d 773 (2009). As previously noted, however, we did not reach the question of collateral estoppel in that case, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>instead limited our holding to making clear that the appeal itself was premature. <em>Tamara II, </em>407 Md. at 187, 963 A.2d at 777. Therefore, the administrative law judge was properly-persuaded by the <em>Tamara A. I </em>commentary on collateral estoppel, because our decision in <em>Tamara A. II </em>did not reach the issue. <em>See West v. State, </em>369 Md. 150, 157, 797 A.2d 1278, 1282 (2002) (explaining that an intermediate appellate opinion underlying a judgment, which is later vacated on another ground, may still constitute persuasive authority). Further, our comment in <em>Tamara A. II </em>that \u201cthe statutory construction itself suggests that an appeal of a finding of indicated child abuse or neglect is not necessarily precluded by a CINA determination,\u201d <em>Tamara A. II, </em>407 Md. at 194, 963 A.2d at 781, is consistent with our holding today, namely, that while a CINA finding does not act as a <em>per se </em>bar to an administrative appeal, it can be preclusive where the elements of collateral estoppel are met. As we also suggested in <em>Tamara A. II, </em>\u00a7 5-706.1 \u201cdoes not necessarily preclude a collateral estoppel defense in a proper case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The instant case is a proper case.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

The ALJ evidently reasoned that a finding of indicated child neglect required actual harm to that child, and therefore, collateral estoppel did not apply to the administrative appeal because the Department had not established that the neglect issue had, in fact, been established in the CINA proceeding. <em>See Tamara A.
