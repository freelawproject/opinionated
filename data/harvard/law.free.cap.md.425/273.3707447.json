For the reasons that follow, we hold that Petitioner was not afforded at the suppression hearing an adequate opportunity to develop the witness\u2019s testimony. Consequently, the witness\u2019s testimony at that hearing was not admissible at Petitioner\u2019s trial under the \u201cformer testimony\u201d hearsay exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">On May 24, 2008, at approximately 6:30 p.m., two armed men robbed the GameStop video game store at 2436 North Charles Street in Baltimore City. They seized $150 from the register, a cell phone, and two wallets, before fleeing from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>store. On their way out, the robbers abducted 18-year-old DeAndre McIntyre, the store\u2019s lone customer, dragging McIntyre into the back seat of a gray Honda Accord that had been idling nearby. Both robbers joined McIntyre in the back seat, while a third man, who had not entered the GameStop, drove the Honda away from the scene. After a few minutes of driving around the Charles Village area of Baltimore City, McIntyre was forced out of the car at gunpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Police investigation into the robbery focused almost immediately on Leon Dulyx (hereafter \u201cPetitioner\u201d). Eyewitness descriptions of the getaway car provided its license plate number, leading police to Petitioner\u2019s aunt, Joy Herbert, who is the car\u2019s registered owner. Ms. Herbert informed police that she did not use the vehicle on May 24, but Petitioner enjoyed unfettered access to the vehicle and was in possession of it during that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">With that information in mind, Detective Kenneth Richard of the Baltimore City Police Department interviewed McIntyre, the only witness who had observed all three men involved in the robbery, at the police department\u2019s city-wide robbery office. When pressed by Detective Richard for a detailed description of the driver, McIntyre explained that he sat in the middle of the car\u2019s back seat during the abduction, so he was able only to observe the driver\u2019s light-brown facial complexion and braided hair. McIntyre could not give a more detailed physical description of the driver, such as height and weight, because he only observed the driver in a seated position.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Detective Richard then presented McIntyre with a photographic array containing six images, to determine whether McIntyre could identify Petitioner as one of the perpetrators of the robbery and abduction. McIntyre initially was unsure if any of the photos resembled the individual he observed driving the getaway vehicle. But, after looking over the images for a few moments McIntyre selected Petitioner\u2019s image and signed a statement on the back of the array that reads: \u201cI was in gamestop and the two boy frost me in the car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>at gun point. The person I pick out was driven the car and they push me out the car [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Detective Richard continued his investigation into the robbery, reviewing surveillance footage and questioning other witnesses, but those efforts failed to identify the other two men involved in the robbery and abduction. After a week of attempting without success to contact Petitioner in order to discuss the episode, Detective Richard swore out a warrant for Petitioner\u2019s arrest. Petitioner was arrested without incident and later charged with the crime of armed robbery and related offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">On the day of Petitioner\u2019s preliminary hearing in District Court, McIntyre arrived unexpectedly at the courthouse to recant his photo array identification of Petitioner. He asked to meet with the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney assigned to the preliminary hearing in Petitioner\u2019s case, explaining that \u201che did not feel like doing this [testifying about the identification]\u201d because \u201che really didn\u2019t see [the driver] anyway.\u201d Instead, McIntyre claimed that he had selected Petitioner\u2019s photo because \u201ca white detective pointed to [Petitioner\u2019s] picture.\u201d McIntyre made this recantation in the presence of Detective Richard, who at that time was meeting with the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney about Petitioner\u2019s preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Two weeks later, McIntyre withdrew his recantation. When discussing the case with the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney assigned to prosecute Petitioner in Circuit Court, McIntyre was resolute in his identification of Petitioner and denied making any statements about not being able to identify the driver. The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney prosecuting Petitioner\u2019s case promptly filed a supplementary discovery disclosure about the episode, alerting defense counsel to it months before the circuit court proceedings in Petitioner\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Petitioner moved to suppress the photographic identification on due process grounds, arguing that Detective Richard conducted the identification procedure in an impermissibly suggestive manner. When the motion came for a hearing, Petitioner was the first to present evidence. He called McIntyre <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>to testify about Detective Richard\u2019s conduct of the photo array identification procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Petitioner, through counsel, began his examination of McIntyre by asking for his account of the events inside the GameS-top immediately preceding the robbery. McIntyre explained that he entered the store looking for a specific video game and was inquiring about the price of the game when the two armed robbers entered the store. McIntyre gave a brief narrative of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>the robbery and abduction as he experienced those events. Petitioner\u2019s counsel then asked for specific, descriptive details about the armed robbers, presumably to test the accuracy of McIntyre\u2019s ability to recall. Without objection by the State, the suppression court cut off questioning and the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">THE COURT: Let\u2019s do this now. You know the rule, particularly with me, no depositions. No depositions. Focus right on the suppression. What is being suppressed here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: The ID, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">THE COURT: Alright, there came a time when\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6Z\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: I\u2019m going to try to establish a foundation at least.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">THE COURT: He\u2019s now describing \u2014 okay, it\u2019s a fair question. I want to get this in perspective. I overrule the Judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Petitioner\u2019s counsel again asked McIntyre to describe the two robbers. The State, however, immediately objected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\">[THE STATE]: Objection, scope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-11\">THE COURT: Well, he can do that by \u2014 he\u2019s singling out one. They both had weapons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-12\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, can we do one of them? The purpose is, if he has the ability to \u2014 it\u2019s just to test his ability to recall, in general, Your Honor. I mean, that\u2019s what the ID is about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-13\">[THE STATE]: Your Honor, respectfully, the Defendant is not alleged to be either of the two that came into the store. We are here to do photo array of the Defendant. If we could focus the scope to the Motion, like Your Honor was just saying. He\u2019s going to testify during trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3MA\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, it\u2019s one question and we\u2019ll move on. I\u2019m not here to do Discovery at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar2\">THE COURT: That\u2019s not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-14\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: I think it establishes\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>THE COURT: You\u2019re telling the Judge an untruth. I also think you\u2019re right. It\u2019s a double-edged matter and I can\u2019t deny you [one] edge because of the other edge. If the one edge is legitimate. I\u2019m going to permit it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">You\u2019re going to limit it to one question, you said. You said describe the one who had the .38 or the one who had the shotgun or what?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Petitioner\u2019s counsel then asked McIntyre to describe the two robbers. McIntyre complied, characterizing one robber as six-foot, one-inch tall, \u201cbrown skinned\u201d and \u201c[c]hubby with braids\u201d; and the other robber as five-foot, seven-inches tall, \u201cbrown-skinned,\u201d with \u201cdreads\u201d in his hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Petitioner\u2019s counsel continued the examination by asking McIntyre for details about the abduction. After McIntyre confirmed that he was \u201ctaken out to the car,\u201d Petitioner\u2019s counsel inquired whether McIntyre \u201ceventually [got] into the car.\u201d Again, without the State\u2019s objection, the suppression court cut off questioning. The suppression court admonished Petitioner\u2019s counsel for posing that question, stating: \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go \u2014 now I do think it\u2019s fair to respect the State\u2019s objection [as to scope] and go to the photos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">In accordance with the Court\u2019s instructions, the remainder of defense counsel\u2019s examination and McIntyre\u2019s testimony related solely to the conduct of the photo array procedure and his selection of Petitioner\u2019s photo. McIntyre\u2019s testimony on the subject, however, was neither clear nor straightforward. He testified that, upon viewing an array made up of three photographs,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he told police that he did not recognize any of the individuals in the photos. Then, according to McIntyre, the lead officer responded by questioning him, \u201cyou sure he ain\u2019t [sic] on there,\u201d and cautioning him, \u201cdon\u2019t lie to me,\u201d prompting McIntyre to identify one of the pictures as \u201csomeone who was involved in th[e] alleged crime.\u201d When asked if any of the officers \u201cforced\u201d him to choose a picture, McIntyre <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>responded \u201cyes, sir.\u201d When asked to clarify whether the officers forced him to choose a particular picture (as opposed to being forced to submit to the identification procedure, and thus, forced to choose a picture generally), McIntyre gave evasive and contradictory answers. McIntyre both agreed that he \u201cpiek[ed] the photo out on [his] own,\u201d and agreed that \u201cthere [were] comments made by the police officer telling [him that he] should pick a certain person.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, McIntyre offered that, \u201c[w]hen I picked the guy out [from the photo array], that\u2019s when the officer was like, yes, that is the right one because another man had a picture of him, of the photo,\u201d implying that the officer only influenced McIntyre\u2019s selection <em>after </em>he had made it on his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">On cross-examination, McIntyre confirmed that he wrote and signed the statement on the photo array that read: \u201cThe person I pick out was driven [sic] the car.\u201d Petitioner did not ask McIntyre about his previous recantation of the identification or his subsequent withdrawal of that recantation. Following the conclusion of McIntyre\u2019s testimony, the suppression court denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress the identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Petitioner\u2019s trial began the next day. The State presented its case first, examining five witnesses and offering into evidence a number of audio and video exhibits. Two GameStop employees testified about what happened inside the GameStop store. Detective Richard testified about the photo array procedure and the resulting identification by McIntyre. And Ms. Herbert, Petitioner\u2019s aunt, testified about her circumstantial knowledge of Petitioner\u2019s access to the getaway vehicle. None of the witnesses provided direct, eyewitness testimony linking Petitioner to the robbery and abduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Likewise, the audiotape and videotape exhibits failed to link Petitioner to the robbery and abduction. One of the exhibits was a recording of a 911 call made by an eyewitness who watched the two robbers and McIntyre get into the getaway vehicle. The caller provided physical descriptions of the two robbers and a description of the getaway vehicle but did not describe the driver of the getaway vehicle. The other audiotape exhibit was a recording of jailhouse telephone conversations between Petitioner and Ms. Herbert, and Petitioner and an unknown female caller. The recording evidenced Petitioner\u2019s anger at having to face the criminal charges and general remorse for his life situation but did not approach the level of a confession to the crimes charged. The videotape exhibit was a recording made by the surveillance camera inside of the GameStop at the time of the robbery. That recording provided visual evidence of the two robbers but not of the driver of the getaway vehicle parked outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">To link Petitioner with the robbery and abduction, the State intended to examine McIntyre. McIntyre, though obviously present at the suppression hearing the day before the start of trial, failed to appear at any time during the three-day trial. The State therefore moved the court to declare McIntyre unavailable and admit his suppression hearing testimony into evidence as \u201cformer testimony,\u201d pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-804(b)(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court, on hearing the State\u2019s summary of its efforts at locating McIntyre, declared McIntyre unavailable. Petitioner\u2019s counsel did not take issue with the court\u2019s declaration of McIntyre\u2019s unavailability, but counsel did object to the court\u2019s admission into evidence of a videotape-recording of McIntyre\u2019s suppression hearing testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>After the close of the State\u2019s case, defense counsel made a motion for judgment of acquittal, which the trial court denied. Petitioner rested without putting on evidence. The trial court instructed the jury on the necessary law, the two sides submitted closing arguments, and the jury retired to deliberate. During its deliberations the jury listened a second time to the 911 recording and jailhouse conversation tapes. An hour after that, the jury returned its verdict finding Petitioner guilty of aiding and abetting a robbery and aiding and abetting theft under $500, and acquitting him of all other charges. The trial court imposed consecutive sentences of six years\u2019 imprisonment for the robbery charge and 18 months for the theft charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Petitioner appealed the judgments of conviction to the Court of Special Appeals, challenging, among other issues not pertinent here, that the Circuit Court erred under Maryland Rule 5-804(b)(l) and the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause in allowing the State to introduce McIntyre\u2019s suppression hearing testimony at trial. Petitioner argued that the suppression court\u2019s limitation on his examination of McIntyre at that hearing deprived him of a full and fair opportunity to develop McIntyre\u2019s testimony. Consequently, Petitioner did not \u201cconfront\u201d McIntyre, as required by the Sixth Amendment and the \u201copportunity\u201d requirement of Rule 5 \u2014 804(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The Court of Special Appeals disagreed, and, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the judgments. The intermediate appellate court specifically noted that admission of McIntyre\u2019s suppression hearing testimony did not offend Petitioner\u2019s right to confront witnesses against him under the Sixth Amendment and the Maryland Rules. The court reasoned that Petitioner\u2019s motive to examine McIntyre at the suppression hearing was \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to his motive to examine McIntyre at trial, and Petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine McIntyre at the suppression hearing because the suppression court \u201conly limited [an] embarked-upon line of questioning.\u201d Therefore, the Court of Special Appeals held that questions about infirmities in McIntyre\u2019s testimony \u201cwere neither precluded by the court nor attempted by [Petitioner].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Petitioner filed with this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">1. Did the Court of Special Appeals err when it held \u201cthat [Petitioner\u2019s] \u2018motive\u2019 to examine [the sole eyewitness against him] at the suppression hearing concerning police conduct during a photographic array identification was \u2018substantially similar\u2019 to Petitioner\u2019s motive to do so at trial\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">2. Did the Court of Special Appeals err when it held that Petitioner was given a \u201cfull and fair opportunity\u201d to cross-examine the witness despite the substantial limitations placed on Petitioner\u2019s ability to question him?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">We granted the petition. <em>Dulyx v. State, </em>421 Md. 192, 25 A.3d 1025 (2011). We answer the second question in the affirmative and do not address the first.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Maryland Rule 5-801 (c) defines \u201chearsay\u201d as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Maryland Rule 5-802 prohibits admission of hearsay statements into evidence, unless the hearsay statement falls within a narrow exception provided by rule, statute or constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Maryland Rule 5 \u2014 804(b)(1) provides one such exception to the hearsay prohibition. As mentioned at the outset, that Rule allows for the admission of a prior statement made under oath by an unavailable witness so long as the party against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>whom the statement is offered had an \u201copportunity\u201d and \u201csimilar motive\u201d to develop the testimony of the witness when the prior statement was made, by direct, cross- or redirect examination. Md. Rule 5\u2014804(b)(1); <em>see Tyler v. State, </em>342 Md. 766, 774, 679 A.2d 1127, 1131 (1996). We have explained that \u201can opportunity to develop the testimony \u2018is generally satisfied when the defense [was] given a full and fair opportunity to probe and expose [the] infirmities [of the testimony] through cross-examination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>416 Md. 670, 696, 7 A.3d 1038, 1053 (2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Salim, </em>855 F.2d 944, 954 (2d Cir.1988)) (alterations in original). Likewise, a motive is \u201csufficiently similar\u201d when \u201cthe party now opposing the testimony would have had, at the time the testimony was given, \u2018an interest of substantially similar intensity to prove (or disprove) the same side of a substantially similar issue\u2019 now before the court.\u201d <em>Id., </em>7 A.3d at 1053 (quoting <em>United States v. DiNapoli, </em>8 F.3d 909, 914-15 (2d Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We review the admissibility of a hearsay statement under a different standard than the admissibility of some other evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">We review rulings on the admissibility of evidence ordinarily on an abuse of discretion standard. Review of the admissibility of evidence which is hearsay is different. Hearsay, under our rules, <em>must </em>be excluded as evidence at trial, unless it falls within an exception to the hearsay rule excluding such evidence or is permitted by applicable constitutional provisions or statutes. Thus, a circuit court has no discretion to admit hearsay in the absence of a provision providing for its admissibility. Whether evidence is hearsay is an issue of law reviewed <em>de novo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\"><em>Parker, </em>408 Md. at 436, 970 A.2d at 325 (quoting <em>Bernadyn v. State, </em>390 Md. 1, 7-8, 887 A.2d 602, 606 (2005)) (quotation marks and citation omitted). We therefore must determine whether, as a matter of law, McIntyre\u2019s suppression hearing testimony meets the requirements of Rule 5-804(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Petitioner argues that he enjoyed neither an \u201copportunity\u201d nor a \u201csimilar motive\u201d to develop McIntyre\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing commensurate with the requirements of Rule 5 \u2014 804(b)(1). Petitioner posits that his opportunity to develop McIntyre\u2019s testimony was foreclosed when \u201cthe trial judge confined the universe of questions that Petitioner\u2019s counsel could ask McIntyre,\u201d thereby barring Petitioner from probing \u201cseveral infirmities in McIntyre\u2019s ... testimony.\u201d Petitioner points to the court\u2019s admonishments at the suppression hearing that prevented him from examining \u201cMcIntyre\u2019s ability to perceive and view Petitioner, inconsistencies in McIntyre\u2019s descriptions of the alleged perpetrators, and McIntyre\u2019s credibility based on his recantation.\u201d Petitioner further offers that his motive at the suppression hearing was solely to develop McIntyre\u2019s testimony regarding the suggestiveness and coerciveness during the photographic identification procedure, while at trial his motive was to challenge McIntyre\u2019s overall credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The State disagrees, arguing that Petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to develop McIntyre\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing and a motive to examine McIntyre at trial that was substantially similar to Petitioner\u2019s motive at the suppression hearing. The State asserts that Petitioner\u2019s lack of opportunity was not a product of the limitations the suppression court placed on Petitioner\u2019s examination, because the court merely precluded two questions that asked for cumulative and irrelevant testimony. Instead, the lack of opportunity, according to the State, was self-inflicted \u2014 a product of Petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to ask questions about matters relevant to the identification procedure. The State further asserts that Petitioner was motivated at the suppression hearing to show that the photo array identification was impermissibly suggestive <em>and, </em>under the totality of the circumstances, unreliable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, the State urges, Petitioner was moti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>vated to impeach the reliability of the identification procedure in the same way he was motivated to impeach McIntyre\u2019s overall reliability as a credible witness at trial, that is, by developing testimony about McIntyre\u2019s ability to perceive, or not, the events of the robbery and abduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Petitioner\u2019s argument that he lacked the \u201copportunity\u201d required by Rule 5 \u2014 804(b)(1) resolves the question. \u201c[The] crucial question is whether, given that the opponent can not now cross-examine the witness, the examination on the prior occasion was fairly equivalent to cross-examination in the present situation.\u201d <em>Huffington v. State, </em>304 Md. 559, 569, 500 A.2d 272, 277 (1985) (quoting Michael M. Martin, <em>The Former-Testimony Exception in the Proposed Federal Rules of Evidence, </em>57 Iowa L.Rev. 547, 556 (1972)) (alteration in original). We have said that a prior occasion to cross-examine is \u201cfairly equivalent,\u201d and the \u201copportunity\u201d requirement is thereby satisfied, when the objecting party has enjoyed a \u201cfull and fair opportunity to probe and expose [the] infirmities [of the testimony] through cross-examination.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>416 Md. at 696, 7 A.3d at 1053 (quoting <em>Salim, </em>855 F.2d at 954) (alterations in original). That \u201cfull and fair opportunity\u201d is afforded when the objecting party can \u201ccall[] to the attention of the factfinder the reasons for giving scant weight to the witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d <em>Salim, </em>855 F.2d at 954 (quoting <em>Delaware v.

Put a different way, if the objecting party was able to effectuate the principal purpose of cross-examination\u2014 \u201cto challenge whether the declarant was sincerely telling what [she] believed to be the truth, whether the declarant accurately perceived and remembered the matter [she] related, and whether the declarant\u2019s intended meaning is adequately conveyed by the language [she] employed\u201d \u2014 then that party has enjoyed an \u201copportunity\u201d under 5-804(b)(l). <em>Id. </em>(quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 70-71, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980)) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">A witness examination illustrative of what is not a \u201cfull and fair\u201d opportunity for cross-examination was presented in <em>Williams, </em>416 Md. at 696, 7 A.3d at 1053. In <em>Williams, </em>a <em>Brady </em>violation<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> caused the retrial of the defendant, Williams, on charges of first-degree murder, use of a handgun in the commission of a violent crime and carrying a handgun. 416 Md. at 674, 683, 7 A.3d at 1040, 1045. But before his retrial, a key eyewitness, whose testimony at the first trial linked Williams to the murder, died. <em>Id. </em>at 683, 7 A.3d at 1045. Moreover, at a pretrial hearing before the second trial, a detective attached to the investigation in Williams\u2019s case disclosed for the first time that the eyewitness had \u201cdescribed herself to him as \u2018legally blind.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683, 7 A.3d at 1045. The State moved to have the eyewitness\u2019s videotaped testimony from the first trial played in front of the jury at the retrial and, over Williams\u2019s objection, the court granted the State\u2019s request. <em>Id. </em>at 684-86, 7 A.3d at 1046-47. The jury again found Williams guilty of first-degree murder, use of a handgun in the commission of a violent crime, and carrying a handgun. <em>Id. </em>at 686, 7 A.3d at 1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">After the Court of Special Appeals affirmed Williams\u2019s conviction, Williams sought, and we granted, a writ of certiorari to hear the case. <em>Williams v. State, </em>408 Md. 149, 968 A.2d 1064 (2009). Williams argued that the detective\u2019s failure to disclose the eyewitness\u2019s impairment until the retrial constituted another <em>Brady </em>violation, and the videotaped testimony should have been excluded from trial as inadmissible hearsay. <em>Williams, </em>416 Md. at 690, 7 A.3d at 1049. In relation to the hearsay argument, Williams asserted that the videotaped testimony failed as \u201cformer testimony\u201d because he did not have the chance at the first trial to cross-examine the deceased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>eyewitness about her visual impairment, <em>id., </em>7 A.3d at 1049, rendering the witness\u2019s former testimony inadmissible as failing the \u201copportunity\u201d prong of the Rule 5-804(b)(l) hearsay exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">We agreed with Williams that, \u201calthough [Williams] may have had an opportunity to cross-examine [the eyewitness] at the first trial, it was not an adequate one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697, 7 A.3d at 1054. We reasoned that an \u201copportunity\u201d is furnished when the defense receives \u201ca full and fair opportunity to probe and expose [the] infirmities [of the testimony] through the cross examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 696, 7 A.3d at 1053 (quoting <em>Salim, </em>855 F.2d at 954) (alterations in original). We reasoned that a visual impairment marked an infirmity in eyewitness testimony and Williams had not probed that infirmity because the detective failed to disclose it. <em>Id. </em>at 698, 7 A.3d at 1054 (\u201cwithout knowing [the eyewitness\u2019s] statement to the detective [about her impairment], [Williams] would have no reason to believe that she was \u2018legally blind.\u2019 \u201d). As a result, Williams was effectively estopped, by actions that were not his own, from probing and exposing an infirmity in the witness\u2019s testimony. We held that, because Williams was not afforded an opportunity to cross-examine, as mandated by Rule 8-504(b)(1), the witness\u2019s prior testimony was inadmissible hearsay. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 7 A.3d at 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Similarly here, Petitioner was not afforded an adequate opportunity to cross-examine McIntyre during the suppression hearing. The factual circumstances in this case give rise to a number of potential infirmities in McIntyre\u2019s testimony, including the accuracy of McIntyre\u2019s observations of the driver inside the getaway car and the veracity of McIntyre\u2019s identification in light of his attempted recantation. The suppression court, though, foreclosed defense counsel from asking questions about these infirmities at the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The court\u2019s exhortation, \u201cno depositions,\u201d communicated an effective restriction on the universe of questions available to Petitioner. That restriction was made explicit when the court directed Petitioner\u2019s counsel to \u201c[fjocus right on the suppres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>sion\u201d; when the court limited Petitioner\u2019s counsel to a single question testing McIntyre\u2019s ability to recall details; and when the Court commanded \u201c[c]ome on, let\u2019s go \u2014 now I do think it\u2019s fair to respect the State\u2019s objection and go to the photos.\u201d The court\u2019s restrictions prevented Petitioner\u2019s having a \u201cfull and fair opportunity\u201d to probe whether McIntyre was sincere in stating at the suppression hearing what he believed to be the truth, and whether McIntyre accurately perceived and recalled what he had seen of the driver of the getaway car. <em>See Salim, </em>855 F.2d at 954 (quoting <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 70-71, 100 S.Ct. 2531). Moreover, Petitioner could not \u201ccall[ ] to the attention of the factfinder [a] reasonf] for giving scant weight to the witness\u2019 testimony,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. at 22, 106 S.Ct. 292), because the suppression court\u2019s directions effectively prevented counsel from questioning McIntyre about his attempted recantation. -</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">We are not persuaded by the State\u2019s argument that the lack of opportunity was self-inflicted because Petitioner\u2019s counsel failed to ask questions about matters relevant to the identification procedure. The State urges that the limitations placed upon the proceeding by the suppression court \u201cdid not expressly or impliedly deny Dulyx the opportunity\u201d to ask about certain perception or credibility infirmities in McIntyre\u2019s testimony. Even if this were accurate (which it is not), perception and credibility, the two infirmities that relate directly to the reliability of a photo identification are not the only infirmities a defense counsel could probe through cross-examination at trial. At trial, Petitioner\u2019s counsel may have wished to cross-examine McIntyre not just on the reliability of his extrajudicial identification of Petitioner but also on his reliability as a witness, generally. For example, Petitioner\u2019s counsel may have wished to probe whether McIntyre possessed any potential bias or prejudice, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 5-616(a)(4), or explore McIntyre\u2019s character for untruthfulness, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 5-616(a)(6). Petitioner\u2019s counsel did not enjoy the opportunity to explore those infirmities at the suppression hearing. As we have said, save for allowing one question about McIntyre\u2019s description of the other two robbers, the suppression court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>limited counsel to questioning McIntyre about the conduct of the photo array procedure. <em>Cf. </em>Kenneth S. Broun, <em>McCormick On Evidence, </em>ch. 31 \u00a7 302, p. 346 (6th ed. 2006) (\u201c[Circumstances may differ sufficiently between the prior hearing and the present trial to bar admission under this requirement, as where questions on a particular subject would have been largely irrelevant at the earlier proceeding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">We hold that Petitioner did not enjoy an opportunity to develop McIntyre\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing commensurate with the requirement of Rule 5-804(b)(l). McIntyre\u2019s transcript testimony was inadmissible hearsay and should not have been accepted into evidence by the trial court. Our analysis of the claim does not end here, however, because the State argues that, even if admission of McIntyre\u2019s testimony was error, the error was harmless and thereby requires affirmance of the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">To determine whether the admission of McIntyre\u2019s suppression hearing testimony was harmless error, we adhere to our oft-cited rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">[Wjhen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoY\"><em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Petitioner\u2019s counsel pointed out in closing argument that \u201cthis case is about ... an ID connecting and placing [Petitioner] at the crime scene.\u201d There was no physical evidence in the case identifying Petitioner as the driver, nor was there a live eyewitness at trial able to identify Petitioner as the driver. Only McIntyre observed the driver of the getaway vehicle, so only his suppression hearing testimony, wrongly admitted at trial, provided the jury with a direct link <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>between Petitioner and the robbery and abduction. Because we cannot \u201cdeclare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict,\u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678, the erroneous admission of McIntyre\u2019s testimony was not harmless. Petitioner\u2019s convictions must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

The order in which evidence was presented at the suppression hearing was perhaps owing to the nature of the challenge McIntyre forwarded at the suppression hearing. We have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">[T]he inquiry for due process challenges to extra-judicial identifications is a two step inquiry. The first is whether the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive. If the answer is \"no,\u201d the inquiry ends and both the extra-judicial identification and the in-court identification are admissible at trial. If, on the other hand, the procedure was impermissibly suggestive, the second step is triggered, and the court must determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the identification was reliable. We pointed out in [a prior case] that in the context of a pre-trial photo identification, unless and until the defendant establishes that the identification procedure was in some way suggestive, the reliability of a witness' identification is not relevant for due process purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-8\"><em>Jones v. State, </em>395 Md. 97, 109-10, 909 A.2d 650, 657-58 (2006) (internal citations, quotation marks and footnote omitted). Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5N\">the burden is on the defendant to show, <em>prima facie, </em>that the pre-trial confrontation or viewing of photographs was illegal, and if he so shows, the burden shifts to the State to show by clear and convincing evidence that it was legal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the court finds that the State has met its burden and that the pre-trial confrontation or viewing was legal, an in-court identification by the witness present at the pre-trial confrontation or viewing is admissible as substantive evidence. And if such witness made a pre-trial identification, his testimony to that effect is so admissible. And, the testimony of a third party present when the pre-trial identification was made is so admissible provided the out-of-court declarant is at the trial and subject to cross-examination; whether or not he makes an in-court identification. If the court finds that the pre-trial confrontation or viewing was illegal, any and all evidence of the pre-trial identification is <em>per se </em>inadmissible. The burden is then on the State to establish that the in-court identification offered had a source independent of the illegal pre-trial confrontation or viewing. It must do this \"by clear and convincing evidence\u201d that the in-court identification is based \"upon observations of the suspect\u201d by the witness other than the confrontation or photographic identifications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 111, 990 A.2d at 658 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b310-9\">.

Although Petitioner\u2019s questions, as written, do not explicitly present a federal constitutional question, Petitioner nonetheless argues in his brief that the suppression court\u2019s admission of McIntyre's recorded testimony at trial violated Petitioner's Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him. We do not reach that issue because we resolve in Petitioner's favor his challenge to the admissibility of the suppression hearing testimony by application of the Maryland Rules. <em>See Parker </em>v. <em>State, </em>408 Md. 428, 435, 970 A.2d 320, 324-25 (2009) (\"[T]his Court has regularly adhered to the principle that we will not reach a constitutional issue when a case can properly be disposed of on a non-constitutional ground.\u201d) (quoting <em>State v.
