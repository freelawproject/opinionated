Because the Court in\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   gave significant instructions on how to analyze\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   claims, we reverse and remand for the district court to consider Jackson's claims in light of that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 1990, Jackson was convicted for the capital murder of Charles Colclasure and sentenced to life in prison. While serving his sentence, Jackson killed Scott Grimes, a prison guard with the Arkansas Department of Correction. In 1996, he was convicted for the capital murder of Grimes and sentenced to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2003, Jackson filed a petition pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   raising an\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   claim and asking that the court find him intellectually disabled and thus ineligible for the death penalty. Larry Norris, the former Director of the Arkansas Department of Correction, filed a motion for summary judgment claiming that Jackson's claim was procedurally defaulted and without merit. In 2007, the district court dismissed Jackson's claim as procedurally defaulted and denied Jackson's motion for a certificate of appealability. We granted Jackson a certificate of appealability on his\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   claim and reversed and remanded the matter to the district court.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Norris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=256%20Fed.%20Appx.%2012\">\n    256 Fed.Appx. 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (unpublished).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On remand, the district court ordered Jackson to respond to Norris's pre-appeal summary judgment motion. Jackson responded and filed a motion for discovery and funds to retain experts. In 2009, the district court granted Norris's motion for summary judgment and dismissed Jackson's\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   claim on the merits. Jackson again appealed, and we reversed and remanded, finding that Jackson was entitled to an\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   hearing.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Norris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3711302\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/959/\">\n    615 F.3d 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Upon remand, the district court granted Jackson's motion for discovery and funds to retain experts. The court conducted an evidentiary hearing and heard from two experts: Dr. James Moneypenny, Jackson's expert, and Dr. Gilbert S. Macvaugh, III, Kelly's expert. The district court issued a detailed opinion, walking through the several tests administered to Jackson throughout his lifetime and the facts surrounding Jackson's crimes and incarceration. The court decided that the DSM-V definition of intellectual disability was the appropriate standard to use to determine whether Jackson was intellectually disabled. After parsing the DSM-V standard and the evidence presented at the hearing, the district court decided to credit Dr. Macvaugh's clinical opinion and found that Jackson was not intellectually disabled. Jackson now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Jackson essentially makes two arguments on appeal. First, he argues the district court erred in analyzing \u00a7 5-4-618(a) when it determined that he is not intellectually disabled. Second, he contends the district court erred in applying the DSM-V's\n   intellectual disability standard rather than the DSM-IV's because the DSM-V was not published at the time of his hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    A. Intellectual Disability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Jackson argues that the district court erred in finding that he was not intellectually disabled and is therefore eligible for the death penalty. \"The legal standard applicable to an\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   claim presents a pure question of law, which we review de novo. Whether an individual is mentally retarded under the applicable legal standard, however, is a pure question of fact, which we review for clear error.\"\n   <em>\n    Sasser v.

The district court did not find that any of the IQ tests administered to Jackson before he was 18 were invalid. The court mentions the standard error of measurement in its order, but it does not specifically state that Jackson's previous tests, which respectively resulted in IQ scores of 72, 73, 74, and 81, should be adjusted for the standard error of measurement. Because the standard error of measurement is plus or minus 5 points, Jackson's adjusted range for his scores shows the possibility that his IQ could fall below 70.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707004,12580884\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1986/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 1995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Though the district court did not specifically adjust Jackson's previous IQ scores according to the standard error of measurement, it appears to have followed the Supreme Court's directive in\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   that additional evidence of intellectual disability is required for scores that fall within the standard error of measurement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707004,12580884\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1986/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707004,12580884\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1986/\">\n    at 2001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

DSM-V,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 2, at 33. The DSM-V states that deficits in only one of the three adaptive-skills domains is sufficient to show adaptive deficits.\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602607\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1039/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1050 (citing DSM-V,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 2, at 33, 38). The district court adopted the DSM-V's definition of intellectual disability and emphasized the explanatory text stating that \"the deficits in adaptive functioning must be directly related to the intellectual impairments.\" DSM-V,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 2, at 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court provided extensive direction on analyzing the adaptive functioning prong. Citing the diagnostic guidelines, the Supreme Court stated that the medical community focuses on adaptive\n   <em>\n    deficits\n   </em>\n   to determine intellectual disability and that significant limitations in adaptive skills are not outweighed by potential strengths in other adaptive skills.\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602607\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1039/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1050 (citing AAIDD,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 47, and DSM-V,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 2, at 33, 38) (finding that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overemphasized the defendant's perceived adaptive strengths when it found that evidence of\n   the defendant's adaptive strengths overcame considerable objective evidence of his deficits). Moreover, the Supreme Court cautioned against relying too heavily on adaptive strengths developed in controlled settings such as prisons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Here, the district court found that Jackson has, at the very least, intellectual deficits. Intellectual deficits would fall under the category of conceptual adaptive skills. DSM-V,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 2, at 37 (\"The\n   <em>\n    conceptual (academic) domain\n   </em>\n   involves competence in memory, language, reading, writing, math reasoning, acquisition of practical knowledge, problem solving, and judgment in novel situations, among others.\"). However, the court held that these deficits were not directly related to intellectual impairments because Jackson also exhibited adaptive functioning strengths. Throughout the order, the district court relied heavily on Jackson's perceived adaptive functioning strengths rather than his deficits, citing to evidence that Jackson: could drive a car; has filed pro se lawsuits while in prison; has filed intra-prison grievances; has submitted commissary and law library requests; can recall information about these lawsuits and requests; has used vocabulary that is generally inconsistent with intellectual disabilities; has asked Dr. Macvaugh several questions about his qualifications and the tests he was administering; and, to get around a prohibition on inmate correspondence with other inmates, utilized a complex method of letter delivery. Furthermore, almost all of the skills that the district court appears to have given significant weight are those that Jackson may have developed in prison, which, according to\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   and the DSM-V, should not be heavily relied upon.\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602607\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1039/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1050 ; DSM-V,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 2, at 38. Thus, the district court, like the court of appeals in\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , inappropriately found that Jackson was not intellectually disabled because his adaptive strengths outweighed his adaptive deficits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Furthermore, the Supreme Court also found in\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   that \"[t]he existence of a personality disorder or mental-health issue, in short, is not evidence that a person does not also have intellectual disability.\"\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602607\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1039/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted) (finding that the court of appeals erred when it used academic failure and childhood abuse to detract from a determination that the defendant's intellectual and adaptive behaviors were related);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, prior to issuing it's order, the district court did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court's finding that the existence of additional personality disorders or mental-health issues is not evidence weighing against an intellectual disability determination. In light of the Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , we believe the district court erred by placing too much emphasis on the existence of other diagnosed disorders to find that Jackson was not intellectually disabled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The court also tried to bolster its adaptive functioning analysis by comparing Jackson's conduct in his underlying crimes to the Supreme Court's justifications in\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   for exempting intellectually disabled persons from execution. In finding that intellectually disabled offenders were ineligible for the death penalty, the Supreme Court explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Mentally retarded persons frequently know the difference between right and wrong and are competent to stand trial. Because of their impairments, however, by definition they have diminished capacities to understand and process information, to communicate, to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses, and to understand the reactions of others. There is no evidence that they are more likely to engage in criminal conduct than others, but there is abundant evidence that they often act on impulse rather than pursuant to a premeditated plan, and that in group settings they are followers rather than leaders. Their deficiencies do not warrant an exemption from criminal sanctions, but they do diminish their personal culpability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255406\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/304/#p321\">\n    536 U.S. at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255406\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/304/#p321\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Tennard v. Dretke\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court stated that \"impaired intellectual functioning is inherently mitigating....

Relying on Jackson's strengths as displayed in those crimes, the court found that his actions did not align with the justifications for exempting mentally disabled persons from the death penalty, thereby proving he is not intellectually disabled. By analyzing Jackson's crimes in light of the\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   justifications, the district court has essentially required Jackson to prove that there was a nexus between his mental capacity and his crime-i.e., that his criminal conduct reflected his mental disability. However, it is not necessary for Jackson's crime to be related to his intellectual disability: it is only necessary for Jackson to actually be intellectually disabled to be exempt from the death penalty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255406\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/304/#p321\">\n    536 U.S. at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255406\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/304/#p321\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That Jackson's potential adaptive strengths were used to commit these crimes does not mean that adaptive deficits related to subaverage intellectual functioning do not exist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602607\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1039/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Again, the district court balanced Jackson's strengths against his deficiencies to find that he was not intellectually disabled, which, subsequent to the district court's order in this case, the Supreme Court has directed courts not do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602607\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1039/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Furthermore, we are given pause because Kelley's own expert, Dr. Macvaugh, who the district court credits, gave a clinical opinion but refused to give a forensic opinion on intellectual disability, stating in the hearing that if Jackson \"has mental retardation, it's not by much. If he doesn't have it, it's not by much.\" R. at 295. The indecisiveness of Kelley's expert, coupled with the district court's brief reference to Jackson's deficits but heavy emphasis on his strengths, is concerning. Accordingly, we find that the district court committed clear error in finding Jackson's adaptive behavior deficits were not related to subaverage intellectual functioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Manifestation No Later Than 18\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The third criterion in \u00a7 5-4-618(a) and the DSM-V is that both subaverage general\n   intellectual functioning and a significant deficit or impairment in adaptive functioning manifested no later than age 18. \u00a7 5-4-618(a) ; DSM-V,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 2, at 33. The parties agree and the district court found that the third prong requiring deficits to be present before Jackson turned 18 was satisfied. The evidence presented at the hearing-Jackson's childhood IQ scores, reports from his schools and other institutions about his behavioral issues, and testimony from both experts-shows that Jackson fell within the standard error of measurement for subaverage intellectual functioning and demonstrated adaptive functioning deficits prior to the age of 18. Thus, we find that the district court did not clearly err in determining that this factor was satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Deficit in Adaptive Behaviors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The final factor in \u00a7 5-4-618(a) is a deficit in adaptive behaviors. In\n   <em>\n    Sasser\n   </em>\n   , this Court found that although the DSM-IV does not have a fourth prong, \"Arkansas's mental retardation standard ... is fully consistent with nationally accepted diagnostic criteria. The fourth prong largely duplicates the second prong, but places no age requirement on the evidence used to establish limitations in adaptive behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    Sasser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3721289\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/833/#p841\">\n    735 F.3d at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the same evidence used to prove the second prong is used to prove the fourth prong. As a result, our same analysis under the second prong applies to the fourth prong. For the reasons stated above, we hold that the district court clearly erred in finding that Jackson's adaptive behavior deficits were not related to subaverage intellectual functioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    B. Application of the DSM-V Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Jackson next argues that the district court erred when it applied the DSM-V rather than the DSM-IV standard for intellectual disability. At the time the\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   hearing took place, the DSM-IV was the most recent version of the APA's diagnostic manual. The DSM-IV contained no specific requirement that an individual's adaptive behavior deficits be caused by that person's subaverage intellectual functioning. DSM-IV,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 3, at 39-49. Dr. Macvaugh testified that he could not be sure that Jackson's deficits were due to subaverage intellectual functioning and that he believed the medical field is not clear about whether the adaptive deficits have to be caused by subaverage intellectual functioning. R. at 356.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The DSM-V was published after Jackson's\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   hearing. Though it does not specify the need for a direct relationship between adaptive deficits and subaverage intellectual functioning in the diagnostic criteria, the explanatory text states that \"[t]o meet diagnostic criteria for intellectual disability, the deficits in adaptive functioning must be directly related to the intellectual impairments described in [prong one].\" DSM-V,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 2, at 38. The district court decided to adopt the DSM-V's standard and found that Jackson had shown intellectual deficits and that both experts had identified adaptive deficits in a number of areas. However, the court also found Jackson failed to show that those deficits were directly related to subaverage intellectual functioning. Jackson argues that the application of the DSM-V standard is inappropriate because that is not the standard under which the parties argued the case. Thus, he claims he was not on notice that he needed to present evidence of a direct connection between his adaptive behavior deficits and his subaverage intellectual functioning. Accordingly, Jackson requests that we remand the case and allow him to present evidence on this connection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals' finding that the state habeas court erred when it applied the most recent medical guidelines to determine intellectual disability rather than the 1992 guidelines that the court of appeals had adopted in a previous case.\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602607\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1039/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court's decision in \"\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   indicate[s] that being informed by the medical community does not demand adherence to everything stated in the latest medical guide.

Accordingly, we find it was not error for the district court to apply the DSM-V standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   However, we also find that there is no material difference between the DSM-V standard and the DSM-IV with regard to the connection between subaverage intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior deficits. Though the DSM-V's language may appear to create a heightened standard, it is actually \"claryif[ying] the most logical approach to a diagnosis of intellectual disability.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Wilson\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [t]he court assumes that a clinician would not diagnose intellectual disability on the basis of adaptive functioning deficits that were related to something else entirely, such as a physical disability or traumatic event.

The court recognized that Jackson has adaptive behavior deficits, but it heavily emphasized Dr.\n   Macvaugh's testimony that he was unable to determine whether Jackson's adaptive behavior deficits were due to subaverage intellectual functioning or another condition.

Jackson is not required to demonstrate a specific connection between subaverage intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior deficits. Rather, he must show only that deficits related to intellectual functioning exist. Furthermore, as discussed earlier, Jackson's other diagnoses are frequently co-occurring with intellectual disability,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DSM-V,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   note 2, at 40, and Jackson is not required to exclude those disorders as causes of his adaptive behavior deficits,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343713\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/170/347/#p371\">\n    170 F.Supp.3d at 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
