St. Pierre's class action complaint, we consider a matter of first impression among the Courts of Appeals: whether unpaid highway tolls constitute the type of \"debt\" that could support a consumer claim under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Because we conclude they do not, we will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   St. Pierre is a New Jersey resident and the registered owner of a car that he sometimes drives on New Jersey highways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On those occasions, he is subject to New Jersey's statutory toll requirements, including that \"[n]o vehicle shall be permitted to make use of any highway project or part thereof operated by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority [ (\"Authority\") ] ... except upon the payment of such tolls, if any, as may from time to time be prescribed by the Authority,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.J.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027%3A23-25\">\n    N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 27:23-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that the owner of the vehicle is liable for the payment of highway tolls even if \"such vehicle was used or operated\" by someone other than the owner,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.J.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027%3A23-25\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27:23-34.2(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Like many car owners in New Jersey, St. Pierre chose to sign up for New Jersey E-ZPass (\"E-ZPass\"), an electronic toll payment program that facilitates toll collection. E-ZPass accountholders agree to certain terms and conditions (the \"E-ZPass Contract\"), including that they maintain a positive balance in a prepaid E-ZPass account from which the toll fare is automatically deducted when they pass through an E-ZPass lane and that their \"failure to pay charges posted to [their] [a]ccount, including tolls, may result in additional penalties as provided by law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   JA 66. When St. Pierre's E-ZPass account fell into arrears because he failed to maintain a positive balance, E-ZPass assigned it to Appellee Retrieval-Masters Credit Bureau, Inc. (\"RMCB\"), a private debt collection agency, which, in turn, sent St. Pierre a collection letter \"for outstanding violations owed for toll evasions in the amount of $1,200.75.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   JA 70. At issue in this case, however, is not the letter itself but the envelope in which the letter was sent. Visible through the glassine window of that envelope was not only St. Pierre's name and address, but also a \"quick response\" code\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and St. Pierre's account number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   St. Pierre's amended class action complaint alleges that the disclosure of these\n   two pieces of information on the envelope violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692a - 1692p, which prohibits the use of any \"unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.J.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027%3A23-25\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1692f, including \"any language or symbol, other than the debt collector's address, on any envelope when communicating with a consumer by use of the mails,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.J.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027%3A23-25\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1692f(8). That prohibition, however, applies only to the collection of a \"debt,\" which the FDCPA defines as an \"obligation ... of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction in which the money, property, insurance, or services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.J.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027%3A23-25\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1692a(5). And there lies the crux of this appeal: Do unpaid highway tolls reflect a consumer's \"obligation ... arising out of a transaction in which the ... services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.J.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027%3A23-25\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , or a legal obligation in the nature of a tax that falls outside the scope of the FDCPA?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The District Court concluded the latter. Although it held as a threshold matter that St. Pierre had alleged an injury sufficiently \"concrete\" to confer Article III standing and, by extension, federal jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    St. Pierre v. Retrieval-Masters Creditors Bureau, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-cv-2596,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201102635\">\n    2017 WL 1102635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (D.N.J.

Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To establish standing, St. Pierre must allege facts demonstrating that he suffered (1) an injury-in-fact; (2) that is fairly traceable to the defendant's challenged conduct; and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\n   <em>\n    Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p590\">\n    504 U.S. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 590,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p590\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p590\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). RMBC argues that St. Pierre failed to make that showing because he alleged only a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   procedural violation of\n   the FDCPA and not an injury-in-fact. Although we previously held in\n   <em>\n    Douglass v.

It does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court provided a lens through which to determine whether an intangible injury is sufficiently \"concrete and particularized\" and \"actual or imminent\" to qualify as an injury-in-fact.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We first ask \"whether an alleged intangible harm has a close relationship to a harm that has traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American Courts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/\">\n    at 1549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If so, it is likely to satisfy the injury-in-fact element of standing; if not, we next ask whether Congress has expressed an intent to make an injury redressable by \"elevat[ing] [it] to the status of [a] legally cognizable injur[y]\" even if that injury was previously inadequate in law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here too, if Congress expressed such an intent, the injury is likely to satisfy Article III. Thus, while \"a bare procedural violation, divorced from any concrete harm\" will not suffice, \"the violation of a procedural right granted by statute can be sufficient in some circumstances to constitute injury in fact. In other words, a plaintiff in such a case need not allege any\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   harm beyond the one Congress has identified.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As we recently observed in\n   <em>\n    In re Horizon Healthcare Servs. Inc.

Rather, the public nature of the construction, maintenance, or operations of highways steers the obligation away from a \"debt\" and towards the tax obligations in\n   <em>\n    Staub\n   </em>\n   , which, as we observed there, were not primarily personal because they were \"used for more general purposes.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651498\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/626/275/\">\n    626 F.2d at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Moreover, the fact that highway tolls resemble taxes-while not a sufficient basis on which to conclude they do not arise out of a \"transaction\" at the first stage of our inquiry-does at this step reinforce the conclusion that the services rendered are not primarily for personal purposes.

And just as the amount paid in taxes does not entitle an individual taxpayer to \"better\" parks, schools, or government systems, the amount paid in tolls does not entitle the payor to better maintenance or construction of highways.

Appellant's Br. 20-21. That argument, however, mistakenly conflates two distinct inquiries: whether, subjectively,\n   an individual chooses to enter into the transaction primarily for his own personal purposes, and whether, objectively, the subject of the transaction-that is, \"the money, property, insurance, or services\" being rendered, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(5) -is primarily for personal purposes. While in some cases, the two will be aligned, as in the case of utilities,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pollice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232111\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/225/379/\">\n    225 F.3d at 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , they are not where the subject of the transaction is the rendition of services that benefit the public generally. And here, even accepting that road access could be considered a good or service in exchange for toll payments-and not merely an opportunity for toll collection-the other, far more significant services rendered by the Authority in exchange for highway tolls are the public services that follow from its statutory mandate, funded through tolls, \"to acquire, construct, maintain, improve, manage, repair and operate transportation projects.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.J.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027%3A23-1\">\n    N.J.
