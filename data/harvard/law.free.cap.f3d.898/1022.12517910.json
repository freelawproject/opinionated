He planned to drive fifteen miles along a curvy mountain road to his campsite in Yosemite National Park. Bystanders saw him stagger and stumble while heading to his vehicle. They tried to persuade him not to drive and even parked behind his vehicle. A National Park Service ranger came to the scene and arrested Nature for being dangerously under the influence of alcohol in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2034.5\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 34.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(21).

Located in a part of the Code of Federal Regulations titled \"El Portal Administrative Site Regulations,\" it provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The following sections and paragraphs of this chapter, as amended from time to time, apply to the administrative site and are hereby incorporated and made a part of this part except as modified by the regulations in this part:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   .....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (b) Resource Protection, Public Use and Recreation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   .....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (21) 2.35 Alcoholic beverages and controlled substances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   .....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2034.5\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 34.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(21). The regulation applies to \"all persons ... within the boundaries of the El Portal Administrative Site.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2034.2\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 34.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2034.4\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 34.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining \"administrative site\"). Nature was in the El Portal Administrative Site (the Site) at the time of his arrest. The Site is \"adjacent to,\" but \"outside\" of, Yosemite National Park. 16 U.S.C \u00a7 47-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Section 2.35, the regulation incorporated by reference, prohibits \"[p]resence\n   <em>\n    in a park area\n   </em>\n   when under the influence of alcohol ... to a degree that may endanger oneself or another person, or damage property or park resources.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.35\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (emphasis added). We refer to it as the dangerous-drinking-prohibition. Nature does not dispute that he was under the influence of alcohol to a degree that may have endangered others. Rather, he argues that the Site is not a \"park area,\" and therefore the dangerous-drinking-prohibition did not apply to his conduct at the Site. The government, however, urges us to hold that the Site is a \"park area\" because the term, in the government's view, includes any land that \"supports the [Service's] mission\" of preservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We begin with the text of the regulations. The regulations define the term \"park area\" as synonymous with the term \"National Park System.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.4\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The term \"National Park System\" means \"any area of land ... now or hereafter administered by the ... National Park Service for park, monument, historic, parkway, recreational, or other purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nature does not dispute that the National Park Service (the Service) administers the Site, but argues that it does not do so \"for park, monument, historic, parkway, recreational, or other purposes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The district court held that the definition of \"park area\" encompassed the Site, but did not explain which part of the definition the Site satisfied, presumably land administered for either a \"park purpose\" or an \"other purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Nature v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274228\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/250/634/#p640\">\n    250 F.Supp.3d 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 640 (E.D. Cal. 2017). We need not decide whether the Site is a \"park area\" because, even assuming without deciding that it is not, the dangerous-drinking-prohibition nonetheless applies to the Site. As discussed above, section 34.5 purports to make the dangerous-drinking-prohibition applicable to the Site. It states, \"The following sections and paragraphs of this chapter ... apply to the administrative site and are hereby incorporated and made a part of this part ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2034.5\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 34.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We hold that this language incorporates the dangerous-drinking-prohibition\n   <em>\n    mutatis mutandis\n   </em>\n   , meaning with the necessary changes to make it applicable to the Site.\n   <em>\n    See mutatis mutandis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1177 (10th ed. 2014);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shalala v.

Put simply, even if the Site is not a \"park area,\" the prohibition applies to the Site as if it were.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This reading makes sense because otherwise some cross-references in section 34.5 would have no consequence. The dangerous-drinking-prohibition in section 2.35 and other cross-referenced regulations apply exclusively, or nearly so, to \"park areas.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.35\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202.2\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (wildlife protection), 2.31 (trespassing); 2.50 (special events). For example, the cross-reference to fishing restrictions makes applicable subsections (a) and (c) specifically and those subsections\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   apply to \"park areas.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.3\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (c). If the Site were not a \"park area\" and we did not read the regulation\n   <em>\n    mutatis mutandis\n   </em>\n   , these cross-references would make applicable to the Site a regulation that by its terms could never apply. This cannot be the correct reading. We construe regulations, like statutes, to give effect to every word when possible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duncan v. Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312991\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/167/#p174\">\n    533 U.S. 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 174,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312991\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/167/#p174\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312991\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/167/#p174\">\n    150 L.Ed.2d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001).
