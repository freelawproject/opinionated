He returned to work following his injury but he eventually required surgery, which he underwent in 2004. Christie now asks us to decide if he is entitled to permanent total disability benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20901\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 50 (the \"Act\"), because of his work-related injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties do not contest that following his surgery, Christie faced physical limitations, and Georgia-Pacific reassigned Christie to less physically demanding safety inspection work sometime in 2006. In late 2010, Christie learned that the option to take early retirement would likely no longer exist beginning in January of 2011. Since Christie was still years away from reaching the retirement age of 62, in December of 2010 he decided to retire early and accepted an 18-percent reduction in monthly pension payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Years after he retired, Christie sought permanent total disability benefits as permitted by the Act. The administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") who considered Christie's claim awarded Christie permanent total disability benefits. Georgia-Pacific appealed the ALJ's decision to the United States Department of Labor's Benefits Review Board (\"Board\"), which reversed the award of benefits. Christie subsequently appealed to our court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To determine Christie's eligibility for benefits, we interpret the language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20902\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10), which defines \"disability\" under the Act. In particular, we consider whether Christie's decision to retire early prevents him from receiving permanent total disability benefits. After reviewing the plain language of \u00a7 902(10), we hold that Christie's decision to retire early does not make him ineligible for benefits. Our conclusion is in accord with a recent Fourth Circuit decision also interpreting \u00a7 902(10). Accordingly, we grant Christie's petition, and we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1986, Christie began working for Georgia-Pacific in Portland, Oregon. Thirteen years later, Christie injured his back at work while moving bags of concrete. Although Christie returned to work following his injury, he eventually required surgery, which was performed in January of 2004. It is undisputed that Christie's back injury is a work-related injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2006, Georgia-Pacific assigned Christie to safety inspection duties in part to accommodate his physical limitations from his back injury. As safety inspector, Christie was responsible for inspecting three Portland warehouses, which involved both active and sedentary tasks. Among other things, Christie created labels for materials in the warehouses detailing the contents and locations of items and who last inspected them. He also performed physical inspections, such as inspecting fire extinguishers, which sometimes involved lifting them. Due to his physical limitations, Christie had difficulty performing some of his job duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In late 2010, Christie learned from his labor union's director that Georgia-Pacific was likely eliminating early retirement in 2011. Under the early retirement option available to Christie in 2010, Christie could choose to retire after age 55 and accept a penalty reducing his monthly payments by 18 percent. Christie knew that without the early retirement option, he was ineligible for retirement income until age 62. Because Christie, then 56, believed he would be unable to continue working for another six years due to his physical limitations, he decided to retire early, effective December 1, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After Christie retired, several doctors evaluated him for multi-level back fusion surgery. Once the doctors determined that Christie should first pursue other treatment options before undergoing surgery, he began conservative pain treatment in May of 2012. By November of 2012, the doctor providing Christie with pain treatment believed Christie had reached his maximum medical improvement, meaning the injury had healed to the fullest extent possible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stevens v. Dir., Office of Workers' Comp. Programs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541306\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/909/1256/#p1257\">\n    909 F.2d 1256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1257 (9th Cir. 1990). Christie's pain doctor also opined that Christie could not return to his regular job and was permanently restricted from several physical activities as of December 3, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Eventually, because of his physical limitations and inability to work, Christie filed a claim seeking permanent total disability benefits under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The ALJ held a hearing; heard testimony; reviewed the evidence presented, including Christie's medical records; and concluded that Christie was entitled to permanent total disability benefits. The ALJ ordered Georgia-Pacific to pay Christie these benefits from December 3, 2012 onward, because that was the date on which, according to the ALJ and based on the medical opinions in the record, Christie\n   became disabled. In so ordering, the ALJ found that Christie was not disabled at the time he retired in December of 2010. However, the ALJ also determined that Christie's decision to retire did not bar Christie from receiving permanent total disability benefits because Christie's retirement was involuntary. Distinguishing Christie's case from other Board case law, the ALJ found that Christie did not retire \"solely\" because the early retirement package that he would receive was financially beneficial or a \"good deal.\" Instead, the ALJ determined that Christie \"testified credibly that he retired, at least in part, because he believed his back problems would not allow him to work until the full retirement age of 62, and he feared losing the ability to retire early.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On administrative appeal, the Board disagreed with the ALJ's conclusion.

According to the Board, \"[t]he only relevant inquiry [in determining disability under the Act] is whether claimant's work injury caused a loss of earning capacity.\" The Board answered this question by concluding that because Christie voluntarily retired, he was not disabled within the meaning of \u00a7 902(10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In its decision reversing the ALJ's award of benefits, the Board relied heavily on its decision in\n   <em>\n    Moody I\n   </em>\n   , and stated that Christie's case was \"not legally distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Moody\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   ].\" In\n   <em>\n    Moody I\n   </em>\n   , claimant Russell Moody had sought temporary total disability benefits.\n   <em>\n    Moody I\n   </em>\n   , 50 Ben.

There, the ALJ had awarded Moody temporary total disability benefits because the ALJ found that Moody's retirement prior to the time of his surgery was irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. In reversing the ALJ's benefit award, the Board concluded that the disability inquiry under \u00a7 902(10) of the Act, which defines disability for purposes of the Act, \"encompasses both physical and economic considerations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board reasoned that Moody's decision to retire \"had already resulted in his complete loss of earning capacity\" and Moody was therefore not disabled within the meaning of the Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.

Rather, \u00a7 902(10) states that disability under the Act means an inability, resulting from an injury suffered at work, to earn the wages an employee was earning from his employer at the time he was injured. Nowhere in \u00a7 902(10) is an employee's decision to retire mentioned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Indeed, the Board's reading of \u00a7 902(10) assumes that retirement categorically results in a person's incapacity to work. Yet, the language of \u00a7 902(10) does not give any indication that retirement is to be treated in that manner. Neither is it the case that retirement, in all instances, means that a retiree is incapable of working. Retirement simply means that a person is no longer working a particular job. In short, although retirement and incapacity to work may be linked, they are not necessarily one and the same.

Although the Board and Georgia-Pacific highlight that Christie was capable of working as a safety inspector at Georgia-Pacific with suitable accommodations at the time he retired, substantial evidence supports the ALJ's finding that Georgia-Pacific never actually offered these accommodations to Christie. Indeed, the ALJ concluded that no one at Georgia-Pacific told Christie that Christie could ask for help with conducting the physical inspections of the warehouses that were part of Christie's work tasks. In addition, the ALJ found that Georgia-Pacific had not documented any accommodations the company made for Christie. Georgia-Pacific therefore \"fail[ed] to establish the availability of suitable alternative employment\" because it failed to offer Christie a job that accounts for his physical limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gen.
