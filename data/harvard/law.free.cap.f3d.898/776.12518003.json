The assignment of these codes is the key component in determining an employer's rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When an employer buys a policy on the residual market, it pays an estimated premium upfront. The insurer then calculates the exact amount due from the employer at the end of the term based on the amount of work performed by employees in each of the various code classifications. If the employer's payroll involves more high-risk work than initially estimated, its actual premium at the end of the term will be higher than its estimated premium, so it will owe more to the insurer. When an insurer and employer disagree about the classification of work, they can resolve their dispute before an administrative panel, Missouri's Workers' Compensation Determinations Review Board (the \"Board\"), which has the power to modify code-classification determinations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20287.335\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 287.335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). Missouri law additionally provides a right to appeal the Board's decision to the Director of the Missouri Department of Insurance (the \"Director\"),\n   who may also correct erroneous code-classification determinations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20287.335\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This dispute involves a workers' compensation policy sold by Travelers Property Casualty Insurance Company of America to Jet Midwest Technik, Inc. on Missouri's residual market. During the policy term, Travelers disputed some of the code classifications in Jet Midwest's policy application and demanded a higher premium. It did so based on an audit that allegedly revealed that Jet Midwest, which paints commercial-sized aircraft, had failed to accurately report some of its work. In particular, Travelers believed that Jet Midwest underreported the time its employees spent painting metal structures over two stories in height, which is in a higher risk category than the code classification assigned to the work by Jet Midwest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Jet Midwest refused to pay the higher premium, prompting Travelers to cancel the policy. Travelers then issued a final bill, which Jet Midwest has paid only in part. Jet Midwest has vigorously disputed its responsibility for the remainder and filed an application with the Board to resolve the parties' code-classification dispute. The Board agreed with Travelers that Jet Midwest had misclassified some of the tasks it had workers perform, but not to the extent that Travelers had thought. The Board advised the parties that they could appeal the decision, but neither did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Travelers instead filed this lawsuit against Jet Midwest, invoking diversity jurisdiction and alleging state-law claims for breach of contract and account stated. Following discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Travelers requested summary judgment on its breach-of-contract claim. Jet Midwest sought partial summary judgment precluding Travelers from relitigating the issues that the Board had already decided. The district court, for its part, adopted a different approach and dismissed the case based on Travelers' failure to fully exhaust its administrative remedies. It then denied the parties' competing summary-judgment motions as moot. Travelers argues on appeal that it had no obligation to exhaust its administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At issue here is the scope of Missouri's exhaustion requirement. Missouri law requires parties to exhaust their administrative remedies in certain types of cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green v. City of St. Louis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10016975\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/870/794/#p796\">\n    870 S.W.2d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 796 (Mo. 1994). To fully exhaust, a party must complete \"every step\" of the administrative process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parker v. City of Saint Joseph\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936040\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/167/219/#p221\">\n    167 S.W.3d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 221 (Mo. Ct. App. 2005). Failing to do so may preclude \"judicial review of the [agency's] determination,\" although \"nothing prevents\" a party from raising any other claims or defenses that the agency did not resolve.\n   <em>\n    Impey v. Mo. Ethics Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6906347\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/442/42/#p48\">\n    442 S.W.3d 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48 (Mo. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Until recently, the applicability of the exhaustion requirement depended on whether a case was \"contested\" or \"non-contested.\" These terms do not mean what they seem. They describe the degree of formality of the administrative procedures available, not the vigor of the parties' disagreement or the extent to which they have actively litigated the dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Valley Park v. Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8166039\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/273/504/#p506\">\n    273 S.W.3d 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 506 (Mo. 2009). As a class, contested cases provide the parties with \"a measure of procedural formality,\" including \"notice of the issues; oral evidence taken upon oath or affirmation and the cross-examination of witnesses; the making of a record; adherence to evidentiary rules; and written decisions including findings of fact and conclusions of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8166039\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/273/504/#p506\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8166039\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/273/504/#p506\">\n    at 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal\n   quotation marks and citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20536.010\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 536.010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4) (requiring a \"hearing\" for a case to qualify as contested). The same types of procedural protections are not available in non-contested cases; there is often no hearing or formal presentation of evidence and there may be no record available for a court to review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Furlong Cos. v.

June 12, 2018). If the case is non-contested, as Travelers argues, then reversal is required because, under the law applicable to this case, Travelers did not need to exhaust its administrative remedies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robison\n   </em>\n   , --- S.W.3d at ---- - ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202927735\">\n    2018 WL 2927735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Although Missouri has decades of precedent on how to distinguish contested from non-contested cases, the categorization of the proceedings in this case presents a question of first impression.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even so, categorizing the Board's proceedings is not difficult. After all, nothing in the statute establishing the Board and defining its authority requires it to follow any procedures in making a decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20287.335\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 287.335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The parties are not required to appear or present oral evidence, and the absence of witnesses and the formal presentation of evidence eliminates the need for cross-examination and evidentiary rules. And although the Board issued a written decision in this case, nothing in the statute required it to do so. In short, the Board's proceedings are non-contested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   But we are not done. Even if the first stage of an administrative process is non-contested, the process as a whole can still qualify as contested if adequate procedures are available on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nowden v. Div. of Alcohol &amp; Tobacco Control\n   </em>\n   , No. SC 96496, --- S.W.3d ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202927729\">\n    2018 WL 2927729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Mo.
