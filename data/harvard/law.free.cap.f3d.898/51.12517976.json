Concluding that the frequent recurrence of prosecutorial missteps in that office \"raise[d] questions regarding whether the errors are fairly characterized as unintentional,\" the Fourth Circuit took the extraordinary step of referring the matter to the United States Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility (\"OPR\") for further investigation of the allegations of professional misconduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697403\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/327/#p343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697403\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/327/#p343\">\n    at 342-343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After Bartko was convicted in a case beset by prosecutorial misfeasance, he filed multiple Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") requests with OPR and other relevant agencies seeking to learn the results of investigations into Wheeler.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   OPR categorically refused to acknowledge the existence of, let alone disclose, any potentially relevant documents outside of Bartko's individual case. And even with respect to Wheeler's conduct in Bartko's case, OPR held back substantial amounts of material, asserting a sweeping breadth for its claimed exemptions. Because circuit precedent foreclosed OPR's approach, and because OPR failed to justify multiple withholdings, we reverse the district court's judgment in favor of OPR with respect to its invocations of Exemption 7(C), and the district court's decision to deny a fee waiver to Bartko. We also remand with instructions for the district court to reconsider its decision with respect to the FBI's withholding of\n   records pursuant to Exemption 3 in light of recent circuit precedent.

Gregory Bartko was an Atlanta-based securities lawyer, investment banker, and broker. In the early 2000s, he created and managed two private equity funds, the Caledonian Fund and the Capstone Fund. Over the next half-decade, Bartko fleeced investors out of more than a million dollars under the false pretense that their investments were fully insured with a guaranteed return. Bartko's luck ran out when the Securities and Exchange Commission caught wind of the scam and began to examine the Caledonian and Capstone Funds. The ensuing investigation resulted in a criminal prosecution by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina. The then-Chief of the Economic Crimes Section, Assistant U.S. Attorney Clay Wheeler, prosecuted Bartko for (i) conspiracy to commit mail fraud and to engage in unlawful monetary transactions in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (ii) mail fraud in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201341\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1342 ; and (iii) the sale of unregistered securities in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77e, 77x, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After a thirteen-day trial, a jury convicted Bartko on all counts. In 2010, Bartko was sentenced to 272 months of imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bartko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697403\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/327/#p343\">\n    728 F.3d at 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 334 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gregory Bartko v.

In addition, the prosecution allowed a government witness (Bartko's co-conspirator) to testify falsely that he had not received any inducement from the government in exchange for his testimony, even though the government actually had made promises to him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Napue v.

The district court denied Bartko's motion. The Fourth Circuit affirmed on the narrow ground that the undisclosed evidence and witness testimony was cumulative of the overwhelming untainted evidence, and so the governmental missteps would not have affected the final outcome of the trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bartko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697403\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/327/#p343\">\n    728 F.3d at 331-332, 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   But the court of appeals did not end its decision there. Pointing to a slew of disturbing recent cases, the court specifically noted the \"frequency of the [discovery] 'flubs' committed\" by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina, which \"raise[d] questions regarding whether the errors [we]re fairly characterized as unintentional.\"\n   <em>\n    Bartko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697403\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/327/#p343\">\n    728 F.3d at 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With respect to Bartko's case in particular, the court expressed deep skepticism about counsel's \"farfetched assertion\" when asked about the misbehavior.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697403\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/327/#p343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697403\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/327/#p343\">\n    at 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court also worried that \"[r]emedies elude\" individual defendants because egregious violations \"ultimately prove immaterial to the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Bartko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697403\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/327/#p343\">\n    728 F.3d at 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The frequent affirmance of criminal convictions on that basis, the court explained, causes the government to believe that it can withhold with impunity material that it is constitutionally required to disclose. Just because \"such practices [may be] 'harmless' as to a specific defendant's verdict,\" the court continued, \"they are anything but harmless\" for \"litigants in the Eastern District of North Carolina and our justice system at large[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697403\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/327/#p343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Concluding that the U.S. Attorney's Office \"is uninterested in placating concerns\" and \"seems unfazed by the fact that discovery abuses violate constitutional guarantees and misrepresentations erode faith that justice is achievable[,]\" the court declared that \"[s]omething must be done.\"\n   <em>\n    Bartko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697403\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/327/#p343\">\n    728 F.3d at 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"To underscore [its] seriousness about this matter,\" the Fourth Circuit ordered the Clerk of Court to \"serve a copy of [its] opinion upon the Attorney General of the United States and the Office of Professional Responsibility[,]\" which handles allegations of misbehavior by Justice Department attorneys.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Faced with that sharp censure, the U.S. Attorney's Office responded by petitioning the court for rehearing, specifically requesting that the court \"reconsider its suggestion that discovery errors in our office are intentional [and] that [Assistant U.S. Attorney Wheeler] intentionally ignored false testimony.\" Gov't's Pet. for Reh'g 2,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Of those, eight documents that were withheld in full or in part under Exemptions 7(C) and 6 lie at the heart of Bartko's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In attempting to shelter its withholding of the Bartko investigation records under Exemption 7(C), OPR once again dropped the ball. To properly justify its invocation of the Exemption, OPR's affidavit had to offer an explanation that is \"full\n   and specific enough to afford the FOIA requester a meaningful opportunity to contest, and the district court an adequate foundation to review, the soundness of the withholding.\"\n   <em>\n    Jefferson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5872437,9506310\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/284/172/\">\n    284 F.3d at 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). For Exemption 7(C),\n   <em>\n    Jefferson\n   </em>\n   required OPR to make an individualized showing that each record was actually compiled for law-enforcement purposes rather than internal attorney supervision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 179.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   OPR's declaration proved the opposite. OPR explained that most misconduct referrals are closed immediately \"with no misconduct findings,\" or on the written record without a \"full investigation, which includes requesting and reviewing relevant documents and conducting interviews of witnesses and the subject attorney.\" J.A. 879. Even when a full investigation leads to the conclusion that an attorney has engaged in professional misconduct, \"those findings could result in a referral to the attorney's state bar or disciplinary action by the Department.\" J.A. 879.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   That description of OPR's review process reveals just how attenuated its \"law enforcement\" function is. For starters, most matters do not even result in an investigation, making a finding of law-enforcement-triggering misconduct implausible in the vast majority of cases. That summary treatment seems to have been what was accorded to the Fourth Circuit's referral in Wheeler's case because there is no record evidence or attestations from OPR indicating that they interviewed witnesses or requested additional documents for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In addition, according to OPR's own explanation, even when misconduct is found, all that usually occurs is a finding of poor judgment or intentional misconduct. Discipline is left to the department head, and perhaps referral to a state bar that would presumably go through its own investigative process (and compile its own records) to determine whether punishment should ensue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   OPR's investigation, in other words, is several steps removed from the type of \"adjudicative or enforcement\" proceeding or civil sanctions that could warrant Exemption 7(C) protection.\n   <em>\n    Rural Housing Alliance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3681544,169343\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/498/73/\">\n    498 F.2d at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is not nearly enough to trigger Exemption 7(C). In this court, there is \"no question that an investigation conducted by a federal agency for the purpose of determining whether to discipline employees for activity which does not constitute a violation of law is not for 'law enforcement purposes' under Exemption 7.\"\n   <em>\n    Stern v. FBI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799814,670047\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/737/84/\">\n    737 F.2d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 90 (D.C. Cir. 1984).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   To be sure, enforcement proceedings need not be imminent for Exemption 7(C) to apply, but they must be \"\n   <em>\n    more than ephemeral possibilities * * *\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Rural Housing Alliance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3681544,169343\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/498/73/\">\n    498 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   82 n.48 (emphasis added). Even though almost all of its complaints are closed without a full investigation, much less an adverse finding, OPR argues that all of its Wheeler records qualify as law-enforcement records just because of the slight chance that an inquiry could lead to an investigation that could lead to a misconduct finding that could result in a state bar referral that could lead to a bar sanctions hearing. That claim does not rise above the ephemeral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   This case highlights OPR's exaggerated reliance on Exemption 7(C). In August 2014-just days after the Fourth Circuit issued its opinion reprimanding the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District-OPR wrote an initial memorandum documenting the court's referral. In that memorandum, before any investigation had begun or findings had been made, OPR concluded that, \"[b]ecause former AUSA Wheeler is no longer employed by\n   the Department, and because further investigation of AUSA Bragdon is\n   <em>\n    unlikely\n   </em>\n   to result in a finding of misconduct,\n   <em>\n    it is questionable whether this matter warrants further inquiry\n   </em>\n   .\" J.A. 893 (emphases added). So right out of the gate, OPR did not find that the Fourth Circuit's referral was substantial enough to inquire further; OPR did not even think Wheeler's actions warranted a low-level inquiry. Nor does OPR explain what type of investigation it conducted, what violations of law it was investigating, or whether there was ever more than a fleeting possibility of civil sanctions. That is not an investigation with an eye toward law-enforcement proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   On top of that, the balance between Wheeler's interest in privacy and the public's interest in how OPR handled a federal appeals court's concerns about possible prosecutorial misconduct weighs strongly in favor of disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   On the privacy side of the balance, Wheeler's interest is substantially diminished. First, the allegations of misconduct during the Bartko trial are already a matter of public record, as is the referral to OPR published in the Fourth Circuit's decision, and the U.S. Attorney's public announcement that it too was referring the allegations of misconduct to OPR.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Department of Justice v.

The problem for Bartko is that there is no discernible evidence in the record that any such third file exists. The Commission explained that, in\n   searching for responsive documents, it had used all of the names listed in the FOIA request as search criteria and searched its Name Recognition Search Index. That identified two (not three) relevant investigative \"matters\" with responsive records. J.A. 540.

He did not challenge the Commission's reliance on Exemption 8 in the district court. J.A. 583 (acknowledging that the Commission's \"withholding of document 36 and 38 is understandable\").

J.A. 678. Indeed, he identified three public service websites with which he had already shared information and attached an article that had been written about the prosecutorial errors in his case.

Disclosure will reveal what is yet unknown-how the government handled the misconduct allegations internally and how it responded to the significant concerns expressed by the Fourth Circuit. Bartko, for his part, is sharing the information with an interested public. Since there is no claim that Bartko has a commercial interest in the documents, and the material is in the public's interest, he qualified for a fee waiver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court's award of summary judgment with respect to (i) OPR's use of Exemption 7(C) to justify its\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response and other withheld records, and (ii) its denial of Bartko's fee waiver request.
