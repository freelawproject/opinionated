Neither condition applies here. That a CBA must be consulted to confirm the existence of accrued vacation days is not sufficient to extinguish an independent state law right to use the accrued time to care for a sick child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May 2011, Laura Masserant, a flight attendant for Alaska Airlines (\"the Airline\"), asked for time off to care for her son, who was sick with bronchitis. Masserant had no sick days available, so she asked to use two of her seven days of accrued vacation leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Airline denied Masserant's request, noting that, in accordance with the CBA between the Airline and the Association of Flight Attendants (\"the Union\"), Masserant's banked vacation days had already been scheduled for use later in the year. Under the terms of the CBA, vacation days for each calendar year are requested the preceding fall and scheduled by January 1 for the ensuing year. Once scheduled, these vacation days may be \"exchanged\" between flight attendants, used for personal medical leaves of absence, used for maternity-related leaves of absence, used to extend bereavement leave, or \"cashed out\"-that is, paid out immediately, with the vacation days kept on calendar but converted to unpaid time off. However, the CBA does not allow scheduled vacation days to be moved for family medical reasons. Accordingly, Masserant's only option under the CBA was to take unscheduled leave to care for her son and so to incur disciplinary \"points.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 21, 2011, Masserant filed a complaint with the Washington Department of Labor and Industries (\"L&amp;I\"), alleging that the Airline's refusal to allow use of banked vacation days violated the Washington Family Care Act (\"WFCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2049.12.270\">\n    Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 49.12.270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The WFCA guarantees workers the flexibility to use accrued sick leave or other paid leave for family medical reasons. Workers invoking the WFCA must generally \"comply with the terms of the [CBA] or employer policy applicable to the leave,\" except that they need not comply with terms or policies \"relating to the choice of leave.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2049.12.270\">\n    Wash.

First, it disputed L&amp;I's jurisdiction. The Airline asserted that Masserant's complaint was not an ordinary state law claim but a CBA dispute in disguise, and therefore was reserved, under the RLA, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the CBA's grievance and arbitration mechanism. Second, the Airline disputed Masserant's view of the application of Washington law to the CBA's vacation leave provisions. According to the Airline, requiring adherence to the CBA's vacation-scheduling regime was not a prohibited restriction on \"the choice of leave,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2049.12.270\">\n    Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 49.12.270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), but a permissible condition on earning leave in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The state agency sided with Masserant. The investigator responsible for Masserant's claim noted that it was undisputed that Masserant's banked vacation days were available as of May 2011 for exchange, personal medical leave, maternity-related leave, bereavement leave, or immediate cash-out. The leave was therefore \"earned,\" and Masserant was \"entitled\" to use it, within the meaning of the WFCA. The investigator concluded that the CBA's limits on the use of banked vacation time, which could be used for certain other unscheduled purposes, served only to limit \"the choice of leave,\" and were therefore void under state law. In May 2012, L&amp;I issued a final notice of infraction and a $200 fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   L&amp;I did not directly address the Airline's jurisdictional argument. But in resting entirely on the interpretation and application of Washington law rather than on some disputed aspect of the CBA, L&amp;I necessarily rejected the argument. As the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Norris\n   </em>\n   , RLA preemption does not apply where the state law claim can be resolved independently of any CBA dispute.\n   <em>\n    Norris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39105\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/246/#p262\">\n    512 U.S. at 256-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39105\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/246/#p262\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lingle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218054\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/399/#p413\">\n    486 U.S. at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218054\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/399/#p413\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing the same standard in the LMRA \u00a7 301 context).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While the L&amp;I proceeding was ongoing, the Airline was in the midst of federal litigation against L&amp;I officials to enjoin it. That federal litigation, the genesis of the present appeal, asserted that Masserant's state law claim was so bound up in a dispute over the terms of the CBA as to be preempted under the Railway Labor Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Masserant was not a party to the federal action, but her Union intervened. In support of its intervention motion, the Union noted that if WFCA claims such as Masserant's were to be treated as CBA disputes, it would be largely the Union, rather than individual workers, that would have responsibility for pursuing those disputes through grievance and arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Int'l Bhd. of Elec.

It was common ground among the parties that Masserant had banked vacation days but was not permitted, under the terms of the CBA, to take them early for her son's medical care. The question was therefore purely one of state law-whether banked, prescheduled vacation days were subject to the state's nonnegotiable right to use accrued paid leave for family medical purposes. The Airline itself framed the inquiry in these terms at the L&amp;I proceeding, arguing that \"Masserant correctly sets out the approach outlined by the CBA and Alaska [Airlines] policy, but is wrong\n   <em>\n    in her WFCA analysis\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Relying on a long line of RLA and LMRA \u00a7 301 cases from this circuit and the Supreme Court, the district court concluded that referring to undisputed CBA provisions in the course of adjudicating a state law cause of action was not enough to trigger RLA preemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Livadas v.

The court therefore denied the Airline's motion for summary judgment and granted the defendants' and Union's cross-motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, the Airline renews its argument that the RLA preempts Masserant's WFCA claim. A divided panel of this court agreed. The panel majority acknowledged that the terms of the CBA were undisputed.\n   <em>\n    Alaska Airlines Inc. v.

Although the worker was owed wages based on having worked under a CBA, and although the CBA determined the amount of those wages, the CBA did not create the right to immediate payment on termination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39425\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/107/#p124\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39425\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/107/#p124\">\n    at 124-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39425\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/107/#p124\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The only issue raised by Livadas's claim ... was a question of state law ....\"). Nor was any disputed term of the CBA implicated in the adjudication of that state law right.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39425\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/107/#p124\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39425\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/107/#p124\">\n    at 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39425\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/107/#p124\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that, although CBA-defined wages were used to calculate damages under the Labor Code, \"[t]here is no indication that there was a 'dispute' in this case over the amount\" of wages owed under the CBA). The claim was therefore well within DLSE's authority to adjudicate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Second, and separately, the Supreme Court concluded that DLSE's policy of refusing to consider state law complaints involving a CBA was subject to substantive conflict preemption, as the policy uniquely disfavored CBA-covered workers, and thus interfered with substantive federal rights under the NLRA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Livadas\n   </em>\n   , 512 U.S. at 116-17 &amp; n.11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39425\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/107/#p124\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

With respect to LMRA \u00a7 301 preemption, the Court considered the worker's claim based on her complaint before DLSE, concluded the claim was not extinguished, and noted that a different result could obtain in a differently pleaded claim under the same state statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39425\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/107/#p124\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 121-25 &amp; n.19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39425\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/107/#p124\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The focus was thus the plaintiff's pleading, the character of the claim, and the proper forum to resolve that claim.

Masserant has alleged a violation of the WFCA's independent state law right to use banked vacation days. Her view of the WFCA, and that of the L&amp;I, is that the statute's \"choice of leave\" exception applies to banked vacation already earned, even if under workplace practices (whether CBA-governed or not) prescheduled vacation may be rescheduled or used for exigencies only under specified circumstances. Unsurprisingly,\n   the Airline disagrees with this interpretation of the WFCA. And after further administrative or state court review, the Airline may yet prevail in its view of Washington law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20296-130-070\">\n    Wash.

But what matters here is not the legal merits of Masserant's state law claim, but that Masserant's claim invokes a state law right that applies to all workers, whether CBA-covered or not, and gives rise to a state law dispute, not a dispute concerning the meaning of the CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , whatever the correct interpretation of Washington law, Masserant's claim does not require construction of the CBA. The claim of course\n   <em>\n    relies on\n   </em>\n   the terms and conditions of employment established by the CBA, in that Masserant's banked vacation days exist only by virtue of her having earned them in accordance with a workplace policy incorporated in the CBA. And the claim may be aided by\n   <em>\n    reference to\n   </em>\n   certain other CBA provisions, such as those making banked vacation immediately available for exchange, personal medical leave, maternity leave, bereavement leave, or cash-out.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Livadas\n   </em>\n   , 512 U.S. at 125,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39425\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/107/#p124\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A state law right to flexibility in rescheduling vacation leave for family medical reasons is no less independent of the CBA if the CBA also provides that right on its own.

As we have emphasized, RLA preemption presents, at bottom, a question of forum. But the dissent would begin its analysis by rejecting Masserant's state law claim, and would thus usurp the role of the state forum from the outset. The dissent would do so in the name of conflict preemption, even though there is no possible interpretation of the WFCA that would create a substantive \"conflict\" with the RLA, as the RLA has no bearing on substantive state law rights.\n   <em>\n    Norris\n   </em>\n   , 512 U.S. at 254,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39105\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/246/#p262\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

More broadly, the end result is a break from any conventional understanding of our federal system: The dissent would use the RLA to enjoin the state agency from interpreting and applying state law, thus allowing a federal court effectively to police the development of substantive state law, and inhibiting the state from creating precedent on the meaning of its own statutes through the ordinary process of state court appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The dissent would presumably allow the state to administer its own law if a WFCA claim were brought by a worker\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   covered by a CBA.

Alaska Airlines's flight attendants are represented by the Association of Flight Attendants-Communication Workers of America, AFL-CIO (AFA). In accordance with the provisions of the RLA, Alaska Airlines and AFA entered into a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) detailing numerous aspects of the employment\n   relationship. Among other provisions, the CBA covers sick leave, vacations, and leaves of absence. These provisions are critical to ensuring that Alaska Airlines can meet Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) minimum crew-staffing requirements for each of its thousands of daily flights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Under the CBA, flight attendants accrue sick leave based on the amount they work, including the number of flights staffed and the flight mileage. Flight attendants may use sick leave in a host of situations defined by the CBA, as well as \"pursuant to applicable State law and/or Company policy.\" Alaska Airlines, headquartered in Washington state, interprets this provision to mean that flight attendants can use sick leave to care for qualifying family members under the Washington Family Care Act (WFCA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2049.12.270\">\n    Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 49.12.270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In addition to sick leave, flight attendants receive paid vacations. The CBA sets forth how vacations days are scheduled in a detailed process. By October 1 of each year, Alaska Airlines posts the list of available vacation times. Flight attendants have fifteen days in which to sign up for available vacation periods, and vacation days are awarded for the following year based on these preferences and the flight attendant's seniority. Once vacation days are assigned, a flight attendant may trade these days with other flight attendants, subject to certain limitations. Flight attendants may also request early vacation pay, though the vacation days themselves remain scheduled as unpaid days off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The CBA enumerates instances when an employee may use vacation time outside of the scheduled period. Among other things, a flight attendant may use sick leave\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   vacation time to cover certain medical leaves of absence, maternity leaves of absence, parental leaves of absence, and bereavement leaves of absence. Under Alaska Airlines's interpretation of the CBA and longstanding practice, flight attendants may not otherwise reschedule vacation. For example, Alaska Airlines contends flight attendants may not reschedule vacation time to care for themselves or a sick family member.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The CBA also contains procedures for resolving disputes as to the meaning of any of the terms in the CBA concerning \"rates of pay, rules or working conditions.\" As required by the RLA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20184\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the CBA establishes a multi-stage process for resolving disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the CBA, culminating in mandatory arbitration before a neutral board of adjustment. Decisions by this board are \"final and binding upon the parties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In October 2010, Masserant signed up for her preferred 2011 vacation schedule. At the beginning of 2011, Masserant was awarded four vacation days in January, and seven in each of February, April, November, and December. As allowed by the CBA, Masserant took her four paid vacation days in January, and then requested early vacation pay for the days scheduled in February, April, and November. Masserant was therefore left with only seven paid vacation days-all scheduled for December.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   On May 20, 2011, Masserant needed time off to care for her son, and requested sick leave to cover a two-day trip from May 21-22. Alaska Airlines informed her that she did not have sick leave available for the entire two-day trip, and she was not entitled to reschedule her paid vacation days in December to cover the absence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As a result, she would receive attendance points for an emergency absence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Ignoring the CBA's grievance procedures for challenging Alaska Airlines's implementation of the contract's sick leave and vacation policy, Masserant, supported by her Union, instead filed a complaint with the Washington Department of Labor &amp; Industries (L&amp;I) on June 16, 2011. In her complaint to L&amp;I, Masserant challenged Alaska Airlines's application of its sick leave policy, arguing that it had both failed to credit her for sick leave accrued in May and failed to let her use accrued sick leave to cover a portion of her absence. Masserant also challenged Alaska Airlines's application of the CBA's vacation policy, stating: \"I asked my company to use my remaining week of vacation for this occurrence. This is earned time that I was denied to use.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In response to L&amp;I's investigation of Masserant's complaint, Alaska Airlines explained that reliable attendance in conformance with FAA safety regulations requiring minimum crew staffing for every flight was vital to \"deliver on its mission,\" and gave details regarding its complex bidding process for vacations. According to Alaska Airlines, under the CBA, \"[f]light attendants are not permitted to use vacation on an unscheduled basis when they get sick,\" and therefore \"it is consistent with the WFCA that the flight attendant not be able to use vacation when a family member gets sick.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   L&amp;I first acknowledged its \"position\" that \"any policy (including advanced vacation scheduling and medical verification) are allowable as long as they don't relate to the choice of leave.\" However, L&amp;I concluded that Alaska Airlines's interpretation of the CBA was undercut by the fact that \"[t]here are occasions when vacation time is 'available' for flight attendants that are not affected by the seniority based bidding process.\" Because flight attendants can use \"accrued sick leave and/or vacation leave\" on an unscheduled basis for medical absences, maternity leave, and bereavement leave, L&amp;I was \"troubled\" that paid vacation was not offered for family care. Therefore, L&amp;I issued a Notice of Infraction, dated May 31, 2012, stating that \"Ms. Masserant was entitled to seven (7) days of vacation,\" and under WFCA, Alaska Airlines must allow her to use this vacation leave to care for her sick child. It ordered Alaska Airlines to pay a $200 penalty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In March 2012, Alaska Airlines filed an amended complaint in district court against L&amp;I.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining L&amp;I from continuing to investigate\n   or enforce Masserant's complaint. In support of this request for relief, the complaint alleged that the RLA preempted such enforcement efforts because the mechanisms provided in the CBA were Masserant's exclusive means of resolving this dispute. The district court granted AFA's motion to intervene on behalf of Alaska Airlines's employees in order to defend their members' rights to enforce WFCA using L&amp;I's procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The parties then filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the question whether the RLA preempted Masserant's state-law cause of action and required her to resolve this dispute through the CBA's dispute resolution procedures. In district court, L&amp;I no longer suggested that Masserant was entitled to use vacation time to care for a sick child in this case because the CBA allowed vacation time to be used for medical leave and other purposes. Instead, L&amp;I and AFA argued that the question whether the CBA allowed Masserant to use vacation time for her own illness or that of her child was not material because WFCA gave Masserant an independent right to use her vacation days at any time, whether scheduled or not. The district court ruled in favor of AFA and L&amp;I, concluding that WFCA \"may\" grant Masserant an independent right to use her December vacation time to care for her sick child in May, and therefore the complaint was not preempted by the RLA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   On appeal, Alaska Airlines argues that Masserant's claim raises the sort of dispute that has to be determined through the CBA's dispute resolution process. In response, L&amp;I and AFA argue that as a matter of law, WFCA gives employees a non-negotiable right, independent of the CBA, to use vacation days to care for sick family members \"irrespective of any limitations that an employer would attempt to put on that leave,\" including \"any advance scheduling requirements for the flight attendant's vacation.\" As explained below, L&amp;I and AFA's litigating position is not supported by the plain language of the statute and regulations, and therefore resolving Masserant's claim requires the interpretation and application of the CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The simple question before us is whether the RLA preempts Masserant's cause of action because it is a minor dispute that must be channeled through the RLA's mandatory arbitral mechanism.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hawaiian Airlines\n   </em>\n   , 512 U.S. at 253,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39105\" index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/246/#p262\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In considering common carriers with nationwide operations, Congress recognized the importance of avoiding \"any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier engaged therein,\" by ensuring that disputes would be settled consistently and promptly through the RLA's mandatory arbitral mechanism. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151a. Here, Alaska Airlines argues that flight attendant absences pose unique concerns in the airline industry. Under FAA regulations, a plane cannot take off without the requisite number of flight attendants on board; thus, ensuring employee attendance is critical to the basic operations of an air carrier. While Alaska Airlines retains and pays for flight attendants to be on \"reserve\" to cover for unexpected absences, those reserves are not unlimited. Such backup measures are not intended to ensure consistent day-to-day operations. For that, Alaska Airlines relies on its negotiations with AFA for detailed scheduling of leave, attendance, and absence, as embodied in the CBA. A cornerstone of these negotiations is the mandatory arbitral mechanism, designed for \"the prompt and orderly settlement\" of disputes concerning the CBA's negotiated leave terms.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39105\" index=\"376\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/246/#p262\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If state courts could apply the potentially conflicting state law of each of the fifty states to interpret the CBA's terms and conditions, the congressional goal of consistent, reliable operation would be threatened, and the application of state law \"might lead to inconsistent results since there could be as many state-law principles as there are States.\"\n   <em>\n    Lingle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218054\" index=\"377\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/399/#p413\">\n    486 U.S. at 405-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6218054\" index=\"378\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/399/#p413\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Instead of applying this straightforward analysis, the majority circumvents Supreme Court precedent and offers a series of disconnected arguments for why we must deem Masserant's claim to be a question of state law that is not a minor dispute. First, the majority notes that RLA preemption is a type of \"forum preemption,\" which considers whether a particular cause of action must be heard in a state or federal forum. Maj. Op. at 924-25. Based on this unexceptionable observation, the majority leaps to the unsupported and untenable argument that unlike \"conflict preemption,\" which allows consideration of state law, RLA preemption precludes any consideration of the state law governing a cause of action. Maj. Op. at 922-24. Any analysis of the nature and scope of the state-law cause of action, the majority asserts, is the same as reaching the merits of the state-law claim. Maj. Op. at 928, 929-30. This approach, the majority urges, is contrary to forum preemption analysis, which allows a court to decide only who the decisionmaker will be. Maj. Op. at 929-30. According to the majority, a federal court's \"only job is to decide whether,\n   <em>\n    as pleaded\n   </em>\n   ,\" a claim is independent of the CBA. Maj. Op. at 924 (emphasis added).
