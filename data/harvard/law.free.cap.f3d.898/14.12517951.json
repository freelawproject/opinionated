In the orders under review, the Commission approved an exemption to the minimum offer price rule in the ISO New England forward capacity market for a limited amount of qualifying renewable energy. The petitioners argue that the renewable exemption creates unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory rates in violation of the Federal Power Act and that the Commission was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. The petitioners also contend that the Commission erred by not setting a hearing on disputed facts. We conclude that FERC engaged in reasoned decision-making to find that the renewable exemption to the minimum offer price rule results in a just and reasonable rate. Likewise, FERC did not abuse its discretion by denying the\n   petitioners' request for a hearing. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

With three years' notice, demand in the forward capacity market is able to signal that a new entrant is needed while there is still time to develop additional generation capability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ISO New England sets prices in the forward capacity market by administering a forward capacity auction. First, ISO New England determines the projected amount of capacity (\"Installed Capacity Requirement\") that the region will require to operate reliably in three years. Next, ISO New England holds a descending price auction, in which generators submit offers to provide quantities of power at certain prices, three years in the future. If the bid capacity at a given price exceeds the Installed Capacity Requirement, ISO New England lowers the auction price. As the auction price decreases, generators offer less capacity to the auction or exit the auction altogether. A \"clearing price\" is reached at the lowest price that yields enough supply to meet the Installed Capacity Requirement set by ISO New England. All generators that have successfully bid in the auction are paid the clearing price for the capacity they provide, even if they submitted a bid lower than the eventual clearing price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The original ISO New England tariff used a \"vertical\" demand curve, specifying a fixed demand that defined the capacity sought by the auction. The clearing price was reached at the lowest price that met the fixed demand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the orders under review, ISO New England implemented a sloped demand curve. The sloped demand curve establishes a downward trending relationship between price and demand. Price is expressed in the chart as a multiple of the net cost of new entry and demand is expressed as a reserve margin. Using the sloped demand curve, if the offered capacity price is decreased, it corresponds to an increased demand. Rather than the New England region procuring enough capacity to meet a fixed demand as under the vertical demand curve, it procures enough capacity to meet the variable demand that is set by the supply prices offered in the auction. The clearing price is reached at the point of intersection of the supply curve and the demand curve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The system-wide sloped demand curve was implemented beginning with the auction for the ninth capacity year (2018-2019). At the time of this petition for review, ISO New England had completed auctions through the eleventh capacity year (2020-2021).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   One of the rules in the ISO New England forward capacity auction is the \"minimum offer price rule.\" The minimum offer price rule mitigates the potential for the improper exercise of market power that can occur if a generation resource submits capacity to the auction at a below-cost price, suppressing the clearing price.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NEPGA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4124880,4341611\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/757/283/\">\n    757 F.3d at 288-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . States and some utilities participate in the market as both buyers and sellers of power, giving them the opportunity to exercise this type of market power. For example, a state-sponsored power generation resource could submit a below-cost price offer to the auction, increasing the supply of lower priced power, and lowering the clearing price. Then, that state, as a net buyer of capacity, benefits by purchasing capacity at the resulting artificially low price. The minimum offer price rule mitigates this type of market power by requiring new resources to submit capacity to the auction above a minimum price floor. The minimum price floor is set at the approximate net cost of entry of a new generation resource.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The present petition for review concerns an exemption to this rule that allows a limited amount of state-sponsored renewable generation sources to submit price offers below the minimum price floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Also, the Commission distinguished the New England States Committee's request for an exemption from one that it approved in the mid-Atlantic market under the PJM system operator.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C056\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at P 35. The Commission explained that \"because [the ISO New England] capacity market relies on a vertical demand curve while PJM's capacity market relies on a sloped demand curve,\" a renewable exemption would have a larger price impact in the ISO New England system.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On April 1, 2014, ISO New England filed a package of reforms to its tariff under section 205 of the Federal Power Act.\n   <em>\n    ISO-NE\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. ER14-1639-000, ISO New England Inc.

The reforms implemented a new system-wide sloped demand curve to replace the vertical curves and included a plan for developing local sloped demand curves in the future. In the reformed tariff, ISO New England included a limited renewable exemption to the minimum offer price rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The reformed tariff allows up to 200 megawatts of qualifying new entrant renewable capacity to be exempt from the minimum offer price rule beginning with the ninth capacity year auction.\n   <em>\n    ISO-NE Tariff\n   </em>\n   , pp. 129-30, 143-44. The tariff also included a carry-over rule, allowing any unused portion of the 200 megawatt renewable capacity to carry forward for two additional auctions (three years), up to a total cap of 600 megawatts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C056\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Generators protested the renewable exemption, arguing that it was unjust and unreasonable because it will undermine competitive entry and result in significant price suppression.

The Generators assert that the supply curve is steep where it intersects the demand curve. Because it is steep, small rightward shifts to the supply curve caused by the introduction of a limited amount of below-cost resources result in an intersection with the demand curve at a much lower clearing price.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178704,4109955\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/762/41/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at P 22.

Generators argue that the new demand curves are steeper at the point that they intersect the supply curve than the previous demand curves, resulting in greater price suppression. The Commission determined that the steepness in the new demand curves is mitigated because actual supply curves have been flatter than Generators predicted, and, if the performance of the demand curves changes over time, there are proceedings to review new curves that can address any issues.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Remand Order\n    </em>\n    at P 44 ;\n    <em>\n     Remand Rehearing Order\n    </em>\n    at P 37.

The Commission relied on the expert predictions that were available at the time of its decision, and we defer to its use of these predictions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The Generators also argue that the Commission did not rationally tie the magnitude of the exemption to any particular prediction of load growth or retirement. However, FERC explained that the 200 megawatt exemption was based on the best estimate of load growth, which was \"estimated at 189 MW annually, plus an adjustment for the reserve margin required to meet the installed capacity requirement.\"\n    <em>\n     Initial Order\n    </em>\n    at P 83 ;\n    <em>\n     Rehearing Order\n    </em>\n    at P 22. The Commission also acknowledged load growth could be more or less than ISO New England anticipated, but ISO New England committed to \"revisit[ing] the cap on the ... exemption in the future, should the entry of [renewable resources] exceed load growth.\"\n    <em>\n     Rehearing Order\n    </em>\n    at P 22. The Commission acted reasonably in tying the 200 megawatt exemption caps to load growth estimates.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    With respect to retirements, the Generators argue that the retirement rationale was inappropriately raised on remand, that uneconomic entry will continue after retirements complete, and that its experts found price suppression will occur even with retirements. The Commission noted that ISO New England had previously predicted 6,500 megawatts of retirements by 2020, which is a substantial portion of the 35,000 megawatt market.\n    <em>\n     Remand Order\n    </em>\n    at P 53 ;\n    <em>\n     Remand Rehearing Order\n    </em>\n    at P 73. More recently, ISO New England \"estimated that by 2020, resources representing about 30 percent of regional capacity have committed to cease operation or are at risk of retirement.\"\n    <em>\n     Remand Order\n    </em>\n    at P 53. The Commission observed that the predicted retirements were far in excess of the 600 megawatt carry-forward cap, and concluded that the exempted renewable energy would only make a small impact in replacing retiring resources.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . Even with retirements, the Commission acknowledged the potential for minor price suppression.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Remand Rehearing Order\n    </em>\n    at P 20. But the Commission is not required to protect against all price suppression. The Commission acted reasonably in concluding that retirements would help mitigate any price suppression.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Accordingly, we defer to the Commission's conclusion that the renewable energy exemption had only a limited potential for price suppression because of the implementation of the sloped demand curve, the prediction of a flatter supply curve, and predicted load growth and retirements. Therefore, we deny the Generators' petition for review.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    <strong>\n     C. The Generators' request for a hearing\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Lastly, the Generators argue that the Commission should have settled\n    issues of disputed fact regarding price suppression, load growth, and retirements at a hearing. The Commission's decision on whether to hold a hearing is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n    <em>\n     Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm'n v.

The extensive written record contained expert testimony and analysis regarding the market effects of the renewable exemption, the development of the sloped demand curve, and predictions for load growth and retirements.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    . Accordingly, the Commission did not abuse its discretion by relying on the written record to resolve disputes of material fact on these issues.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    <strong>\n     III. Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    For the reasons set forth above, the Generators' petition for review is denied.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-73\">\n     It may appear that the Commission selectively relied on evidence of the performance of the supply curves during the ninth and tenth capacity year while it simultaneously refused to consider evidence that the predicted load growth was not materializing. However, as the Commission acknowledged, load growth was lower than anticipated during the ninth and tenth capacity years.\n     <em>\n      Remand Rehearing Order\n     </em>\n     at P 72. But, the Commission relied on retirements in addition to load growth to offset the renewables exemption. The Commission considered evidence that the actual retirements in those years offset the small amount of exempted renewable energy that actually cleared the market even absent load growth.\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5705865,1839015\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/28/173/\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n     at P 73.
