The district court later sentenced Sampson principally to five years of imprisonment. On appeal, Sampson challenges the judgment on numerous grounds. We conclude that none of Sampson's arguments is meritorious. We therefore\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the district court's judgment of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sampson began serving in the New York State Senate in 1997, representing the 19th Senate District in Brooklyn. Until his expulsion from the Senate in 2015, Sampson was seen as a political \"powerhouse.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Alan Feuer,\n   <em>\n    John Sampson, Once a State Senate Powerhouse, Sentenced to Prison\n   </em>\n   , N.Y. Times, Jan. 19, 2017, at A20. He served as leader of the Democratic Conference of the Senate from June 2009 to December 2012, and Minority Leader of the Senate from January 2011 to December 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sampson was also licensed to practice law in New York State. As described in more detail in this case's companion appeal,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sampson\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-2869-cr (2d Cir. 2018), Justices of the New York State Supreme Court periodically appointed Sampson to serve as a referee in foreclosure actions for properties located\n   in Brooklyn. The government argued at trial that over time, Sampson embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from various foreclosure escrow accounts that he oversaw as a referee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In July 2006, Sampson asked Edul Ahmad (\"Ahmad\"), a Queens businessman, to lend him $188,500 so that he could replace funds he had embezzled before the authorities could discover they were missing. Ahmad agreed to lend Sampson the money. Sampson failed to repay Ahmad. After realizing that Sampson would not repay the loan, Ahmad asked Sampson to use his position in the New York State Senate to provide Ahmad with special favors. Sampson subsequently intervened with New York State regulatory agencies conducting reviews of Ahmad's business, lobbied for Ahmad to receive potentially lucrative brokerships from national financial institutions, and introduced legislation that would have benefited Ahmad as the owner of a minority-owned business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In July 2011, Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") agents arrested Ahmad for mortgage fraud, and the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York (\"the USAO\") commenced its prosecution of Ahmad. After Ahmad was released on bail, he met with Sampson \"multiple times.\" App'x at 109. Sampson told Ahmad that Sampson \"had a friend that he had gone to school with\" who worked in the USAO, \"and that he would reach out to this individual and try to get some information as to the strength of [the USAO's] case,\" including the names of individuals who might testify against Ahmad should Ahmad choose to go to trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government argued to the jury that Sampson's goal was to prevent Ahmad from pleading guilty to the charges, cooperating with the government, and disclosing Sampson's crimes. Ahmad accepted Sampson's offer to help him acquire names of potential witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sampson contacted Samuel Noel (\"Noel\"), who, at the time, served as a supervisory paralegal at the USAO. Sampson provided Noel with the names of four potential witnesses in Ahmad's case: Leesa Shapiro, Glenn Hirsch, Roger Khan (\"Khan\"), and Premaj Hansraj (\"Hansraj\"). Noel understood that Sampson was asking him to conduct an improper search of the USAO's non-public database and determine who was planning to testify at Ahmad's trial. Noel knew that it was a crime for him to provide Sampson with this non-public information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Nonetheless, after speaking with Sampson, Noel used his government account to run the names of Ahmad, Sampson, and the relevant witnesses through the Public Access to Electronic Records (\"PACER\") database. Noel understood at the time that he was forbidden from using PACER for such non-work-related purposes. Next, Noel looked up the names of Ahmad, Sampson, and the relevant witnesses in the Legal Information Office Network System (\"LIONS\"), a nonpublic USAO database with confidential information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Noel found results for Ahmad, Khan, and Hansraj, but not for the others. Noel later told Sampson that he did not see his name or come across other relevant information in the LIONS database.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Noel also contacted two nonsupervisory USAO paralegals, one working on Ahmad's case and the other working in the USAO's public integrity section. During a closed-door meeting, Noel told the paralegal working on Ahmad's case to inform him of information regarding the case, including if she learned that witnesses were speaking\n   about Sampson. During another closed-door meeting in his office, Noel directed the paralegal working in the public integrity section to inform him if she came across any of the named witnesses mentioning Sampson. On November 22, 2011, Sampson assured Ahmad that Sampson was \"on top of\" Noel, and that Noel was \"doing the best he can\" to find out information on Ahmad's case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    at 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ahmad also informed Sampson that the FBI had approached Qayaam Farrouq (\"Farrouq\"), one of Ahmad's co-conspirators in the mortgage fraud. Ahmad told Sampson that he was worried that Farrouq would cooperate with the government. Ahmad therefore suggested that Sampson provide Farrouq with an attorney who would betray attorney-client confidentiality and provide them with information about whether Farrouq would cooperate. Sampson arranged for an attorney to represent Farrouq, instructing Ahmad not to have contact with the attorney directly, but that Sampson himself would communicate with the attorney about Farrouq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Sampson followed a similar tack after the government arrested Nazir Gurmohamed (\"Gurmohamed\"), one of Ahmad's other co-conspirators. Sampson suggested that he and Ahmad obtain an attorney for Gurmohamed who would breach privilege and inform them if Gurmohamed began cooperating with the government. During the meeting with Ahmad at which this conversation took place, Sampson talked to Farrouq's attorney on the phone and solicited information about Farrouq and Gurmohamed's arraignments and bail hearings. As for obtaining a lawyer for Gurmohamed, Sampson instructed Ahmad to pay the attorney in cash so there would be no \"money trail.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    at 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Later, Sampson sent Ahmad contact information for the attorney Ahmad was to retain for Gurmohamed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Sampson also attempted to hire a private investigator, Warren Flagg (\"Flagg\"), a former FBI agent who worked with the USAO while in that role. Sampson hoped that Flagg could exploit his ties with the USAO to extract information regarding the case against Ahmad. During a meeting, Flagg told Ahmad that it would be illegal for him to secure confidential information about the USAO's potential cooperating witnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    at 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]f I call up a buddy of mine and say, oh, you know this case? First of all, that's tampering.\"). Nevertheless, Flagg suggested that Ahmad compile a list of possible cooperating witnesses for Flagg to investigate. Sampson repeatedly urged Ahmad to do so. At the same time, Sampson stated that Ahmad did not need to involve his criminal counsel in any of Flagg's potential work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Despite Sampson's efforts, Ahmad began to cooperate with the government in November 2011. Sampson and Ahmad met again in February 2012. In preparation for the meeting, pursuant to instructions from law enforcement, Ahmad copied a page from his check register that showed the $188,500 he had transferred to Sampson. During the meeting, Ahmad showed Sampson the copy, informed him that it was responsive to a government subpoena, and asked what he should do. Sampson instructed Ahmad not to produce the check register and to lie to the government about its-and the loan's-existence. Sampson then took the copy from Ahmad; he did not return it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 27, 2012, two FBI agents-Ken Hosey (\"Agent Hosey\") and Erin Zacher (\"Agent Zacher\")-interviewed Sampson and questioned him about the check register page. Sampson claimed not to recall anything about the $188,500 payment that Ahmad had provided him. Agent Hosey\n   then showed Sampson a photocopy of Ahmad's check register page. Sampson told Hosey that the document \"didn't ring a bell\" and that \"he didn't have a recollection from it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    at 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He suggested, however, that he might recall if he checked his files or received more information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the same interview, the agents questioned Sampson about his ownership interest in a Brooklyn liquor store. Sampson had previously failed to disclose this interest when submitting a liquor license application to the New York State Liquor Authority. Responding to FBI questioning, however, Sampson admitted he did have the ownership interest. He claimed that his four business partners in the store awarded him the interest as payment for performing certain legal work, but Sampson failed to identify what work he did. He also denied asking one of his Senate staffers to help with a matter related to the store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the conclusion of the interview, Hosey informed Sampson that he believed Sampson was lying and that it was a felony to lie to federal agents. Sampson responded, \"[n]ot everything I told you was false.\" Trial Transcript (\"T.\") 2109.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On April 29, 2013, a grand jury in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York returned an indictment against Sampson that contained nine criminal counts. On March 17, 2015, a grand jury returned a fifth superseding indictment, which contained eleven counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counts 1 and 2 concerned Sampson's alleged embezzlements from the escrow accounts that he oversaw as a referee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Count 3 charged Sampson with conspiracy to obstruct justice, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k), due to his alleged efforts-with Noel, Ahmad, and others-to impede Ahmad's mortgage fraud investigation. Count 4 charged Sampson with obstruction of justice, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201503\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), for his individual role in the same conduct. Count 5 charged Sampson with witness tampering, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)-(C) and 1512(b)(3), for attempting to induce Ahmad not to provide the check register page to the federal authorities. Count 6 charged Sampson with witness tampering, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3), for pressuring Ahmad to lie to the government about the existence of the $188,500 loan. Count 7 charged Sampson with evidence tampering, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), for his attempt to hide the check register page from the government. Count 8 charged Sampson with concealment of records, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201519\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , regarding the same conduct. Finally, Counts 9, 10, and 11 charged Sampson with making false statements to federal officers, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Specifically, the indictment alleged that Sampson falsely told Agents Hosey and Zacher that he did not recall seeing the check register page prior to the FBI interview (Count 9), that he never requested nonpublic information from Noel (Count 10), and that he did not direct a Senate staffer to intervene\n   with New York tax authorities on the liquor store's behalf (Count 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A jury trial commenced on June 22, 2015. On July 24, 2015, the jury found Sampson guilty as to Counts 4, 9, and 11. In other words, the jury concluded that Sampson personally obstructed justice in the mortgage fraud investigation and made false statements to Agents Hosey and Zacher regarding his knowledge of the check register page and his use of Senate staff to benefit the liquor store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 14, 2015, Sampson moved for judgments of acquittal on Counts 4 and 9 (but not Count 11) pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The district court held that Sampson waived this argument by failing to raise it before trial and that, in any event, Sampson's argument failed on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *9-13. Sampson also claimed that the check register false statement conviction (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Count 9) was invalid because,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , it was literally true that he had not seen the FBI's photocopy of the check register page prior to the interview. The district court rejected this argument, noting that \"\n   <em>\n    [o]f course\n   </em>\n   Special Agent Hosey was not asking if Defendant literally had ever seen the actual photocopy then being displayed; Special Agent Hosey was asking if Sampson had ever seen the image depicted therein.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *17 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In addition, on July 5, 2016, Sampson moved for a new trial due to the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    McDonnell v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 2355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). The district court denied this request, concluding that\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   was inapplicable because the government had not charged Sampson with bribery or corruption offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On January 18, 2017, the district court sentenced Sampson to five years of imprisonment on each of the three counts, with the sentences to run concurrently, followed by three years of supervised release. The district court entered judgment on January 27, 2017, and Sampson timely appealed. Sampson is presently serving his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Sampson first argues that the government's theory of obstruction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201503\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Sampson sought confidential information in Ahmad's case with the corrupt intent of facilitating witness tampering-ran afoul of our decisions in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, he contends, his conviction on Count 4 must be vacated. The government counters that Sampson waived this objection by not raising it before trial and, in any event, Sampson's conduct was properly punishable under \u00a7 1503(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because Sampson's argument raises questions of law, our review is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We need not address whether Sampson waived this argument, because even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that he did not, we conclude-for the reasons outlined below-that \u00a7 1503(a) proscribed his conduct.

Thus, the district court effectively told the jury that Sampson must have\n   <em>\n    deliberately and purposefully\n   </em>\n   \"cause[d] [Noel] to ... obstruct, impede, or influence or corruptly endeavor to obstruct, impede, or influence\" Ahmed's prosecution.

But even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that a literally truthful statement cannot be the basis for a \u00a7 1001 charge,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sampson's argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   At the start, Agent Hosey did not testify as to the exact phrasing of his question, so the record is not clear whether Agent Hosey in fact asked, \"Have you seen this document before?\" But even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that he did, there was nothing \"true\"-literally or otherwise-about Sampson's response. Sampson did not simply answer Agent Hosey's question with a \"no.\" According to Agent Hosey, \"his quotes were\n   <em>\n    it didn't ring a bell\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    he didn't have a recollection from it\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    at 780\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In other words, Sampson did not merely tell Agent Hosey that he had never seen the precise document being presented to him. Sampson insisted that the document did not look familiar to him, and that it did not resemble any document that he had previously seen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Schafrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6498915,10528995\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/871/300/\">\n    871 F.2d 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 303 (2d Cir. 1989) (noting that a responsive statement \"must be judged according to common sense standards\"). Moreover, Sampson claimed that \"if he could check his files or there was more information, he may be able to recall.\" App'x at 780. In context, here, too, Sampson was asserting that he could not recall seeing any document similar to the photocopy that Agent Hosey was showing him. Sampson could not have possibly meant that he might somehow find, in his own files, the very same photocopy of the check register page.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schafrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6498915,10528995\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/871/300/\">\n    871 F.2d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If, in the context in which the statements were made, they were materially untrue, then [a violation] is established.

Garavito-Garcia,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335416\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/242/#p248\">\n    827 F.3d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248 (2d Cir. 2016) (noting that a defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence \"bears a heavy burden,\" and that a conviction will be upheld \"if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Ahmad testified that he had previously shown Sampson a copy of the check register page, telling him that it was responsive to a government subpoena and that Ahmad needed his advice. According to Ahmad, Sampson instructed Ahmad to lie to the government about the document's existence. Sampson then took the copy from Ahmad and did not return it. Given this testimony, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, a reasonable jury had sufficient basis to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Sampson knew at the time of his interview with Agent Hosey that he had previously seen a document resembling the one that Agent Hosey showed him, and that he falsely claimed that he did not remember having seen such a document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Sampson next contends that the evidence was insufficient to show that he intended to deceive Agent Hosey and his colleague, Agent Zacher. The district court instructed the jury that a statement or representation is \"false or fictitious\" under \u00a7 1001(a)(2)\"if it was untrue when made, and known at the time to be untrue, by the person making it or causing it to be made.\" T. 2499. It further instructed that a statement or representation is \"fraudulent\" under \u00a7 1001(a)(2)\"if it was untrue when made and was made, or caused to be made, with the intent to deceive the government agency to which it was submitted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230232\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/788/61/#p66\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Sampson does not challenge these instructions. Accordingly, to convict him of this charge, the jury needed only to conclude that Sampson knew that his statement to the agents regarding the check register page-namely, that he did not remember having seen such a document-was false when he made it. The evidence was sufficient to support such a conclusion: the jury was entitled to find that Sampson was aware that his statement was false, and that he did in fact remember having seen the check register document. And even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the government had to prove an \"intent to deceive\" to secure a conviction under \u00a7 1001(a)(2), we again disagree that the evidence against Sampson was insufficient. As noted above, Ahmad testified that Sampson told him to lie about the check register page, and Sampson took the copy without returning it, presumably to prevent it from being turned over to the authorities. This evidence is more than adequate to support the conclusion that when Sampson told the agents that the check register page photocopy \"didn't ring a bell,\" he intended to deceive them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Finally, Sampson maintains that Agent Hosey's question was \"fundamentally ambiguous,\"\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lighte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1552310\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/782/367/#p375\">\n    782 F.2d 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 375 (2d Cir. 1986), and therefore cannot serve as a basis for a \u00a7 1001(a)(2) conviction. This argument, too, is without merit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The evidence was more than sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Agent Hosey's question was not fundamentally ambiguous-and thus that Sampson, understanding the question, lied. As we insisted in\n   <em>\n    Lighte\n   </em>\n   , \"[i]f the response given was false as the defendant understood the question, his conviction is not invalidated by the fact that his answer to the question might generate a number of different interpretations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1552310\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/782/367/#p375\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Taken together, Sampson's response to Agent Hosey's question and his earlier dealings with Ahmad involving the check register page provided sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Sampson interpreted the question as Agent Hosey intended and that Sampson knowingly made a false statement in reply. Accordingly, Sampson's challenge to his conviction on Count 9 fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Sampson next challenges his conviction on Count 11, contending that the district court erred in refusing to admit certain evidence, and in refusing to allow Sampson's attorney to ask a question of Agent Hosey during cross-examination. Count 11 charged Sampson with violating \u00a7 1001(a)(2) by telling Agents Hosey and Zacher that he never asked his Senate staffer to help with the liquor store's tax issues. At trial, the government elicited\n   testimony from Agent Hosey as to how Sampson responded when questioned about whether he \"had asked the Senate staff[er] to assist\" the business partner \"regarding the liquor store.\" App'x at 782. Agent Hosey responded that Sampson \"stated he had not and said that he would not put pressure on his staff to make that kind of inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   During cross-examination, Sampson sought to introduce notes taken by Agent Zacher during the interview. Sampson offered the notes for two purposes: (1) to demonstrate that Sampson's statement that \"he had not\" asked the Senate staffer for assistance concerning the liquor store did not appear in the notes, which cast doubt on whether Sampson made this statement, and (2) to show that the structure of Agent Hosey's interview may have confused Sampson, and perhaps caused him to provide a false statement unintentionally. The government objected, asserting that the notes were hearsay. The judge sustained the government's objection. Sampson argues on appeal that the district court erred in refusing to admit the notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In addition, and also on cross-examination of Agent Hosey, Sampson's attorney attempted to ask him, \"Isn't it a fact that John Sampson did not deny that he had asked his staff to assist?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 797. The government objected, and the judge sustained the objection. Sampson's attorney did not rephrase the question, but simply moved onto another topic. Sampson argues that the district court erred in refusing to allow his attorney to ask this question, and that the district court's evidentiary rulings also violated his Confrontation Clause rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \"We review evidentiary rulings, including a trial court's decision to limit the scope of cross-examination, for abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Furthermore, \"[a] district court is accorded broad discretion in controlling the scope and extent of cross-examination,\" and \"may impose reasonable limits on cross-examination to protect against,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   harassment, prejudice, confusion, and waste.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, although the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause gives \"a defendant the right not only to cross-examination, but to effective cross-examination,\" \" '[i]t does not follow ... that the Confrontation Clause prevents a trial judge from imposing\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   limits' on defense counsel's cross-examination of government witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556050\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/79/#p103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556050\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/79/#p103\">\n    712 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   103 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion-or violate the Confrontation Clause-in either of its evidentiary rulings. First, Agent Zacher's notes were hearsay not shown to fall within any exception, and were therefore inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 802. Sampson offered Agent Zacher's notes to prove the truth of their contents-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , he was offering them as an accurate reflection of what occurred during his interview with the FBI. This was improper. The district court explicitly allowed Sampson to raise the relevant information by cross-examining Agent Hosey without admitting the notes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App'x at 799 (\"You can ask [Agent Hosey about the structure of the interview] in a completely\n   different way that doesn't violate my ruling [that the notes are inadmissible].

Agent Zacher's notes, however, were inadmissible hearsay. The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow Sampson to introduce them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Second, the district court did not violate Sampson's Confrontation Clause rights by sustaining the government's objection to Sampson's question. As noted above, a district court can, consistent with the Confrontation Clause, impose reasonable limits on cross-examination to prevent \"harassment, prejudice, confusion, and waste.\"\n   <em>\n    Ulbricht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276296\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/71/#p118\">\n    858 F.3d at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556050\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/79/#p103\">\n    712 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   103 ). Here, the trial transcript provides ample basis for the district court's apparent view that, in asking Agent Hosey about Sampson's denial, Sampson's attorney was \"trying ... to work an end run around [the district court's] rulings\" by referring to evidence that the district court had already deemed inadmissible hearsay (that is, Agent Zacher's notes). T. 2182. This ruling did not exceed the bounds of the \"broad discretion\" afforded to district courts in limiting the \"scope and extent\" of cross-examination.\n   <em>\n    Ulbricht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276296\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/71/#p118\">\n    858 F.3d at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556050\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/79/#p103\">\n    712 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   103 ). The district court did not forbid Sampson's attorney from continuing with this line of questioning\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , and Sampson's attorney did not attempt to rephrase the question, but instead moved on. Under these circumstances, we do not believe the district court violated Sampson's Confrontation Clause rights in sustaining the government's objection to a single question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    V\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Next, Sampson argues that it was unfairly prejudicial for the district court to admit evidence that Sampson had allegedly engaged in bribery. The government sought a pretrial ruling that it could introduce evidence that Sampson had engaged in political favors for Ahmad once Sampson made clear that he would not repay the money he had borrowed. The district court allowed the government to present this evidence at trial for (at least) two different purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As a result, Sampson argues, \u00a7 201(b)(2)(A) no longer reaches his conduct with respect to Ahmad and the $188,500 loan, so that this conduct is not currently a \"federal offense\" under \u00a7 1512(b)(3). Because the jury ultimately acquitted Sampson on the charges that he violated \u00a7 1512(b)(3), this issue is largely moot. Nonetheless, Sampson now argues that\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   makes clear that the evidence of his alleged bribery was unfairly prejudicial at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   We disagree. \"Under Rule 403, so long as the district court has conscientiously balanced the proffered evidence's probative value with the risk for prejudice, its conclusion will be disturbed only if it is arbitrary or irrational.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, the evidence of Sampson's purported bribery was highly probative-and not merely for the purposes of demonstrating that he violated \u00a7 1512(b)(3). The prosecution's theory was that Sampson\n   <em>\n    thought\n   </em>\n   that he was committing a federal offense-a belief that a person in his position might well have entertained, given our Circuit's pre-\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Silver\n   </em>\n   , 864 F.3d at 118-19 &amp; n.88.

First, Sampson argues that the district court improperly imposed an additional 16-level enhancement to his offense level per U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2X3.1 and 2B1.1(b). Second, he claims that the district court erred in imposing an \"abuse of public trust\" enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. Third, he insists that the district court failed to provide an adequate justification for varying upward from the Guidelines sentencing range of 37 to 46 months. Finally, he contends that his sentence creates \"unwarranted disparities.\" Br. for Def.-Appellant at 61. We reject all four of Sampson's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The 16-Level Enhancement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Section 2J1.2(c) of the Sentencing Guidelines instructs that if an individual commits an offense that involves obstructing a criminal investigation or prosecution, the sentencing court should apply \u00a7 2X3.1, the Guideline for \"accessory after the fact.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(c) (2016). Pursuant to \u00a7 2X3.1(a)(1), except in circumstances not applicable here, an individual's base offense level should be six levels lower than the offense level for the underlying offense. Application Note 1 to \u00a7 2X3.1 explains that the sentencing court should \"[a]pply the base offense level [for the underlying offense] plus any applicable special offense characteristics that were known, or reasonably should have been known, by the defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Because Sampson was convicted of endeavoring to obstruct Ahmad's criminal prosecution for mortgage fraud, the district court referred to \u00a7 2B1.1-the Guideline for \"fraud and deceit\"-to calculate what the offense level might have been for Ahmad's underlying mortgage fraud. Section 2B1.1(b)(1) imposes a \"special offense characteristic\" enhancement for fraud, depending on the amount of the loss,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Application Note 3(A). Under \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(I), if the intended or actual loss caused by the fraud was for more than $1.5 million, the sentencing court should increase the defendant's sentence by 16 levels. Read in conjunction with Application Note 1 to \u00a7 2X3.1, then, the district court should have imposed this 16-level sentence enhancement only if Sampson \"kn[ew], or reasonably should have ... known\" that Ahmad had committed fraud, and that this fraud was for a sum greater than $1.5 million. At sentencing, the district court concluded, \"based on the evidence that was adduced at trial and the inferences that could be drawn from it,\" that Sampson either knew or should have known that Ahmad was engaging in a fraud of this scale-to wit, approximately $3 million. App'x at 1114-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Sampson argues that \"[t]here [was] no factual basis\" for the district court \"to conclude that Sampson knew or should have known Ahmad committed fraud, let alone a fraud\" over the requisite $1.5 million threshold. Br. for Def.-Appellant 51. Because Sampson is challenging the district court's factual findings on this issue, we may vacate only if the district court committed clear error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ulbricht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276296\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/71/#p118\">\n    858 F.3d at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"To hold that a factual finding is 'clearly erroneous,' we must be left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276296\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/71/#p118\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the [sentencing judge's] choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276296\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/71/#p118\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Here, there was no \"clear error\" in the district court's determination that Sampson knew (or reasonably should have known) about Ahmad's mortgage fraud, as well as its value. First and foremost, the evidence suggests that Sampson was aware that New York State regulators were investigating Ahmad's business, and he knew that Ahmad had received inquiries from these regulators concerning forged signatures on some of Ahmad's documents. Sampson even advised Ahmad to submit an affidavit denying that Ahmad knew about the forged signatures, and told him that he \"should let Prem [Ahmad's business partner] take the blame on this,\" since \"Prem didn't have anything to lose.\" App'x at 197. Furthermore, during a recorded conversation, Sampson strongly implied that he understood that Ahmad was committing fraud, and told Ahmad that he needed to use different language when conversing with him in the future so that Sampson would have plausible deniability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't App'x at 76-77 (\"[AHMAD:] '[F]or example, Nazir, he bought houses for me. Steve bought houses for me.' ... [SAMPSON:] 'He didn't buy houses, no, no, no, Ed, he did not buy houses for you. You and Nazir, you're an investor [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ]. Nobody bought houses for you. You got to get that mindset out. Nobody bought houses for you.\"). In addition, during his recorded conversation with Flagg, Sampson expressed familiarity with the government's publicly filed indictment in Ahmad's case, which alleged that Ahmad's fraud was worth over $50 million. Given the evidence that Sampson knew of Ahmad's wealth, and that he knew Ahmad was engaging in fraud to augment this wealth, we do not believe that it was \"clear error\" for the district court to conclude that, at the very least, Sampson \"should have known\" that Ahmad was defrauding individuals in an amount greater than $1.5 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Abuse of Public Trust Enhancement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Section \u00a7 3B1.3 of the Guidelines instructs that if the defendant \"abused a position of public or private trust, or used\n   a special skill, in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense,\" the sentencing court should increase the defendant's sentence by two levels. The district court held that this enhancement was warranted because \"a lot of what [Sampson] did actually involved his status as an attorney.\" App'x at 1115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \"The determination of whether a defendant utilized a position of trust or special skill in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense is a question of fact reviewed for clear error.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, the district court did not clearly err in determining that Sampson utilized his \"special skill[s]\" as an attorney to \"significantly facilitate[ ]\" the commission of the offense. Comment 4 to \u00a7 3B1.3 defines \"special skill\" as \"a skill not possessed by members of the general public and usually requiring substantial education, training, or licensing,\" and lists \"lawyers\" as a class of individuals possessing a \"special skill.\" The district court determined that Sampson relied on his skills as an attorney in his endeavors to obstruct justice, including: (1) his knowledge of \"how criminal cases developed,\" and at what point in the investigatory process \"witnesses would be identified\"; (2) his knowledge of how the USAO worked, so that he could give specific directions to Noel; (3) his knowledge of the criminal justice system so that he could instruct Flagg accordingly in terms of acquiring information; and (4) his \"knowledge and relationships developed as an attorney in criminal cases\" in determining which attorneys to hire for Ahmad's co-defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App'x at 1115-17. The fact that Sampson's offenses did not directly relate to his status as an attorney and could have been committed by a layperson is \"immaterial,\" because the dispositive question is simply whether Sampson's \"special skills increase[d] his chances of succeeding or of avoiding detection.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Sampson's opening brief on appeal does not discuss nationwide sentencing disparities, focusing solely on the Skelos sentence. And although Sampson's reply brief includes, in a footnote, a statistic on nationwide sentences for obstruction and federal false statement convictions, it is well-settled that we will not usually entertain an argument made for the first time in a reply brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knipe v.
