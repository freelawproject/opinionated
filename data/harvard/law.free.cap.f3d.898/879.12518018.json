In 2004, the California legislature expanded the list of eligible \"benefits\" to include employer payments to third-party industry advancement funds (\"IAFs\"). But there's a catch. Since 2017, employers may take a wage-credit for IAF contributions only if their employees consent to doing so through a collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") negotiated by a union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs-Appellants Interpipe Contracting, Inc. (\"Interpipe\") and Associated Builders and Contractors of California Cooperation Committee, Inc. (\"ABC-CCC\") challenge an amendment to the labor code that imposed the 2017 wage-credit limitation on these types of contributions. They argue that the amendment, SB 954, 2016 Leg., 2015-2016 Reg. Sess. (Cal. 2016), violates their constitutional rights because,\n   they contend, it discriminates against pro-open shop advocacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellants' challenges require us to answer two questions. First, we must decide whether SB 954 is preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (\"NLRA\") because it regulates an aspect of labor relations that Congress intended to leave to market forces, or because it regulates non-coercive labor speech. Second, if SB 954 is not preempted, we must decide whether it violates the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause by limiting the ability of certain IAFs to raise funds to finance their speech. Because we conclude that ABC-CCC lacks standing to press its equal protection claim, and because we hold that SB 954 is neither preempted by the NLRA nor infringes ABC-CCC's First Amendment rights, we affirm the district court's judgment dismissing Appellants' action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Since 1931, California has required contractors on public works projects to pay their employees a \"prevailing wage.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201770\">\n    Cal.

To close this loophole, in 2016 the state legislature amended \u00a7 1773.1 with SB 954-the law at issue here. SB 954 clarifies that subsection (9) allows wage crediting only for \"other purposes similar to those specified in paragraphs (6) to (8), inclusive,\n   <em>\n    if the payments are made pursuant to a [CBA] to which the employer is obligated\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201773.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1773.1(a)(9) (2017) (emphasis added). Thus, since SB 954 went into effect on January 1, 2017, it has been clear that employers may reduce payments to employees to support their contributions to IAFs only if doing so is approved by their employees through a CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Interpipe is a plumbing and pipeline contractor that favors \"open shop\" employment arrangements and opposes project labor agreements (\"PLAs\") on public works projects. \"Open shop\" is labor vernacular for projects involving an employer that has no formal contracts with a labor union, and where both unionized and non-unionized labor is permitted.\n   <em>\n    Del Turco v.

Nor does ABC-CCC suggest that SB 954 prevents employers (and employees for that matter) from contributing to ABC-CCC. Instead, it advances a novel First Amendment theory: that it has a protected First Amendment right to\n   <em>\n    receive\n   </em>\n   the employee-subsidized funds from Interpipe and other employers.

Far from taking aim at IAFs' speech, SB 954 is, instead, a generally applicable wage law that targets employer use of employee wages, does not single out pro-open shop IAFs, and only indirectly affects one possible revenue source for IAFs. Indeed, the law leaves ABC-CCC free to solicit funds from employers,\n   employees, or anyone else. That ABC-CCC may now need to explore alternative means of raising funds to finance its speech does not somehow transform a minimum wage law into a regulation of expressive conduct. SB 954 is therefore more akin to generally applicable economic regulations affecting rather than targeting news publications that the Court has found pass constitutional muster.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196893\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/575/#p585\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196893\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/575/#p585\">\n    at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196893\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/575/#p585\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is beyond dispute that the States and the Federal Government can subject newspapers to generally applicable economic regulations without creating constitutional problems.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   To be sure, the Supreme Court has not drawn a bright line distinguishing conduct-based laws that permissibly burden speech from those that do not. But three considerations back a requirement that, in order to trigger First Amendment scrutiny, a conduct-based law must (1) target a particular type of entity for differential treatment, and (2) regulate the ingredients necessary to effectuate that entity's First Amendment rights. First, a law regulating conduct that merely alters incentives rather than restricts the ingredients necessary for speech does not regulate conduct that is \"inherently expressive\"-a necessary trait of an impermissible conduct-based regulation.\n   <em>\n    FAIR II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276625\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/47/#p65\">\n    547 U.S. at 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276625\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/47/#p65\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Pickup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3826018\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/1208/#p1225\">\n    740 F.3d at 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, applying the First Amendment to conduct that has only an indirect effect on speech would task the courts with unwieldy line drawing exercises: how indirectly related to speech must a conduct-based restriction be to avoid First Amendment scrutiny? Third, scrapping conduct-based laws that have only an attenuated relationship to speech would have the perverse effect of invalidating legitimate exercises of state authority to protect the general health and welfare. A labor standard like SB 954 that ensures employee approval before their wages are rerouted to third-party advocacy groups would, under ABC-CCC's theory, be subject to scrutiny simply because it\n   <em>\n    affects\n   </em>\n   ABC-CCC's ability to finance its speech. That cannot be the law. Accordingly, because SB 954 regulates conduct that is not \"inherently expressive,\" we hold that it does not regulate ABC-CCC's speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, we consider whether SB 954 limits a state subsidy on speech in a viewpoint discriminatory way. \"[A] legislature's decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right ....\"\n   <em>\n    Regan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298910\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/540/#p549\">\n    461 U.S. at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298910\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/540/#p549\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Further, the legitimacy of a State's limitation on a speech subsidy is all the more apparent where it withdraws a policy that facilitates compulsory subsidization of others' expression.

Second, that unionized employees are unlikely to fund an anti-union IAF over a pro-union one is beside the point: A facially neutral statute restricting expression for a legitimate end is not discriminatory simply because it\n   <em>\n    affects\n   </em>\n   some groups more than others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.A.V. v.

Just as LSPCs remain free to express their anti-abortion views however they wish, SB 954 leaves ABC-CCC and other IAFs-regardless of viewpoint-free to engage in whatever speech they like.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In fact, SB 954 is planted on even firmer constitutional ground than the ordinance in\n   <em>\n    First Resort\n   </em>\n   for two reasons. First, whereas the law there regulated the aggrieved party, First Resort, SB 954 does not regulate ABC-CCC or other IAFs\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   . At most, SB 954 indirectly\n   <em>\n    affects\n   </em>\n   ABC-CCC. This fact attenuates any concern that the law targets ABC-CCC's speech. Second, whereas\n   <em>\n    First Resort\n   </em>\n   concerned possible infringement of LSPCs' First Amendment rights, SB 954 goes some way toward\n   <em>\n    remedying\n   </em>\n   an encumbrance on the First Amendment rights of others-namely, employees on public works projects. Indeed, if ABC-CCC were to prevail here and California's prevailing wage law reverted to its pre-SB 954 state-whereby employers could deduct employee wages to support the employers' favored IAFs without employee consent-the result would likely be an infringement of\n   <em>\n    employees'\n   </em>\n   First Amendment right to contribute to causes of\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   choosing. \"As Jefferson famously put it, 'to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhor[s] is sinful and tyrannical.' \"\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 2464 (quoting A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, in 2 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 545 (J.

SB 954's averred objective is to close a loophole in California's prevailing wage law by requiring collective employee consent before an employer may divert employee wages to IAFs. ABC-CCC argues that SB 954 is overinclusive because it disallows individual employees from agreeing to the IAF wage-credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   ABC-CCC's argument is unavailing because it loses sight of the law's purpose. SB 954 is part of a larger statutory scheme setting a wage floor for employees on public works projects. The prevailing wage requirement means an employer may not deny an individual employment because she is unwilling to negotiate down a minimum wage and instead hire an employee who is. Allowing individual employees to negotiate wage credits for employers' IAF contributions as ABC-CCC suggests would effectively circumvent this prohibition. Employers could pit prospective employees against each other and hire only those who agreed to take the wage deduction, thereby rendering employee \"consent\" illusory. That risk is relatively low under a unionized CBA arrangement because employers in that context cannot coerce individual employees into agreeing to a below-floor wage. Thus, because the legislature did not unreasonably determine that individual employees are not similarly situated to unions in negotiating wage credits, SB 954 is not overinclusive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   A law's underinclusiveness may also indicate viewpoint discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Underinclusiveness raises serious doubts about whether the government is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

ABC-CCC's arguments are unpersuasive. First, although SB 954 does not require the unanimous consent of all employees, it certainly ensures a greater degree of consent than if employers could-as they were doing-freely reduce employees' wages without\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   form of employee consent. Thus, while SB 954 might not \"address all aspects of a problem,\" it at least addresses lawmakers' \"most pressing concerns.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, the fact that some employees may disapprove of their union's decision not to agree to a wage deduction in support of a particular IAF simply reflects the inherently representative nature of unions. As with any representative arrangement, if a majority of employees disagrees with the outcome of a negotiated CBA, they can vote for a new union representative or dump the union entirely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Second, the notion that deductions for pension plans and the like must be subject to the same consent requirement fails to account for SB 954's declared purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . Pension plans, training programs, and worker assistance programs all share a common denominator: they directly benefit employees. Allowing wage credits for those programs is therefore reasonably tailored to the purpose of the prevailing wage law: setting a compensation floor for employee pay. IAFs like ABC-CCC, by contrast, focus not on programs directly benefitting employees, but on public policy advocacy\n   and, as ABC-CCC puts it, \"precedential issues of importance to the construction industry.\" To that end, ABC-CCC spends funds on distributing mailers to voters, underwriting academic articles, providing testimony to governmental bodies, and hosting seminars for contractors that promote open shop employment arrangements. These activities, which are geared at promoting the interests of the construction industry, have only an attenuated relationship to employee interests. Treating IAFs differently from employee-focused programs therefore makes sense in light of the objectives of California's prevailing wage law. Accordingly, requiring employee consent for IAF contributions and not others fits snugly with SB 954's purpose and is not underinclusive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \"Given that [SB 954 does] not infringe[ ] [ABC-CCC's] First Amendment rights, the State need only demonstrate a rational basis to justify the ban on [wage-crediting IAF contributions].\"\n   <em>\n    Ysursa\n   </em>\n   , 555 U.S. at 359,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679544\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/353/#p358\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . SB 954 easily clears this low bar. California has a legitimate interest in enacting a prevailing wage law to protect its workers, and SB 954 is rationally related to that purpose because it prevents employers from deducting their employees' wages to support the employers' preferred IAFs absent their employees' collective consent.
