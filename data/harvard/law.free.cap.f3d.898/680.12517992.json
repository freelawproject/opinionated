After all,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was not decided until June 26, 2015, well after Raines's direct appeal was decided on June 11, 2013.

Raines filed his \u00a7 2255 motion on May 11, 2016, and the district court construed that motion as raising a claim based on\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was decided on June 26, 2015, and was made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   , 136 S.Ct. at 1265, 1268.

It contends that, even without the ACCA enhancement, Raines would still be considered a career offender under the United States Sentencing Guidelines because he has at least two prior convictions for controlled-substance offenses or crimes of violence. Under the concurrent-sentence doctrine, \"an appellate court may decline to hear a substantive challenge to a conviction when the sentence on the challenged conviction is being served concurrently with an equal or longer sentence on a valid conviction,\" the defendant will suffer no collateral consequence from the conviction, and the issue does not involve a significant question.\n   <em>\n    Dale v.

But the Guidelines are not binding, and, in any event, the low end of this range is below the statutory minimum (180-month) sentence that Raines received under the ACCA.

Section 894(a)(1) therefore does not qualify as a generic extortion offense under the categorical approach. The Fourth Circuit has recognized as much, noting that a crime that \"involves the\n   <em>\n    non-consensual\n   </em>\n   taking of money or property from another\" cannot qualify as a generic extortion crime because it does not involve a taking with the victim's\n   <em>\n    induced\n   </em>\n   consent.\n   <em>\n    Gardner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5917339\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/793/\">\n    823 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   802 n.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Furthermore, even setting aside the element of induced consent, \u00a7 894(a)(1) is broader than the generic offense of extortion in another material respect.

More to the point, \u00a7 2244(b)(4) focuses on what a \"claim\" requires, while \u00a7 2255(h) focuses on what a \"motion must ... contain.\" This \"difference in language\"-in one section, what a claim requires; in the other, what a motion requires-\"demands a difference in meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Gallo v. Moen Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087565\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/265/#p270\">\n    813 F.3d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 270 (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   If a petitioner in Welch's boat-a conviction that qualifies under two ACCA prongs-can clear the \"constitutional\" gate to bring a habeas petition, then a petitioner with a murkier record should also be entitled to clear that gate and bring a second-or-successive petition. When a petitioner's sentencing record is unclear as to\n   which clause the petitioner was sentenced under, the petitioner satisfies the \"new constitutional rule\" requirement so long as the challenge includes a claim under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, petitioners with an ambiguous sentencing record have an even better argument for bringing a petition because any\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   error would not be harmless (as it could be for petitioners who were expressly sentenced under another clause).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   It is no surprise that other case law points the same way. Applying the so-called\n   <em>\n    Stromberg\n   </em>\n   principle, the Supreme Court has explained that \"where a provision of the Constitution forbids conviction on a particular ground, the constitutional guarantee is violated by a general verdict that may have rested on that ground.\"\n   <em>\n    Griffin v.

If a defendant's sentence \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have rested on\" a particular ground that \"the Constitution forbids,\" then it is an easy extension of\n   <em>\n    Stromberg\n   </em>\n   to see that a sentence is invalid also.\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217781\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/46/#p53\">\n    502 U.S. at 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217781\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/46/#p53\">\n    112 S.Ct. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Likewise,\n   <em>\n    Potter\n   </em>\n   seemed motivated in part by a concern that prisoners would deliberately refrain from objecting to their presentence report at sentencing if they did not have the burden to prove that they were only sentenced under the residual clause. But the Supreme Court recently rejected a similar \"strange incentives\" rationale as \"highly speculative\" and \"fail[ing] to account for the realities at play in sentencing proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Rosales-Mireles v.

We should not make it harder. To be consistent with\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   , we should not require a second-or-successive habeas petitioner to show that a sentence was based only on the residual clause.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
