Iipay's tribal lands are located in San Diego County, California. Iipay operated a traditional, brick-and-mortar casino on its tribal lands, but the casino failed and Iipay no longer conducts traditional gambling activity at the casino.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-11\">\n   In an effort to revitalize its gaming revenue stream, Iipay launched Desert Rose Bingo (\"DRB\"). DRB is a server-based bingo game that allows patrons to play computerized bingo over the internet. Like traditional bingo, participants in DRB purchase cards labeled with a grid of numbers. Numbers are then drawn and, if the numbers drawn correspond with the numbers on the player's card, the numbers on the card are covered or \"daubed.\" A player wins by daubing numbers on the card in a pre-determined pattern.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-12\">\n   Iipay operated DRB through its wholly owned subsidiary, Santa Ysabel Interactive (\"SYI\"), on a set of servers that are located in Iipay's now-defunct casino on tribal lands. Unlike other computerized bingo games, Iipay does not provide any physical computer terminals located on Iipay's tribal lands at which patrons can play DRB. Instead, Iipay offered DRB to all California residents over 18 years of age exclusively through the internet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-13\">\n   A patron must access DRB by navigating to desertrosebingo.com using a web browser on a computer or other internet-enabled device, such as a tablet or cell phone. The patron must then register, create an account, and fund the account (either via a credit card or an electronic funds transfer).\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-14\">\n   After a patron has funded his account, he can select a bingo game in which to participate, ranging in value from $.01 to $1.00. Once the patron selects a denomination of game in which to participate, the patron is presented with a \"Request Form\" popup window. In the Request Form window, the patron selects the number of games he would like to participate in (up to five games), the number of cards per game the patron would like to play (up to 500 cards per game), and the \"playback theme\" the patron would like the post-game video to appear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the patron is satisfied with his selection of denomination of game, number of games, and number of cards, the patron clicks the \"Submit Request!\" button on the Request Form. The patron is then presented with a \"System Message\" stating that the request has been submitted and \"accepted\" by DRB. After the Request Form is submitted, the patron's account is debited for an amount equal to the denomination of game the patron chose, multiplied by the number of games and cards per game the patron selected.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the patron's request is accepted, the patron can view the request under the \"Requested\" tab on DRB's main page. The Requested tab shows the information from the Request Form-denomination of game, number of games, number of cards per game, and playback theme. The Requested tab also displays the number of \"proxies,\" which corresponds with the number of patrons registered to participate in the game, and a timer. Once the number of patrons participating in the game reaches the pre-determined minimum number of participants set by DRB, the timer begins to count down.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-17\">\n   When the timer reaches zero, the patrons' wagers are logged as \"completed,\" and the outcome of the game is determined. Technically, by submitting the Request Form, the patron has appointed an individual located at the casino, on Iipay's tribal lands, as the patron's \"proxy.\" There is always one SYI employee located at the casino that serves as the \"Patron's Legally Designated Agent\" and is responsible for representing all patrons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-18\">\n   Serving as a Patron's Legally Designated Agent does not require any affirmative action, such as actually daubing the bingo card, by the proxy. Instead, the proxy is a passive observer and the DRB software automatically conducts all aspects of gameplay, from drawing the numbers to daubing the cards. Thus, the \"playing\" of the game requires no actual action on the part of the patron, the Patron's Designated Agent, or any other human. The last human action in a game of bingo conducted through DRB occurs when the patron clicks the \"Submit Request!\" button.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-19\">\n   Shortly after the game is completed, the patron can navigate to the \"Completed\" tab and view the results of the bingo game. Under the completed tab, the patron can choose to view a video replay of the completed bingo game, which is presented in the selected graphical theme (e.g., Jurassic). The replay video shows the bingo card the patron purchased and a video recreation of the numbers being drawn and daubed. At the end of the video, the patron is informed whether and how much the patron won. The patron's account is then credited with any winnings.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-20\">\n   Iipay launched DRB on November 3, 2014. On November 18, 2014, the State of California and the United States (collectively, the \"Government\") sued Iipay seeking injunctive relief prohibiting Iipay from continuing to operate DRB. On December 12, 2014, the district court issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting Iipay from continuing to operate DRB during the pendency of this litigation. DRB has remained dormant ever since.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-21\">\n   After discovery, the State of California and the United States filed separate motions for summary judgment. The State of California sought summary judgment on two grounds. First, California claimed that Iipay's operation of DRB violated the tribal-state compact between California and\n   Iipay regarding Class III gaming.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court rejected this argument, finding that DRB was a Class II game that was not subject to the tribal-state compact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-22\">\n   Second, California and the United States jointly argued that Iipay's operation of DRB violated the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (\"UIGEA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205361\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . Iipay argued that the UIGEA did not apply to its operation of DRB because DRB was conducted on tribal lands and, as a result, was legal under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (\"IGRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . The district court ruled that DRB violated the UIGEA and entered a permanent injunction prohibiting Iipay from operating DRB. Iipay appealed the district court's grant of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-23\">\n   II\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-24\">\n   We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo and may affirm on any ground supported by the record.\n   <em>\n    Phoenix Mem'l Hosp. v. Sebelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787993\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/1219/#p1224\">\n    622 F.3d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1224 (9th Cir. 2010). Statutory interpretation presents a question of law, which we also review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-25\">\n   III\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-26\">\n   This case presents an issue of first impression regarding the interrelation between IGRA and the UIGEA. No other circuit has opined on whether an Indian tribe can offer online gaming to patrons located off Indian lands in jurisdictions where such gambling is illegal. The issue hinges on the interpretation of the key provisions of IGRA and the UIEGA. Thus, to analyze this issue, it is helpful to review the statutory framework of IGRA and the UIEGA.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-27\">\n<em>\n    A. The Statutory Framework\n   </em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-28\">\n   IGRA was passed to provide a regime for regulating gaming on Indian lands. It provides that \"[a]ny class II gaming on Indian lands shall continue to be within the jurisdiction of the Indian tribes.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). As discussed above, DRB (like other forms of bingo, generally) is a Class II game.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 964 n.4. Thus, if DRB takes place on Indian lands, it is under Iipay's jurisdiction, provided Iipay complies with certain regulatory requirements that are not at issue here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-29\">\n   The UIGEA was passed to regulate online gambling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n<em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205361\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike\n   IGRA or other gambling regulations, the UIGEA does not make gambling legal or illegal directly. Instead, the UIGEA makes it illegal for a \"person engaged in the business of betting or wagering\" knowingly to accept certain financial payments from an individual who is engaged in \"unlawful Internet gambling.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205363\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlawful internet gambling occurs when an individual places or receives a \"bet or wager by any means which involves the use, at least in part, of the Internet where such bet or wager is unlawful under any applicable Federal or State law in the State or Tribal lands\n   <em>\n    in which the bet or wager is initiated, received, or otherwise made\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205362\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10)(A) (emphasis added). A \"bet or wager\" includes \"staking or risking\" something of value, purchasing a lottery ticket, or transmitting \"any instructions or information pertaining to the establishment or movement of funds by the bettor or customer in, to, or from an account with the business of betting or wagering.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205362\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-30\">\n   Thus, the UIGEA does not prohibit otherwise legal gambling. But the UIGEA does create a system in which a \"bet or wager\" must be legal both where it is \"initiated\" and where it is \"received.\" This requirement makes sense in light of how the internet operates. If a bet merely had to be legal where it was received, a bettor could place an illegal bet (on a game of poker, for instance) from anywhere in the United States, so long as the bet was legal in the jurisdiction hosting the servers for a game (Las Vegas or Atlantic City, for instance, in the case of online poker). In effect, the UIGEA prevents using the internet to circumvent existing state and federal gambling laws, but it does not create any additional substantive prohibitions.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-31\">\n<em>\n    B. Iipay's Operation of DRB Violates the UIGEA\n   </em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties' main point of contention is whether the \"gaming activity\" related to DRB occurs exclusively \"on Indian lands\" and, thus, under Iipay's jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Iipay contends that the \"gaming activities\" related to DRB consists of the operation of the servers on Iipay's lands, which determine the patterns on the bingo cards, draw the numbers, and daub the cards. Iipay argues that any activity conducted by the patrons outside of Iipay's lands-such as selecting the denomination and number of games the patron would like to participate in and submitting the patron's request through DRB's website-are merely pre-game communications between the patron and the Patron's Designated Agent. Finally, Iipay argues that, to the extent the terms \"gaming activities\" or\n   \"on Indian lands\" are ambiguous, they must be construed in Iipay's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    Cty. of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes &amp; Bands of Yakima Indian Nation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224802\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/251/#p269\">\n    502 U.S. 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 269,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224802\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/251/#p269\">\n    112 S.Ct. 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224802\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/251/#p269\">\n    116 L.Ed.2d 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) (stating that statutes are to be construed liberally in favor of Indian tribes and ambiguities should be resolved in their favor).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Government argues, consistent with the district court's opinion, that \"gaming activity\" is not ambiguous. Citing\n   <em>\n    Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community.\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707007,7343111\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2024/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707007\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/782/\">\n    188 L.Ed.2d 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), the Government contends that \"gaming activity\" under IGRA is \"the gambling in the poker hall,\" as opposed to \"off-site licensing or operation of the games.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n<em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2032-33. The Government argues that the \"gambling\" in this instance, is the patron's decision to wager money on the bingo game, which occurs off Indian lands.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-34\">\n   We reject Iipay's argument that the patron's decision to submit a requested wager of a particular monetary denomination is merely a pre-gaming communication with the patron's designated proxy. The district court found that it was uncontested that the act of clicking \"Submit Request!\" by a patron was a \"bet or wager\" within the meaning of the UIGEA. The district court based this finding on the fact that the patrons were staking something of value on the outcome of the bingo game, but the court could have just as easily found that the patrons were giving \"instructions or information pertaining to the establishment\n   or movement of funds by the bettor or customer in, to, or from an account with the business of betting or wagering.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205362\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). Additionally, the district court found that DRB's patrons were located in California when they clicked the \"Submit Request!\" button and that betting on bingo violates California law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20330\">\n    Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (prohibiting \"percentage games\"). Iipay does not contest these findings on appeal.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-35\">\n   Two key conclusions can be drawn from these uncontested findings. First, as the Government argues, the patrons are engaging in \"gaming activity\" by initiating a bet or a wager in California and off Indian lands. Consistent with the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Bay Mills\n   </em>\n   , the act of placing a bet or wager is the \"gambling in the poker hall,\" not \"off-site licensing or operation of the games.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707007,7343111\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2024/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2032-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, it seems clear that at least some of the \"gaming activity\" associated with DRB does not occur on Indian lands and is thus not subject to Iipay's jurisdiction under IGRA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, these uncontested facts undermine Iipay's position that IGRA can shield DRB from the application of the UIGEA. Iipay has admitted that patrons initiate bets or wagers within the meaning of the UIGEA while located in California, where those bets are illegal. Even if DRB is completely legal in the place where the bet is accepted, on Iipay's lands, the bets are not legal in the jurisdiction where they are\n   <em>\n    initiated\n   </em>\n   , in this case California.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, when Iipay accepts financial payments over the internet as part of those bets or wagers, Iipay violates the UIGEA.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-37\">\n   In this respect, Iipay's argument regarding proxies actually works against Iipay's position. Iipay argues that the patron's action in selecting a wager amount and clicking \"Submit Request!\" is pre-gaming communication with the proxy, not \"gaming activity.\" But if clicking \"Submit Request!\" is not \"gaming activity\" within the meaning of IGRA, but merely an administrative issue, it cannot be protected by IGRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<em>\n    Bay Mills\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707007,7343111\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2024/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2032-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that IGRA's provisions do not apply to administrative activities that are unrelated to the \"gambling in the poker hall\"). That conduct is, however, subject to the provisions of the UIGEA as a \"bet or wager\" initiated through the internet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, whether Iipay is\n   correct that no \"gaming activity\" occurs off Indian lands or not, Iipay's operation of DRB violates the UIGEA.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-38\">\n   Iipay argues strenuously that this analysis is flawed because any determination regarding the legality of DRB must be made exclusively through examining IGRA, without reference to the UIGEA. This is so, Iipay contends, because the UIGEA does not contain any substantive prohibitions on previously legal gambling and expressly provides that \"no provision\" of the UIGEA \"shall be construed as altering, limiting, or extending any Federal or State law or Tribal-State compact prohibiting, permitting, or regulating gambling within the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205361\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, Iipay argues, if DRB would have been legal in the absence of the UIGEA, it must remain legal after the UIGEA's passage.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-39\">\n   On this point, Iipay's argument fails for two reasons. First, absent a direct conflict, courts should give effect to co-existing federal statutes.\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6225793\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/249/#p253\">\n    503 U.S. 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 253,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6513849,6225793\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/112/1146/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6225793\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/249/#p253\">\n    117 L.Ed.2d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). Here, there is no direct conflict between IGRA and the UIGEA and, thus, we give effect to the provisions of both statutes.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, although Iipay is correct that the UIGEA does not alter IGRA, that does not mean that the UIGEA did not outlaw certain financial transactions associated with gaming on Indian lands facilitated by the internet, a topic on which IGRA is silent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, Congress clearly contemplated that the UIGEA might apply to games played on Indian lands because it specifically exempted certain intra- and inter-tribal games from the UIGEA's scope.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n<extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205362\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10)(C) (exempting bets or wagers \"initiated and received or otherwise made exclusively\" on a single tribe's land or multiple tribal lands, provided that the relevant tribal ordinances and regulations permit such bets or wagers).\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-41\">\n   What Iipay's arguments fail to acknowledge is that the UIGEA does not have to make DRB the game illegal in order to make Iipay's operation of that game-specifically, its decision to accept wagers and financial payments over the internet from patrons located in California-illegal. Whether DRB is permitted by IGRA or not, Iipay's operation of DRB violates the UIGEA's requirement that bets placed over the internet be legal both where they are initiated and where they are received. Thus, it can be true that the UIGEA did not alter IGRA, and it can also be true that DRB is subject to and violates the UIGEA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-42\">\n   In summary, Iipay is correct that IGRA protects gaming activity conducted on Indian lands.
