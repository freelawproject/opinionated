In 2011, without authorization, he purchased\n   oil futures contracts using the firm's trading account and transferred those contracts between firm accounts. In company records, Wang marked these contracts as closed (sold) when they were, in fact, still open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After the firm discovered the transactions, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Wang. The one-count indictment alleged that, upon discovery of a loss of $2.2 million, the firm sold the contracts. Wang pleaded guilty to violating the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) by Making a False Report in Connection with a Commodities Transaction in violation of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6b(a)(1)(B) and \u00a7 13(a)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court sentenced Wang to three months in prison, with three years supervised release, and ordered him to pay $2.2 million in restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Attorney General initiated removal proceedings on March 19, 2015, charging Wang with removability by classifying his conviction as an aggravated felony under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) section 237(a)(2)(A)(iii).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Immigration Judge ordered Wang removed on June 4, 2015, and the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed. Wang now petitions us to review the Board's order, challenging its ruling that the District Court convicted him of an aggravated felony. For the reasons that follow we will grant his petition and remand the case to the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although we have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), \"no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section ... 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) [aggravated felony].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(C). We do, however, have jurisdiction to examine \"constitutional claims or questions of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Catwell v.

Therefore, we have authority to take up the issue, using the de novo standard, of whether Wang's conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony because it is \"a purely legal question, and one that governs our own jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Valansi v.

Wang disputes the Board's ruling on both prongs. His first challenge focuses on the language of the statute of conviction which reads: \"It shall be unlawful ... (B) willfully to make or\n   cause to be made to the other person any false report or statement or willfully to enter or cause to be entered for the other person any false record.\" Section 6b(a)(1)(B). He is not properly categorized as an aggravated felon, he contends, because crimes \"involv[ing] fraud or deceit\" require materiality as an element of proof and Section 6b(a)(1)(B) lacks this element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Immigration Judge brushed aside Wang's materiality argument. He reasoned that Wang was properly classified as an aggravated felon because, under Section 101(a)(43)(M)(i) of the INA, \"deceit\" was understood to include crimes of falsification-like Section 6b(a)(1)(B) -without regard to materiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal, the Board affirmed the Immigration Judge's removal order, but it moved the focus of its decision away from interpreting the INA and towards an analysis of the criminal statute. The Board concluded that it was \"unnecessary\" in this case to decide if the INA required materiality because \"all relevant portions [of Section 6b(a)(1) ] require materiality.\" Fan Wang, A088 152 814, 1, 3 (BIA 2016). Wang challenges both the Immigration Judge's interpretation of the INA and the Board's conclusions about Section 6b(a)(1)(B), but our review encompasses only the Board's interpretation of the criminal statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Whether Section 6b(a)(1)(B) requires proof of materiality, for purposes of the INA, is a matter of first impression for us.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We use a categorical approach to analyze the statute of conviction, examining only the elements of the offense to establish whether the petitioner committed a crime involving fraud or deceit.\n   <em>\n    Kawashima v.

But the Board concluded it was necessary to refer to the common law to understand this subsection. The Government supplements the Board's reasoning by urging us to read Section 6b(a)(1)(B) as inextricably intertwined with the provisions that surround it. We see flaws in both analyses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Picking up, in part, on the Immigration Judge's reasoning, the Board emphasized the conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Kawashima\n   </em>\n   that Section 101(a)(43)(M)(i) of the INA \"refers more broadly to offenses that 'involv[e]' fraud or deceit-meaning offenses with elements that necessarily entail fraudulent or deceitful conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Kawashima\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186613\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/478/#p483\">\n    565 U.S. at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186613\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/478/#p483\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Relying then on the common law of deceit, the Board concluded that Section 6b(a)(1)(B) is an aggravated felony because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [A]s understood at common law, 'deceit' required that any false statement made be material. Thus, because the common law concepts of fraud and deceit required materiality, the materiality requirement was carried forward when concepts were codified in 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6b(a), prohibiting contracts designed to defraud or mislead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Fan Wang, A088 152 814, 5 (BIA 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"We ... presume that Congress incorporates the common-law meaning of the terms it uses if those 'terms ... have accumulated settled meaning under ... the common law' and 'the statute [does not] otherwise dictat[e].' \"\n   <em>\n    Wells\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11596238\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/482/#p483\">\n    519 U.S. at 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11596238\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/482/#p483\">\n    117 S.Ct. 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mut.

Therefore, the analysis in cases like\n   <em>\n    UMIC\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    JBW\n   </em>\n   might be persuasive in a case in which the crime involved false reports in combination with either fraud ( Section 6b(a)(1)(A) ), deceit ( Section 6b(a)(1)(C) ), or both.

Reports reflecting these manual entries were transmitted in interstate commerce to Company-1's accounting department located in Chicago, Illinois.....

Fan Wang (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (No. 14 Cr. 411). Finally, the November 19, 2014 judgment specified a \"total loss\" of $2.2 million. Judgement, 11/17/14, at 5, United States v. Fan Wang (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (No. 14 Cr. 411). The District Court ordered Wang to pay restitution in this amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Wang is convinced that the Government never proved that his crime (making false reports) caused the $2.2 million loss. He makes a number of arguments to support this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   He first maintains that the Immigration Judge and the Board improperly treated the allegation on loss in the indictment as part of his admission of guilt at the time of his plea. He says that he never admitted this,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   and declares that he actually disputed\n   it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regardless of whether he admitted it, we disagree that the Board based its decision on a conclusion that Wang admitted to the loss. There is nothing in the record to support this, and the Board specifically affirmed the Immigration Judge's reliance on the District Court's judgment specifying a total loss amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Next, Wang stresses that the \"loss must be tied to the specific counts covered by the conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    Nijhawan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p38\">\n    557 U.S. at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p38\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   He then attacks the Board's use of the District Court's reference to a total loss of $2.2 million in its judgment. Wang says the loss was \"surplusage\" evidence (not necessary to prove the elements of his crime) and was, therefore, out of bounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   He supports his characterization of the evidence on loss by pointing to the fact that the District Court considered it during sentencing while it was reviewing \"relevant conduct\" under United States Sentencing Guideline Manual \u00a7 1B1.3.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pollard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"662122\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/986/44/\">\n    986 F.2d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 1993) (\"Relevant conduct\" includes uncharged conduct, beyond the offense of conviction.). He is convinced that a \"surplus\" allegation in an indictment, presented only as evidence of \"relevant conduct\" at sentencing, is plainly not tied to his convicted offense. Therefore, according to Wang's understanding of\n   <em>\n    Nijhawan,\n   </em>\n   it cannot be used as proof of loss for purpose of Section 101(a)(43)(M)(i) of the INA. Although he is right that evidence of loss was not needed for his conviction, we disagree with the conclusions he draws from this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   First, the Supreme Court made clear that when the Board considers loss under Section 101(a)(43)(M)(i) of the INA, it may go beyond evidence that is necessary to prove the elements of the crime and look at \"the specific way in which an offender committed the crime on a specific occasion.\"\n   <em>\n    Nijhawan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p38\">\n    557 U.S. at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p38\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It reasoned that, if the INA was interpreted as limiting the review of loss only to the evidence required for conviction in fraud crimes, it would effectively require \"obtaining from a jury a special verdict on a fact that ... is not an element of the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 42,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p38\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In practical terms, exclusion of sentencing-related materials would render Section 101(a)(43)(M)(i) virtually inapplicable to fraud crimes committed in jurisdictions that did not specify the $10,000 threshold as an element of the crime.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p38\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p38\">\n    at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p38\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Moreover, in this case, Wang had ample opportunity to challenge this evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p38\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p38\">\n    at 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p38\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For these reasons, it is clear that even though evidence of loss was not required for conviction, it was not beyond the limits of the Board's review as it deliberated on whether a crime is an aggravated felony under the INA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   But Wang's argument goes further, demanding that we scrutinize whether the\n   Government's reliance on this particular District Court judgment to meet its burden of proof is consistent with the INA's definition of loss.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Singh,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5732147,3870475\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/503/\">\n    677 F.3d at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   To justify the inquiry Wang segregates his unauthorized purchases of futures contracts (uncharged conduct) from his false reports on those purchases (conduct grounding his conviction) and argues that his employer's loss resulted only from his purchases, not his reports. The point of Wang's facile distinction is to tie the loss exclusively to uncharged conduct in the hope that, in this case, it will place it outside the definition of loss under the INA, even if it was relevant conduct for purposes of sentencing. Among the difficulties for Wang is that the Government presented this same evidence differently and more compellingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Government asserts that there is a direct link between Wang's crime and the loss because his false reports covered up his unauthorized purchases. By asserting this connection the Government is not denying that Wang's purchases were part of a causal chain that resulted in a loss. Rather, it is simply stating that the $2.2 million loss is undeniably tethered to the conduct for which Wang was convicted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is a convincing argument primarily because it avoids strained distinctions, and it plainly describes \"the specific way in which [the] offender committed the crime on [this] specific occasion.\"\n   <em>\n    Nijhawan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p38\">\n    557 U.S. at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658219\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/29/#p38\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
