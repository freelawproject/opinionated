California's Gun-Free School Zone Act of 1995 and Senate Bill 707\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 1994, the California Legislature (\"the Legislature\") enacted the Gun-Free School Zone Act, which banned the possession of firearms on school grounds and within school zones (the area within 1,000 feet of school grounds). Gun-Free School Zone Act of 1995, sec. 1, \u00a7 626.9(b), (e)(1),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1994%20Cal.%20Stat.%206191\">\n    1994 Cal. Stat. 6191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 6191-92. The Act exempted two groups: (1) individuals licensed to carry a concealed firearm under California law (\"CCW permit holders\"); and (2) \"retired peace officer[s] ... authorized to carry a loaded firearm\" (\"retired peace officers\"). \u00a7 626.9(l)-(m), 1994 Cal. Stat. at 6193.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2015, the Legislature considered an amendment to the Gun-Free School Zone Act, Senate Bill 707 (\"SB 707\"), that would give school officials control \"of who, if anyone,\" could bring firearms onto their campuses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cal. S. Comm. on Pub. Safety, Analysis of S.B. 707, 2015-2016 Reg. Sess., at 5 (Apr. 13, 2015). SB 707, sponsored by State Senator Lois Wolk, was introduced in response to the \"disturbing increase in the number of active shooter incidents on ... campuses across the country\" and the \"alarming number of sexual assaults on college and university campuses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Recognizing that \"some gun rights proponents\n   in other states ha[d] sponsored legislation to increase the opportunity for students and teachers to bring firearms on school campuses with CCWs, claiming this will deter\" sexual assaults and active shooters, Senator Wolk highlighted research \"indicat[ing] that bringing more firearms on campus will lead to more campus violence and increase the danger to students and others on campus.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Senator Wolk thus introduced SB 707 to \"ensure that students and parents who expect a campus to be safe and 'gun free' can be confident that their expectation is being met.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In returning control over firearm possession to school officials, the version of SB 707 that Senator Wolk originally introduced would have eliminated the Gun-Free School Zone Act's exception authorizing CCW permit holders and retired peace officers to carry firearms \"on school grounds,\" though it would have retained the exceptions authorizing both groups to carry firearms \"within school zones.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   S.B. 707, sec. 1, \u00a7 626.9(c)(5)-(6), (l), (o), 2015-2016 Reg.

This Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2016, Plaintiffs filed suit, arguing that SB 707's differential treatment of CCW permit holders and retired peace officers lacked a rational basis and thereby violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court rejected that argument. While it agreed that the CCW permit holders and retired peace officers were \"similarly situated\" for constitutional purposes, the district court reasoned that the Legislature had a rational basis for treating retired peace officers differently on school grounds-unlike\n   CCW permit holders, they risked facing enemies made during their law-enforcement careers, and this need for self-protection did not end when officers stepped on campus. \"Therefore,\" the district court concluded, \"allowing retired peace officers an exemption from the general ban of carrying concealed weapons on school property is rationally related to the legitimate state interest of ensuring their protection.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court also rejected Plaintiffs' Equal Protection argument that the Legislature impermissibly favored retired peace officers over \"unpopular\" civilian gun owners.

In\n   <em>\n    Silveira\n   </em>\n   , we held that the provision of California's Assault Weapons Control Act (\"AWCA\") exempting retired peace officers from a statewide ban on assault weapons violated the Equal Protection Clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1089-92.

According to Plaintiffs, this and similar language in\n   <em>\n    Silveira\n   </em>\n   requires that we \"scrutinize the connection, if any, between the goal of a legislative act and the way in which individuals are classified in order to achieve that goal,\" rather than consider\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   legitimate governmental interest in creating the classification. Further, Plaintiffs contend, the Legislature's stated purpose in enacting SB 707 was to reduce the number of guns on school grounds, so, if we are to uphold the legislation, we must find the retired-officer exception-which would presumably increase the number of guns on campuses-rationally related to this specific goal. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In reviewing the AWCA's retired-officer exception, the\n   <em>\n    Silveira\n   </em>\n   court noted that the classification was \"wholly unconnected to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   legitimate state interest,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1091 (emphasis added), and recognized its duty to \"identify\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   hypothetical rational basis for the exception,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1090. And if this language from\n   <em>\n    Silveira\n   </em>\n   did not persuade us to consider reasons for the classification beyond the Legislature's stated purpose for SB 707, the Supreme Court has made clear that we should.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Heller v.

A classification will be upheld, however, when \"the statute is rationally\n   related to a legitimate interest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200639\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/432/#p439\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200639\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/432/#p439\">\n    at 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200639\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/432/#p439\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   With regard to retired-officer safety, in\n   <em>\n    Silveira\n   </em>\n   we held that permitting retired peace officers to carry\n   <em>\n    assault weapons\n   </em>\n   was too attenuated from the goal of ensuring their safety. Here, we hold that permitting retired peace officers to carry\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   kinds of firearms on school grounds is sufficiently connected to the goal of ensuring such officers' safety to survive rational-basis review. In so doing, we refuse to second-guess the Legislature's determination that (1) retired peace officers are at a heightened risk of danger based on their previous exposure to crime, and (2) allowing them to carry firearms other than assault weapons on school grounds mitigates that risk and increases officer safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This brings us to the second reason the State advances for upholding this classification: public safety. While\n   <em>\n    Silveira\n   </em>\n   recognized that the Legislature's interest in public safety was too attenuated from the retired-officer classification in the context of assault weapons,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9323041\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/1052/\">\n    312 F.3d at 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , here we hold that the Legislature's interest in public safety is sufficiently connected to permitting retired peace officers to carry other kinds of firearms on school grounds. As the State argues, the Legislature is free to conclude that retired peace officers, as a class, are more skilled in the use of firearms due to the extensive training in the safe storage and operation of firearms that law enforcement personnel receive. And as the California College and University Police Chiefs Association argued in opposing the original version of SB 707 that applied the school-grounds ban equally to retired peace officers, their training further permits the Legislature's conclusion that retired peace officers offer \"a distinct asset in [the] ability to carry out\" the mission of campus safety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cal. S. Comm. on Pub. Safety, Analysis of S.B. 707, 2015-2016 Reg. Sess., at 6 (Apr. 13, 2015). Accordingly, the Legislature may legitimately decide to authorize retired peace officers, and retired peace officers alone, to carry firearms other than assault weapons on school grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, we turn to Plaintiffs' argument that SB 707 violates the Equal Protection Clause because it was enacted to \"favor[ ] a politically powerful group and to disfavor a politically-unpopular one.\" Plaintiffs, as well as the Cato Institute as amicus curiae, argue that the district court erred in holding that Plaintiffs could not establish a violation of the Equal Protection Clause because they failed to present \"evidence of explicit legislative intent to cause harm to civilian gun owners.\" It is true that animus need not be explicit in the legislative history for a plaintiff to establish impermissible intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Cleburne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200639\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/432/#p439\">\n    473 U.S. at 447-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200639\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/432/#p439\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
