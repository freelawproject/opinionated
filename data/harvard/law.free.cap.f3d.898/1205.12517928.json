It is clear that waiver does not apply in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Aquestive and the Director also argue that BioDelivery's motion requesting remand for consideration of non-instituted grounds is untimely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 93 at 4 (\"Biodelivery Sciences has waited nearly two months after the\n   <em>\n    SAS\n   </em>\n   decision to seek relief-after the parties spent the time to brief and argue the case, and more than three months after the appeal was submitted to the panel for decision.\"); ECF No. 92 at 6 (\"Even if Appellant did not waive its arguments for a complete remand, its argument that the appeals from all three IPRs should be terminated and remanded is untimely.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Nine days after the\n   <em>\n    SAS\n   </em>\n   decision, BioDelivery filed its first request for\n   <em>\n    SAS\n   </em>\n   -based relief from the PTAB's institution of less than all claims in IPR2015-00165.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 88;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SAS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611230,12611231\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1348/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"But instead of instituting review on all of the claims challenged in the petition, the Director instituted review on only some (claims 1 and 3-10) and denied review on the rest.\");\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 1359-60 (\"Because everything in the statute before us confirms that SAS is entitled to a final written decision addressing all of the claims it has challenged and nothing suggests we lack the power to say so, the judgment of the Federal Circuit is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\"). Aquestive did not, at that time, complain that this request was untimely, nor could it have reasonably done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   BioDelivery made its second request for\n   <em>\n    SAS\n   </em>\n   -based relief soon after this court began ordering remands when the PTAB considered less than all asserted grounds, explaining that such requests were appropriate in view of\n   <em>\n    SAS\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 91 (dated June 19, 2018),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Polaris\n   </em>\n   (issued May 30, 2018),\n   <em>\n    Baker Hughes Oilfield\n   </em>\n   (issued May 30, 2018),\n   <em>\n    and Nestle Purina PetCare\n   </em>\n   (issued June 11, 2018). Aquestive argues that BioDelivery should have requested this type of relief earlier, pointing to the PTO's informal \"guidance\" memorandum dated April 26, 2018 as evidence that \"in view of\n   <em>\n    SAS\n   </em>\n   , [the PTAB] was going to institute on all claims and grounds of unpatentability raised in the petition.\" ECF No. 92 at 6-7 (discussing\n   <em>\n    Guidance on the Impact of\n   </em>\n   SAS\n   <em>\n    on AIA Trial Proceedings\n   </em>\n   , U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office (Apr. 26, 2018),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.uspto.gov/patentsapplication-process/patent-trial-and-appeal-board/trials/guidance-impact-sas-aia-trial). The PTO's salutary decision concerning future action does not insulate earlier PTAB actions from remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Aquestive further argues that because the PTAB recognized\n   <em>\n    SAS\n   </em>\n   to require institution on all challenged claims and all challenged grounds, BioDelivery should have also recognized this and requested complete relief in its May 3 filing. ECF No. 92 at 7 (discussing this court's statements in\n   <em>\n    PGS Geophysical\n   </em>\n   ). We agree that\n   <em>\n    SAS\n   </em>\n   requires institution on all challenged claims and all challenged grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PGS Geophysical\n   </em>\n   , 891 F.3d at 1360 (\"Equal treatment of claims and grounds\n   for institution purposes has pervasive support in SAS.\"). However, even if a prior action did not appear unlawful at the time, this does not insulate it from corrective action. The second request for\n   <em>\n    SAS\n   </em>\n   -based relief was not untimely simply because BioDelivery did not predict that this court would authorize requests for remand when the PTAB instituted on less than all grounds as well as on all claims. It is undisputed that BioDelivery acted promptly after these occurrences, requesting remand within days of this court's first orders granting remand for the PTAB's failure to institute on all asserted grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Aquestive also asks that if this court decides that remand is appropriate, that we first decide the presently appealed issues.

Aquestive states that it \"is actively enforcing its patents in numerous district court litigations,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., including two district court actions against BioDelivery. We take note that one of these suits was stayed (jointly) during the\n   <em>\n    inter partes\n   </em>\n   reviews.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reckitt Benckiser Pharm., Inc. v. BioDelivery Sci. Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 5:15-cv-00350-D (E.D.N.C. Sept. 22, 2014), ECF Nos. 39 &amp; 42. Whether district court litigation is stayed for these remand procedures is within the province of the district court. Thus, the prejudice alleged by Aquestive does not weigh against a remand in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   IT IS ORDERED THAT :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (1) Biodelivery's request for remand to implement the Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    SAS\n   </em>\n   is granted in Federal Circuit Appeal Nos. 2017-1265, 2017-1266, and 2017-1268.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (2) The PTAB's decisions in PTAB Nos.
