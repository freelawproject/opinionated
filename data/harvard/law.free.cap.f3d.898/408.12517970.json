In 2007 Thomas Alexander Porter (\"Appellant\") was convicted in Virginia state court of capital murder for killing a Norfolk law enforcement officer, Stanley Reaves. He was sentenced to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After he pursued direct and collateral review in state court, Appellant filed the operative\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   petition in the district court, raising a host of challenges to his conviction and sentence. Chief among them was a claim that one of the jurors was biased against him. Specifically, when asked at voir dire whether any jurors had relatives in law enforcement, the juror did not disclose that his brother was a law enforcement officer in the jurisdiction adjacent to Norfolk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The district court dismissed the \u00a7 2254 petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Porter v. Davis\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:12-cv-550,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204182677\">\n    2014 WL 4182677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *52 (E.D. Va. Aug. 21, 2014) (\"\n   <em>\n    Porter I\n   </em>\n   \"). Appellant filed a plenary appeal of that dismissal, and we dismissed the appeal and remanded for further consideration of Appellant's actual bias claim, which the district court failed to address in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Porter v. Zook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346837\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/694/\">\n    803 F.3d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2015) (\"\n   <em>\n    Porter II\n   </em>\n   \"). On remand, the district court dismissed Appellant's actual bias claim as a matter of law without holding an evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Porter v. Zook\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:12-cv-550,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201688765\">\n    2016 WL 1688765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (E.D. Va. Apr. 25, 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    Porter III\n   </em>\n   \"). We now consider an appeal of that decision and the dismissal of his other claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although we affirm on the majority of Appellant's claims, we are constrained to remand once again on the juror bias issue. In dismissing the actual bias claim, the district court failed to recognize the applicability of Supreme Court precedent requiring a hearing in these circumstances; erected inappropriate legal barriers and faulted Appellant for not overcoming them; and ignored \"judicially-recognized factors\" in determining whether a hearing is necessary.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We likewise conclude that the district court erred in\n   <em>\n    Porter I\n   </em>\n   by dismissing Appellant's separate but related juror bias claim brought pursuant to\n   <em>\n    McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201349\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/548/\">\n    464 U.S. 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201349\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/548/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201349\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/548/\">\n    78 L.Ed.2d 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We therefore affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand with instructions that the district court allow discovery and hold an evidentiary hearing on Appellant's two separate juror bias claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In Virginia state court on March 7, 2007, Appellant was convicted of using a firearm in the commission of a felony, grand larceny of a firearm, and capital murder for killing a law enforcement officer in order to interfere with the performance of his official duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following facts were adduced at Appellant's trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   At approximately 3:30 p.m. on October 28, 2005, Porter and Reginald Copeland\n   traveled in Porter's Jeep to the Park Place apartment complex located at 2715 DeBree Avenue in the City of Norfolk to inquire about purchasing marijuana. Porter was carrying a concealed, nine-millimeter Jennings semi-automatic pistol. The two men entered the apartment of Valorie Arrington, where several people were present, including Valorie and her daughters, Latoria and Latifa ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Once inside, Porter began arguing with the women, brandishing his gun, and threatening that he might shoot one of them if provoked. Copeland left the residence, but Porter remained behind, locking the door so Copeland could not reenter. After being locked out of Valorie's apartment, Copeland walked away from the apartment complex and happened upon three uniformed police officers a block away, including Norfolk Police Officer Stanley Reaves. Copeland reported Porter's behavior to Officer Reaves and directed him to Valorie's apartment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Officer Reaves drove his police cruiser to the front curb of the apartment building, parked the car, and walked across the grass towards the sidewalk leading from the street to the apartment door. As Officer Reaves approached the apartment, Porter left Valorie's apartment and began walking away. Officer Reaves confronted Porter, grabbed Porter's left arm, and instructed him to take his hands out of his pockets. Porter then drew his concealed weapon from his pocket and fired three times, killing Officer Reaves. Porter took Officer Reaves' service pistol and then fled in his Jeep.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Several eyewitnesses, along with Porter, testified at trial and provided various descriptions of the events leading up to and immediately following Officer Reaves' death. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Copeland testified that he and Porter entered Valorie's apartment because she was Copeland's friend and because he had smoked marijuana with her before. ... [A]t some point in the conversation Porter began arguing with one of the women.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Copeland \"didn't know what to do\" but left the apartment and \"ran down [to the next block] and told [Officer Reaves, ']Look, there is a man up in the house with some girls, and he shouldn't be in there.' \" Copeland described the apartment building to Officer Reaves, and Officer Reaves drove his patrol car to the building with Copeland \"running behind\" the vehicle. Officer Reaves arrived at the building before Copeland, and as Copeland approached he saw \"Officer Reaves in the car and Porter was coming out [of] the building.\" Copeland identified Porter to Officer Reaves, and Officer Reaves instructed Copeland to stay back and then approached Porter. Moments later, Porter and Officer Reaves disappeared from Copeland's viewpoint behind a parked van, but Copeland \"heard gunshots and started running,\" and he \"ran and told the [other] officers what happened.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Simone Coleman testified that she was walking on the sidewalk near the apartment complex when she saw Officer Reaves' patrol car arrive. Coleman watched as Officer Reaves stepped out of his patrol car, and she saw Porter walking across the grass from the apartment, coming to \"within a few feet\" of her. She testified that Porter's hands were \"[i]n his pockets\" as Coleman passed by, and she \"was looking back\" to watch the confrontation between Officer Reaves and Porter. Coleman heard Officer Reaves instruct Porter to \"take his hands out of his pockets,\" and then Officer Reaves \"grabbed Mr. Porter's left arm.\" Coleman testified that Officer\n   Reaves \"didn't have a gun out,\" and that Porter, in response to Officer Reaves grabbing his arm, pulled a gun out of his pocket, pointed the gun at Officer Reaves' head, and pulled the trigger. Coleman watched Officer Reaves collapse to the ground, and she testified that Porter then shot Officer Reaves two more times. Coleman identified Porter in court as the man who killed Officer Reaves.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Selethia Anderson, who lived across the street from the apartment complex, was sitting on her front porch when she saw Officer Reaves arrive. Anderson testified that she watched Officer Reaves exit his vehicle and walk towards Porter as Porter was leaving the apartment complex. She described how Officer Reaves confronted Porter and \"used his right hand to grab [Porter's] left hand,\" and then Porter immediately reached into his hoodie pocket with his right hand, pulled out a gun, and shot Officer Reaves in the head. Anderson testified that after Officer Reaves fell, Porter shot him twice more \"between the back of the head and neck.\" According to Anderson, Porter knelt over Officer Reaves' body after the shooting, and when Porter left the scene, he was carrying a \"bigger gun\" than the one he had used to shoot Officer Reaves. Anderson identified Porter in court as the man who shot Officer Reaves.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Valorie testified that she was in her apartment that afternoon when Copeland arrived with Porter. According to Valorie, the two men \"came for some marijuana\" but the women did not have any, and asked the men to leave. Copeland agreed to leave, but Porter stayed inside, locked the door and kept Copeland outside. Valorie testified that she felt scared because Porter had \"locked us in our own house.\" Valorie asked Porter why his hands were in his sweatshirt pocket, and Porter responded by pulling out his gun and asking, \"[s]o are you going to give me the bag of weed or what?\" Valorie testified that she uttered a prayer, and when Porter realized she was a Muslim, he told the women that they were \"lucky\" and he put away the gun. When Porter realized a police car had arrived, he left the apartment and ran \"like some horses going down the stairs.\" Moments later, Valorie heard gunshots.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Latoria's testimony confirmed that Porter entered Valorie's apartment along with Copeland, and that Copeland left the apartment but Porter remained inside, locking the door. Latoria testified that Porter threatened that he would \"get to clapping\" if any of the women made a sudden move, and she explained that \"clapping\" was a term for \"shooting.\" She testified that she looked out the window, noticed Officer Reaves arrive in his patrol car, and asked, \"Why is Reggie [Copeland] talking to the police officer?\" Latoria testified that Porter then immediately exited the apartment, and she watched through the window as Officer Reaves approached Porter, grabbed Porter's arm, and then Porter \"reach[ed] into his right pocket and he pull[ed] out his gun and he shot him.\" Latoria testified that Officer Reaves did not have a weapon drawn when Porter shot him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   After killing Officer Reaves, Porter traveled to New York City where he was apprehended one month later in White Plains, New York. The murder weapon was found in his possession at the time of his arrest. Officer Reaves' gun was eventually located in Yonkers, New York.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The autopsy report revealed that Officer Reaves suffered three close-range\n   wounds to his head: one to the forehead, one to the left back of the head, and a flesh wound near the right ear. \"The cause of death was two separate close range gunshot wounds to the head.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Porter did not dispute that he shot Officer Reaves, but his version of the events differed from that of the eyewitnesses. Porter testified in his own defense that he drove to Valorie's apartment with Copeland \"[t]o get a bag of marijuana\" because Copeland was his \"means of getting marijuana.\" Porter parked the vehicle outside the apartment, and he \"grabbed the gun out of the glove compartment box\" before leaving the vehicle \"[b]ecause the area ... is a bad area.\" Porter testified that he gave Copeland $10 to purchase marijuana, and that he waited outside while Copeland went inside to make the purchase.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Porter testified that after a few minutes had passed, Copeland emerged from an upstairs apartment and invited him inside. Porter confirmed that Copeland left the apartment, but Porter denied locking the door and keeping Copeland outside. Porter also denied brandishing his gun inside the apartment or making a statement about shooting any of the women. Porter claimed that he left the apartment when he learned from the women that Copeland had not paid them for marijuana, and he denied that any of the women knew about Officer Reaves' arrival because \"[w]asn't nobody even looking out the window.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Porter testified that he left the apartment and was walking to his vehicle \"when Officer Reaves stepped in front of me and grabbed me.\" Porter and his counsel then had the following exchange:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Q. Did anything else happen when he did that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A. Yes. I seen him pulling his gun.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q. What do you mean, you saw him pulling his gun?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A. Well, when he grabbed me with his left arm on my left arm, we were still standing face to face. I seen him pulling his gun. That's when I put my hands up in the air and backed up, looking at him, like, \"What [are] you doing?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. You just described that you put your hands up in the air?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Q. And at that point, what happened?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A. Well, I got my hands in the air when he finally gets the gun out and point it at me. I take my hands down and pull my gun and started shooting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q. Why did you do that, Mr. Porter?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A. Because I was scared. I thought he was going to kill me because he looked angry at the time, so I was just worried for my safety.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Porter testified on direct examination that he could not remember how many times he pulled the trigger, but after he shot Officer Reaves, he bent down, picked up Officer Reaves' gun and ran. Porter explained that he left the scene because he \"was scared\" because he realized he \"just killed an officer.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Porter testified repeatedly on cross-examination that he \"never wanted to kill anybody\" but he also admitted that he \"pulled out the gun\" and \"shot [Officer Reaves] in the forehead.\" Porter and opposing counsel had this exchange on cross-examination:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q. You meant to hit Stanley Reaves with a bullet, didn't you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q. All right. And you took aim-therefore, you took aim at him, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q. You took aim at a part of his body, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Q. And the part of his body that you took aim at and then before pulling the trigger from less than six inches away was directly into his forehead, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Q. And you agree that you knew you were aiming at his head, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Porter also had this exchange on cross-examination:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Q. You admit that you ... pulled your gun out?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Q. And that you shot him in the head?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Q. You admit that you stole his gun?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Q. So according to your version of events, you claim that Officer Reaves pulled his gun, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Q. And the only thing about the crime that's alleged you committed, the capital murder of Officer Stanley Reaves, using a gun to commit that murder and stealing Officer Reaves' gun, the only part of the crime that we're here that you're on trial for that you dispute, really, is the reason why you shot Officer Reaves; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   A.

He said nothing further. Juror Treakle was ultimately selected to sit on the jury that convicted Appellant and sentenced him to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   On May 30, 2009, after Appellant's direct appeal, state habeas counsel Maryl Sattler interviewed Juror Treakle. Sattler, a law student at the time, produced an affidavit memorializing her interview.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 1718-20 (the \"Sattler Affidavit\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Sattler Affidavit, Juror Treakle said that sitting through Officer Reaves's wife's testimony at trial \"had been difficult for him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1719.

Appellant also alleged that Juror Treakle's brother worked in Chesapeake, the jurisdiction adjacent to Norfolk. Officer Reaves and his family also lived in Chesapeake, and at the time of Officer Reaves's murder, community members were mourning the death of another officer similarly killed in the line of duty. And significantly, after Officer Reaves's murder, Chesapeake and Norfolk law enforcement officers joined in a manhunt for Appellant. Indeed, Officer Reaves's wife wrote a letter in the local newspaper thanking the Chesapeake Police Department for its support in the aftermath of her husband's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Appellant raised three theories of juror bias in the state habeas petition based on these allegations: (1) actual bias; (2) implied bias;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) juror silence foreclosing counsel's ability to conduct an adequate voir dire pursuant to\n   <em>\n    McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v.

But the state court in this case\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   concluded that Appellant produced evidence of actual bias sufficient for a hearing, while still deciding that no evidence of bias existed at the time of trial or appeal to support a claim that trial counsel acted unreasonably.

This conclusion certainly does not preclude a finding that an actual bias hearing is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Albrecht\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit reasoned that the state habeas court addressed a claim that jury instructions were ambiguous \"on the merits\" in a related IAC claim.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076917\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/485/103/#p116\">\n    485 F.3d at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We recognize that in our remand to the district court in\n   <em>\n    Porter II\n   </em>\n   , we stated the district court \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   conduct an evidentiary hearing or any other proceedings it deems necessary to resolve the claim.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346837\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/694/\">\n    803 F.3d at 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis supplied). Nonetheless, in reviewing anew the district court's latest decision, we conclude that its reasoning for dismissing the actual bias claim without an evidentiary hearing is contrary to law. First, the district court failed to appreciate that this case is controlled by\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   , in which the Supreme Court held that a hearing was warranted. Second, it held Appellant to unreasonable standards. Third, it misinterpreted the effect of Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b).

Moreover, the district court places a burden on trial counsel uncontemplated by the Supreme Court or this court-that counsel must keep asking questions until the juror gives a complete answer, without knowing whether the answer is complete. Indeed, counsel had no opportunity to ask whether Juror Treakle could be impartial even though his\n   <em>\n    brother\n   </em>\n   was an officer\n   <em>\n    in the jurisdiction adjacent to the scene of the crime\n   </em>\n   . In other words, defense counsel had no chance to \"engage in any searching scrutiny\" of Juror Treakle's relationship with his brother because he did not know about it.\n   <em>\n    Porter III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201688765\">\n    2016 WL 1688765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11.

How could Appellant meet this standard without discovery or a hearing? \"[I]t would create a 'classic catch-22' if a [habeas] defendant were obliged to submit admissible evidence to the [district] court in order to be accorded an evidentiary hearing, when the defendant is seeking the hearing because he cannot, without subpoena power or mechanisms of discovery, otherwise secure such evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Conaway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3335962\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/567/#p582\">\n    453 F.3d at 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court further opined, \"Perhaps if [Juror Treakle's brother] had been murdered or shot in the line of duty one could doubt [Juror] Treakle's assurances that he could remain impartial in the trial of [Appellant] for the capital murder of a police officer.\"\n   <em>\n    Porter III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201688765\">\n    2016 WL 1688765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *12. But suggesting that bias could only arise if Juror Treakle's brother himself had been a victim not only undermines the district court's own analysis, but it creates an unworkable inquiry that flies in the face of\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Conaway\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   iii.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Third, at the motion to dismiss stage, a district court must \"accept a petitioner's well-pleaded allegations as true, and ... draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the petitioner's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Conaway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3335962\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/567/#p582\">\n    453 F.3d at 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, here the district court ignored this standard and made assumptions adverse to Appellant about Juror Treakle's answers at voir dire. For example, the district court called Juror Treakle \"honest\" (twice) and \"forthright.\"\n   <em>\n    Porter III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201688765\">\n    2016 WL 1688765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12-13. He found that Juror Treakle \"did not intentionally conceal the fact that he had a brother who was a deputy sheriff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at *12. These determinations are not only contrary to the legal standard, but should be properly made\n   <em>\n    after an evidentiary hearing\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teleguz v.

The district court\n   <em>\n    assumed\n   </em>\n   Juror Treakle did not purposely lie based on a cold record as opposed to the efficacy of a live hearing. It reasoned, \"[Appellant]'s suggestion that [Juror] Treakle volunteered information about his nephew, who was a police officer, but not about his brother, who was a deputy sheriff, for fear of losing his place on the jury suggests a cageyness that is refuted by the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Porter III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201688765\">\n    2016 WL 1688765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11. But the \"record\" to which the district court refers is woefully undeveloped and incomplete. Appellant has not had a chance to develop the record and prove that Juror Treakle, rather than somehow simply forgetting about his brother, purposely omitted or concealed his relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The dissent's logic suffers from the same fatal flaw. It states, \"There is no evidence in the record that Treakle was aware of the community's feelings or that he had ever spoken to his brother about the case,\" and \"Pernell's affidavit does not suggest any communication between the brothers.\"\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at 447 n.4. But Appellant was never given a chance to ask Juror Treakle or his brother these crucial questions. Thus, \"the dissent ignores a critical component underlying the Supreme Court's concern in cases involving juror bias-that without a hearing, a criminal defendant is deprived of the opportunity to uncover facts that could prove a Sixth Amendment violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnes v. Joyner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069843\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/229/#p250\">\n    751 F.3d 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 250 (4th Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The district court also relied on the general rule that juror testimony may not be used to impeach a verdict. If Juror Treakle is called to the stand in an evidentiary hearing, some of his testimony may be barred by Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   During an inquiry into the validity of a verdict ..., a juror may not testify about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury's deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror's or another juror's vote; or any juror's mental processes concerning the verdict .... The court may not receive a juror's affidavit or evidence of a juror's statement on these matters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Fed. R. Evid. 606(b)(1). There are three exceptions to this general rule, however. A juror may testify about whether:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   (A) extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's attention;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   (B) an outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   (C) a mistake was made in entering the verdict on the verdict form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Fed.

The Supreme Court has held, \" Rule 606(b) applies to juror testimony during a proceeding in\n   which a party seeks to secure a new trial on the ground that a juror lied during voir dire.\"\n   <em>\n    Warger v.

To prove a juror bias claim under\n   <em>\n    McDonough\n   </em>\n   , the petitioner must show: (1) \"a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire,\" and (2) \"a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.\"\n   <em>\n    McDonough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201349\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/548/\">\n    464 U.S. at 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201349\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/548/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the state habeas court addressed this issue on the merits, we review under the deferential AEDPA standard, which requires Appellant to demonstrate that the state habeas court's decision \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Even under this deferential standard, the state habeas court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.

Polk\n   </em>\n   , this court addressed a strikingly similar case on \u00a7 2254 review. The issue in\n   <em>\n    Conaway\n   </em>\n   was whether a juror was biased under\n   <em>\n    McDonough\n   </em>\n   for failing to disclose that he was a relative of the key prosecution witness, a man named Harrington, when asked if he knew anyone on the witness list or recognized any names.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3335962\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/567/#p582\">\n    453 F.3d at 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He did, however, acknowledge that he knew another person on the witness list. The trial hinged on a credibility determination between the defendant Conaway and Harrington, and Conaway was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conaway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3335962\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/567/#p582\">\n    453 F.3d at 573-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the first prong of\n   <em>\n    McDonough\n   </em>\n   , we concluded that the state habeas court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law in dismissing the claim. We reasoned that an allegation that the juror \"failed to disclose\" he was Harrington's relative was \"sufficient under\n   <em>\n    McDonough\n   </em>\n   to state a constitutional claim for relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Conaway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3335962\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/567/#p582\">\n    453 F.3d at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is true even though that juror swore that nothing would affect his ability to render an impartial verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, we have viewed the \"honesty\" aspect of the first\n   <em>\n    McDonough\n   </em>\n   prong as encompassing not just straight lies, but also failures to disclose. The State has offered no principled distinction between Appellant's\n   <em>\n    McDonough\n   </em>\n   claim and the one in\n   <em>\n    Conaway\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The dissent attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Conaway\n   </em>\n   by explaining that in the case at hand, \"[t]here are not 'multiple questions' that could 'candidly be answered' only by acknowledging that [Treakle's] brother was a sheriff's deputy.\"\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at 444. But\n   <em>\n    Conaway\n   </em>\n   's holding did not hinge on the fact that counsel asked more than one question; rather, that holding depended on the fact that the juror did not answer truthfully the questions posed to him. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    McDonough\n   </em>\n   itself states that the first prong is satisfied if the \"juror failed to answer honestly\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   material question on voir dire.\"\n   <em>\n    McDonough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201349\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/548/\">\n    464 U.S. at 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201349\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/548/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis supplied). Here, the question was straightforward: \"Have you, any member of your family or close personal friend worked for or with any law enforcement organization, either as an employee or on a volunteer basis?\" J.A. 250-51. Broken down, the question asked was: Has any member of your family worked for a law enforcement organization? The dissent faults counsel for failing to ask a follow up question or a more specific question,\n   <em>\n    see post\n   </em>\n   at 444-45, but that position creates a situation where counsel must necessarily assume that jurors who have taken an oath are, at best, withholding critical information, and at worst, lying. Point blank, Juror Treakle did not candidly answer counsel's question. Appellant is entitled to find out why.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   We also cannot say as a matter of law that the\n   <em>\n    McDonough\n   </em>\n   claim should be dismissed based on the second prong.

A fellow officer was so rough with a protesting bystander, a man named Hite (whom he was arresting for disorderly conduct), that Hite ultimately died of head injuries.

Indeed, during Officer Reaves's own deposition testimony as part of the Hite litigation, which was presented to the state habeas court, Reaves testified that although there was an investigation into the incident, \"[n]obody really formally told [him] anything yet\" about the results; he never received paperwork about it; and although he was removed from street duty, he did not indicate whether that action was captured in his personnel file.

Initially, there is no doubt as to Porter's guilt: he murdered Officer Stanley Reaves in Norfolk. Due to the publicity surrounding the murder, Porter's trial was moved from Norfolk to Arlington County in northern Virginia. At the beginning of voir dire, the circuit judge informed the potential jurors that the case was moved from Norfolk because of \"publicity\" (J.A. 222), and that the case involved \"a charge of capital murder of a law\n   enforcement officer.\" (J.A. 223). The judge also told the jurors that the law enforcement officer was \"a Norfolk police officer,\" (J.A. 227), and the jurors assured the judge that they had not seen or heard \"anything about this case either today or any other time,\" (J.A. 228).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   During voir dire, Porter's attorney, Joseph Migliozzi, first asked jurors if they \"belonged to any organizations\" that \"support[ ] law enforcement objectives in your community.\" (J.A. 248). He then pivoted to a \"little more specific question,\" that is, \"[h]ave you, any member of your family or close personal friend worked for or with any law enforcement organization, either as an employee or on a volunteer basis.\" (J.A. 250-51). Migliozzi noted that several jurors had already provided an answer to that question in response to his first question and clarified what he was asking: \"But is anyone here, or a member of your close personal family, worked in law enforcement in any capacity as a volunteer or an employee?\" (J.A. 251). This question prompted the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-253\">\n   MR. MIGLIOZZI: I'm going to start in the back row. Mr. Treakle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-254\">\n   MR. TREAKLE: My nephew is an Arlington County police officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-255\">\n   MR. MIGLIOZZI: Your nephew?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-256\">\n   MR. TREAKLE: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-257\">\n   MR. MIGLIOZZI: In this county here?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-258\">\n   MR. TREAKLE: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-259\">\n   MR. MIGLIOZZI: Do you think, with that being the case, that that would impair your ability to sit on this jury and render a fair and impartial verdict in this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-260\">\n   MR. TREAKLE: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   (J.A. 251-52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Multiple jurors answered that they had a relative in law enforcement; all stated that they could remain impartial, and counsel did not move to strike any juror for cause on this basis. Despite the publicity the case had generated in the Norfolk area, Migliozzi did not ask the jurors if they had any family or friends in Norfolk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   After conducting voir dire with the full panel, the circuit judge placed the venire into groups of four to probe their ability to sit impartially on a capital case involving a police officer's murder. During the small group questioning, Migliozzi reminded Treakle that the case involved the capital murder of a police officer and asked, \"If you should convict, the defendant, Mr. Porter, of capital murder, could you follow the Court's instructions and consider voting for a sentence of less than the death penalty?\" (J.A. 318). Treakle responded, \"Yes.\" (J.A. 318). Migliozzi probed the jurors' ability to weigh testimony from law enforcement officers, asking \"[d]o you believe that the testimony of a law enforcement official, a police officer, is more believable than the testimony of another witness just because he or she is a law enforcement officer?\" (J.A. 316). Treakle shook his head no. Finally, Treakle and the other venire persons in his small group were asked, \"[D]o any of the four of you know of any reason why you could not or would not be able to fairly and impartially determine the facts of the case or abide by the instructions of the Court on the sentencing issues?\" (J.A. 316). All four jurors responded in the negative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   Treakle was seated on Porter's jury, and Porter was convicted of Reaves' murder and sentenced to death. After the Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed Porter's conviction and sentence, Porter pursued his state collateral review. As part of the investigation into any potential claims, Porter's habeas counsel, Dawn Davison, had a law student, Maryl Sattler, assist in interviewing jurors. The law student summarized the interview with Treakle as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-265\">\n   Ms. Davison ... explained to Mr. Treakle that we were there representing Thomas Porter, and that we were interviewing jurors as part of our review of the entire case. Mr. Treakle indicated that he understood and was willing to speak with us. He explained that he had to pick up his wife at 3:00 pm, so he would only be available for a few minutes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-266\">\n   Ms. Davison asked Mr. Treakle which of the witnesses made the greatest impression on him during the trial. Without hesitation, Mr. Treakle replied that he found the officer's wife (Treva Reaves) to be a very powerful witness. He indicated that he found her testimony moving and very emotional for him because his brother is a sheriff's officer in Norfolk. We were very surprised by this statement because we had read his voir dire prior to the interview and Mr. Treakle had never said anything about this brother. When Ms. Davison asked for clarification, Mr. Treakle repeated that his brother works for the sheriff's department \"down in Norfolk.\" Mr. Treakle said sitting through Mrs. Reaves's testimony had been difficult for him. He expressed sympathy for law enforcement officers, and emphasized that they put their lives on the line every day for the community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-267\">\n   We only spoke with Mr. Treakle for a short while. At approximately 2:45 pm, Mr. Treakle said that he wished he could speak with us longer, but he did not want to be late to pick his wife up from work at 3:00 pm.

In reversing the district court's dismissal of the\n   <em>\n    McDonough\n   </em>\n   claim, the majority necessarily concludes not that Treakle might have been dishonest at voir dire, or that there is a factual disagreement about his honesty, but that it was unreasonable as a matter of clearly established federal law to conclude that he was honest. Presumably, regardless of Treakle's testimony at a future evidentiary hearing regarding his answers at voir dire, the district court cannot find him credible. On the second prong of\n   <em>\n    McDonough\n   </em>\n   , the majority remands because it cannot speculate as to what questions would have emerged had Treakle mentioned his brother. Is the district court also supposed to speculate? Is Porter's trial counsel going to testify? Will his testimony be anything other than self-serving in favor of Porter? I believe the district court correctly determined that the Supreme Court of Virginia did not unreasonably apply clearly established law, and I would affirm dismissal of the\n   <em>\n    McDonough\n   </em>\n   claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   III.
