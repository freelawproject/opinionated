Several environmental groups, individuals, and other entities petition for review. Concluding that Virginia's issuance of the certification was not arbitrary and capricious, we deny the petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A. The Project\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Mountain Valley Pipeline Project (the \"Project\") is a proposed interstate natural gas transmission pipeline that will be approximately 303 miles long and 42 inches in diameter and will transport natural gas from Wetzel County, West Virginia, to Pittsylvania County, Virginia. Much of the Project crosses topography with steep slopes and areas that are susceptible to landslides. Approximately 106 miles of the pipeline will be located in Virginia, and constructing the pipeline requires 385 stream crossings and 144 wetland crossings in the Commonwealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (\"MVP\") proposes to construct and operate the\n   pipeline in Virginia and West Virginia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   MVP generally would use a 125-foot-wide construction right-of-way in uplands and a 75-foot-wide right-of-way through wetlands. MVP would retain a 50-foot right-of-way permanently to operate the pipeline. For overland construction, MVP would generally need to clear the land of trees and vegetation, then dig a trench of up to nine feet in depth, fracturing and blasting rock where necessary. Waterbody crossings would be dry open-cut crossings; MVP would temporarily divert the water from the construction area and bury the pipeline two to four feet below the streambed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.

FERC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As the NGA required,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717n(b), FERC acted as the lead agency in preparing an EIS for the Project. FERC first issued a draft EIS in September 2016. Then during the 90-day period that followed, FERC conducted seven public meetings and received 1,237 written comments (many of which were from DEQ). Some of DEQ's suggestions included adjusting the Project route, requiring a revised Karst Mitigation Plan, creating an Acid Soil Mitigation Plan, revising the Blasting Plan, and adopting various measures to reduce erosion and the introduction of sediment into the water. FERC's final EIS, issued in June 2017, incorporated many of the suggestions DEQ had offered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The EIS recognized that many aspects of the Project created the potential to negatively impact affected waters. With regard to upland construction activities, the EIS observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The clearing and grading of stream banks could expose soil to erosional forces and would reduce riparian vegetation along the cleared section of the waterbody. The use of heavy equipment for construction could cause compaction of near-surface soils, an effect that could result in increased runoff into surface waters in the immediate vicinity of the proposed construction right-of-way. Increased surface runoff could transport sediment into surface waters, resulting in increased turbidity levels and increased sedimentation rates in the receiving waterbody. Disturbances to stream channels and stream banks could also increase the likelihood of scour after construction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   J.A. 771. The EIS stated that \"[i]n order to limit impacts on riparian zones, the Applicants would follow measures outlined in its Procedures.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.A. 771.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The EIS also recognized that flooding during construction was a potential concern. The EIS stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   To minimize or prevent impacts resulting from flash flooding during construction, the Applicants would remove any equipment or loose material from the affected area prior to any anticipated significant rain event. Additionally, the Applicants would implement erosion and sedimentation control measures, such as installing trench breakers and water bars to inhibit water flow along the trench and right-of-way. Upon completion of construction, the Applicants would restore the ground surface as\n   closely as practicable to original contours and re-establish vegetation to facilitate restoration of pre-construction overland flow.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   J.A. 772. In the end, however, regarding construction of the Project that implementation of the various recommendations FERC had made and the plans MVP had agreed to follow, the EIS concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   No long-term or significant impacts on surface waters are anticipated as a result of the projects, because Mountain Valley and Equitrans would not permanently affect the designated water uses, they would bury the pipeline beneath the bed of all waterbodies, implement erosion and sedimentation controls, adhere to crossing guidelines in their Procedures, and restore the streambanks and streambed contours as close as practical to pre-construction conditions. Temporary impacts would be avoided or minimized through the implementation of our recommendations ... and various plans.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   J.A. 775.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In October 2017, FERC issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the construction of the Project. The certificate includes 37 \"Environmental Conditions,\" many of which reflect DEQ's input.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   FERC noted that MVP \"committed to use specialized construction techniques on steep slopes, including cut-and-fill and two-tone grading, to minimize adverse effects.\" J.A. 558. FERC also noted that MVP had developed a\n   <em>\n    Landslide Mitigation Plan\n   </em>\n   and FERC required that MVP revise the plan \"to outline construction measures to be used when crossing steep slopes at angles perpendicular to contours and to include a more robust monitoring program.\" J.A. 558. As for the concern that \"slope failures will cause instream sedimentation,\" FERC also noted that MVP had \"agreed to follow the measures outlined in [FERC's]\n   <em>\n    Upland Erosion Control, Revegetation, and Maintenance Plan\n   </em>\n   ... and its\n   <em>\n    Wetland and Waterbody Construction and Mitigation Procedures\n   </em>\n   , which include erosion controls to prevent sedimentation into waterbodies.\" J.A. 558. FERC acknowledged that \"these plans cannot fully prevent sedimentation, but would provide adequate protections by reducing sedimentation into streams and reducing the potential for slope failures.\" J.A. 558.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Also, \"[t]o minimize potential impacts on karst related groundwater through construction associated sedimentation and runoff, [MVP] will implement the erosion control measures outlined in [FERC's] Plan and its\n   <em>\n    Karst-specific Erosion and Sediment Control Plan\n   </em>\n   .\" J.A. 566. Additionally, \"to minimize the potential for hazardous materials leaking from construction equipment to contaminate groundwater, [MVP] will implement the measures outlined in its\n   <em>\n    Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan\n   </em>\n   (SWPP Plan);\n   <em>\n    Spill, Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures Plan\n   </em>\n   (SPCC Plan); and\n   <em>\n    Unanticipated Discovery of Contamination Plan for Construction Activities in West Virginia and Virginia\n   </em>\n   .\" J.A. 566.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   FERC's certificate noted that, with regard to streams crossed by the Project, FERC was taking into consideration not only the sedimentation that would be produced from the crossing itself, but also the sedimentation that would result from runoff from construction workplaces. FERC noted that the stream crossings would \"result in temporary (less than 4 days) and\n   localized (for a distance of only a few hundred feet of the crossing) increases in turbidity downstream of construction, but the magnitude of this increase is minimal compared to increased turbidity associated with natural runoff events.\" J.A. 569. FERC added that \"[o]nce construction is complete, [MVP] will stabilize and restore streambeds and banks consistent with the\n   <em>\n    Wetland and Waterbody Construction and Mitigation Procedures\n   </em>\n   .\" J.A. 569.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In addition to all the measures FERC specifically required, FERC noted that the Corps and various state agencies \"have the opportunity to impose conditions to protect water quality pursuant to sections 401 and 404 of the Clean Water Act.\" J.A. 570. FERC emphasized that \"[t]he applicants must obtain all necessary federal and state permits and authorizations, including the water quality certifications, prior to receiving [FERC] authorization to commence construction.\" J.A. 570. FERC specifically concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Based on [FERC] staff's experience with pipeline construction, and [MVP's] commitment to cross waterbodies via dry-ditch methods, adherence to the measures in [FERC's] Plan and Procedures, [MVP's] proposal to conduct a stream monitoring plan, and use of [FERC's] third-party compliance program, we determine that impacts on waterbodies due to sedimentation will be effectively minimized.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   J.A. 567.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   FERC's certificate provided that MVP \"must receive written authorization from the Director of OEP [Office of Energy Projects] before commencing construction of any project facilities.\" J.A. 628 (emphasis omitted). Finally, as is relevant here, the face of the certificate explained FERC's flexibility to deal with unforeseen contingencies with the potential to affect the environment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   The Director of OEP, or the Director's designee, has delegated authority to address any requests for approvals or authorizations necessary to carry out the conditions of the order, and take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the protection of all environmental resources during construction and operation of the project and activities associated with abandonment. The authority shall allow:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   a. the modification of conditions of the order;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   b. stop work authority; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   c. the imposition of any additional measures deemed necessary to ensure continued compliance with the intent of the conditions of the order as well as the avoidance or mitigation of unforeseen adverse environmental impacts resulting from project construction and operation and abandonment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   J.A. 624-25 (Appendix C to the Certificate).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   B. Corps' Section 404 Review and Virginia's Related Section 401 Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   MVP requested its Section 404 permit from the Corps by filing a \"Joint Permit Application\" in February 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201344\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The application served as a preconstruction notification under \"Nationwide Permit 12\" (\"NWP 12\"), which concerns \"activities required for the construction, maintenance, repair, and removal of utilities lines and associated facilities in waters of the United States.\" J.A. 100.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   33 U.S.C. 1344(e)(1) (allowing the Secretary of the Army to issue permits on a \"nationwide basis for any category of activities involving discharges of dredged or fill material if the Secretary determines that the activities in such category are similar in nature, will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed separately, and will have only minimal cumulative adverse effect on the environment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Applicants seeking coverage under that permit must provide information that the Corps can use \"to determine that the adverse environmental effects of the activity will be no more than minimal and to determine the need for compensatory mitigation or other mitigation measures.\" J.A. 430. A project can be covered by NWP 12 only if it satisfies numerous conditions that apply generally to each nationwide permit. One such condition requires that construction include appropriate soil erosion and sediment controls. In this way, NWP 12 \"ties in the requirements and practices of the VESC program and regulations.\" J.A. 112. Additionally, although NWP 12 authorizes disturbance of streams temporarily during construction, the permit requires that streams be restored to pre-construction condition once construction is complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In 2017, the Corps revised the requirements for NWP 12,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Issuance and Reissuance of Nationwide Permits,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%201860\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 1860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -01, 1985-86 (Jan. 6, 2017), which prompted MVP to revise its earlier-filed application. In MVP's revised application, MVP discussed in detail the Project's potential impacts on wetland, stream, and river crossings and the steps MVP would take to address them. In March 2017, the Corps added several Regional conditions specific to Virginia for the NWP 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As per Virginia law, the State Agencies then considered whether NWP 12 and the certification conditions satisfied the criteria necessary for Section 401 certification. 9 Va. Admin. Code 25-210-130(H). Following its consideration of public comment, the Board issued its certification on April 7, 2017, concluding that the requisite criteria had been satisfied (the \"April 401 Certificate\"). The certification stated that \"the Board finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the activities permitted under the Corps' NWP program ... will be conducted in a manner which will not violate applicable water quality standards, provided permittees comply with all applicable Section 401 conditions.\" J.A. 452.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   C. Virginia's Approval of MVP's Annual Standards and Specifications\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   MVP first submitted its standards and specifications to DEQ in February 2016. Over the course of more than a year, DEQ engaged in several written and in-person exchanges with MVP representatives before finally approving the standards and specifications for the Project in June 2017 (\"\n   <em>\n    MVP's Standards and Specifications\n   </em>\n   \"). They identify the measures MVP will take to meet the substantive requirements of the VESC and VSM Laws. They also outline how MVP will meet FERC's requirements regarding its\n   <em>\n    Upland Erosion Control, Revegetation, and Maintenance Plan\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wetland and Waterbody Construction and Mitigation Procedures\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The approved standards and specifications include, among other things, plans to protect against impacts from landslides and blasting, requirements for addressing acidic silt, and assessing karst hazards. They also require MVP to monitor land-disturbing activities, conduct regular inspections, and report the results to DEQ. The technical requirements in\n   <em>\n    MVP's Standards and Specifications\n   </em>\n   in fact exceed in several respects the requirements that the Virginia Construction General Permit imposes generally on large-scale construction projects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In addition to these requirements, DEQ also informed MVP that it needed to submit site-specific plans to DEQ for its approval before commencing land-disturbing activities. These plans would \"address every foot of land disturbance related to pipeline construction, including the path of the proposed pipeline right of way ..., access roads, construction lay-down areas and construction activities that will occur in streams and wetlands.\" J.A. 108. Additionally, DEQ required MVP to post these plans on its website so that the public could comment on them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   D. Virginia's Section 401 \"Supplemental Proceedings\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   On May 19, 2017, the same day DEQ issued the 2017 Guidance Document, it also issued an information request to MVP pursuant to the new policy. The request stated that it was \"for the purpose of evaluating whether additional 401 certification conditions are necessary to ensure protection of water quality.\" J.A. 7. Included in the many categories of information requested were \"[a] complete listing of all type of project-related upland ground-disturbing activities that would occur within 50 feet of\" surface waters; a list of sensitive waterbodies located within 50 feet of the land-disturbing activities; and information concerning various measures MVP would be taking to protect water quality, including a water-quality monitoring plan. J.A. 8. DEQ's request marked the beginning of a supplemental process that involved many detailed exchanges of information between DEQ and MVP, as well as in-person work sessions involving representatives of various other state agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   On July 3, 2017, DEQ issued a draft 401 certification that included 14 conditions that had not been included in the April 401 Certification (for the Corps' 404 permit). The draft was shared with the public subject to DEQ's notice and comment procedures, generating more than 8,000 comments. DEQ also held two public hearings regarding the certification. As this process continued, DEQ and MVP continued to discuss more water-quality related concerns, what measures would be employed to address the concerns, and how effective those measures would be. DEQ also entered into a contract with the United States Geological Service to monitor water quality during construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As a result of this continued review, DEQ substantially revised its draft 401 certificate, adding several new requirements. The revised draft included 15 conditions that were in addition to the many other requirements imposed by the various other governmental entities and laws. Those conditions included \"specific requirements for best work practices emphasizing hazard assessment, frequent inspection requirements, monitoring activities, preventative measures, riparian buffer protections, and comprehensive mitigation plans.\" J.A. 130.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In addition to preparing the revised draft certification, DEQ prepared other documents explaining its analysis, including a \"Basis for Certification\" and detailed responses to the public's comments. DEQ also further explained its analysis when it presented its recommendation to the Board during a two-day public meeting in December 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As noted, the certification process required Virginia to determine that it had \"reasonable assurance\" that the Project would \"not violate applicable water quality\n   standards.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20121.2\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 121.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). DEQ recognized that \"[t]he term 'reasonable assurance' is not defined in the [CWA] or applicable federal regulations.\" J.A. 124. It reasoned that the standard \"addresses future events\" and thus is \"inherently predictive in nature and absolute certainty is not required.\" J.A. 103 n.4, 125. Still, DEQ reasoned that the term requires \"more than a probability or mere speculation. J.A. 103 n.4, 125. DEQ concluded that, with all of the additional conditions imposed in the proposed Section 401 certification, that standard was met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   DEQ noted that application of the VESC and VSM Laws through the annual standards and specification program would serve \"to protect surface water quality during and after construction completion.\" J.A. 107. DEQ also emphasized that the supplemental 401 review was only one of many programs and processes protecting Virginia's water quality, each of which DEQ participated in. These programs and processes included FERC's environmental review; the CWA section 404 certification and related VWP permitting programs; DEQ's review of stormwater and erosion control measures through the VESC and VSM Laws; DEQ's supplemental Section 401 review of impacts of upland activities; and DEQ's participation in the development of project-specific water-quality monitoring requirements. DEQ concluded that these programs, \"[w]hen considered as a unified approach, ... provide a thorough technical evaluation and process that is designed to ensure that Virginia's water quality is protected.\" J.A. 113.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   DEQ noted that in the process that culminated with issuance of the April 401 Certification, DEQ had \"already established reasonable assurance that activities in streams and wetlands\" would \"be conducted in a manner that [would] not violate applicable water quality standards.\" J.A. 126. Reviewing the potential impact of the stream-crossing activities that were covered by NWP 12, DEQ emphasized that the permit requires the use of appropriate erosion and sediment controls. DEQ also emphasized that NWP 12 requires, with regard to any stream crossing, that any disturbance will only be temporary and that the impact area must be restored to preconstruction condition once construction is complete. DEQ also noted that \"[t]he VWP program and prior certification of the Corps' Nationwide Permits has proven to be sufficient to evaluate and, when necessary, mitigate potential water quality impacts for linear construction projects, such as roads and pipelines.\" J.A. 100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   DEQ acknowledged that its review of the project-specific stormwater management and erosion and sediment control plans - the description of exactly how the annual standards and specifications would be applied foot-by-foot within the Project - would not be completed until after completion of Virginia's Section 401 process. Nevertheless, DEQ's reasonable-assurance determination of the upland activities depended in part on the facts (1) that no land-disturbing activity could begin until those plans had been approved, and (2) that the plans would not be approved unless they satisfied\n   <em>\n    MVP's Standards and Specifications\n   </em>\n   , which DEQ had already determined complied with the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. DEQ also noted that Virginia's AS&amp;S Program \"incorporates the same engineering,\n   erosion and sediment control, recordkeeping, monitoring, inspecting and post construction stormwater management requirements that are otherwise implemented in the ... Construction General Permit (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20Va.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2025-880-1\">\n    9 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 25-880-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ).\" J.A. 126. DEQ drew assurance from the fact that a Richmond Circuit Court had recently upheld the Construction General Permit on the basis that \"substantial evidence in the record [supported] the Board's determination that proper implementation of permit conditions, including inspections and corrective action, would protect water quality.\" J.A. 127;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Order,\n   <em>\n    Kelble v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   , Case No. CL14-762, at 4-5 (Richmond Cir. Ct. Apr. 10, 2017) (concluding in appeal challenging whether Construction General Permit adequately protected water quality that substantial evidence supported Board's determination that proper implementation of the conditions of the permit, including inspections and adaptive actions, would protect water quality). And DEQ placed strong reliance on the EPA's conclusion that its own construction general permit was sufficient to prevent projects from negatively affecting water quality. DEQ emphasized that it \"traditionally rel[ies] on the technical studies and analysis of [the] EPA\" because DEQ lacks the money or manpower to do the \"in-depth analyses\" that the EPA does. J.A. 305.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   DEQ concluded,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   In the absence of information demonstrating otherwise, compliance with the requirements under the [AS&amp;S] Program will result in stormwater discharges being controlled as necessary to meet applicable water quality standards and antidegradation requirements. More specifically, by imposing requirements that discharges to impaired, TMDL [Total Maximum Daily Load], and exceptional waters comply with additional requirements, to stabilize exposed areas faster and to conduct site inspections more frequently than other sites (in addition to meeting [stormwater and erosion] requirements), authorizing these discharges will not result in a lowering of water quality. Thus, DEQ has determined that compliance with the [AS&amp;S] approval generally is sufficient to satisfy Tier 2 and Tier 3 antidegradation requirements because the controls will not result in a lowering of water quality, making individualized Tier 2 or Tier 3 review unnecessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   J.A. 128-29. The DEQ added that its determination that the AS&amp;S Program would ensure compliance with water quality standards and antidegradation requirements was supported by the fact that the requirements under that program met the technical requirements of the Construction General Permit and that the EPA had stated in its 2017 Construction General Permit fact sheet that compliance with that permit was generally sufficient to prevent any lowering of water quality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 1075 (\"EPA has determined that compliance with the [Construction General Permit] generally will be sufficient to satisfy Tier 2 (or 2.5) and Tier 3 antidegradation requirements because the controls will not result in a lowering of water quality, making individualized Tier 2 or Tier 3 review unnecessary.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   DEQ also noted that FERC had concluded - prior to Virginia's adding any conditions in the Section 401 process - that impacts on water resources were \"expected to return to baseline levels over a period of days or weeks following construction given the requirement to restore water bodies to their original contours.\" J.A. 132. Given that fact, and the fact that the Corps' approval would be necessary regarding any stream or wetlands crossings, \"FERC [had] concluded that the cumulative effect on surface waterbody resources\n   would be minor.\" J.A. 132. Similarly, DEQ took notice of the fact that the Corps would be assessing in detail \"geographic areas that are determined to be potentially subject to more than minimal cumulative adverse environmental effects,\" and the Corps will have authority to add conditions to NWP 12 \"to require mitigation measures to ensure that the cumulative adverse environmental effects of these activities are no more than minimal.\" J.A. 133-34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Finally, DEQ emphasized that the proposed 401 certification required MVP to develop a limited water-quality monitoring plan to monitor and evaluate potential impacts from activities not subject to the Corps' Section 404 permit. DEQ noted that the plan MVP submitted included in-stream monitoring of water quality in proximate upland areas. The monitoring would occur before, during, and after construction, and would evaluate temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and pH. Elevated sample results \"that exceed the applicable water quality criteria\" would require consultation between MVP and DEQ so that they could respond appropriately. J.A. 92. In addition to this monitoring, DEQ noted it would be conducting \"project-specific water quality monitoring at a number of proposed ... stream crossings near sensitive and/or critical areas\" that also \"will be conducted before, during and after ... construction activities.\" J.A. 139. DEQ noted that the monitoring had already begun in the fall of 2017 in order \"[t]o establish a baseline of water quality conditions,\" and that it would continue if the project were approved until \"at least one year after completion of construction.\" J.A. 140. DEQ stated that \"[t]he monitoring is intended to provide reasonable assurance that erosion and sediment control measures are effective\" and that \"[i]f necessary, changes will be made to approved erosion and sediment control plans based on conditions encountered in the field during construction.\" J.A. 140.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   During the two-day meeting held by the Board to consider DEQ's recommendation, the Board further amended the draft certificate, including adding one additional condition. The Board approved the certificate as amended, and on December 8, 2017, DEQ issued a final certification (the \"December 401 Certification\"). The certification stated that it \"addresses Project activities in upland areas outside of the Corps jurisdictional areas under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201344\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and water withdrawal activities that are exempt from coverage under the Virginia Water Protection Permit Program Regulation ( 9 [Va.

The certification declared that \"[t]he additional conditions contained in ... this Certification along with the requirements imposed by the VWP regulation, the Corps Section 404 permitting requirements, and prior regulatory actions associated with the approval and requirements of the June 2017 Annual Standards and Specifications, and the April 7, 2017 Section 401 Water Quality Certification of the Corps Nationwide Permit 12 provide reasonable assurance that water quality standards will not be violated.\" J.A. 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   E. Petitions For Review and Subsequent Events\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   On December 8, 2017, and December 18, 2017, separate petitions for review were\n   filed by various entities challenging the December 401 Certification.

Still, we noted that the prospect of the plaintiff's achieving the ultimate relief he seeks is not altogether irrelevant to the issue of redressability: \"[I]f no realistic possibility exists that a plaintiff can obtain the ultimate relief,\" then he cannot show redressability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The facts of the present case are closely analogous to those of\n   <em>\n    Townes\n   </em>\n   . As in\n   <em>\n    Townes\n   </em>\n   , Petitioners challenge what they claim is an improper administrative decision that they had hoped and expected would yield a more favorable result. Also as in\n   <em>\n    Townes\n   </em>\n   , they seek \"\n   <em>\n    immediate\n   </em>\n   relief from a federal court as a necessary antecedent to the\n   <em>\n    ultimate\n   </em>\n   relief [they] seek[ ] from a different entity, like an administrative agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 547 (emphasis in original). We therefore analyze the standing issue here applying the same principles we used in\n   <em>\n    Townes\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Applying these principles, we conclude Petitioners have standing. Just as the board's parole-ineligibility decision ended Townes's opportunity to receive a discretionary parole hearing (and the shorter parole period he would have hoped to receive from that hearing), the December 401 Certification ended Petitioners' opportunity to have more stringent requirements imposed (or the Project vetoed entirely). Thus, like Townes, Petitioners have properly asserted injury-in-fact fairly traceable to the decision they challenge. And also like Townes, were Petitioners to prevail on the merits of their claims in federal court, the court could immediately undo the administrative decision that caused their injury. As was true in\n   <em>\n    Townes\n   </em>\n   , analyzing redressability does not require us to predict whether, if we rule for Petitioners on the merits, they will eventually obtain the ultimate relief that\n   they seek.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, to show redressability, they need only demonstrate a \"realistic possibility\" that they will obtain that ultimate relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 548 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   As MVP points out, in order to obtain the relief Petitioners ultimately seek - tighter restrictions or a complete discontinuation of the Project - Petitioners would need to clear several hurdles even after prevailing on the merits before us. At the very least, they would need the State Agencies to decide on remand not to elect to waive any further review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Then they would need the State Agencies to decide to deny reissuance of the 401 certification or at least to impose stricter conditions. And as MVP points out, even if the State Agencies decided to take that course, FERC theoretically could resist their efforts by arguing, for example, that it is too late in the process for the State Agencies to make such a decision or that further restrictions would be preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In our view, however, none of these potentialities are sufficient to negate the \"realistic possibility\" that if Petitioners prevailed on the merits of this petition, they would obtain at least more stringent requirements on remand. Petitioners argue that FERC would be legally required to add any conditions requested by the State Agencies on remand or to honor a decision by the State Agencies to deny 401 re-certification. But even assuming Petitioners are incorrect, and FERC had some discretion on the subject, there is good reason to believe FERC would be amenable to the State Agencies' attempts to re-issue its 401 certification with more stringent restrictions.

Indeed,\n   <em>\n    MVP's Standards and Specifications\n   </em>\n   incorporate the very same substantive protections as are contained in the Virginia Construction General Permit. The State Agencies justifiably drew confidence in these protections from the EPA's judgment regarding the effectiveness of these same protections in preventing construction from negatively impacting water quality.

They argue, for example, that interstate gas pipelines \"can have significantly greater impacts than the smaller projects authorized by EPA's General Permit.\" Petitioners' Reply brief at 19.

However, while\n   <em>\n    MVP's Standards and Specifications\n   </em>\n   do not directly incorporate Virginia's water quality standards, the December 401 Certification incorporates MVP's water-quality monitoring plan.

Petitioners point to evidence in the record supporting their view that the protections in place here would not be effective in preventing construction impacts from lowering water quality given the specific characteristics of the Project, particularly the steep topography of the land at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   But we conclude that the State Agencies' approach appropriately blended site-specific and non-site specific analyses. The December 401 Certification incorporates a\n   <em>\n    Landslide Mitigation Plan\n   </em>\n   . For example, as DEQ explained in its response to public comments to its draft certification,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   Plan development included field observations for these sites including: slope characteristics, GPS mapping of observed slides, slumps, rockfalls, scarp locations, the presence of geotropically affected trees, drainage features, and gullying. The Plan includes mitigation strategies such as excavation and/or regarding of upgradient head soils, dewatering, rock embedment as well as construction operations including buttressing and reinforced soil slope.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   Landslide mitigation also will depend on the installation of appropriate drainage and erosion control measures during construction and proper right-of-way reclamation. Certain site-specific measures have already been identified for certain high risk areas and others will be applied as field conditions indicate the need.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   J.A. 138.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Moreover, DEQ has emphasized that it \"traditionally rel[ies] on the technical studies and analysis of the EPA\" because DEQ lacks the money or manpower to do the \"in-depth analyses\" that the EPA does. J.A. 305. While it is always true that government agencies could undertake analysis that is more in-depth and more specific to a particular project, we do not believe the State Agencies acted arbitrarily in placing significant reliance on the effectiveness of its \"tried and true\" methods here. In making this judgment, we cannot ignore the fact that the State Agencies vigorously participated at every stage of the decision-making process and did not issue their final 401 certificate until they had added all of the protections that they concluded were needed to give them reasonable assurance that state water quality would be protected. This is exactly how the system was designed to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   At its essence, Petitioners' position is that, having chosen to participate in the process, Virginia was foreclosed from placing significant reliance on the judgment of federal agencies regarding the general effectiveness of the types of protections in place here and was limited in the types of evidence on which it could base its reasonable-assurance\n   certification. We see no reason why Virginia should be so hamstrung. And we see no purpose we would serve by stepping in and second-guessing the analytical methods Virginia deemed appropriate to provide it with reasonable assurance that its water quality would be protected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Petitioners (and amicus Chesapeake Bay Foundation) also challenge the State Agencies' decision to analyze the impacts from activities covered by NWP 12 separately from the impacts from upland activities related to construction. In light of this segmentation, Petitioners maintain that issuance of the December 401 Certification was arbitrary and capricious because the State Agencies \"fail[ed] to consider the combined effect of the upland activities and the stream and wetland crossings.\" Petitioners' Opening brief at 35. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   We note initially that the petition for review here challenges only the December 401 Certification. There is thus no argument before us that the State Agencies improperly limited the scope of their April 401 Certification to the impact of activities covered by NWP 12. What we do consider today is Petitioners' argument that the State Agencies erred by not including the impact of activities covered by NWP 12 within the scope of their supplemental 401 process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   We find this criticism to be unfounded. Contrary to Petitioners' suggestion, DEQ \"did not review the Project's potential upland impacts in a vacuum.\" MVP's brief at 51. Rather, DEQ \"fully integrated [its earlier] analysis into its review of upland impacts.\" MVP's brief at 50. Indeed, DEQ explained in its \"Basis for Certification\" that it was its intention that the April 401 Certification for the activities covered by NWP 12 and the additional proposed 401 certification \"\n   <em>\n    together\n   </em>\n   would constitute the Commonwealth of Virginia's 401 Certification for the MVP Project.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.A. 103 (emphasis in original). DEQ's analysis in the supplemental process included consideration of the impacts the activities covered by NWP 12 were expected to have. Thus, although the December 401 Certification \"addresse[d] only activities in upland areas,\" J.A. 48, and determined that there was reasonable assurance that\n   <em>\n    allowing these activities\n   </em>\n   would not reduce water quality, DEQ made this determination with full awareness and consideration of the fact that the NWP 12-covered activities would also be occurring. And in the end, DEQ made clear that it was only \"[t]he additional conditions contained in Section V of the draft certification\n   <em>\n    along with the requirements imposed by the VWP regulation, the Corps Section 404 permitting requirements\n   </em>\n   , and prior regulatory actions associated with the approval and requirements of the June 2017 [Annual Standards and Specifications],\" that \"provide[d] reasonable assurance that water quality standards will not be violated.\" J.A. 113 (emphasis added). Finally, as we have discussed, a significant basis for the State Agencies' reasonable-assurance certification was the existence of monitoring requirements that would allow DEQ to make prompt adjustments if samples revealed exceedances of pre-construction\n   sedimentation levels. In this way, the monitoring plan protected against\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   degradation of water quality from the Project, without regard to what particular activities (or combination of activities) was the cause. For all of these reasons, we conclude that the State Agencies' segmented approach to the December 401 Certification, even if unorthodox, was not arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In sum, because we conclude that the State Agencies did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in issuing the December 401 Certification, we deny the petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <em>\n    PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    Equitrans, L.P. also applied to construct and operate a portion of the pipeline that would provide service from western Pennsylvania and interconnect with the Project in Wetzel County, West Virginia.
