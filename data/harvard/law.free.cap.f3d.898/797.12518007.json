Anthony Markeith King and Kristen L. Raines were charged in a conspiracy to distribute scheduled controlled substances without an effective prescription in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (b)(1)(C), (b)(1)(E), and 846. Raines was also charged with two counts of distribution of a scheduled controlled substance without an effective prescription, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (b)(1)(C), and (b)(1)(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   King pled guilty to the conspiracy charge. The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   put King at a base offense level of 26, then added a four-point enhancement for acting as an organizer or leader and subtracted two points for acceptance of responsibility. King then had an offense level of 28, criminal history category I, with a Guidelines range of 78-97 months. The court sentenced King to 120 months' imprisonment, varying upward due to the nature of King's role in the conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Raines proceeded to trial and was convicted on the conspiracy charge and acquitted on the distribution charges. The district court found Raines to be at offense level 26 (after applying a two-point enhancement for abuse of position of trust), criminal history category I, with a Guidelines range of 63-78 months. The court sentenced Raines to 70 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Raines appeals her conviction and sentence, claiming: 1) the court improperly admitted evidence at trial, 2) the court erred in instructing the jury, 3) the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction, and 4) her sentence is substantively unreasonable. King challenges the reasonability of his sentence. We affirm the district court in all respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Artex Medical Clinic opened in Little Rock, Arkansas, in June of 2014. Patients\n   at Artex frequently received prescriptions for hydrocodone and/or Xanax. Artex operated on a cash-fee basis, where patients would pay $200 in cash prior to being evaluated. Anthony King worked as a \"recruiter\" for the clinic. King recruited patients from across Arkansas to the clinic. Patients were required to sign a \"pain contract\" in which they agreed to opioid treatment before they were seen or diagnosed by medical staff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Kristen Raines began working as an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse for Artex in July of 2014. From nearly the time she was hired until the clinic closed in September of 2014, Raines was the only employee of Artex present on a daily basis who was licensed to write prescriptions for hydrocodone and Xanax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Drug Enforcement Administration announced that drugs containing hydrocodone would become Schedule II drugs on October 6, 2014, which led to Artex closing its doors at the end of September. Shortly after Artex closed, its operators (including King) opened KJ Medical Clinic. Because of hydrocodone's new scheduling, Artex employed two doctors as prescribing physicians. The new clinic operated similarly to the old clinic-patients would walk-in and pay either $200 for a pain evaluation or $150 for treatment for a \"cough.\" In early November of 2014, Raines began working at KJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The signs that KJ was not operating as a legitimate medical establishment were apparent. Receptionists at the clinic guided patients' answers on questionnaires to make them appropriate candidates for controlled substance prescriptions. Patients were instructed to fill their prescriptions only at particular pharmacies. Patients were required to sign forms attesting that they were not involved in any government investigation into the clinic. Patients were given an \"entrance number\" in the parking lot near the building and were only allowed inside in limited numbers. Upon entry plaintiffs were checked for weapons by an armed security guard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The clinic's unorthodox methods extended to patient evaluations and the prescription of medications. Doctors at the clinic would pre-fill prescriptions for hydrocodone and Xanax. Nurses would then conduct in-person evaluations of the patients and complete the pre-filled prescriptions over the physician's signature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Raines left KJ in early January of 2015. King continued recruiting patients until May of 2015, when the clinic was raided by the DEA. Following the raid, Raines and King were charged in a conspiracy to distribute controlled substances. Raines was also charged with two counts of distribution of a controlled substance without an effective prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At trial the government presented evidence from cooperating co-conspirators, confidential informants, and an expert medical witness. Stella Green, a coworker nurse, testified that using pre-signed prescriptions was standard procedure for the clinic. Several other witnesses also testified that the clinic relied on pre-signed prescriptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The government introduced evidence from a confidential informant who visited the clinic in November of 2014, January of 2015, and March of 2015. Raines was working at the clinic during the time period of the first two visits, but not the third. The informant testified that on each visit prospective patients were told to take a number, get in line, and wait to receive a prescription. She described the atmosphere as chaotic, with patients arguing about who would get inside to fill their prescription. She testified that on her first visit when she handed her paperwork in and marked only a \"5\" on the pain scale, a\n   desk clerk asked her to change her answer to a \"10\" or else she would be unable to see a doctor. The government introduced a video taken during the informant's third visit to the clinic. The informant testified that the contents of the video were similar in many ways to her experience during her first two trips to the clinic. A coworker testified that Raines would have walked through or seen the same areas that the video was taken in as an ordinary part of her workday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A medical expert, Dr. Carlos Roman, testified regarding standards of practice in the field of pain management, guidelines for prescribing medications, and \"red flags\" that indicated potential painkiller abuse. Dr. Roman had twenty years of experience in the medical profession and had served on the Arkansas State Medical Board Review Committee since 2005, including as chairman. Dr. Roman also served as the Chief of Pain Management at St. Vincent Infirmary in Little Rock, Arkansas. Dr. Roman noted that the Artex \"pain contract\" and KJ's signed form prohibiting patients from participating in law enforcement activity were not typical for a legitimate medical establishment. He also testified regarding the Prescription Monitoring Program (\"PMP\") data offered by the United States as evidence of irregular prescription activity. The data was submitted to the trial court in a summary chart form showing hydrocodone and Xanax prescriptions allegedly written by Raines while working at Artex. The original versions of the prescriptions referenced in the chart were also submitted to the court. Of approximately 112 patient files from KJ, 21 contained paperwork signed by Raines, along with prescriptions bearing Raines's handwriting and a physician's signature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dr. Roman testified that he believed the records indicated a failure to pursue a legitimate medical purpose. He based his review on all of the files available from Artex, ten files chosen at random from KJ, and eleven files identified as relating to patients Raines treated at KJ. He noted that patients had consistently marked either a \"9\" or \"10\" on the pain scale. He further remarked that the patients' answers to anxiety and depression questionnaires were outside the normal boundary for treatment by a pain specialist and indicated suicidal tendencies. In particular, he noted that several of the files raised concerns that medical treatment had been limited to the prescription of opioids when the alleged circumstances would have required more detailed and thorough care. He also commented on an audio recording from an informant patient in which Raines referred to Xanax by the street term \"bars.\" He noted that using street terms is not normal in medical practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   During the jury instruction conference, Raines requested a \"good faith\" instruction, proposing the following language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   When you consider the good faith defense, it is the defendant's belief that is important. It is the sincerity of the defendant's belief that determines if he or she acted in good faith. If the defendant's belief is unreasonable, you may consider that in determining his or her sincerity of belief, but an unreasonable belief sincerely held is good faith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial judge declined to provide the instruction. The trial judge provided an instruction on willful blindness over Raines's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Raines was convicted on the conspiracy charge and acquitted on the substantive distribution charges. At sentencing the district court found Raines responsible for 125,940 pills of hydrocodone and 151,076 pills of Xanax. The court also applied an enhancement for abuse of position of trust. Raines was sentenced to a term of 70\n   months' imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The district court applied a sentence enhancement to King for being an organizer or leader and also applied a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. King was sentenced to a term of 120 months' imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Evidentiary Rulings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \" Federal Rule of Evidence 403 allows a district court to exclude evidence 'if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of ... unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.' \"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Raines raises a series of objections to evidentiary decisions made by the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    1. The Prescription Monitoring Program Data Summaries\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Raines claims the PMP data is inadmissable because it is of questionable reliability and is unfairly prejudicial. The PMP data was corroborated by several other pieces of evidence, including cross-references to particular days on which Raines worked, patient sign-in logs for those days, and hard copies of the actual prescriptions offered to those patients. Those corroborating elements provided sufficient reliability for the PMP summaries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Contrary to Raines's assertion, it was not unfairly prejudicial for the PMP summaries to include only those prescriptions for the particular substances alleged in the conspiracy. The district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the PMP evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    2. Expert Physician Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Raines objects to the admission of Dr. Roman's expert physician testimony on the grounds that it was based on both a lack of personal knowledge and an inadequate review of the prescription records. Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence governs the admission of expert testimony. \"We review a district court's decision to\n   admit expert testimony for an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. GEICO Gen. Ins.

Dr. Roman was well qualified to testify concerning standards of practice in the field of pain management, including warning signs regarding abuse of pain medication or diversion of medication. And given Dr. Roman's \"personal knowledge [and] experience,\" he was a reliable source of testimony on standards of medical care and the import of the PMP charts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

While Dr. Roman acknowledged that he could not definitively state that any particular prescription was illegitimate absent more information, his opinion on the general operation of the clinic based on the accumulated evidence was still relevant. On the whole, Dr. Roman's opinion on the PMP charts \"advance[d] the trier of fact's understanding\" of the clinical practices at KJ and Artex and how they differed from ordinary medical facilities. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Dr. Roman's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    3. Testimony from Clinic Coworker\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Stella Green testified regarding her personal knowledge of the general practice of the clinic. As a fellow nurse, Green had direct knowledge of the clinic's general operating practices. While Green testified about her own observations and knowledge, it was circumstantial evidence of Raines's knowledge of or willful blindness to the nature of the clinic. Defense counsel was given the opportunity to cross-examine Green regarding her personal knowledge (or lack thereof) of Raines's specific actions. That opportunity sufficiently ensured the reliability of the testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Green's testimony was corroborated by other evidence offered through the course of the trial, particularly that the clinic relied on pre-signed prescriptions.

Videotape by an Informant\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Raines claims that the district court abused its discretion by admitting a videotape of a visit by a confidential informant that took place while she was not employed by the clinic. The video was offered as circumstantial evidence of Raines's knowledge of or willful blindness to the nature of the clinic. While Raines did not work at the clinic at the time the video was taken, the informant who captured\n   the video testified that the contents were similar to her prior visits to the clinic-which did occur while Raines was employed by the clinic. Other testimony corroborated that Raines would have viewed the same areas of the clinic shown on the video as part of her ordinary workday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We need not decide whether admission of the video was error, as \"improper admission of evidence which is cumulative of matters shown by admissible evidence is harmless error.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276689\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1155/#p1159\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Substantive Reasonableness of the Sentences\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   A sentencing court \"abuses its discretion if it fails to consider a relevant factor that should have received significant weight, gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or considers only the appropriate factors but commits a clear error of judgment in weighing those factors.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895901\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/480/1175/#p1177\">\n    480 F.3d 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1177 (8th Cir. 2007) (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Haack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9019971\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/403/997/#p1004\">\n    403 F.3d 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1004 (8th Cir. 2005) ). A sentence within the Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9019971\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/403/997/#p1004\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The district court adequately explained its sentence, even noting that it was appropriate with or without the existence of the Guidelines in light of the quantity of drugs that Raines had helped enter her community. The district court's decision not to weigh mitigating factors as heavily as Raines \"would have preferred does not justify reversal.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bridges\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659283\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/374/#p379\">\n    569 F.3d 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 379 (8th Cir. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   King's sentence was also substantively reasonable. The district court articulated its opinion that King's role as a recruiter who connected users from across the state of Arkansas with the pill mill deserved a stronger sentence than that contemplated by the Guidelines. The court noted that the sentence was designed to address the needs of the particular offender, given King's daily violation of the law and the damage caused to the community. Under these circumstances, an upward variance of 23 months was not an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

In that case we held that specific prescriptions introduced into evidence but not addressed in the relevant indictment should have been barred on Rule 404(b) and 403 grounds.
