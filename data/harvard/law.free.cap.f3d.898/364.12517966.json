Under it, debt collectors are prohibited from engaging in deceptive, abusive, or otherwise unfair practices to collect debts.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Teppers filed a complaint alleging Amos violated the FDCPA and Amos timely replied. In their pretrial filings, the Teppers argued that Amos was a \"debt collector\" as defined in \u00a7 1692a(6) of the Act because their loan was in default and Amos considered the loan to be in default when it was purchased. They alleged Amos violated the Act through its written and oral communications with the Teppers, in part because it was not registered to do business in Pennsylvania when it threatened and filed foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Amos, in its pretrial filings, did not contest its status as a \"debt collector\" under the Act. Rather, it argued it was not required to register in Pennsylvania as a foreign business entity because its sole business was acquiring and collecting debt. During the one-day bench trial that followed, Korogluyan testified to the same and added that the higher loan amount was calculated using an increased interest rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The District Court requested post-trial memoranda from the parties. In their memorandum, the Teppers argued Amos violated the FDCPA because it increased their loan's interest rate without first terminating and accelerating the loan, which their credit agreement required. Amos, in its memorandum, again did not challenge its status as a debt collector, and repeated that it was not required to register in the Commonwealth because its sole business was collecting the debt it acquired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   After the trial and post-trial supplemental briefing, but before the District Court issued a decision, the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   . In response, the District Court ordered additional briefing for the parties to address whether, in light of\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   , Amos qualifies as a debt collector.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Thereafter the Court decided: (1) Amos is a \"debt collector\" as defined in \u00a7 1692a(6); (2) the Teppers' loan is a \"debt\" as defined in \u00a7 1692a(5) of the Act; and (3) Amos violated the Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Tepper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203446886\">\n    2017 WL 3446886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7-10. Amos was not liable for failing to register as a foreign business in Pennsylvania, however, because it is a debt collector.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10. It appeals the District Court's decision, arguing that it is not a debt collector. Accordingly, we summarize only the Court's reasoning for that part of its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Taking heed from\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   , the District Court looked first to the statute's text.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. It explained there are two ways for a plaintiff to prove a defendant is a debt collector: either (1) its \"principal purpose ... is the collection of any debts,\" or (2) it \"regularly collects or attempts to collect ... debts owed or due ... another.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8 (quoting \u00a7 1692a). It explained that, following\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   , an entity that purchases debts and then seeks to collect them for its own account is ineligible for the second definition because it is limited to those who regularly collect debts due a third party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By contrast, the first definition applies to \"collection of any debts\" so long as that activity is the entity's \"principal purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing \u00a7 1692a). The parties did not dispute that Amos's sole business activity is purchasing and then attempting to collect debts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Hence the Court held Amos meets the first definition of debt collector.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   did not decide, but nonetheless affects, who fits the \"principal purpose\" definition of \"debt collector.\" Whereas, prior to the Supreme Court's decision, our precedent in\n   <em>\n    Pollice\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Check Investors\n   </em>\n   instructed us to look at whether the debt was in default at the time it was purchased, after\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   the \"default\" test falls away for a \"principal purpose\" framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We take our cue from the Court to begin by carefully examining the statute's text.\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604742\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1718/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both Amos and the Teppers contend the plain text of the statute supports their desired outcome-Amos arguing that it fits the definition of \"creditor\" and therefore it is not a \"debt collector\" because the terms are mutually exclusive, and the Teppers arguing it fits the \"principal purpose\" definition of \"debt collector.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We do not overlook Amos's omission of the \"principal purpose\" definition from its argument. Its admitted sole business is collecting debts it has purchased. It uses the mails and wires for its business. It can be no plainer that Amos \"uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts.\" \u00a7 1692a(6). \"Any debts\" does not distinguish to whom the debt is owed. And it stands in contrast to \"debts owed or due ... another,\" which limits only the \"regularly collects\" definition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604742\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1718/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hen we're engaged in the business of interpreting statutes we presume differences in language ... convey differences in meaning.\"). Asking if Amos is a debt collector is thus akin to\n   asking if Popeye is a sailor. He's no cowboy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Amos claims that because it also meets the definition of creditor-it is the entity \"to whom [the] debt is owed,\" \u00a7 1692a(4)-it is not a debt collector. In\n   <em>\n    Check Investors\n   </em>\n   we noted an entity may satisfy the statutory definition of \"creditor\" and yet be a \"debt collector.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5526333\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/159/\">\n    502 F.3d at 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Our conclusion today does not require us to sort out what\n   <em>\n    Check Investors\n   </em>\n   intended by its statement that those terms are mutually exclusive. Suffice it to say that, following\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   , an entity that satisfies both is within the Act's reach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Amos argues as its fallback position that if we do not find it is a creditor (to the exclusion of being a debt collector), we should hold that it is not a debt collector under the definition's exclusion for \"officer[s] [and] employee[s] of a creditor [who], in the name of the creditor, [are] collecting debts for [the] creditor.\" \u00a7 1692a(6)(A). This exception clearly does not fit; for even if Amos is a nominal creditor, the Teppers sued Amos, a limited liability company, and not any of its officers or employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In sum, Amos may be one tough gazookus when it attempts to collect the defaulted debts it has purchased, but when its conduct crosses the lines prescribed by the FDCPA, it opens itself up to the Act's penalties. The District Court held that Amos's debt-collection attempts with the Teppers crossed those lines, and it must face the statute's penalties for its bad behavior. We affirm the portion of the Court's opinion Amos has challenged on appeal-that it is a debt collector under the \"principal purpose\" definition. The Court decided correctly in light of\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   's repeal of the \"default\" test. Whether an entity acquired the debts it collects after they became defaulted does not resolve whether that entity is a debt collector. Instead, we follow the plain text of the statute: an entity whose principal purpose of business is the collection of any debts is a debt collector regardless whether the entity owns the debts it collects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Thus we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Though not relevant here, the definition of \"debt collector\" also includes \"any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the enforcement of security interests.\" \u00a7 1692a(6).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The Fifth Circuit, in a non-precedential opinion, ruled that because\n    <em>\n     Henson\n    </em>\n    held \"that debt purchasers who collect for their own accounts are not 'debt collectors' under the 'regularly collects' alternative,\" the plaintiff failed to state a claim to that effect.\n    <em>\n     Infante v.

In addition, the Eleventh Circuit has since applied its pre-\n    <em>\n     Henson\n    </em>\n    standard that \"a non-originating debt holder [does not qualify as] a 'debt collector' ... solely because the debt was in default at the time it was acquired\" (which, it noted,\n    <em>\n     Henson\n    </em>\n    confirmed).\n    <em>\n     Kurtzman v.
