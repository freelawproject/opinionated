Thomas unsuccessfully challenged in state court his conviction for assault with intent to commit murder, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support that conviction. He then filed a federal habeas corpus petition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which the district court denied.

Our statement of the facts below includes both the facts stated by the Michigan Court of Appeals and additional facts from witness testimony at trial which Thomas has not disputed here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In April 2005, Thomas held Rodney Harrison hostage in his own home for several hours while another man, Larry Davidson, searched Harrison's home for a large sum of money that Thomas and Davidson believed was hidden in the home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

Ct. App. Dec. 13, 2007). Davidson first gained entry into Harrison's home by trickery, and then held Harrison at gunpoint while calling Thomas on the phone, telling Thomas that he was \"in,\" and instructing Thomas to come to the side door of Harrison's home.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204355431\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Once Thomas was inside, Davidson told Thomas to keep his eyes on Harrison and to shoot Harrison if he made a sound.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204355431\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thomas then told Harrison to sit on the sofa with his hands underneath his thighs, and threatened to kill Harrison if he moved or made a sound.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204355431\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the next two-and-a-half hours, Thomas held a gun to Harrison's head while Davidson ransacked the home.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204355431\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At the end of this time, Davidson had still not found the money. A third man arrived and told Thomas and Davidson to \"[t]ie [Harrison] up, execution-style.\" Before they tied him up, Davidson told Harrison that \"I'm about to shoot your motherf***ing ass,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"You're about to die,\" and \"I'm going to shoot you with your own f***ing gun. Naw[,] I'm going to shoot you with [my] gun.\" The men then put Harrison on his stomach, handcuffed him, blindfolded him, tied his feet, and tied his legs together. As he lay on the floor, Harrison thought that the men were going to shoot him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Davidson then attacked Harrison, kicking him several times in the kidney and pistol-whipping his head. Harrison later suffered from a malfunctioning kidney as a result of the kicks. Thomas himself did not kick or pistol-whip Harrison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After this attack, Davidson made a phone call within earshot of Harrison, during which he said, \"We cannot find the money or the dope. We've got to put four bullets in this mother****er because he's a big guy, and we've got to put two into his wife.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Harrison's wife returned home from work towards the end of the home invasion, but quickly left once she realized what was happening. Upon seeing her, Thomas said \"Damn, she's here. She's getting away,\" and chased her. Harrison's wife escaped to a neighbor's home and called the police, but the men had left the Harrisons' home by the time the police arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A Michigan jury convicted Thomas of assault with intent to commit murder,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20750.83\">\n    Mich.

The district court held those proceedings in abeyance while Thomas exhausted his state-court remedies for a different claim. When the district court reopened the proceedings, Thomas argued among other things that his \"conviction for assault with intent to commit murder [was] not supported by sufficient evidence.\" The district court denied relief on that claim, and we granted a certificate of appealability for that claim only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\") provides the standard of review in this case.

Read in isolation (but not, in my view, in conjunction with the crime's other two elements), the \"intent-to-kill\" element is susceptible of two interpretations-one broader, the other narrower. The narrower interpretation posits that a defendant convicted under Section 750.83 must have intended to kill the victim by means of the very assault in question. According to the broader reading, a defendant's intent to kill the victim at some post-assault point in the near future satisfies the element. Because the evidence was clearly insufficient to convict Thomas (either as a principal or as an accomplice) under the narrower interpretation of the intent-to-kill element, the reasonableness of the Michigan Court of Appeals's application of the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   standard hinges on whether the majority's broad interpretation of Section 750.83 's intent-to-kill element is viable under the Michigan courts' precedents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

After reciting the elements of the crime, the court elaborated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   An assault may be established by showing either an attempt to commit a battery or an unlawful act that places another in reasonable apprehension of receiving an immediate battery.

Absent from the court's analysis is any explicit holding that the crime's elements can be satisfied without proof that the defendant intended to kill the victim by means of the assault in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The majority seems to suggest, however, that such a holding was implicit in the court's reasoning.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanford v.

Because an individual can intend his attempted battery to kill a victim, even if the attempted battery misses its mark or otherwise fails, the narrow interpretation of Section 750.83 's intent-to-kill element is fully consistent with the caselaw holding that a physical injury is not a prerequisite for a conviction under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The narrower interpretation also leaves room for assault-with-intent-to-commit-murder convictions based on apprehension-type assaults.

Ct. App. Aug. 16, 2012), for example, the Michigan Court of Appeals upheld an assault-with-intent-to-commit-murder conviction where the defendant broke into the victim's house; attempted, while holding a knife, to force his way into the victim's barricaded bedroom; and verbally threatened to kill her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3. But because the victim fortunately climbed out of her window and called the police before the defendant breached the bedroom door, the defendant did not actually attempt a battery.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The court nevertheless held that Section 750.83 's elements were satisfied because the \"[d]efendant placed the victim in reasonable apprehension of an immediate battery\" and because his \"statements that he intended to kill the victim demonstrate the requisite intent to commit murder.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. And because the defendant was holding a knife, a reasonable jury could have concluded that the barricaded bedroom door was the only thing that prevented the defendant's apprehension-type assault from evolving into an attempted or consummated battery intended to kill the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The apprehension-type assault in\n   <em>\n    Sheppard\n   </em>\n   is materially different from the assaults that Thomas and Davidson committed because the record in this case bears out that, of all of the assaults committed, only the nonlethal acts of rope-tying, pistol-whipping, and kicking evolved from apprehension-type assaults into attempted or consummated batteries. By contrast, a reasonable jury could infer that Sheppard intended his apprehension-type assault to immediately evolve into an attempted or consummated battery intended to kill the victim, even though the barricaded door halted that evolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The upshot is that the Michigan Court of Appeals neither explicitly nor implicitly held in the case before us that Section 750.83 's intent element can be satisfied by an intent to kill at some point in the near future, but not by means of the very assault in question. By all appearances, the\n   court instead held that a rational juror could have found that either Thomas or Davidson intended to kill Harrison by means of the assaults that they committed against him. But a holding premised on such a conclusion, which is not supported by the record, would have been an unreasonable application of the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   standard. The State, quite tellingly, acknowledged in its brief that the Michigan Court of Appeals might have been unreasonable in affirming Thomas's conviction under a theory of principal liability, even though the evidence was equally sufficient to convict him as a principal or as an accomplice under the broad interpretation of the intent-to-kill element. This leads us to the question of whether the majority's interpretation of Section 750.83 is a tenable reading of the intent-to-kill element under the Michigan courts' existing caselaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Estelle v.

But that is not the type of analysis in which Thomas asks us to engage. No Michigan court has ever explicitly or implicitly adopted the broad interpretation of Section 750.83 's intent-to-kill element, so such an interpretation is not rooted in a determination that this court could reexamine, even if it had the authority to do so. Rather, the broad interpretation is the majority's own after-the-fact explanation for the Michigan Court of Appeals's affirmance of Thomas's conviction.

App. Feb. 26, 2013), supports his argument that the broad interpretation of Section 750.83 's intent-to-kill element is incorrect. In that case, the Michigan Court of Appeals overturned an assault-with-intent-to-commit-murder conviction based on the defendant's nonlethal battering of a victim coupled with a conditional threat that he would return and kill the victim if she did not cease the conduct to which he objected.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3-5. The court determined that the defendant's violent actions were not intended to kill the victim and that his threat of future lethal violence did not satisfy the intent-to-kill element because \"it was not proof beyond a reasonable doubt that [the] defendant intended to kill the victim\n   <em>\n    at the time he committed the assault\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3 (emphasis added). Although\n   <em>\n    Cameron\n   </em>\n   involved a conditional\n   threat to kill in the future, whereas some of the threats here were unconditional,\n   <em>\n    Cameron\n   </em>\n   's reasoning implies a presumption that a defendant convicted under Section 750.83 must have intended his immediate assault to kill the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Because\n   <em>\n    Cameron\n   </em>\n   postdates the Michigan Court of Appeals's ruling in Thomas's direct appeal, the majority opines that the decision proves only that the state court potentially \"changed Michigan law in 2013\" to adopt the narrower interpretation of Section 750.83 's intent-to-kill element. Maj. Op. at 700 n.3. But\n   <em>\n    Cameron\n   </em>\n   cannot have changed Michigan law because the majority has identified no earlier case that explicitly or implicitly adopts the broad interpretation. The case is therefore probative of the Michigan courts' position on the issue both before and during Thomas's direct appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

If Thomas's assault-with-intent-to-commit-murder conviction were vacated, he could be resentenced for the lesser-included offense of assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   If this court were to issue the writ in this case, Thomas would not go unpunished for the other serious crimes that he committed in 2005. The jury also convicted Thomas of (1) first-degree home invasion, (2) felonious assault, (3) possession of a firearm by a felon, and (4) possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony. Those other convictions account for 28 years of his minimum sentence of 78 years. Moreover, the jury was charged on the crime of assault with intent to commit great bodily harm less than murder,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20750.84\">\n    Mich.

Op. at 697. We could therefore issue the writ without prejudice to the State seeking an entry of conviction for the lesser-included offense, which carries a maximum sentence of ten years.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20750.84\">\n    Mich.

But under a proper interpretation of Michigan law, I do not believe that assault with intent to commit murder was one of them. The majority denies habeas relief based not on deference to the Michigan courts' interpretation of the crime at issue, but based on its own after-the-fact explanation for the Michigan Court of Appeals's affirmance of Thomas's conviction. Because I believe that this approach is contrary to the proper use of our habeas power in the sufficiency-of-the-evidence context, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    To the extent that Michigan law was unclear or unsettled on this point at the time of Thomas's state proceeding, we are bound by Michigan law as interpreted by the Michigan courts in his case. \"We have repeatedly held that a state court's interpretation of state law, including one announced on direct appeal of the challenged conviction, binds a federal court sitting in habeas corpus.\"\n    <em>\n     Bradshaw v.
