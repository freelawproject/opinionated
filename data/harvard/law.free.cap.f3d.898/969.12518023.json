The question before us is whether making specific commercial gun sales contingent on incorporating these innovations violates the constitution. This appeal stems from a challenge to three provisions of California's Unsafe Handgun Act (\"UHA\"). For safety reasons, California requires that new models of handguns meet certain criteria, and be listed on a handgun roster, before they may be offered for sale in the state. Two provisions require that a handgun have a chamber load indicator and a magazine detachment mechanism, both of which are designed to limit accidental firearm discharges. The third provision, adopted to aid law enforcement, requires new handguns to stamp microscopically the handgun's make, model, and serial number onto each fired shell casing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ivan Pena, along with several other individuals and two nonprofit organizations, the Second Amendment Foundation, Inc. and the Calguns Foundation, Inc. (collectively, \"Purchasers\"), challenge the constitutionality of the UHA. Purchasers argue that these three provisions have narrowed their ability to buy firearms in California, in violation of the Second Amendment, and that the handgun roster scheme imposes irrational exceptions, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We do not need to reach the question of whether these limitations fall within the scope of the Second Amendment's right to bear arms because, even assuming coverage, these provisions pass constitutional muster. The California law only regulates commercial sales, not possession, and does so in a way that does not impose a substantial burden on Purchasers. We reject Purchasers' claim that they have a constitutional right to purchase a particular handgun. Nor do the provisions violate the Equal Protection Clause. We affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Unsafe Handgun Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As its name implies, California's Unsafe Handgun Act (UHA) seeks to reduce the number of firearm deaths in the state. The primary enforcement clause reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A person in this state who manufactures or causes to be manufactured, imports into the state for sale, keeps for sale, offers or exposes for sale, gives, or lends an unsafe handgun shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   CAL. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32000(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   An \"unsafe handgun\" is defined as \"any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person\" and that does not have certain safety devices, meet firing requirements, or satisfy drop safety requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 31910.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The UHA charges the California Department of Justice (\"CDOJ\") with maintaining a roster of all handgun models that have been tested by a certified testing laboratory, \"have been determined not to be unsafe handguns,\" and may be sold in the state.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 32015(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Effectively, the\n   Act presumes all handguns are unsafe unless the CDOJ determines them \"not to be unsafe.\" Handguns with purely cosmetic differences (including a difference in finish, grip material, and shape or texture of the grip) from a handgun already on the roster need not meet these criteria.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 32030.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Over time, California has added new requirements for inclusion on the roster. Since 2007, new models of semiautomatic pistols must be equipped with both a chamber load indicator (CLI) and a magazine detachment mechanism (MDM)-safety features designed to limit accidental discharges that occur when someone mistakenly believes no round is in the chamber.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 31910(b)(5). A CLI is a \"device that plainly indicates that a cartridge is in the firing chamber.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16380. An MDM is \"a mechanism that prevents a semiautomatic pistol that has a detachable magazine from operating to strike the primer of ammunition in the firing chamber when a detachable magazine is not inserted in the semiautomatic pistol.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16900.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Since 2013, new models of semiautomatic pistols need to include a feature called \"microstamping\": each such pistol must imprint two sets of microscopic arrays of characters that identify the make, model, and serial number of the pistol onto the cartridge or shell casing of each fired round.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 31910(b)(7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Designed to help solve crimes, microstamping provides law enforcement with identifying information about a handgun fired at a crime scene.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fiscal v.

Most significant, the required features are inapplicable to models of semiautomatic pistols that were \"already listed on the roster\" when such requirements became effective. CAL.

In addition, firearms sold to law enforcement officials and certain curios or relics (as defined in the\n   <em>\n    Code of Federal Regulations\n   </em>\n   ) are exempt. CAL.

District Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Seeking to enjoin the state from enforcing the UHA, in 2009 Purchasers sued the Chief of the CDOJ Bureau of Firearms Stephen Lindley on two constitutional theories. Purchasers claimed that the CLI, MDM, and microstamping requirements restricted access to the firearms of their choice, in violation of the Second Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Purchasers also claimed that the\n   UHA's roster scheme transgressed the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by making irrational exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After cross-motions, briefing, and a hearing, the district court granted summary judgment to California. Citing the Supreme Court's landmark decision in\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v.

The district court observed that the provisions were conditions on the sale of firearms, not prohibitions, and that Purchasers maintained access to nearly 1,000 types of firearms on the roster, all of which were approved for sale in California. Purchasers' \"[i]nsistence upon ... particular\" handguns, the court concluded, simply \"f[e]ll outside the scope of the right to bear arms.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Moving forward, the statute limits commercial sales of new models of semiautomatic pistols to those with the CLI, MDM, and microstamping protections.

Although MDMs might prevent a gun from firing at will, it is likely a rare occurrence when someone has time to put a round from outside a magazine in the chamber without inserting the magazine itself. CLIs and MDMs are designed to make the handgun owner aware of when there is ammunition in the chamber.

The parties agree that these objectives are important. The first step is undisputedly satisfied.\"). The CLI and MDM requirements also reasonably fit with California's interest in public safety. A CLI lets someone know that a gun is loaded without even having to pick it up to check; it acts as a red flag for those handling the gun who may have forgotten that it was loaded. An MDM prevents a firearm from shooting unless a magazine is inserted. Without an MDM, a magazine-equipped pistol can be fired if there is a bullet in the chamber, even if the magazine has not been inserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In one sense then, an MDM disables a gun capable of providing self-defense. But the practical effect strikes us as a rare instance. Because it is more likely that people will associate firearms that have magazines with loaded firearms and firearms that do not have magazines with unloaded firearms, the legislature could reasonably predict that the MDM could prevent accidental discharges of the weapon. The legislative judgment that preventing cases of accidental discharge outweighs the need for discharging a gun without the magazine in place is reasonable. The legislative history cites studies confirming this common-sense conclusion. Purchasers do not provide any reliable evidence that these studies are incorrect or that CLIs or MDMs will clearly thwart, rather than advance, California's goal of saving lives by preventing accidental discharges. The fit between the prevention of accidental discharges and the requiring of CLIs and\n   MDMs on not-yet-rostered handguns is a reasonable one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Purchasers argue that the UHA's requirements have \"nothing to do with consumer safety\" because the UHA \"exempts specially-favored individuals whose safety is no less important[ ] [and] mandates alleged 'safety' features that California instructs consumers to ignore as unreliable.\" Purchasers point to exemptions in the UHA for law enforcement, entertainment industry-related props, intra-family transfers, and private-party transfers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , CAL.

The exceptions are not so pervasive or without basis as to make the fit unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Purchasers further fault the UHA because \"not every aspect of the roster obviously advances the state's regulatory interest.\" Purchasers argue that once a gun has been deemed \"safe\" and put on the roster and then falls off the roster for administrative reasons, California has no interest in deeming it \"unsafe.\" We do not agree. Although purely administrative reasons may not have anything to do with a weapon's performance and safety-just as not having a current driver's license is not proof that the driver is not a safe driver-we will not interfere with the orderly administration of California's roster. We are not here to order California to re-list weapons where the manufacturers or importers have otherwise failed to comply with California law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Purchasers also argue that California \"teaches consumers to disregard [CLIs] and [MDMs], [so] requiring handguns to have these features actually impedes the state's safety interests.\" Amicus briefs filed in support of Purchasers add that the regulations, by encouraging people to look for or rely on a CLI or a MDM, respectively, \"inevitably discourage[ ] individuals from\n   <em>\n    actually checking\n   </em>\n   to see whether a firearm is loaded.\" This,\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   tell us, \"may increase the likelihood of an unintentional discharge.\" We disagree. California does not instruct consumers to disregard CLIs and MDMs. Instead, the regulations simply mean that consumers should not rely entirely on them or assume that just because a magazine is out or the CLI is not popped up, the weapon is incapable of being dangerous. \"Treat all guns as if they are loaded,\" California tells gun-owners.

Serial number tracing \"enabl[es] law enforcement to gather vital information about recovered firearms.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707189\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/85/#p91\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The same logic applies to recovered bullets, and counsels the conclusion that limiting the availability of untraceable bullets serves a substantial government interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   California also has established a \"reasonable fit\" between these substantial interests and the microstamping requirement. The legislative history supporting the microstamping provision describes California's \"enormous and diverse\" problem regarding unsolved homicides committed with handguns. In approximately 45 percent of all homicides in California, no arrests are made because police lack the needed evidence, and more than 60 percent of the homicides in California are committed with handguns. According to the legislative history, microstamping would \"provide rapid leads in the first crucial hours after a homicide\" because police could match a bullet found at a crime scene with the registered owner. This data is particularly critical in drive-by-shootings, the legislature observes, where the only evidence at the crime scene may be spent cartridges. California is dealing with a real-world problem and has crafted a real-world solution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The California legislature considered and rejected other, more intrusive solutions to combat the unsolved homicide-by-handgun problem. The legislature found that microstamping technology improved the accuracy of ballistic identification \"without requiring the manpower and expense associated with the creation and maintenance of a ballistic image database containing millions of images.\" Purchasers do not suggest a less invasive approach to curbing unsolved handgun homicides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Instead, Purchasers contest California's evidence that microstamping will address the problem\n   <em>\n    effectively\n   </em>\n   . California presented evidence that existing microstamping technology is accurate 96 percent of the time. Purchasers caution that the microstamping technology is not as reliable as California claims. The standard does not demand that California's solution be a perfect one. At the time it considered this provision, the California legislature weighed competing evidence on effectiveness before enacting the statute. California's evidence need only \"fairly support[ ]\" its conclusions.\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240538\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/953/#p960\">\n    746 F.3d at 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . California has gone well beyond this threshold requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Purchasers also argue that microstamping is impracticable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although this case involves the Purchasers, not the manufacturers, the Purchasers cloak their argument in the language of the producers. The reality is not that manufacturers cannot meet the standard but rather that they have chosen not to. Purchasers offered\n   evidence that gun manufacturers have not \"produced a functioning, commercially available semiautomatic pistol\" equipped with the microstamping technology and they \"have no plans to attempt to do so.\" The declarations offered are \"lacking in details,\" as the dissent candidly notes, and rest on conclusory language, such as \"appears infeasible\" or \"cannot practically implement.\" Simply because no gun manufacturer is \"even considering trying\" to implement the technology, it does not follow that microstamping is technologically infeasible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Notably, the parties agree that semiautomatic handguns are not subject to the microstamping requirement and are grandfathered as long as the manufacturer continues to pay a roster fee and the firearms do not fail a retest. We thus find it odd, indeed, that the manufacturers indirectly assert a right to sell new models of-modern-semiautomatic handguns, but refuse to modernize their firearms by installing microstamping features. We need not accept wholesale that manufacturers will decline to implement this new public safety technology in the face of California's evidence that the technology is available and that compliance is feasible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   It is ironic that Purchasers filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, agreeing with California that \"[t]his case's essential facts are not in dispute.\" As Purchasers lay out in their cross-motion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendant admits that no handguns for sale in the United States have the microstamping technology required by California's roster law. No firearms manufacturer has submitted any microstamping-compliant handguns, and Defendant has no information as to whether any manufacturer will ever produce microstamping handguns. Accordingly, the microstamping requirement imposes a de facto ban on the sale of all new semiautomatic handgun models in California.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   For Purchasers, it is enough that manufacturers say that they will not and \"cannot\" comply. But that begs the question of the deference we provide to California's lawmakers, who made a considered judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   California's evidence carries the day in the legislative context. The state produced evidence that compliance with the microstamping requirement is \"technologically possible\" and would cost an incremental $3.00 to $10.00 per gun. By 2008, the inventor of microstamping had publicly tested the technology with local police departments across the country. In those tests, he gave microstamping-equipped firearms and cartridges to local range officers so that they could observe the stamped cartridges and extract their codes. Overall, the technology was publicly tested seven times with seven different police departments, including in Sacramento and Los Angeles before the law was enacted. In addition to this critical evidence, the legislature\n   considered studies showing that microstamping technology generally works.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Throughout the legislative process and in this litigation, the state has reasonably relied on Todd Lizotte, the inventor of microstamping. For over fifteen years, Lizotte has shared his expertise by testifying before state legislative committees, conducting public tests, and contributing to articles that appear in law enforcement periodicals, technical journals, and newspapers. During consideration of the UHA, Lizotte answered technical questions from the drafting committee, and the legislative history contains multiple references to Lizotte and his company, NanoMark Technologies. Given his extensive firsthand knowledge, it is significant that Lizotte concluded that \"20 years of development, testing and public demonstrations show that microstamping can be implemented,\" that \"[p]rinting two separate codes on the firing pin is feasible,\" and that \"it is possible for firearm manufacturers to implement microstamping technology contemplated by the California legislation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The judgment California made about technological feasibility is no less predictive than the judgment on efficacy. In both cases, the legislators reviewed the record, including conflicting testimony. We cannot countenance the dissent's effort to draw an artificial distinction and hold California to a standard never before imposed. The dissent suggests that California must produce specific evidence of compliance with its own microstamping requirement in a \"laboratory.\" But the state need not don lab coats, equip semiautomatic firearms with microstamping technology, and test the technological feasibility results itself. That is far too exacting a standard of \"proof\" in the context of intermediate legislative scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Renton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196723\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/41/#p52\">\n    475 U.S. at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196723\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/41/#p52\">\n    106 S.Ct. 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In effect, the dissent would transform the state into a gun manufacturer. Instead, California may \"predict[ ]\" as a policy judgment that gun manufacturers are capable of outfitting firearms with \"available\" technology when experts state that compliance is technologically \"feasible.\"\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651420\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/180/#p195\">\n    520 U.S. at 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651420\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/180/#p195\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Both mechanisms help prevent accidental handgun discharges by decreasing the likelihood that a person will mistakenly believe that the firing chamber is empty. I therefore join these portions of the majority opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   I part company with the majority, however, over the microstamping provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs have raised two different points. First, they argue that the mechanism for stamping cartridge casings can be disabled by the owner, thus undoing the benefits of microstamping. The State and its\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   emphasize that microstamping is a proven technology and that, even if some owners disable the microstamping mechanism, it will aid the police in solving crimes. They urge us to defer to the California legislature's judgment on the overall usefulness of microstamping. The majority agrees. Pointing to \"evidence that the technology is available,\" Maj. Op. at 983;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 983-84, the majority concludes that \"California has gone well beyond [the] threshold requirement\" of showing that its evidence \"fairly support[s] its conclusion,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 982-83 (citation omitted). If the efficacy of microstamping as an aid to police forensics were the only issue before us, I would join the majority in its entirety; this is a policy question well-suited to legislative prediction. And even if microstamping is not a perfect solution, California is entitled to see whether microstamping will aid police in solving crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   But Plaintiffs raise a second argument, one that the majority largely ignores. Plaintiffs argue that the testing protocol adopted by the California Department of Justice (\"CDOJ\") in its regulations is so demanding that no gun manufacturer can meet it. Plaintiffs have come forward with evidence that no new handguns being sold in the United States can satisfy CDOJ's testing protocol and, therefore, no new handguns qualify for California's approved-as-safe roster. The State argues that the technology is available, and that the manufacturers are just unwilling to submit to California's requirements. This is an argument we cannot resolve on this record. So far as we can tell from the meager record before us, no one-including CDOJ-has ever tested any weapon against California's protocol to see whether it is technologically feasible. Plaintiffs claim that the microstamping requirement acts as a prohibition on the commercial sale of new handguns in California. On the record before us, I cannot conclude that the State is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' challenge to the microstamping requirement, and that means that we must take Plaintiffs' Second Amendment claims seriously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Under the appropriate Second Amendment analysis, I cannot conclude that there is a reasonable fit between CDOJ's microstamping requirement and the legislature's\n   object in solving handgun crimes. The result of CDOJ's restrictive testing protocol is undisputed: since at least 2013, no new handguns have been sold commercially in California, and that means that no guns were sold with the microstamping feature. That fact has an important secondary effect-it means that no new handguns are being sold commercially with the MDM and CLI safety features either.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The consequence is obvious. Today, no one in California can purchase handguns that have the safety features the legislature thought critical for saving lives, nor can any Californian purchase guns with the microstamping feature the legislature thought important to assist police. The only guns commercially sold in California are grandfathered from these provisions. This is a totally perverse result. If the legislature (or CDOJ, seeking to implement the legislature's instructions) has adopted safety requirements that no gun manufacturer can satisfy, then the legislature has effectively banned the sale of new handguns in California. The effect of this result on our intermediate-scrutiny analysis is clear: the fit between California's interest in solving handgun crimes and the microstamping requirement would not only fail to be reasonable, it would be non-existent. The requirement would severely restrict what handguns Californians can purchase without advancing the State's interest in solving handgun crimes-or any government interest-one iota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   This result would surely violate the Second Amendment and therefore cries for a more searching inquiry than the majority has provided us. Here is how I will proceed. In Part I, I demonstrate that there is a conflict in the evidence as to whether any manufacturer can comply with California's testing protocol. The majority confronts neither the conflicting evidence nor the possibility that California has effectively banned the commercial sale of all new handguns. It instead concludes-in a cursory fashion-that we must defer to the State because its legislature weighed the evidence of microstamping's technological feasibility. Maj. Op. at 982. But as I discuss in Part II, the majority is in error both as a matter of law and fact. This deference is only appropriate for a legislative body's predictive policy decisions-i.e., how effectively a law will advance the government's stated interest. In contrast, Plaintiffs' challenge to CDOJ's microstamping protocol presents a more fundamental question of technological feasibility, one the legislature did not and, in fact, could not have addressed because it did not have the testing protocol before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   These defects reveal why, at step 2 of our Second Amendment inquiry, we cannot conclude on summary judgment that there is a reasonable fit between the microstamping requirement and the State's goal in solving handgun crimes. But this disposition requires returning to step 1 and deciding whether the microstamping requirement burdens conduct protected under the Second Amendment-a point the majority assumed without deciding. I believe we must address the point rather than assume it.

Plaintiffs' challenge to the microstamping requirement is not over whether the technology\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   works. There can be little doubt that microstamped handguns are capable of imprinting a cartridge casing with alphanumeric characters, and the technology's inventor attests to having publicly tested the technology with police departments across the country. Plaintiffs have quibbled around the edges about the usefulness of microstamping, but even the studies that Plaintiffs cite demonstrate the technology's general application.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , David Howitt et al., WHAT MICRO SERIALIZED FIRING PINS CAN ADD TO IDENTIFICATION IN FORENSIC SCIENCE , at 31-40 (2008); George G. Krivosta,\n   <em>\n    Nanotag\n    <sup>\n     TM\n    </sup>\n    Markings from Another Perspective\n   </em>\n   , 38 AFTE J. 41, 43 (2006). The degree to which microstamping will in practice aid police investigations is not my concern. My sole interest is the conflicting evidence over whether CDOJ's testing protocol can be satisfied by any gun manufacturer. Because the majority has not addressed these requirements, I will discuss the statute and its accompanying regulations and then address the evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In order to qualify for the UHA's approved-as-safe roster, a handgun model must undergo testing by a state-certified laboratory. CAL. PENAL CODE \u00a7 32010(a) - (b) ; 11 CAL. CODE REGS. \u00a7 4059(a). The manufacturer must \"provide[ ] three handguns of the make and model for which certification is sought,\" and the lab must fire 600 rounds from each handgun. CAL. PENAL CODE \u00a7 31905(a) - (b). To ensure that the handgun model is capable of legibly microstamping the cartridge casings, the lab must fire 2 rounds from each handgun before the 600-round test, as well as 2 rounds after the test. 11 CAL. CODE REGS. \u00a7 4060(e)-(g). These 4 casings per handgun are the only casings the lab examines.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 4060(h). Using a \"stereo zoom microscope,\" the lab must verify that (1) \"the pistol has transferred an imprint or etching in at least two places on each cartridge casing\" and that (2) \"the pistol's complete FIN can be identified from the one or more etchings on each cartridge casing ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 4060(h)(1). The \"FIN\" is the firearm identification number, which must \"consist of at least eight, but no more than 12, unique alpha and/or numeric characters that must begin with the manufacturer's\" identifying code.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 4049(j). This test is conducted on all three handguns of the model submitted for certification.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 4060(h)(3). The lab may certify that the model is microstamping compliant only if the examiner can identify the complete FIN from all twelve of the cartridge casings collected for testing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Plaintiffs and their\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   raise two specific objections to these requirements. First, they argue that microstamping technology is incapable of legibly imprinting casings consistently enough to ensure that\n   all twelve casings are imprinted with the\n   <em>\n    complete\n   </em>\n   FIN. Second, Plaintiffs contend that no handgun can satisfy the requirement that each casing be imprinted \"in at least two places ....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 4060(h)(1);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   CAL. PENAL CODE \u00a7 31910(b)(7)(A). They assert that, while a handgun's firing pin can sometimes successfully imprint a casing, the other internal surfaces-e.g., the breech face, extractor, ejector-are incapable of\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   imprinting legible characters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Plaintiffs cite to studies and declarations in support of these troubling assertions. I will address this evidence momentarily, but the critical take-away is this: contrary to the majority's assertion, Maj. Op. at 983-85, there is no indication in the brief legislative history included in the record before us that the state legislature, in enacting the UHA, considered either of these two impediments to certifying handguns as microstamping compliant. With regard to the examination of the twelve casings, the legislature could not have directly considered whether manufacturers could comply with this testing standard because CDOJ promulgated the regulation\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the legislature amended the UHA to include the microstamping requirement. Similarly there is almost no mention in the legislative history of the dual-imprint requirement\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and no evidence that the legislature addressed whether a surface other than the firing pin could legibly imprint cartridge casings. Simply stated, the California legislature did not consider the concerns raised by Plaintiffs, to which I now turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Plaintiffs rely principally on declarations from industry representatives and academic studies. Their most detailed declaration comes from Lawrence Keane, who is the Secretary and General Counsel to the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (\"SAAMI\") and Senior Vice President, Assistant Secretary, and General Counsel to the National Shooting Sport Foundation (\"NSSF\"). According to Keane, NSSF is a trade association for the firearms industry, while SAAMI is an ANSI-accredited standards development organization for the industry's test methods, definitive proof loads, and ammunition performance standards. Keane states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   To date, I am not aware of a single handgun manufacturer worldwide that has produced a functioning, commercially available semiautomatic pistol designed and equipped with \"a microscopic array of characters that identify the make, model, and serial number of the pistol\" etched or otherwise imprinted in two or more places on the interior surface of internal working parts of the pistol, and that are transferred by imprinting on \"each cartridge case when the firearm is fired.\" I am unaware of any handgun manufacturer who has attempted, or is even considering trying, to design and equip a semiautomatic pistol incorporating this technology. NSSF and SAAMI handgun manufacturers have informed me and stated publicly that they cannot comply with California's microstamping requirements and have no plans to attempt to do so. The reason is simple, microstamping does not work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   He further states that various \"[i]ndependent, peer-reviewed studies, including ones\n   by the inventor of microstamping, Todd Lizotte, have confirmed that firearm microstamping is unproven and unreliable to perform in the manner that the UHA requires.\" According to Keane, \"[b]ecause the microstamping requirement cannot be complied with, it is currently preventing scores of manufacturers, distributors and retailers from selling many semi-automatic pistol models in the State of California that are widely available in more or less every other state of the Union, because any such sales would subject them to criminal prosecution.\" More specifically, he states that \"[microstamping] certainly cannot produce the required markings at two locations on the cartridge case, as required by the law.\" He repeats that \"[b]ecause the microstamping requirement cannot be complied with,\" manufacturers are not planning to sell in California. These \"[c]ompanies have actually stopped doing business in California because of that requirement, not because they wished to cease operations there.\" He concludes that the microstamping requirement \"constitute[s] a de facto ban on handguns in California ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Plaintiffs also provided declarations from two CEOs, Michael Fifer of Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co., and James Debney of Smith &amp; Wesson Corp. Their declarations are nearly identical, although Debney provides more detail. Fifer states that \"Ruger believes that California's microstamping regulations make compliance impossible. Quite simply, the state law requires the technology to perform at a level that Ruger cannot practically implement and, to our knowledge, has never been achieved by any manufacturer.\" Debney states that \"Smith &amp; Wesson does not believe it is possible currently to comply with California's microstamping regulations. Quite simply, the state law requires the technology to perform at a level that it cannot .... As it appears infeasible to comply with the CA DOJ microstamping regulations, Smith &amp; Wesson does not have the ability or plans to incorporate microstamping in its semiautomatic handguns ....\" He adds that Smith &amp; Wesson currently produces California-compliant handguns and will continue to do so \"as long as we do not make any changes to them,\" because any changes Smith &amp; Wesson makes would require CDOJ to test the weapons to keep them on the approved-as-safe roster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In addition, Plaintiffs and their declarants cite to several studies regarding microstamping's technological feasability. One of the most insightful pieces of evidence is a 2013 study, in which Lizotte is listed as a co-author.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   T. Grieve et al.,\n   <em>\n    Gear Code Extraction from Microstamped Cartridges\n   </em>\n   , 45 AFTE J. 64 (2013). The study acknowledges that the alphanumeric characters microstamped on a casing can become \"deformed, or partially removed due to the firing and cartridge ejection process ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 64. Indeed, the study focuses on the viability of additionally microstamping casings with a \"circular gear code\" as a failsafe \"that could either fill in any gaps in a distorted alpha-numeric code, or be used to replicate the code if the alpha-numeric identifier\n   <em>\n    is entirely illegible\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 64-65 (emphasis added). The study acknowledges that characters can become distorted when the primer is \"struck twice\"-presumably by the firing pin-and consequently smeared.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 68. It also notes that \"[d]ouble strikes were especially prevalent in\" one of the handgun models tested,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , which indicates that a handgun's ability to satisfy the UHA's testing protocol may rely more on its make and model than on the progression of microstamping technology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Similarly, microstamping's effectiveness appears to have almost as much to do with the type of ammunition used as it does with any other factor addressed so far.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 70 (\"Lacquered cartridges ... posed\n   problems during the optical and SEM evaluations, especially for the Hi-Point cartridges as it interfered with the transfer of the identifiers and the gear code.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   L.S. Chumbley et al.,\n   <em>\n    Clarity of Microstamped Identifiers as a Function of Primer Hardness and Type of Firearm Action\n   </em>\n   , 44 AFTE J. 145, 153 (2012) (\"[F]urther study is necessary before any definitive statements can be made concerning the effect of ammunition type. However, it is clear that the presence of lacquer is of paramount importance in identifier transfer.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the 2013 study also acknowledges that the ability to identify characters imprinted on a casing may depend on the use of a scanning electron microscope. Grieve,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 68. As I discuss immediately below, this equipment is not currently permitted under the UHA's testing protocol and the use of only an optical microscope is unaccounted for in the State's evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The State relies solely on a declaration from microstamping's inventor, Todd Lizotte. Mostly notably, Lizotte describes a \"stress test\" he performed in 2007 with a Smith &amp; Wesson .40 caliber handgun, which he equipped with a microstamped firing pin that he designed to work with that specific handgun model. Lizotte attests that, after firing over 2,500 rounds, \"all eight microstamped digits from the firing pin were legible 97% of the time,\" while \"breech face markings transferred to cartridge casings were legible 96% of the time.\" He further represents that,\"[b]etween firing pin and breech face markings, all eight microstamped digits were identifiable in all cases.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   These results are undeniably impressive, but they do not directly assuage the concerns regarding the UHA's testing requirements because it is not clear that Lizotte's 2007 stress test would satisfy California's testing protocol, which did not even become effective until 2011. There are several problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Although Lizotte reports a perfect rate of legibility when combining characters imprinted on casings by both the firing pin and breech face, there is a subtle but important caveat to this result: he identifies the imprinted characters through the use of both \"optical microscopy and scanning electronmicroscopy techniques....\" The UHA's regulations, however, prescribe the use of only a \"stereo zoom microscope\"-i.e., an optical microscope. 11 CAL. CODE REGS. \u00a7 4060(h)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 4052(b)(1)(A). In other words, Lizotte's declaration never explains how often imprints are legible using only the equipment allowed for in the microstamping protocol. Certainly handgun manufacturers and consumers would have reason for concern if these rates are relatively low. And this may very well be the case, as Lizotte has emphasized the importance of scanning electron microscopy in identifying imprinted characters. In countering the results of a study critical of microstamping's technological feasibility,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lizotte asserted \"that the results [the study] observed would have been different, and the markings would have been 'fully legible,' if a more sophisticated method had been used to read the markings known as, 'Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) ....' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Moreover, it is unclear from Lizotte's declaration whether the modified handgun\n   he used in the stress test imprinted\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   casing with two sets of microstamped characters. He does not state how often the breech face made an imprint, but only how many imprints were legible. Because each of the twelve casings examined during CDOJ's certification procedure must be imprinted \"in at least two places,\" a low rate of breech-face imprints would also be troubling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   In highlighting these informational deficits, it is not my intention to be critical of Lizotte's work. He appears to be a responsible inventor and advocate who has placed his technology in the public domain in order to encourage microstamping's adoption. But the State, in defending its implementation of a novel handgun restriction against a Second Amendment challenge, has relied solely on Lizotte's nine-page declaration, which is not fully responsive to the concerns raised by Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The majority does not even mention any of this evidence. Rather, it offers a back-of-the-hand dismissal by concluding that \"[t]he reality is\" that gun manufacturers are merely unwilling to comply with the microstamping requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 982-83. The majority claims that the failure to produce a complying handgun is not evidence \"that microstamping is technology infeasible.\" Maj. Op. at 982-83. But Ruger's CEO attests that California's \"law requires the technology to perform at a level that Ruger cannot practically implement and, to [his] knowledge, has never been achieved by any manufacturer.\" I do not see how the majority gets to decide at summary judgment what \"the reality is\" when there is conflicting evidence in the record. While the declarations are certainly lacking in detail, they should not be construed so narrowly-especially considering that it is the State that bears the burden under intermediate scrutiny of proving that its law passes constitutional muster. After all, the State does not attempt to explain why gun manufacturers would forgo the opportunity of selling their new generations of handguns in a major market like California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The majority also summarily asserts that this suit has been brought by gun purchasers rather than gun manufacturers, implying that the inability of the latter to comply with the UHA is somehow irrelevant to Plaintiffs' inability to purchase handguns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 982-83. But Plaintiffs have not claimed that gun manufacturers have a right under the Second Amendment to\n   <em>\n    produce\n   </em>\n   the guns of the manufacturer's choice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teixeira v. County of Alameda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265669\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/670/#p683\">\n    873 F.3d 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 681 (9th Cir. 2017) (en banc) (rejecting a gun seller's argument \"that, independent of the rights of his potential customers [to acquire firearms], the Second Amendment grants him a right to\n   <em>\n    sell\n   </em>\n   firearms\"),\n   <em>\n    cert. denied\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612427,12612428,12612429,12612430,12612431,12612432\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1988/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , --- L.Ed.2d ---- (2018). Rather, Plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   claim is based solely on their own inability to purchase handguns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Taken together, Plaintiffs' evidence is impossible to reconcile with Lizotte's declaration, which portrays microstamping as nearly infallible. We cannot assume that microstamping can satisfy the UHA's testing protocol.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any other context, this conflict in the evidence would render this case inappropriate for decision on summary judgment. The district court was well aware of these factual disputes. Instead of resolving them, the court held that the commercial sales exception-which I discuss at length below-meant that the Second Amendment does not even apply to Plaintiffs' claims. The majority declines to affirm the district court on the grounds on which the court based its decision, assumes the Second Amendment applies, and then decides the factual conflict for itself. We should have sent this case back to the district court to resolve these factual issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The majority raises other arguments in defense of its decision to uphold the microstamping requirement in the face of conflicting evidence. These rationales are unavailing and, in large part, inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The majority highlights aspects of the UHA that, in its view, offset Plaintiffs' central contention that the requirement effectively bans the sale of new handguns. It cites, for instance, the fact that \"[t]he microstamping requirement only became effective after the CDOJ certified that the technology 'is available to more than one manufacturer unencumbered by any patent restrictions.' \" Maj. Op. at 984. If the majority is implying that this certification has any bearing on the issue before us, this assertion is wide of the mark. The certification was required by the legislature to ensure that manufacturers had legal access to the technology; the certification was about patent rights, not technological feasibility. CAL. PENAL CODE \u00a7 31910(b)(7)(A). As the State recently conceded before the California Supreme Court, \"this certification confirms the lack of any patent restrictions on the imprinting technology, not the availability of the technology itself.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Shooting Sports Found., Inc. v.

The absence of patent restrictions resulted from Lizotte generously placing his technology in \"the public domain ... free of royalty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The majority similarly relies on the fact that, even if microstamping proves to be technologically infeasible, the UHA authorizes the California Attorney General to \"approve a method of equal or greater reliability and effectiveness in identifying the specific serial number of a firearm from spent cartridge casings ....\" Maj. Op. at 985 (quoting CAL. PENAL CODE \u00a7 31910(b)(7)(B) ). So what is this replacement technology? Who knows? The State has not represented that it knows of a microstamping alternative even at the conceptual stage, and the majority has wisely declined to speculate on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The majority also misleadingly states that \"semiautomatic handguns are not subject to the microstamping requirement and are grandfathered as long as the manufacturer continues to pay a roster fee and the firearms do not fail a retest.\" Maj. Op. at 983. But semiautomatic handguns that were not listed on the UHA roster\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the microstamping requirement took effect are expressly subject to the requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CAL. PENAL CODE \u00a7 31910(b)(7)(A). If the majority is asserting that the availability of grandfathered handguns in California affects the application of intermediate scrutiny, then this too is incorrect. That Plaintiffs can commercially purchase older-model handguns says nothing about whether there is a reasonable fit between the microstamping requirement-which Plaintiffs claim effectively bans\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   handgun sales-and the State's interest in solving handgun crimes. If the requirement is impossible to comply with, then as discussed above, it imposes a burden without advancing any state interest. Similarly, the fact that the UHA does not altogether ban possession of non-microstamped handguns does not squarely address the application of intermediate scrutiny; it only means that California has not banned the sale of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   handguns-new and old-in violation of\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Moreover, contrary to the majority's assertion, the Third Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707189\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/85/#p91\">\n    614 F.3d 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2010), bears little resemblance to this case. Maj. Op. at 985-86. There, the Third Circuit rejected a Second Amendment challenge to a federal criminal statute prohibiting \"possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number ....\"\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   , 614 F.3d at 88. The court reasoned that \"preserving the ability of law enforcement to conduct serial number tracing-effectuated by limiting the availability of untraceable firearms-constitutes a substantial or important interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 98. Here, however, there is no disputing that microstamping's potential ability to aid the police in solving handgun crimes presents a substantial interest.\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   did not address anything remotely analogous to the question of technological feasibility presented in this case and is therefore inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The majority similarly justifies its unfounded confidence in the ability of manufacturers to comply with the microstamping requirement by citing to other areas of law that have little relevance to this case. The challenge before us \"echoes a similar one made for decades about airbags,\" the majority announces. Maj. Op. at 983 n.11. We as readers, however, are left to suss out how regulations concerning automobile\n   safety standards compare to testing requirements that will potentially curtail a fundamental right to possess handguns. The analogy is pretty far afield. The majority also perplexingly attempts to analogize to the Fourth Amendment. Maj. Op. at 985 (citing\n   <em>\n    Maryland v.

Recall that Plaintiffs actually raised two challenges to microstamping.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pp. 988. Although I have focused on Plaintiffs' challenge to the microstamping requirement based on its technological feasibility, they first raised the question of microstamping's efficacy in aiding police investigations. Plaintiffs contend that criminals can easily defeat the technology by either replacing a handgun's firing pin-a fairly common and inexpensive procedure-or obliterating its characters with sandpaper. And even if a microstamped handgun did successfully imprint the cartridge casings from the rounds fired during a crime, Plaintiffs assert that it is only the utterly careless criminal who fails to pick up his casings before fleeing the scene. The brief legislative history of the microstamping requirement demonstrates that these precise arguments were made before the legislature, which evidently found them unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Perhaps Plaintiffs are correct, and microstamping will do little to solve handgun crimes. But it is not our role to second guess the legislature's predictive judgment that microstamping will solve at least some crimes. Indeed, the technology need not\n   result in the police making arrests in every case in order for the microstamping requirement to have a reasonable fit. This is thus precisely the type of dispute over whether X-law will have Y-effect that will prevent Z-harm that is entitled to legislative deference. And as the majority notes, the \"legislature considered and rejected other, more intrusive solutions\" to solving handgun crimes. Maj. Op. at 982.

I agree with the majority on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   When the majority notes that the parties dispute whether microstamping will \"effectively\" address this problem, it fails to distinguish between the issues of efficacy in solving crime and the separate issue of technological feasibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 982-83. The majority summarily cites to the principles of legislative deference laid out above to conclude that we must defer to California with respect to\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the efficacy of microstamping to aid police\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the question of whether manufacturers can produce handguns that satisfy the testing protocol.

Op. at 984. But this assertion fails to take into account that Plaintiffs' challenge to the microstamping provision raises a novel question. The majority does not cite-nor was I able to discover-any case in which the public's ability to exercise a constitutional right was dependent on the technological feasibility of a requirement imposed by the government. Rather than proceed with caution through this unchartered terrain, the majority presses forward by relying solely on the concept of legislative deference. Indeed, the majority declines to even pause and question whether the rationales discussed above for deferring to a legislative body's policy judgments are applicable to the question before us.

The State could simply demonstrate and certify that popular brands of modern handguns, once modified with microstamped interior surfaces, will legibly imprint cartridge casings in two places with their identifying information-and can do so at rate of consistency that will satisfy the State's testing protocol.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The majority objects to this invitation, arguing that it would essentially \"transform [California] into a gun manufacturer.\" Maj. at 984.

As demonstrated above, the California legislature failed to adequately consider the impediments to complying with the microstamping requirement and its testing protocol.

As far as I can tell, Lizotte never testified before the state legislature nor submitted any materials to them other than a press release. The only direct reference to him in the legislative history involves staff members of a legislative committee soliciting his brief response to one of the studies critical of microstamping.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 8.

The majority attempts to fill this void by relying on a form of deference that is inapplicable to the question of whether gun manufacturers can comply with the UHA's testing protocol.

Thus, in order for me to conclude that we should reverse and remand as to the microstamping requirement, I must address the threshold question of whether microstamping implicates the Second Amendment.

If I have read the Third Circuit's precedent correctly, it regards facial challenges to laws prohibiting possession of guns by felons and the mentally disabled and to laws forbidding the possession of guns in sensitive places to be not just \"presumptively lawful,\" but lawful and thus outside of further Second Amendment scrutiny.

Take, for example, a law saying that a condition for the commercial sale of firearms is that sales may\n   take place only between 11 p.m. and midnight, on Tuesdays. Or a law imposing a $1,000,000 point-of-sale tax on the purchase of firearms for self-defense (presumably, to fund firearms training and education). Even though these restrictions can be characterized as \"conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms,\" we would have to find such restrictions inconsistent with the \"scope of the Second Amendment.\" After\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   , it seems clear that challenges to these laws would easily overcome any presumption of lawfulness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   So what constitutes a condition and qualification on commercial sales? I know of no accepted or common understanding of this phrase.

The law at issue in\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   banned all\n   <em>\n    possession\n   </em>\n   of handguns in the District of Columbia, but I think it obvious that D.C. could not have taken the intermediate step of banning all\n   <em>\n    sales\n   </em>\n   of handguns in the District.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   , 614 F.3d at 92 n.8. To return, yet again, to the language of the First Amendment, what may be sold (to anyone) fairly goes to the content of the Second Amendment right to acquire the arms that we may keep and bear for our defense. A law that permits only the commercial sale of water pistols and Nerf guns is not what the Second Amendment guaranteed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Admittedly, I have no particularly good solution to defining what is and what is not a condition and qualification on commercial sales. As with the term \"regulate Commerce\" in the Constitution, U.S. CONST . art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3, the phrase \"conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms\" is impressively capacious and difficult to cabin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v.

But the Court's generous treatment of \"Commerce\" in Article I goes to the regulatory powers entrusted to Congress, one of the core powers Congress was given to knit together the union following the Articles of Confederation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208788\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/1/#p15\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208788\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/1/#p15\">\n    at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208788\" index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/1/#p15\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Commerce Clause emerged as the Framers' response to the central problem giving rise to the Constitution itself: the absence of any federal commerce power under the Articles of Confederation.\"). By contrast, giving \"commercial sale\" a similarly broad construction here would serve to restrict rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights. I am reluctant to give the term such a broad construction. Moreover, I am left with the strong impression that\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   did not exempt from Second Amendment scrutiny\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   condition and qualification on firearm\n   ownership that might be enforced at the point of sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   In my view, the better approach to the conditions and qualifications on commercial sale category is that taken by the D.C. Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Heller II\n   </em>\n   . We should apply the presumption of lawfulness to a longstanding regulation of commercial sales of arms. The plaintiff would be able to \"rebut this presumption by showing the regulation does have more than a de minimis effect upon his [Second Amendment] right.\"\n   <em>\n    Heller II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3769810,5712319\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/670/1244/\">\n    670 F.3d at 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This proposed framework would capture the spirit of\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   . It places little burden on the government to show that its regulations are longstanding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Greeno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877622\" index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/510/#p518\">\n    679 F.3d 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 518 (6th Cir. 2012) (requiring the government to \"demonstrate[ ] that the challenged statute 'regulates activity falling outside the [historic] scope of the Second Amendment' \" with more than \"inconclusive\" or ambiguous evidence (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ezell v.

At the same time, it gives the plaintiff an opportunity to show that the regulations substantially infringe Second Amendment rights. The closer the regulations get to the core of the Second Amendment, the less willing we should be to deem them \"presumptively lawful\" and outside the scope of the Second Amendment. Where the presumption is rebutted, the government would have to defend its regulation under an appropriate level of scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   With this understanding of what the step 1 inquiry entails, I now turn to the question of whether the microstamping requirement burdens conduct protected by the Second Amendment. The State makes two arguments. Its primary contention is that the microstamping requirement is presumptively lawful as a condition and qualification on the commercial sale of arms. Alternatively, the State claims that the requirement, even if not a condition on commercial sales, is still outside the scope of the Second Amendment because it is a \"longstanding, accepted regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    Fyock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011538\" index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/991/#p1000\">\n    779 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   997 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240538\" index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/953/#p960\">\n    746 F.3d at 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . I address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   As is evident from my discussion above, not everything that the State enforces at the point of sale should be deemed a condition and qualification on the commercial sale of arms. I conclude that zoning and commercial licensing requirements are the kind of time, place, and manner restrictions governing the when and where in commercial sales that may be presumptively valid as conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Beyond that, things get complicated, and whether restrictions on commercial sales of firearms fall entirely outside the scope of the Second Amendment will depend on the nature of the restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   The microstamping requirement is not a condition California imposes on time, place, or manner of sale, but on the kinds of handguns Californians may purchase. It is true that the restriction is generally enforced at the point of sale, but that, as I have explained, is not a complete answer to Plaintiffs' complaints. Plaintiffs argue that the microstamping requirement restricts the supply of weapons available in the first place-and that surely is a burden on the right of self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   I am thus unwilling to assume that California's restriction on the types of arms that can be sold commercially is so plainly a condition and qualification that it is \"presumptively lawful\" and thus immune from any Second Amendment inquiry. Whatever the contours of the commercial sales category,\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   cannot mean that the State can ban the sales of arms-whether it does\n   so directly or indirectly by imposing conditions on features that commercially sold firearms must possess. Accordingly, I cannot conclude that the microstamping requirement falls within the commercial sales exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   In the alternative, the State claims that there is \"historical precedent for California's Unsafe Handgun Act.\" I construe this discussion of history as an attempt to recognize a new category of presumptively lawful regulatory measures under\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n    554 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   627 n.26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In such an inquiry, the burden lies with the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ezell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3753557\" index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/684/#p702\">\n    651 F.3d at 702-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, historical exceptions must not be described at an \"inappropriately high level of generality-akin to saying that because the government traditionally could prohibit defamation, it can also prohibit speech criticizing government officials.\"\n   <em>\n    Heller II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3769810,5712319\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/670/1244/\">\n    670 F.3d at 1294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   The State claims that microstamping has a historical provenance because police have long used ballistic testing of fired rounds to determine which gun, and type of gun, the round came from. But this historical evidence is inadequate for the State's purpose. The history of ballistic testing merely shows that the police have examined bullets and casings for distinctive markings inadvertently left by the barrels. This is a history of forensics, not a history of the laws regulating firearms. The State has supplied no evidence that rifling was done for the purpose of identifying the weapon, or that this inadvertent consequence of gun manufacturing was required by law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Alternatively, the State argues that microstamping is similar to the longstanding requirement that weapons have a serial number. Federal law has required serial numbers on firearms since 1934, and the courts have upheld these requirements post-\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   . The Third Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   observed that requiring serial numbers was a longstanding rule that had nothing to do with the gun's utility: \"[T]he presence of a serial number does not impair the use or functioning of a weapon in any way .... With or without a serial number, a pistol is still a pistol.\" 614 F.3d at 94. Thus, the Third Circuit concluded, any burden would be \"\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In other words, the only possible reason anyone would want an unmarked firearm is for illegal purposes, and that would fall outside the bounds of\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   's emphasis on the Second Amendment protecting law-abiding citizens.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 95.\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   does not help the State at this point in the analysis, however, because the Third Circuit declined to adopt the government's claim that the serial number requirement did not impair Second Amendment rights. Instead, the court concluded that the law passed muster under either heightened or strict scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 97-99 (applying heightened scrutiny);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 99-101 (applying strict scrutiny). In other words, the case supporting the State's best historical example does not support the State's claim that its requirement falls outside the scope of the Second Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   From the State's argument, I garner that there is at least a ninety-year history of requiring that newly-manufactured guns be imprinted with a serial number on some portion of the weapon in accordance with a process in place since the Industrial Revolution and that doing so does not affect the gun's utility. In other words, there is a history of imposing a restriction that burdens nothing except for someone's desire to act unlawfully. Even assuming that microstamping is just a variation on the serial number requirement, the State's history is not sufficient to persuade me that there should exist a new class of laws immune from Second Amendment inquiry, particularly when Plaintiffs allege that\n   they cannot satisfy the microstamping requirement. That is far greater than a \"\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   \" burden.\n   <em>\n    Marzzarella\n   </em>\n   , 614 F.3d at 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Accordingly, the district court erred in holding that, at step 1, the microstamping requirement does not burden conduct protected by the Second Amendment. Because I additionally conclude that granting summary judgment in favor of the State on the microstamping requirement is improper at step 2, I respectfully dissent as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   \"I will not add to this long paper by an apology for its length.
