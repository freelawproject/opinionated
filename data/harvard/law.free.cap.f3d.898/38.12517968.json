As a practical matter, that is the position in which the National Labor Relations Board's decision in this case left the employer. Advanced Life Systems, a family owned-and-operated small business, found itself whipsawed between Board precedent that, on the one hand, forbids employers to\n   <em>\n    make\n   </em>\n   pay increases and holiday gifts without first negotiating with the union, and, on the other, generally forbids employers to\n   <em>\n    stop making\n   </em>\n   increases and holiday gifts after a union's election. We hold that two statements by the company's owner constitute unfair labor practices, but the Board's ruling that the employer's suspension of\n   personal gifts and discretionary pay raises was unlawful is not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The National Labor Relations Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20151\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.,\n   </em>\n   protects the right of employees to \"bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20151\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 157.

William Woodcock is Advanced Life's majority owner and operator. Woodcock's immediate family members co-own the business, but only Woodcock controlled the company and its operations. Advanced Life began operations in 1996 and has grown over the intervening years to operate six ambulance stations and employ around fifty-five personnel, comprising a mix of Emergency Medical Technicians (\"EMTs\"), paramedics, dispatchers, and administrative and management staff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Given its size, Advanced Life never adopted a formalized wage schedule or written policy.\n   <em>\n    Advanced Life Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20NLRB%20No.%20117\">\n    364 NLRB No. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 13. New hires were reportedly told that they could expect periodic pay raises on, for example, the anniversary of their hire date.

The record reveals no discernible nexus between, on one hand, the timing or amount of any pay raises and, on the other hand, any consistent or predictable metric like seniority or advanced training.

Advanced Life continued this holiday practice until 2011, with one exception.

Since the Woodcocks paid for the gifts entirely from their personal funds, they never claimed a tax deduction nor sought other favorable treatment for those expenditures. The employees, for their part, never claimed the gifts as wages nor reported them on their income taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In July 2012, the now-defunct National Emergency Medical Services Association (\"Union\") began an organizing campaign among Advanced Life's paramedics, EMTs, and dispatchers. During the organization campaign, one of the unit employees, Matthew Schauer, talked with Woodcock about the \"pros and cons\" of unionization. ALJ Hr'g Tr. 74:20. In testimony that the Board credited, Schauer reported Woodcock as saying that Advanced Life \"would not be able to give us raises if we brought a union in.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Shortly after that, the Union won the representation election, and the Board certified it as the unit's exclusive collective-bargaining representative.

Woodcock explained that his attorney had advised him to temporarily freeze all changes in the employees' terms and conditions of employment, including pay raises, \"because of the whole Union deal.\" ALJ Hr'g Tr. 65:15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The next month, another unit employee, Cole Gravel, asked Woodcock why Advanced Life had not made any pay raises in the five months since the employees had unionized. Woodcock replied that, because pay raises had been discretionary prior to the election, Advanced Life was now legally obligated to negotiate any change in pay with the Union.\n   <em>\n    Advanced Life Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20NLRB%20No.%20117\">\n    364 NLRB No. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The International Association of EMTs and Paramedics, a labor organization affiliated with the Union, filed two unfair labor practice charges against Advanced Life in January 2013.

And Advanced Life admits that Woodcock and Schauer had a conversation about the effect of unionization on the company's relations with its employees. Advanced Life just factually disputes the precise content of Woodcock's statement. According to Advanced Life, Woodcock only said that without the Union, employment issues could be expeditiously resolved between management and employees, but unionization would require negotiating with the Union \"a lot of the things that [Advanced Life] normally did day to day[.]\" ALJ Hr'g Tr. 74:23, 74:25-75:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   So this issue boils down to a credibility determination between Schauer's and Woodcock's versions of his statement. The problem for Advanced Life is that we will not reverse the Board's credibility determination unless it was \"hopelessly incredible, self-contradictory, or patently unsupportable.\"\n   <em>\n    Shamrock Foods Co. v.

To be sure, the Board had reason to be suspicious of Schauer's testimony, given that Schauer disclaimed remembering \"all the specifics\" of his conversation with Woodcock yet \"specifically remember[ed]\" the precise wording of Woodcock's comment.

That is incorrect. Advanced Life (i) listed the Board's Section 8(a)(3) rulings in its statement of the issues before this court, and (ii) directly attacked the factual and legal underpinnings necessary to sustain the Section 8(a)(3) violation based on the withheld pay raises. What the Board's argument overlooks is that the same facts and arguments about the character of Advanced Life's past pay increases and Christmas gifts are dispositive of both the Section 8(a)(3) and (a)(5) inquiries. That is because they are mirror inquiries: If the timing or amount of Advanced Life's past pay raises and gifts were anything less than automatic, Section 8(a)(5) precluded Advanced Life\n   from making any further payments pending negotiations with the Union. If they were automatic, then Section 8(a)(3) required Advanced Life to make those payments and its failure to do so evidenced anti-union animus. Because the Board found no Section 8(a)(5) violation involving the withheld pay raises, the only purpose of Advanced Life's arguments about the irregularity of its pay increases was to attack the Board's finding of Section 8(a)(3) violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In sum, Advanced Life adequately addressed the operative facts and legal theories governing the findings of Section 8(a)(3) violations.

When raises occurred, they could come at intervals as short as two weeks or as long as 22.5 months. Even discarding the most extreme data points, the record showed that three employees received raises two weeks apart, six received raises one month apart, four were at 1.5 months, six at two months, five at 2.5 months, fourteen at three months, ten at 3.5 months, eight at four months, eighteen at 4.5 months, ten at five months, and twenty-nine at 5.5 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The amount of each increase was just as uneven and unpredictable, ranging from 25 cents, to 50 cents, to $1.00, to $2.50 per hour. And nothing in the record tied those disparities to identifiable or predictable metrics, like evaluations, time in service, or advanced training.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Advanced Life Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20NLRB%20No.%20117\">\n    364 NLRB No. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 14 n.13 (noting\n   that a multiplicity of unpredictable factors could influence Woodcock's discretion to award raises, including \"the availability of employees, the economy, company expenses, call volumes, and reimbursement rates\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The General Counsel's own evidence, which was drawn from three employees, proves the point. Cole Gravel received incremental hourly increases of $1.00, $0.50, $0.50, $0.50, $1.50, $0.50, $0.50, and $0.25. Lenny Ugaitafa's raises came in amounts of $0.50, $0.50, and $1.00 per hour.

Nothing in the record reveals any rhyme or reason for the differing amounts other than Woodcock's exercise of his sole discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In short, on this record, the only discernible constant is the inconstancy of both the timing and amount of pay increases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Apparently lumping the numbers together, the administrative law judge divined that, on average, 25 to 50 cent raises occurred \"once every 6 months or sooner[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Advanced Life Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20NLRB%20No.%20117\">\n    364 NLRB No. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 15.

The question under\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   is not whether numbers could be averaged in hindsight, but whether a \"long-standing\" practice of predetermined payments to individual employees was so ingrained in the workplace as to lead to \"automatic wage increases\" for individual employees.\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171869\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/736/#p743\">\n    369 U.S. at 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171869\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/369/736/#p743\">\n    82 S.Ct. 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daily News of Los Angeles v.

While the timing and context allowed the Board to find that the two statements violated Section 8(a)(1) based on how a reasonable\n   employee would interpret them, without more they cannot be bootstrapped into evidence of actual discriminatory intent on Woodcock's part given the confusing questions of legality surrounding Advanced Life's ability (or not) to continue such payments.

The Board found that Advanced Life had such an established practice of granting Christmas \"payments\" that they constituted a term and condition of employment, and so unilaterally discontinuing them after the Union was elected violated Section 8(a)(5).\n   <em>\n    Advanced Life Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20NLRB%20No.%20117\">\n    364 NLRB No. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 2-3.

While employees' subjective expectations can be one relevant consideration, they cannot by themselves establish the type of long-term pattern of regularized payments needed to except awards from the employer's central duty to bargain with a union over terms of employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As with the pay increases, the record in this case lacks substantial evidence of a long pattern of regularized Christmas payments by Advanced Life that was tied to the employees' remuneration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the testimony concerning Christmas gifts was far too sparse, inconsistent, and conflicting to establish any reliable pattern of payments, let alone one tied to the employees' remuneration. The General Counsel relied on evidence from just three employees, only two of whom received cash gifts rather than just a raffle ticket. Not only did the testimony of those two employees prove inconsistent with each other, but also one of the two witnesses who received a cash gift had his testimony on the Christmas gifts impeached by his own earlier sworn affidavit.\n   <em>\n    Advanced Life Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20NLRB%20No.%20117\">\n    364 NLRB No. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 14 n.22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The remnants of unimpeached testimony concerning cash payments boiled down to one employee, Schauer, receiving a gift of $100 in 2011, and another employee, Gravel, receiving $100 in 2008 and $300 in 2011. That does not a mechanical and predictable pattern of payments make. It makes no pattern at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Schauer went on to testify that he was told by Advanced Life management that \"EMTs [get] $50 for every year that we're there up to $500 and paramedics get $100 for every year that we're there up to $500\n   as well.\" ALJ Hr'g Tr. 32:7-9. That testimony contradicts Gravel's testimony-the only testimony concerning Christmas payments with an unimpeached sample size of more than one year. Under Schauer's proffered pattern, Gravel should have received $400 dollars in 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Gravel received only $300. The Board made no effort to reconcile that conflicting evidence and the unpredictability of gift amounts that it revealed. Nor did the Board point to any discernible linkage between gift amounts and remuneration as the law requires.\n   <em>\n    Exxel/Atmos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716305,1358946\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/972/\">\n    147 F.3d at 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Read as a whole, the record gets still worse for the Board. Rather than disclose a consistent, long-term pattern of foreordained bonuses, the record reveals that Gravel, alone, received a $100 payment in 2008. In 2009, Gravel received a Christmas check but could not recall the amount. In 2010, the employees received only a smattering of token raffle gifts because the Woodcocks chose instead to donate $10,000 to an employee whose home was destroyed in a mudslide. And in 2011, the only year where all three testifying employees received something of value, one of them received a $50 gift card to a coffee shop. That is the antithesis of a regularized and longstanding pattern of established holiday bonuses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Board contends that the Woodcocks had an enforceable practice of collectively disbursing cash and other items totaling between $10,000 and $15,000 each holiday season. But the Board had to find that Advanced Life had a longstanding pattern of making bonus payments calculable by reference to each recipient employee's remuneration.\n   <em>\n    Exxel/Atmos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716305,1358946\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/972/\">\n    147 F.3d at 976-977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Board made no relevant finding that stripped the payments of their purely personal origin and motivation. In any event, the Board's reliance on a broad swath of dollar amounts-a range with an internal deviation of 50%-confesses its own inability to calculate with any confidence whether and how much any individual employee might expect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , there were no payments made by\n   <em>\n    Advanced Life\n   </em>\n   . The Board glossed over the critical and undisputed fact that the Woodcocks paid for the Christmas gifts entirely out of their own pockets, not out of company funds. Neither the Woodcocks nor Advanced Life claimed those expenditures as tax deductions or any type of business expense. Nor did the Woodcocks and Advanced Life even maintain a record of the payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Board simply imputed the payments to Advanced Life on the ground that Woodcock was the company's majority owner and the payments aimed to boost employee morale. Yet neither of those considerations turns personal gifts into business expenditures, let alone a formal component of employees' salaries or benefits. In ordering the retroactive payment of Christmas gifts, the Board also failed to grapple with the problem that (1) the Woodcocks are not parties to either the administrative or judicial proceedings, and (2) no basis was found for piercing the corporate veil or imposing alter ego status, which is what would be needed to transmogrify the Woodcocks' personal gifts into salary payments by Advanced Life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , the Board ignored that the employees themselves had never treated the gifts as salary or official bonuses. On this record, not one of them reported any of the Christmas payments as income on their federal or state taxes. The Board contends a company's tax treatment of monetary disbursals to employees is not\n   dispositive of whether those payments are wages.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    North Am. Pipe Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=347%20N.L.R.B.%20836\">\n    347 NLRB 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 840 (2006). That is true, but beside the point. The Board rested its finding of a violation of Section 8(a)(5) in no small part on how the employees subjectively understood the payments at issue. But the Board cannot rely selectively on those subjective views that support its position, while ignoring evidence about uniform employee understandings that point in the opposite direction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carpenters and Millwrights, Local Union 2471 v.

Yet neither of those statements makes any mention of the Christmas party or the Christmas gifts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   To sum up, the record overwhelmingly documents the personal, discretionary, and irregular nature of the Woodcocks' Christmas gifts, and the absence of any discernible link between their amount and the individual employee's remuneration (or any other relevant employment factor). No substantial evidence supports treating them as company wages or bonuses. All the Board demonstrated here was that no good deed goes unpunished.
