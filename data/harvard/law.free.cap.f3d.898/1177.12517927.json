Applicants who invoke \u00a7 145 are required by statute to pay \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\" incurred by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") in defending the Board's decision, regardless of the outcome. Historically, the agency relied on this provision to recover sums it spent on travel and printing and, more recently, expert witnesses. Now, 170 years after Congress introduced \u00a7 145's predecessor, the agency argues that \u00a7 145 also compels applicants to pay its attorneys' fees. We hold that it does not, for the American Rule prohibits courts from shifting attorneys' fees from one party to another absent a \"specific and explicit\" directive from Congress. The phrase \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\" falls short of this stringent standard. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Patent Act gives applicants two mutually exclusive options for judicial review of an adverse Board decision.

To satisfy the Supreme Court's strict standard, the PTO must show that \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\" specifically and explicitly includes attorneys' fees. But this phrase is at best ambiguous as to attorneys' fees. As explained below, the cases and definitions relied on by the PTO demonstrate that, at most, this language is merely capable of implicitly covering attorneys' fees. The American Rule and the \"specific and explicit\" requirement demand more than language that merely\n   <em>\n    can be\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    is sometimes used\n   </em>\n   broadly to implicitly cover attorneys' fees. Moreover, other statutory provisions enacted by Congress demonstrate that ordinarily, a statutory right to \"expenses\" does not include an implicit authorization to award attorneys' fees. This is further demonstrated by both contemporaneous and current court cases and other statutory provisions in the Patent Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We begin our analysis with contemporaneous definitions and usages of \"expenses.\" In 1839, when Congress introduced the \"whole of the expenses\" language in \u00a7 145's predecessor, Act of Mar. 3, 1839, \u00a7 10, 5 Stat. at 354, the ordinary meaning of \"expenses\" did not implicitly encompass attorneys' fees. The PTO only cites one dictionary from this time period, which defined \"expense\" as \"[a] laying out or expending; the disbursing of money, or the employment and consumption, as of time or labor.\" Appellant Br. 17 (quoting Noah Webster,\n   <em>\n    American Dictionary of the English Language\n   </em>\n   (1st ed. 1828) ). Other 1830s dictionaries defined \"expense\" as \"cost; charges; money expended,\" J.E. Worcester,\n   <em>\n    A Comprehensive Pronouncing and Explanatory Dictionary of the English Language, with Pronouncing Vocabularies of Classical and Scripture Proper Names\n   </em>\n   117 (1830), and as \"the disbursing of money,\" \"[m]oney expended,\" \"cost,\" and \"[t]hat which is used, employed, laid out, or consumed,\" Noah Webster et al.,\n   <em>\n    An American Dictionary of the English Language\n   </em>\n   319 (Joseph Worcester ed., 1830). These vague definitions, however, do not establish that a statutory right to \"expenses\" includes \"an implicit authorization to award attorney's fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Summit Valley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190562\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/717/#p721\">\n    456 U.S. at 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190562\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/717/#p721\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   More compelling than the dictionary definitions, though, is Congress's usage of the terms \"expenses\" and \"attorneys' fees\" in other statutes.

Section 9 requires that money paid by patent applicants into the Treasury be used \"for the payment of the salaries of the officers and clerks herein provided for, and all other expenses of the Patent Office.\" Act of July 4, 1836, ch. 357, \u00a7 9,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20Stat.%20117\">\n    5 Stat. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 121. In the dissent's view, this establishes that Congress \"understood salaries to be within the scope of 'expenses.' \" Dissent Op. 1198. But as the dissent recognizes, context is important when interpreting a statute. Dissent Op. 1199. Here, \u00a7 9 is an accounting provision that earmarks money the PTO receives to cover various \"expenses of the Patent Office\"; it does not address how \"expenses of the proceedings\" are to be allocated in the context of adversarial litigation involving the PTO. Moreover, it is doubtful (or at least uncertain) whether any of the salaries of the particular \"officers and clerks\n   <em>\n    herein provided for\n   </em>\n   \" under \u00a7 9 included the salaries of PTO attorneys and paralegals who engaged in litigation on the agency's behalf. \u00a7 9, 5 Stat. at 121 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1-2, 5 Stat. at 117-18 (creating roles for Commissioner of Patents, Chief Clerk of Patent Office, an examining clerk, and two \"other\" clerks). Accordingly, \u00a7 9 at most supports the idea that \"expenses\"\n   <em>\n    can be\n   </em>\n   broad enough to cover salaries of some PTO employees in an unrelated context. But, even then, Congress felt it necessary to expressly enumerate \"salaries of the officers and clerks\" in addition to \"all other expenses,\" demonstrating again that the ordinary meaning of expenses does not include attorney salaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Both the dissent and the PTO contend that it would not make sense for Congress to use the phrase \"attorneys' fees\" in the context of \u00a7 145 actions because it is more accurate to classify the salaries of the PTO's attorneys as personnel \"expenses.\" Appellant Br. 42; Dissent Op. 1199-1200. In light of other statutes providing for the government's recoupment of\n   <em>\n    attorneys' fees\n   </em>\n   , as opposed to personnel expenses, in enforcement actions, we do not find this argument convincing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207413\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5) (\"Any person who fails to pay on a timely basis a civil penalty ordered or assessed under this section shall be required to pay ... the United States enforcement expenses, including but not limited to attorneys fees and costs incurred by the United States for collection proceedings ....\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201319\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(9) (similar). Indeed, aside from the trademark analogue at issue in\n   <em>\n    Shammas\n   </em>\n   , the PTO did not identify a single statute that awards to the government prorated portions of its attorneys' salaries without using the phrase \"attorneys' fees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, the PTO and the dissent paint \u00a7 145 actions as a scourge on other patent applicants. Appellant Br. 21-25; Dissent Op. 1201-02, 1204-05. They claim it is unfair to burden all applicants with the additional costs caused by those who voluntarily initiate \u00a7 145 proceedings. But this policy debate on the value of \u00a7 145 actions is best left for Congress. And, as various amici indicate, Congress already addressed the debate by rebuffing an attempt to repeal \u00a7 145. Br. of Amici Curiae Intellectual Prop. Owners Ass'n 21 n.3; Br. of Amici Curiae Ass'n of Amicus Counsel 14. In any event, the dissent's concerns appear to us exaggerated. A back-of-the-envelope calculation elucidates the minuscule impact of these proceedings on the\n   overall cost of a patent application. Although neither party could provide an exact tally of the \u00a7 145 proceedings, at the panel stage the PTO estimated that there were four to five of these proceedings in the last three years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. at 19:19-20:10, http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx?fl=20 16-1794.mp3. If we were to take a conservative estimate of ten \u00a7 145 actions per year (five times the rate estimated by the PTO) and assume that the PTO expended $100,000 in attorneys' fees defending each action ($20,000 more than the amount the PTO incurred in this case), the total expense for fiscal year 2018 would be $1 million. The PTO estimates that it will receive more than 627,000 patent applications during this same time period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,\n   <em>\n    Fiscal Year 2018 Congressional Justification\n   </em>\n   11 (2017), https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fy18pbr.pdf. When spread amongst the 627,000+ applications, the $1 million price tag amounts to less than $1.60 per application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The general rule in the United States is that each party pays for its own attorneys. To deviate from the status quo embodied in the American Rule, Congress must draft legislation-\"specific and explicit\" legislation-demonstrating its intent to make the award of attorneys' fees available under that statute. Awarding \"[a]ll the expenses\" simply cannot supply the \"specific and explicit\" directive from Congress to shift attorneys' fees, and nothing else in the statute evinces congressional intent to make them available. Other than\n   <em>\n    Shammas\n   </em>\n   's interpretation of the trademark analogue, we are not aware of any statute requiring a private litigant to pay the government's attorneys' fees without regard to the party's success in the litigation.

That provision, which was retained when Congress added the expense-reimbursement language in 1839, read in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   [T]he applicant shall pay into the Treasury of the United States, or into the Patent Office, or into any of the deposite banks to the credit of the Treasury ... the sum of thirty dollars ....

Congress understood \"salaries of the officers and clerks\" as one kind of \"expense.\" To be sure, there is a difference between \"expenses of the Patent Office\" and \"expenses of the proceedings,\" but the point is that Congress, at the time it enacted the precursor to \u00a7 145, understood salaries to be within the scope of \"expenses.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   When a term goes undefined in a statute, we give the term its ordinary meaning.\n   <em>\n    Taniguchi v.

The ordinary meaning of \"expenses\" encompasses expenditures for personnel. Dictionaries in use when Congress enacted \u00a7 145's precursor generally defined \"expenses\" as an expenditure of money, time, labor, or resources. For example, in 1830 \"expense\" was defined as \"1. [a] laying out or expending; the disbursing of money, or\n   <em>\n    the employment and consumption, as of time or labor\n   </em>\n   .\" Noah Webster,\n   <em>\n    An American Dictionary of the English Language\n   </em>\n   319 (3d ed. 1830) (emphasis added). The majority points to other 1830s dictionary definitions, which defined \"expense\" as \"cost; charges; money expended,\" J.E. Worcester,\n   <em>\n    A Comprehensive Pronouncing and Explanatory Dictionary of the English Language, with Pronouncing Vocabularies of Classical and Scripture Proper Names\n   </em>\n   117 (1830), and as \"the disbursing of money,\" \"2. Money expended,\" \"cost,\" and \"3. That which is used, employed, laid out or consumed,\" Noah Webster,\n   <em>\n    An American Dictionary of the English Language\n   </em>\n   319 (3d ed. 1830). Based on these definitions, I agree with the government that the ordinary or common meaning of \"expenses\" includes personnel expenditures. It also includes out-of-pocket attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Although the PTO did not retain outside counsel in this case, the statute's history suggests that Congress intended \"expenses\" to also include attorneys' fees for the PTO's retained outside counsel. At the time the expense-reimbursement provision appeared, proceedings in equity seem to have been quite rare. And when they occurred, it seems that the PTO incurred the expense of employing outside counsel. This conclusion is drawn from the Report of the Commissioner of Patents for the Year 1845, in which the Commissioner explained that \"[t]wo suits in equity are now pending against the Commissioner in the circuit court for the district of Pennsylvania, in which, as it has not been necessary for me to attend, I have employed counsel.\" REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF PATENTS FOR THE YEAR 1845, H.

In other words, the Supreme Court has told us that the plain and ordinary meaning of the word \"expenses\" in the litigation context includes those incurred for attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Although NantKwest and the majority do not deny that \"expenses\" is broad enough to cover the PTO's personnel expenses, they contend that the term \"is merely capable of implicitly covering attorneys' fees\" and \"is at best ambiguous as to attorneys' fees.\" Majority Op. 1187. As support, NantKwest and the majority rely on other federal statutes under various titles where Congress has employed the term \"expenses\" to authorize attorneys' fees either in addition to expenses (e.g., \"expenses\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   attorneys' fees\"), or as a component of them (e.g., \"expenses\n   <em>\n    including\n   </em>\n   attorneys' fees\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority contends that \"[t]hese statutes demonstrate Congress's understanding that the ordinary meaning of 'expenses' does not include attorneys' fees.\" Majority Op. 1188.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Certainly, \"a definition [being] broad enough to encompass one sense of a word does not establish that the word is\n   <em>\n    ordinarily\n   </em>\n   understood in that sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Taniguchi\n   </em>\n   , 566 U.S. at 568,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189785\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/560/#p573\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But even if I were to agree with NantKwest and the majority's characterization of what \"expenses\"\n   <em>\n    ordinarily\n   </em>\n   means, here the statutory context in which \"expenses\" appears indicates that it includes personnel expenditures for attorneys.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189785\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/560/#p573\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189785\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/560/#p573\">\n    at 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189785\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/560/#p573\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that the context in which a word appears may over-override the word's ordinary meaning). As noted, the word \"expenses\" showed up one other time in the Patent Act of 1836-where the Act expressly characterized the salaries of PTO officers and clerks as \"expenses.\" Patent Act of 1836, ch. 357, \u00a7 9,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20Stat.%20117\">\n    5 Stat. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The majority addresses the statutory context by pointing to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20285\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which provides that \"[t]he court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.\" The majority suggests that because this provision of the Patent Act specifically mentions attorneys' fees, Congress must have intended to exclude them from \"expenses\" in \u00a7 145. Majority Op. 1190-91. I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   First, Congress intended a broader compensation scheme under \u00a7 145 than under \u00a7 285.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 145 (\"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 285 (\"reasonable attorneys' fees\"). For example, NantKwest does not contest that the language of \u00a7 145 includes the PTO's expert witness expenses. In \u00a7 285, Congress chose not to award all the expenses to the prevailing party, but only attorneys' fees. Congress can certainly employ a broad word over\n   other narrower alternatives if it so chooses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Second, as salaried employees, the PTO's attorneys do not bill individual hours for their work, nor do they collect fees from those whom they represent. In this context, the overhead associated with the PTO's attorneys' work is more aptly characterized as an \"expense\" to the PTO than a \"fee.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare Expense\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"expense\" as \"expenditure[s] of money, time, labor, or resources to accomplish a result\"),\n   <em>\n    with Attorney's fee\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"attorney's fee\" as \"[t]he charge to a client for services performed for the client, such as an hourly fee, a flat fee, or a contingent fee\"). I would not require Congress to mimic \u00a7 285 and use the phrase \"attorneys' fees\" when, in this context, \"expenses\" is the more apt term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Third, the \u00a7 145 and \u00a7 285 provisions are implicated in different settings. Section 285 arises in traditional patent litigation, and authorizes a district court to award attorneys' fees to the prevailing party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Octane Fitness, LLC v.

The \"[a]ll the expenses\" contemplated by \u00a7 145 are a direct counterpart to the application fees that are designed to reimburse the PTO's examination expenses-application fees that, like the \"[a]ll the expenses\" of \u00a7 145, the applicant must pay regardless of whether it receives a patent. Congress's use of different phrases therefore makes sense in these different settings. And Congress's choice to depart from the model of a related statute is a choice we may not disregard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    SAS Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611230,12611231\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1348/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   But I need not rely on the word \"expenses\" alone. Congress did not simply provide for \"expenses of the proceedings\" in \u00a7 145-it clarified that it was requiring the applicant to pay \"\n   <em>\n    [a]ll\n   </em>\n   the expenses of the proceedings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The majority maintains that \"the word 'all' sheds no light on the breadth of 'expenses,' \" and reasons that \"all\" \"serves only to clarify that, whatever the 'expenses' are, all of them must be paid by the applicant.\" Majority Op. 1194. I disagree. Such an interpretation leaves little work for \"all\" to do; simply saying \"the expenses\" would seem to do just as well. While this latter, more limited phrasing would still not explicate the breadth of \"expenses,\" neither would it, by itself, provide a basis for excluding anything properly regarded as an \"expense.\" In my view, Congress used the word \"all\" to broadly and comprehensively capture anything fairly regarded as an \"expense,\" resolving any lingering doubt in favor of inclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The majority acknowledges that the term \"expenses\" is capable of including attorneys' fees and cites to several statutes that list attorneys' fees as part of expenses. Majority Op. 1188-89 (citing ten such statutes). In \u00a7 145, Congress's use of the word \"all\" indicated its desire to broadly and comprehensively include\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the expenses as it commonly understood them, which includes the personnel expenses the PTO incurs in defending \u00a7 145 actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Both the legislative history and the purpose of \u00a7 145 support my reading of the statutory text and context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The majority questions the relevance of legislative history in interpreting fee statutes. Majority Op. 1194-95. I note, however, that the Supreme Court has examined legislative history in cases implicating fee-shifting and the American Rule.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ruckelshaus v.

As the parties have noted, the \"expenses\" provision arose (in slightly different form) in the 1839 Amendments to the Patent Act, which provided that an applicant bringing a proceeding in equity to contest an adverse decision of the Patent Office would be required to pay \"the whole of the expenses of the proceeding ... whether the final decision shall be in his favor or otherwise.\" Patent Act of 1839, ch. 88, \u00a7 10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20Stat.%20353\">\n    5 Stat. 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 354.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   When Congress revised the Patent Act in 1870, it used expense-reimbursement language very similar to the language used in the previously enacted 1839 statute. Initial versions of the House bill sought to limit the reimbursement provision by using the word \"costs\" instead of \"expenses\" and by limiting any reimbursement to $25. But these changes were rejected and the word \"expenses\" was retained. The version of the bill reported in the House and referred to the Senate read, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   SEC. 52. And be it further enacted, That when the Commissioner of Patents is the only defendant in any such suit,\n   <em>\n    all costs shall be paid by the complainant\n   </em>\n   , and whole amount of costs taxed against the complainant shall not exceed the sum of twenty-five dollars ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   H.R. 1714, 41st Cong. \u00a7 52 (as referred to the S. Committee on Patents, Apr. 25, 1870) (emphasis added). The Senate made significant amendments to the bill, including changing Section 52 to use \"expenses\" rather than \"costs\" and by removing the $25 cap. The version passed by the Senate read, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   SEC. 52. And be it further enacted, That whenever a patent on application is refused, for any reason whatever, either by the Commissioner or by the supreme court of the District of Columbia upon appeal from the Commissioner, the applicant may have remedy by bill in equity; .... And in all cases where there is no opposing party a copy of the bill shall be served on the Commissioner, and\n   <em>\n    all the expenses of the proceeding shall be paid by the applicant, whether the final decision is in his favor or not\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   H.R. 1714, 41st Cong. \u00a7 52 (as amended by the Senate, May 31, 1870) (emphasis added). The House disagreed with the Senate amendments and asked for a conference. Ultimately, the House members dropped their objections to the Senate amendments to \u00a7 52, and the enacted version reflected the Senate's version using the word \"expenses.\" This demonstrates-or\n   at least strongly suggests-that Congress specifically intended that \"expenses\" be broader than \"costs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The statute's purpose also confirms that Congress intended all of the expenses associated with \u00a7 145 proceedings to be borne by the applicants who elect them-not by taxpayers or other PTO users whose fees fund the agency's operations. Section 145 proceedings are an optional extension of the application process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gandy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3521818\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/122/432/#p439\">\n    122 U.S. at 439-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3521818\" index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/122/432/#p439\">\n    7 S.Ct. 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (referring to \u00a7 145's precursor as \"in fact and necessarily, a part of the application for the patent\" and \"clearly a branch of the application for the patent\"). And litigation in district court is expensive and time-consuming, much more so than the direct appeals limited to the administrative record also available to disappointed applicants. Proceedings under \u00a7 145 force the PTO and its employees to dedicate time and effort to conducting discovery, interviewing witnesses, filing and responding to motions, and addressing new evidence. PTO's En Banc Br. 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Indeed, even in 1838, Congress was aware that proceedings in equity were adding to the Patent Office's expenses-including labor expenses. H.R. Rep. No. 25-797, at 3 (1838) (discussing the 1839 Act). A letter from the Commissioner of Patents annexed to the House Report stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   The judicial decisions on interfering applications, subsequent to the examination, on application, will, both in number and importance, exceed all the patent cases before the United States courts. On the first of January three cases were pending a hearing, valued at upwards of $100,000 each. The evidence is voluminous, and the arguments often lengthy.\n   <em>\n    The subject of appeals is beginning\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    to add considerably to the labor of the office\n   </em>\n   , and the litigated cases demand many long copies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   An applicant's choice to proceed under \u00a7 145 diverts the agency's resources from the PTO's principal mission of examining patent and trademark applications at the agency. The purpose of \u00a7 145's expense-reimbursement provision is to ensure that these expenses fall on the applicants who elect the more expensive district court proceedings over the standard appeal route.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The majority concludes that the text of \u00a7 145 fails to provide the necessary congressional directive to overcome the American Rule's bar against shifting attorneys' fees. Under the American Rule, \"the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect a reasonable attorneys' fee from the loser.\"\n   <em>\n    Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v.

For example, the majority attempts to create ambiguity by focusing on the word \"expenses\" in a vacuum. But, as I've discussed, Congress did not simply provide that under \u00a7 145 an applicant pays \"expenses.\" Nor did it say \"may pay\" or something that could be less than \"all.\" Congress said that the applicant \"shall\" pay \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   It is also well established that \"[t]he absence of specific reference to attorney[s'] fees is not dispositive if the statute otherwise evinces an intent to provide for such fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Key Tronic Corp. v.

Although the majority gives lip service to this principle, as a practical matter, it still seems to require a statute's use of the magic words \"attorneys' fees\" to meet the American Rule's heightened demands.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, the majority spends pages contrasting \u00a7 145 unfavorably with other statutes that explicitly mention attorneys' fees. Majority Op. 1187-91. It further cites a Congressional Research Service Report compiling the text of other fee-shifting statutes. The majority notes that each of these statutes recites either the magic words \"attorneys' fees,\" or the (slightly) less magical \"fees,\" \"fees for attorneys,\" \"compensation ... for attorney[s],\" \"fees of counsel,\" and the like. Majority Op. 1993-94 n.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   But again, the absence of \"attorneys' fees\" is not dispositive. In making clear that \"[t]he absence of specific reference to attorney[s'] fees is not dispositive if the statute otherwise evinces an intent to provide for such fees,\" the Supreme Court pointed to an Eighth Circuit decision, stating that \"[t]he Eighth Circuit, for example, found 'a sufficient degree of explicitness' in [the Act's] references to 'necessary costs of response' and 'enforcement activities' to warrant the award of attorney[s'] fees and expenses.\"\n   <em>\n    Key Tronic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1146879\" index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/809/#p815\">\n    511 U.S. at 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1146879\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/809/#p815\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As the PTO observes, at Congress's direction, the PTO now must\n   operate entirely as a user-funded agency. PTO's En Banc Br. 23. All applicants pay a number of fees throughout the patent-examination process to cover the PTO's expenses of operation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. Thus, in asking this court to exclude personnel expenses from \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings,\" NantKwest asks this court to require\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   PTO applicants to pay the PTO's personnel expenses incurred in response to its \u00a7 145 complaint, rather than NantKwest itself. This contravenes Congress's intent. The statutory language is clear: it is the applicant that voluntarily chooses a \u00a7 145 action, and not other PTO users, who must pay \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings.\" Thus, the question of the equitable allocation of burdens is one that Congress has already addressed in the language of the statute. It is not this court's job to allocate those burdens differently based on our own policy preferences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Finally, much is made of the fact that the PTO refrained from seeking reimbursement for its personnel expenses until recently, despite the provision's 170-year existence. Notably, however, while the PTO has historically refrained from seeking reimbursement of these expenses, it has never affirmatively disclaimed that authority. Given how dramatically the patent and litigation landscapes have changed since the provision was first enacted, it is hardly surprising that the PTO would have felt compelled in recent years to change its strategy. The PTO's past decisions to not seek reimbursement for its personnel expenses may be related to the fact that it is so rarely confronted by these cases. The PTO now points, however, to how \u00a7 145 proceedings have become more common and more expensive. PTO's En Banc Br. 30. Accordingly, the PTO has become increasingly reluctant to require other PTO users to subsidize the expenses of these optional proceedings, in light of Congress's mandate that the PTO fund itself exclusively through fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Even within the more rigorous administrative rule-making environment, \"[a]gencies are free to change their existing policies as long as they provide a reasoned explanation for the change.\"\n   <em>\n    Encino Motorcars, LLC v.

Each of these statutes referred to \"attorneys' fees,\" \"fees,\" \"compensation for ... attorney[s],\" \"fees for attorneys,\" \"compensation for representation ... equivalent to that provided for court-appointed representation,\" \"fees of counsel,\" \"legal fees,\" or \"compensation\" for \"foreign counsel.\" Henry Cohen, Cong.

The majority acknowledges that its cited statutes were not enacted contemporaneously with Congress's enactment of \u00a7 145's precursor, so it points to an 1867 statute that distinguishes between an individual attorney's fees and his or her expenses. Majority Op. 1188 n.4. This distinction hardly suggests that \"[a]ll the expenses of the proceedings\" does not include the PTO's personnel expenses. Regardless, my point is that because statutory interpretation depends very much on context, I would not assign the same probative value to unrelated, later-enacted statutes as does the majority.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    The majority proposes that Congress should have amended \u00a7 145 to include the \"attorneys' fees\" language when it amended the Patent Act in 1946 to permit the \"award [of] reasonable\n    <em>\n     attorney's fees\n    </em>\n    to the prevailing party\" in infringement actions (i.e., the precursor to \u00a7 285 ). Majority Op. 1190-91 n.7 (quoting Patent Act of 1946, ch. 726,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"363\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Stat.%20778\">\n     60 Stat. 778\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 778 (emphasis added) ). In other words, the majority would require Congress to review and amend \u00a7 145, its already-clear expense-reimbursement statute, so as to make it extra clear. This just can't be right. Especially not when, as I have detailed, the statutes are implicated in different settings and intentionally provide for compensation schemes of varying breadth. The majority seems to infer that because Congress added other statutory provisions (which arise in different circumstances), that it necessarily intended to\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    provide for the PTO's personnel expenses in those provisions it did not amend. This inference is far too attenuated to have any persuasive force.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    When asked during oral argument to propose other language that Congress could have employed to overcome the American Rule, NantKwest offered \"including, without limitation, the time spent by lawyers working on the particular matter from the Solicitor's office ... and outside counsel\" or \"persons providing lawyer services who are hired internally or externally by the Patent Office\" as the only alternatives.
