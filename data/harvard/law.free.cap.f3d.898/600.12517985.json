HO, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   John Troy King pleaded guilty to killing Djuan Jefferson with a knife. The Texas court found him guilty of murder with a deadly weapon and sentenced him to 45 years in prison. King then sought post-conviction relief in state court, arguing that his trial counsel's performance was constitutionally deficient. After the Texas\n   courts denied King's claims of ineffective assistance, he sought a writ of habeas corpus in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The district court denied the writ, and our Court granted a certificate of appealability on two of King's ineffective assistance of counsel claims: (1) that counsel advised him he was eligible for court-ordered community supervision despite the fact that he was statutorily ineligible and (2) that counsel failed to convey a 15-year plea offer from the State. We affirm because the state court's resolution of these claims was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A Texas grand jury indicted King for murdering Djuan Jefferson by stabbing him with a knife, after previously having been convicted of felony possession of a controlled substance. King agreed to plead guilty in exchange for the State's agreement to waive the indictment's enhancement paragraph, which lowered the mandatory minimum sentence to 5 years from 15 years. The parties did not reach an agreement as to the sentence length, but agreed that King would be sentenced based on a Presentence Investigation (PSI) report. Pursuant to King's written plea agreement, the judge found King guilty of first-degree felony murder with a deadly weapon and sentenced him to 45 years in prison. King did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   King then sought habeas relief in state court, arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. As relevant here, King alleged that his counsel advised him that \"the Judge could grant him Court ordered Community Supervision\"-despite the fact that counsel \"knew that Defendant King was not even eligible for Community Supervision.\" According to King, he \"would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have entered a guilty plea ... had his attorney correctly advised him ... that he was not eligible for Judge ordered community supervision.\" Instead, he \"would have\n   <em>\n    insisted\n   </em>\n   upon going to trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   King also argued that his counsel failed to tell him about a 15-year plea deal the State allegedly offered. King learned of this offer \"[o]nly through a website review/response between Gina Chambers and [King's counsel].\" As Gina Chambers explained in her affidavit, King's lawyer \"replied to my review wherein she stated, 'My client had an opportunity to plead to 15 years in this case ... the last option was a PSI and he opted that route.' \" King also asserted that he \"would have accepted\" the 15-year deal \"had he known about it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The state court ordered King's trial attorney to file an affidavit responding to his allegations, but she failed to do so. The State's attempts to locate her were unsuccessful, but it did inform the court that she was no longer licensed to practice in Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The state court denied the writ, ruling that King failed to demonstrate both (1) \"that trial counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\" and (2) that there was \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different\" as to both of his claims. As to the failure of King's counsel to communicate the alleged 15-year plea offer, the state court found that King's \"[c]onclusory allegations are not enough to overcome the State's denial.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Empey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11952395\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/757/771/#p775\">\n    757 S.W.2d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 775 (Tex.

The court also explained that King's allegation \"that\n   he did not want to plead guilty, but rather wanted to go to trial renders his argument that he would have accepted a plea bargain of fifteen years ... irrelevant.\" Finally, the court ruled that King \"failed to meet his burden of providing evidence that the State would not have withdrawn the offer or that the trial court would not have refused to accept the plea bargain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, without written decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   King then sought federal habeas, re-urging his ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Regarding his probation-based ineffectiveness claim, King urged that if he \"knew his only alternative was jail time[,] he would have never plead[ed] guilty but [would have] went to trial.\" As to his failure-to-communicate claim, King explained that \"had he been properly informed of the 15 year plea offer, he would have accepted the offer rather than going to trial by Judge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court denied the writ, and we now affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"When a state prisoner asks a federal court to set aside a sentence due to ineffective assistance of counsel during plea bargaining, our cases require that the federal court use a doubly deferential standard of review that gives both the state court and the defense attorney the benefit of the doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Burt v.
