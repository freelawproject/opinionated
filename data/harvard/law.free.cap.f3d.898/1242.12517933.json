Matthew Sluss is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada, incarcerated in the United States upon conviction of a felony. He seeks a transfer under a treaty between the United States and Canada to a Canadian prison where his term of imprisonment would apparently be reduced and his monetary allowance increased. He now appeals the dismissal of his complaint under the Administrative Procedure Act alleging that the denial of his transfer application was arbitrary and capricious because based on improper factors. The government contends the Treaty is not self-executing and is not, therefore, part of domestic law, so Sluss must rely exclusively on the implementing statute, which the government maintains vests unbounded, unreviewable discretion of prisoner transfers in the Attorney General.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the following reasons, we hold: First, the government's self-execution argument is non-jurisdictional and therefore does not affect the court's subject matter jurisdiction to consider Sluss's case under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, even assuming the treaty is not self-executing, the government's position that Sluss must rely exclusively on the implementing legislation is flawed. The text and legislative history of the treaty and the legislation show that the latter incorporates the substantive standards of the former, making those\n   standards part of domestic law. Third, the treaty provision on which Sluss relies provides law to apply, although the scope of judicial review is narrow, limited to the terms of that provision and not reaching the correctness of the assessment or the outcome. Fourth, consistent with the narrow scope of judicial review, the denial of Sluss's transfer was not arbitrary and capricious. Accordingly, we affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Treaty on the Execution of Penal Sentences between the United States and Canada permits prisoners \"to serve sentences of imprisonment ... in the country of which they are citizens, thereby facilitating their successful reintegration into society.\" Preamble, 30 U.S.T. 6263 (1978) (the \"Treaty\"). Its purposes are basically two-fold: (1) to promote rehabilitation of individuals incarcerated away from their home countries who face linguistic, familial, cultural, educational, employment, and parole-related barriers by allowing transfers to a prison in their home country and thus permit their successful reintegration into society; and (2) to promote diplomatic and law enforcement relations by relieving strains that arise from imprisonment of large numbers of foreign nationals.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , S.

That is, the Attorney General must consider \"all factors\" relating to the prisoner's \"best interests,\" and in doing so consider how those interests dovetail with the Treaty's rehabilitative purpose.

Here, then, the court's review is appropriately limited to ensuring that the Attorney General addressed the terms of Section 6, while allowing the exercise of broad discretion in determining whether to approve a transfer application.

The Attorney General must consider the prisoner's \"best interests\" in determining whether to approve a transfer application, but contrary to Sluss's view,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appellant Br. 9, Section 6 does not limit consideration\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   to those interests.

Wolf, Chief, Int'l Prisoner Transfer Unit, Crim. Div., U.S. Dep't of Justice (hereinafter \"Wolf\"), to Chris Hill, Instit'l Reintegration Ops., Corr'l Serv., Canada (Mar. 5, 2014). Further explanation was provided in denying Sluss's request for reconsideration. Pointing to one of the Treaty's purposes-\"to relieve the special hardships faced by prisoners who are incarcerated in a foreign country far from their family and friends, [including] cultural differences and difficulty in maintaining contact with family in the home country, and difficulty in speaking a foreign language in prison\"-the Attorney General advised that such hardships are \"inapplicable to an inmate [such as Sluss] who has resided in the United States for a lengthy period of time with the intention to remain in this country, and whose immediate family members are living here.\" Wolf Letter to Matthew Sluss (Aug. 12, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Sluss contends that a transfer to a Canadian prison would be in his \"best interests\": He would receive a reduced term of imprisonment and a greater monetary allowance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 23; Letter from Corinne Vitozzi, Senior Analyst, Intern'l Transfers Unit, Corr. Serv., Canada, to Matthew Sluss (Dec. 21, 2015). His interpretation seeks to limit the Attorney General's discretion without regard to the Treaty's purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part I. Neither the text of Section 6 nor the ratification history of the Treaty supports Sluss's interpretation that his personal interests are dispositive. Viewed in light of the Treaty's rehabilitative purpose, the Attorney General properly considered factors such as Sluss's long-term U.S. domicile, the U.S. residency of his family, his insubstantial contacts with Canada, and the absence of language, cultural, or familial hardships. Sluss's reference to a shorter sentence and greater monetary allowance in Canada may be in his \"best interests\"\n   <em>\n    personally\n   </em>\n   , but the Attorney General concluded those factors are neither determinative nor necessarily significant even if relevant to the rehabilitative purpose of the Treaty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, Sluss seeks to supplement the record before this court with pre-decisional documents on his transfer request, recently obtained pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act in redacted form. Sluss does not suggest that the Attorney General failed to consider his \"entire\" record.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , H.R. REP. No. 95-720, at 7 (letter of Sec'y Vance); S. REP. No. 95-435, at 14 (views of Att'y Gen. Bell). Rather, Sluss argues that the district court needed to review the entire administrative record. But he overlooks the limited scope of judicial review. The pre-decisional documents presented by Sluss confirm, even though heavily redacted, that the Attorney General considered factors relating to Sluss's \"best interests\" in light of the rehabilitative purpose of the Treaty, namely, his offense summary, criminal history, and the nature and extent of his and his family's contacts with Canada and the United States. The Attorney General could properly rely on the Justice Department's records and the record Sluss presented with his application for transfer. Under the circumstances, there is no need to supplement the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Accordingly, we affirm the order dismissing the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The court expresses appreciation for the assistance provided by\n    <em>\n     amicus curiae\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
