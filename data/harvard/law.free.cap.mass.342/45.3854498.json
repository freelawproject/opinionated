L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (the State administrative procedure act), inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1, to review a decision of the contributory retirement appeal board (hereinafter called appeal board) established under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (4), as appearing in St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Paul A. McCarthy, the petitioner\u2019s late husband and a member of the State contributory retirement system, \u201con August 8, 1951, was and for some years had been a Representative in the General Court from the Somerville District.\u201d \u201c [0]n August 8, 1951, while he was speaking on some vital bill ... in the performance of his duties, he collapsed and fell to the floor as a result of a cerebral spasm or accident. \u2019 \u2019 He had been afflicted with hypertension \u2018 \u2018 for some years prior to August 8, 1951.\u201d Thereafter he was in and out of hospitals and received treatment from time to time. He died from chronic depressive heart disease in April, 1955, after having been confined to his bed \u201cfor some time.\u201d The foregoing facts were found by the appeal board and are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">The question at the hearing before the appeal board was whether the incident on August 8, 1951, was the proximate cause of McCarthy\u2019s death. The evidence, discussed below, was conflicting, but the appeal board found that McCarthy \u201cdid not die as the natural and proximate result of a personal injury sustained at a definite time and at a definite place as required by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 9.\u201d It accordingly held that his widow, the petitioner, was not entitled to the death benefits under that section, thus affirming the action of the State board of retirement denying the petitioner\u2019s application. On petition for review under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, the judge ruled that \u201c [u]pan a consideration of the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>record . . . the decision of the appeal board is unwarranted by facts found by the court on the record as submitted\u201d and found that the death was within the terms of \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The decision of the appeal board was set aside and a decree was entered adjudging that the petitioner was entitled to the benefits provided by \u00a7 9. The board appealed. Gr. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The material portions of Gr. L. e. 32, \u00a7 9 (1), are: \u201cIf the board, upon receipt of proper proof, finds that any member [of the contributory retirement system] in service died as the natural and proximate result of a personal injury sustained or a hazard undergone as a result of, and while in the performance of, his duties at some definite place and at some definite time . . . without serious and wilful misconduct on his part, the payments and allowances hereinafter referred to . . . shall be granted to his beneficiary or beneficiaries . . ..\u201d It has been held that a death under facts somewhat similar to those in the case at bar can be found to be within the terms of \u00a7 9. <em>Baruffaldi </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>337 Mass. 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">In a judicial review under \u00a7 14 a decision of an administrative agency can be set aside on any of the grounds set forth in subsection (8), but the only ground here pertinent is (e). Thus, our inquiry is whether the decision of the appeal board was \u201c [unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is defined in \u00a7 1 (6) as \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The evidence supporting the decision of the appeal board was essentially this. One Dr. Skvirsky, who had examined McCarthy after his collapse on August 8,1951, testified that McCarthy \u201chad had hypertension for a number of years\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>that \u201cit might have been inevitable that he was doomed to have a cerebral hemorrhage if his blood pressure was as high as 230 over 130 at any one time\u201d; that his hypertension was organic, not emotional; and that he did not have much stress and strain in connection with his service in the House' of Representatives. Dr. Skvirsky expressed the opinion that, on the basis of McCarthy\u2019s history of sixteen years of hypertension prior to his death, the debate in the House which brought about this cerebral spasm or accident was not an accident which brought about his ultimate death. A letter from a Dr. Sprague, who had examined the McCarthy file, was introduced. It stated, in part, \u201cI do not consider it a reasonable assumption to consider that service in the Legislature is a hazardous undertaking, particularly to an individual engaged in legislative work for seventeen years. ... It is my opinion that the medical progress of this case was entirely consistent with the natural progress of his disease and with the unpredictable nature of attacks of heart failure and death in hypertensive coronary artery disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The petitioner contends that the effect of Dr. Skvirsky\u2019s testimony was destroyed because he admitted that he had told McCarthy to quit his job. The appeal board, however, need not have inferred that McCarthy\u2019s death was caused by the cerebral accident on the House floor, merely because a doctor had advised him to retire.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">There was, to be sure, evidence tending to show that McCarthy\u2019s death was a result of the August, 1951, debate within the terms of \u00a7 9 (1). But it cannot be said that there was no evidence from which a reasonable mind could reach a contrary conclusion. This is not a case where all the evidence supporting the appeal board\u2019s findings lacks essential qualities of trustworthiness, and the petitioner does not so contend. Compare <em>Sinclair </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number><em>Employment Security, </em>331 Mass. 101, 103-104. Nor is this a case where the decision of the appeal board is not in accord with the facts found. Compare <em>Baruffaldi </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>337 Mass. 495, 498-502.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The judge stated that the decision of the appeal board was \u201cunwarranted by facts found by . . . [him] on the record as submitted.\u201d Under Gr. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (8), the court on review is not empowered to make independent findings of fact unless \u201cthe substantial rights of any party may have been prejudiced because the agency decision is . . . (f) Unwarranted by facts found by the court on the record as submitted or as amplified under paragraph (7) of this section, <em>in those instances where the court is constitutionally required to make independent findings of </em>fact\u201d (emphasis supplied). There was no such requirement here. The judge, therefore, had no power to make independent findings. 'See <em>Willand\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 677, 678. Whether McCarthy\u2019s death was within the terms of \u00a7 9 (1) was a question to be decided by the appeal board. If its decision rested on substantial evidence \u2014 and we hold that it did \u2014 the judge had no power to set it aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Since we hold that the appeal board was warranted in finding that the death was not within the terms of \u00a7 9 (1), there is no need to decide whether recovery is barred by the alleged failure to comply with the notice provisions of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The final decree setting aside the decision of the appeal board is reversed and a new decree is to be entered affirming the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-8\">No facts, however, were expressly found by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-9\"> This definition accords with the definition of substantial evidence in our decisions. See <em>Jordan Marsh Co. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>316 Mass. 748, 756-757; <em>Goddu\u2019s Case, </em>323 Mass. 397, 401\u2014402; <em>Ramos\u2019s Case, </em>330 Mass. 686, 688-689; <em>Sinclair </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>331 Mass. 101, 102; <em>Singer Sewing Mach. Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>341 Mass. 513, 517; The Massachusetts Administrative Procedure Act, Curran and Sacks, 37 B. U. L. Rev. 70, 96-97 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-7\"><em> </em>Dr. Sprague qualified his opinion by saying, \u201cIf it was the opinion of these physicians [other physicians involved in the ease] that Mr. McCarthy\u2019s work was a grave danger to his health, then it seems to me that there should have been some statement that these physicians had instructed him to retire when his hypertension was apparently intractable in 1946.\u2019\u2019 There was no evidence that McCarthy was advised to retir\u00e9 in 1946.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
