City Bank presents its exceptions, among others, to the refusal to direct a verdict for it, to the refusal of a mistrial, and to rulings on evidence. The evidence is stated in its aspect most favorable to Elbar.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">On March 20, 1957, Elbar bought a $100,000 United States Treasury bearer certificate of indebtedness due February 14, 1958. On August 17 or 18, 1957, the certificate was stolen from Elbar.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">During November, 1957, a man who gave a name \u201csomething like Fred or Frederico\u201d Serano approached one Shapiro, a \u201cgenealogist\u201d (and also a disbarred lawyer, although it was not shown that this was known by City Bank prior to February 20,1958). Serano \u201cwas a foreign looking person\u201d whom Shapiro \u201chad never seen before.\u201d Serano showed Shapiro the certificate, but did not give Shapiro \u201can address or telephone number.\u201d Shapiro called by telephone one Goldman, whom he had known for fifty years as a fellow member of a social club, \u201cand asked him if he knew anyone who would buy or loan on a $100,000 certificate ... at a discount.\u201d Shapiro said that he \u2018wanted to borrow $90,000 for a client. \u2019 \u2019 After trying his own bank, Goldman called one Marks, a social friend for some years who had become \u201ca director in City Bank in December, 1956, just about the time the bank opened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Marks, after two telephone talks with Epstein, president of City Bank, called back to say that \u201cCity Bank would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>interested\u201d and arranged an appointment for Goldman and Shapiro with Epstein. Goldman took Shapiro to the bank and introduced him, to Marks. Marks introduced them to Epstein, who had met Goldman before. Epstein \u201casked about the bond and ... ['Shapiro] told him it belonged to a client . . . out of the country, who wanted to obtain $60,000 cash on the bond, and . . . thought this would be the easiest way to negotiate rather than through other channels.\u201d They \u201cdiscussed the possibility that the . . . client would leave some money in the bank and the rate of interest\u201d which was fixed at six per cent, although the certificate carried interest of only three and three eighths per cent. Epstein made no inquiry \u201cabout Shapiro\u2019s business, financial status, or where he got the bond, nor was . . . [he] told that Marks [had] inquired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Epstein then introduced Shapiro to Swift, executive vice-president of 'City Bank, who handled the details of the loan. \u201c [U]p to this time no one asked where the certificate was, but Swift [then] did [ask] and . . . [Shapiro] told Swift he would get the bond.\u201d Shapiro then returned to his own office and \u201cwaited until Serano called him.\u201d Serano gave Shapiro the certificate and 'Shapiro took it to City Bank and gave it to Swift. Swift looked at the certificate and asked some questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Shapiro then signed a note for $90,000 due on February 14, 1958. He also signed a signature card and an authorization to City Bank to collect the certificate of indebtedness at its maturity, to use the proceeds to pay his note, and to deposit \u201cthe overage to . . . [his] account.\u201d At Epstein\u2019s request Shapiro agreed to open a checking account with City Bank and informed Swift that \u201che wanted the account opened as \u2018Special\u2019 as it was a client\u2019s money.\u201d Swift introduced Shapiro to one \u201cFoley, a teller . . . and told Foley it would be all right to cash a check.\u201d Shapiro \u201cmade out a check for $60,000 to cash, presented it to Foley and said [that] he wanted the money in $100 bills and Swift heard this.\u201d Foley replied that \u201cthey did not have that many on hand and Swift suggested that . . . [Shapiro] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>take half in $100 . . . bills then and half the next day.\u201d Shapiro \u201ctore np the first check, [and] made out another for $30,000.\u201d Foley gathered up \u201c$100 . . . bills from other tellers and . . . gave . . . [Shapiro] the money in 300 one hundred dollar bills which . . . [\u00a1Shapiro] put into a brief case and took back to his office. \u2019 \u2019 Shapiro gave this money to Serano and told him he would have to wait until the next day for the other $30,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">On November 27, Shapiro returned to City Bank, made out a check for $30,000, and asked for the money in $100 bills. Foley gave the money to him, after he had checked the signature on the check with the signature card and \u201ccalled the bookkeeping department and got the \u2018Okay.\u2019 \u201d Before giving \u201cShapiro the money . . . [Foley] asked Shapiro if he would take a treasurer\u2019s check but Shapiro said, \u2018No, I want cash.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Foley then \u2018\u2018asked Shapiro why he would take a chance in carrying that amount of money around and Shapiro replied that he was a diamond merchant and would get better prices for cash. \u2019 \u2019 Before Foley \u201casked this question of Shapiro he had looked at the signature card and it was printed right on the card that Shapiro was a genealogist. \u2019 \u2019 On December 2, 1957, Foley cashed a check for Shapiro for $8,000 and on December 6, 1957, one for $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">When Shapiro told him about the loan, Goldman on either November 26 or 27 \u201casked Shapiro for a loan of $1,500 . . . [although] Shapiro had never made a loan of $1,500 to . . . [him] before.\u201d By appointment Shapiro met Goldman on November 27 and gave him \u201ca check for $1,500.\u201d It was \u201cjust a friendly loan with no interest,\u201d not repaid until December, 1958. Goldman was first summoned \u201cto hearings involving this transaction in October, 1958, and . . . again in December, 1958.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">City Bank was not a member of the Federal Reserve 'System. It handled transactions with the Federal Reserve through The First National Bank of Boston (First National). Accordingly, on February 14, 1958, City Bank sent to First National for collection the certificate of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>debtedness and one coupon. Shapiro\u2019s note was stamped \u201cpaid\u201d and sent to Shapiro on February 14, and \u201cShapiro\u2019s account in City Bank . . . [was] credited with the difference between the proceeds of the certificate and coupon ($101,678.33) and $90,000 the amount of the note.\u201d On February 14, the balance in Shapiro\u2019s account was $12,478.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">First National sent the certificate on February 14 to the Federal Reserve with a request for redemption. On February 20, First National, Epstein, and Swift learned that the bond had been stolen. Various conferences then took place among Epstein, representatives of Elbar, and others. Marks, when asked by the police, failed to recall who was with him, Epstein, and Shapiro in Epstein\u2019s office when the loan was made. It later \u201ccame to him\u201d who the man (his friend of thirty years, Groldman) was. He notified Epstein but he did not notify the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">There was also evidence that City Bank \u201cnever had a U. S. certificate of indebtedness for $100,000 before this time,\u201d or a loan on one; that the loan \u201cwas greater than the average loan\u201d; that in respect of such a loan on a \u201cbearer bond they check through their directors to make sure the borrower is the owner; that if a borrower is a friend of a director and the director comes in and says so-and-so is the owner of the bond and the director knew him, City Bank would take that as identification for the bond\u201d; that Epstein, if \u201ctold that the bond belonged to a South American client,\u201d would not \u201chave accepted it as collateral unless the man who owned it was there\u201d; that at least one officer of City Bank knew that \u201cone can turn in . . . [government] securities to . . . [certain Boston] firms and have his money that day or the next\u201d; and that it \u2018 \u2018was not usual for a depositor to . . . cash a check ... of $30,000 and ask for . . . $100 bills . . . [and] to come back the next day with another check for $30,000 and ask for that in $100 bills.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">1. City Bank contends that, because the case deals with a negotiable instrument issued by the United States, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>court must apply Federal law with respect to the standards and burden of proof. The Supreme Court of the United States has held otherwise with respect to a Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation bond, where only private parties were litigants, and the situation involved \u201cthe transfer of Government paper between private persons.\u201d <em>Bank of America Natl. Trust &amp; Sav. Assn. </em>v. <em>Parnell, </em>352 U. S. 29, 33-34. See <em>Gramatan Natl. Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>326 Mass. 367, 369-370; Mishkin, The Variousness of \u201cFederal Law\u201d: Competence and Discretion in the Choice of National and State Rules for Decision, 105 U. of P. L. Rev. 797, 824-828; note 45 Cal. L. Rev. 212, 213. Cf. <em>Clearfield Trust Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>318 U. S. 363, 366, where the United States was a party. That the Treasury regulations, found in 31 CFR \u00a7 306.95 (a), indicate a general policy of promoting the marketability of these certificates is not sufficient ground for distinguishing the <em>Parnell </em>case. No provision of the regulations prescribes anything with respect to either the burden of proof of ownership or the good faith of a person taking such Federal securities. Cf. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>325 Mass. 257, 262-264. The case is to be determined in accordance with the law of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">2. This action is governed by G. L. c. 107. See esp. \u00a7 82.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> City Bank contends, upon the basis of <em>Filosi </em>v. <em>Crossman, </em>111 Conn. 178, 184-185, that \u00a7 82 does not apply where the action is for conversion of the certificate rather than upon the instrument itself. The <em>Filosi </em>case seems contrary to the result reached in <em>Fillebrown </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>190 Mass. 472, 481-482, and to general authority elsewhere. We do not follow it. See <em>Crittenden </em>v. <em>Widrevitz, </em>272 Fed. 871, 873-874 (2d Cir.), cert. den. 257 U. S. <em>636; McCollum </em>v. <em>Graber, </em>207 Ark. 1053, 1055-1059.

Section 82 applies despite the circumstance that the bonds were government bearer bonds. See <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. </em>v. <em>Taunton, </em>303 Mass. 176, 178 (municipal bond); <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Taunton, </em>303 Mass. 182, 183; <em>National Sur.

Cf. <em>Wyer </em>v. <em>Dorchester &amp; Milton Bank, </em>11 Cush. 51, 53-55 (bank note).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">General Laws c. 107, \u00a7 82, reads, \u201cEvery holder is deemed prima facie to be a holder in due course; but when it is shown that the title of any person who has negotiated the instrument was defective the burden is on the holder to prove that he or some person under whom he claims acquired ithe title as holder in due course. ...\u201d In Massachusetts, under \u00a7 82, the party contending that a defect in title exists has the burden of establishing the existence of the defect. See <em>Beacon Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Ryder, </em>273 Mass. 573, 575-576; <em>Gramatan Natl. Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>326 Mass. 367, 370-371. Where such a defect is established, then the holder has the burden, in the sense of the ultimate burden of persuasion (and not merely the burden of going forward with evidence), \u201cof proving that he was a holder in due course.\u201d See <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>221 Mass. 103, 104; <em>Back Bay Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Brickley, </em>254 Mass. 261, 268; <em>Granlund </em>v. <em>Saraf, </em>263 Mass. 76, 81; <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>264 Mass. 208, 214-215. See also <em>Commercial Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Kealey, </em>92 F. 2d 397, 402 (4th Cir.). If the jury believed, as they obviously did, the ample evidence that the certificate had been stolen, the thief had a defective title. Under \u00a7 82, the thief was a person \u201cwho . . . [had] negotiated the instrument.\u201d Thus, City Bank then had the ultimate burden of proof that it was a holder in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"AJp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>We do not understand the <em>Beacon Trust Co. </em>case to modify the rule<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> laid down in <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Eldridge, supra. </em>City Bank, however, places some reliance upon <em>Standard Acceptance Corp. </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>277 Mass. 278, 279, 281, and the <em>Gramatan Natl. Bank </em>case, 326 Mass. 367, 371, in each of which a verdict was entered for a holder who had the ultimate burden of proof of absence of bad faith. In the <em>Gramatan </em>case \u201cmost of . . . [the facts] were not in dispute\u201d and the \u201cvery most that could have been found\u201d was that the holder \u201chad grounds for\u201d suspicion. In the <em>Standard Acceptance Corp. </em>case (where \u00a7 82 was not discussed in the briefs or the decision) it would seem that the court concluded that very complete evidence of what actually occurred, even viewed in its aspect most adverse to the holder\u2019s position, did \u201cnot justify a finding of bad faith.\u201d We accept these decisions as establishing the possibility that upon occasion a verdict may be ordered for the holder where, upon all rational views of a fully described transaction, no inference of bad faith can reasonably be drawn. See Honigman, Proof of Good Faith, 23 Mich. L. Rev. 870, 876-879.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">3. The crucial issue is whether 'City Bank took the certificate of indebtedness in good faith so that it became a holder in due course under G. L. c. 107, \u00a7\u00a7 75, 79 (N. I. L. \u00a7\u00a7 52, 56)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Fillebrown </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>190 Mass. 472, 480, it was said, \u201c [N] either knowledge of suspicious circumstances, nor doubts as to the genuineness of the title, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>gross negligence on the part of the taker either singly or together are sufficient to defeat the holder\u2019s recovery, unless amounting to proof of want of good faith.\u201d This court (at p. 482) indicated that the test on this issue of fact was whether the taker of the instrument \u201cknew, or in the face of facts sufficient to put her upon inquiry purposely refrained from knowing[,] of the fraud\u201d affecting the instrument. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>111 Mass. 342, 343 (where the trial judge, in a charge which this court regarded as correct in general, said \u201cthat there might be such recklessness as would be inconsistent with honesty of purpose\u201d); <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Park Trust Co. </em>245 Mass. 440, 446 (although an \u201cinvestigation . . . would have shown . . . [fraud, the holder was] not bound to make\u201d one); <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Bond &amp; Goodwin Inc. </em>276 Mass. 458, 463-464 (\u201cSuspicion . . . was not the equivalent of knowledge which would show bad faith\u201d); <em>Standard Acceptance Corp. </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>277 Mass. 278, 282 (that \u201cthe would-be seller of a negotiable instrument is unscrupulous and has been concerned in . . . illegal transactions is not enough\u201d); <em>Macklin </em>v. <em>Macklin, </em>315 Mass. 451, 455 (\u201c [t]he rights of a holder . . . are to be determined by the simple test of honesty and good faith, and not by a speculative issue as to his diligence or negligence\u201d) ; <em>Gramatan Natl. Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>326 Mass. 367, 371. In view of these decisions, the test in the present case, based upon the language of the <em>Fillebrown </em>case at p. 482, is whether the jury could reasonably infer that the group acting for City Bank knew \u201cfacts sufficient to put . . . [it] upon inquiry [and] purposely refrained\u201d from inquiring or from knowing about other facts which would have revealed the lack of title in Shapiro\u2019s client.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">4. City Bank was not entitled to a directed verdict. Assuming that City Bank was a holder in due course to the extent of amounts already paid to Shapiro from the \u201cSpecial\u201d account before it learned of the theft, it was not one with respect to the amounts then remaining in the checking account. G. L. c. 107, \u00a7 77 (N. I. L. \u00a7 54). See <em>Merchants Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Marden, Orth &amp; Eastings Co. </em>234 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Mass. 161, 170, annotation, 59 A. L. R. 2d 1173, 1176, 1184. See also <em>Boston-Continental Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Hub Fruit Co. </em>285 Mass. 187, 189. The motion for a directed verdict was general. Because in any event it could not be allowed as to the amount remaining in the checking account, it was properly denied. See <em>Shumway </em>v. <em>Home Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>301 Mass. 391, 396-397; <em>Trites </em>v. <em>Melrose, </em>318 Mass. 378, 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We do not, however, place our approval of the trial judge\u2019s refusal to direct a verdict solely upon the narrow ground just mentioned. There was sufficient evidence to warrant submitting to the jury the issue whether City Bank took the bond in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The jury could have found that Swift and Epstein were told that the certificate was owned by 'Shapiro\u2019s client and that Swift knew that the deposit of proceeds was to be \u201copened as \u2018Special\u2019 as . . . client\u2019s money.\u201d Shapiro thus purported to be pledging a client\u2019s security for a personal loan. The judge correctly told the jury that they should consider whether knowledge of ownership of the bond by a client, when it was being pledged by Shapiro \u201cfor ... a loan to himself,\u201d so called for inquiry that failing to make it tended to show bad faith. Although the proceeds of the loan were to go temporarily into a special account, the great bulk of the funds were to be withdrawn, and were withdrawn, in cash promptly. The knowledge of the client\u2019s interest, at least in respect of any interest of that client, imposed a duty upon City Bank \u201cto ascertain whether the . . . [certificate] could be used legally as collateral security for\u201d Shapiro\u2019s own debt. See <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>294 Mass. 236, 247; Bestatement 2d: Trusts, \u00a7 <em>297; </em>Scott, Trusts (2d ed.) \u00a7 297.6. No inquiries were made by City Bank\u2019s officers as to Shapiro\u2019s authority to pledge the certificate for a loan to himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Shapiro was a stranger to City Bank when the loan was made, although introduced by Marks, one of City Bank\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>directors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Marks did not say, \u201cThis man is a friend of mine, and . . . owns this . . . bond.\u201d He was.not shown to have done more than to introduce him. The jury had before them expert testimony that First National would not have made the loan to one (even if introduced by a director) who had indicated that the certificate belonged to another. It was known to officers of City Bank that the certificate could have been sold promptly elsewhere for cash, whereas borrowing would be at a rate of interest above that accruing on the certificate. Swift, an officer of City Bank, knew that Shapiro, instead of taking a cashier\u2019s check to transmit funds to his client, ran the risk of transporting currency in packets of three hundred $100 bills. This the jury could reasonably regard as so unusual as to indicate that Shapiro did not wish to have the transaction traced. As to withdrawals later made from the checking account, City Bank\u2019s teller could have been found to have known that Shapiro described himself as a diamond merchant who needed cash, at a time when his signature card showed him to be a genealogist and when other City Bank officers knew that \u2022 Shapiro was borrowing on his own note secured by what he said was a client\u2019s collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The jury, of course, could reasonably have concluded that City Bank for an interest return of only some $1,200 would have been unlikely to take the risk of becoming a converter of a $100,000 bond and of losing the security for its loan. They could have found that the action of the bank and its officers was consistent with good faith, even if grossly un-businesslike. Nevertheless; the jury, who saw and heard City Bank\u2019s officers, were not bound so to decide. The extraordinary circumstances of this loan could reasonably have been regarded as ample to cause serious alarm to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>competent lending officer of even a new bank, as not being regular and in the ordinary course of business. See Goodrich, J., in <em>Bank of America Natl. Trust &amp; Sav. Assn. </em>v. <em>Rocco, </em>226 F. 2d 297, 307, <em>supra. </em>The jury had adequate basis in the evidence for inferring that City Bank\u2019s officers incorrectly appraised as slight the risk of dealing with Shapiro; and that, with a view to preserving a profitable piece of business, they refrained from inquiry with a reckless disregard of the obvious which constituted bad faith. Even if the test as to notice and absence of bad faith is the subjective test of honesty and not the objective test of diligence, the circumstances of which the bank could have been found to have had knowledge permitted the jury to infer that the bank\u2019s conduct, in disregard of sound banking standards, was something more than gross ignorance and negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">5. Shapiro was permitted to testify, subject to City Bank\u2019s exception,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (1) about his conversations with Serano and with. Goldman, (2) about the $1,500 loan which he made to Goldman, and (3) about a $11,000 fee taken for his own work. The judge also admitted, subject to exception, testimony of Goldman (a) about a conversation with the president of Middlesex County National Bank that his bank \u201cwas not in a position to handle that kind of bond or, at that time, to do anything with a bond of that size\u201d; and (b) about the $1,500 loan to him. City Bank\u2019s counsel stated that his objection was to admitting this testimony on the issue of bad faith on the part of City Bank, although he did not object to receiving the testimony upon the issue of Shapiro\u2019s lack of title to the certificate. City Bank seasonably excepted to the denial of its request to limit the use of the testimony, made when the testimony was given and also later renewed. Exception was also taken to the testimony that Shapiro was a disbarred lawyer and to Foley\u2019s testimony about Shapiro\u2019s statement that he was a diamond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>merchant. This statement was not made until after the first $30,000 had been withdrawn from the checking account. It was not shown that City Bank officers knew, prior to any of Shapiro\u2019s withdrawals of cash from the bank account, (1) about the matters discussed by Shapiro and Goldman and by Goldman and his banker, (2) that Shapiro had made the $1,500 loan, or (3) that Shapiro was a disbarred lawyer. City Bank objected to all the testimony described above on the ground that it referred to matters which took place, or became known to City Bank, only after credit had been extended to Shapiro. If this testimony was not admissible on the issue of City Bank\u2019s good faith, the harm was not removed by the charge. Indeed, the judge specifically mentioned Goldman\u2019s effort to obtain a loan from the Middlesex County National Bank and Shapiro\u2019s loan to Goldman as factors at least indirectly bearing upon City Bank\u2019s \u201cinnocence and title to that bond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">It is possible that some of this damaging information would have been discovered if City Bank had made an investigation to determine whether Shapiro was authorized by his client to pledge the bond to secure his own note. Elbar argues (see <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Puritan Trust Co. </em>211 Mass. 409), 421; cf. <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Everett Natl. Bank, </em>305 Mass. 178, 181-182; <em>Boston Note Brokerage Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Pilgrim Trust Co. </em>318 Mass. 224, 227-228) in effect that the disputed evidence was admissible because it showed facts which City Bank would have discovered if it had pushed such an inquiry. City Bank, if it had investigated, would probably have found that Shapiro was indeed authorized by his client to pledge the bond. That other significant facts would have been discovered, however, is collateral to the issue of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">We assume that, if the disputed evidence had been clearly limited to showing that inquiry would not have been futile, and to its bearing on Shapiro\u2019s own title, its admission would not have been prejudicial. On the issue of City Bank\u2019s good faith, however, only what City Bank actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>knew is significant in appraising whether it was acting honestly. See <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Park Trust Co. </em>245 Mass. 440, 446; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Bond &amp; Goodwin Inc. </em>276 Mass. 458, 464. That Shapiro was pledging a client\u2019s bond for his own debt gave notice to the bank of risks and dangers and of an obligation to investigate. That City Bank did not investigate in accordance with good banking practice, when it had this knowledge, warranted an inference by the jury that it was deliberately avoiding discovering the facts which an investigation might reveal. Its good faith, however, was not affected by facts of which it had no knowledge at any pertinent moment. The disputed evidence should have been limited to the issues on which it had relevance as City Bank sufficiently requested. It was not relevant on the issue of good faith and may seriously have affected the jury\u2019s judgment on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">6. Our disposition of City Bank\u2019s exceptions to the failure to limit the evidence just mentioned makes it unnecessary to consider City Bank\u2019s other exceptions concerning issues of law which either have been sufficiently discussed above or are unlikely to arise at a new trial. These include exceptions to the charge, to the refusal of requested instructions, and to the denial of a mistrial because of a question whether Elbar carried theft insurance, the answer to which (because irrelevant or likely to be prejudicial) the judge in his discretion seems properly to have struck from the record. See <em>Gladney </em>v. <em>Holland Furnace Co. </em>336 Mass. 366, 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-10\"> The ease was tried with three similar actions.
