The case was presented to a judge of the Superior Court on a statement of agreed facts. Therein it appeared that on September 16, 1958, his \u201cday off,\u201d the plaintiff was assigned by his superior officer to perform traffic duty for a private contractor who was engaged in the relocation of the old Salem depot. Although not required to do so, the plaintiff accepted the assignment and was paid by the contractor. He \u201cworked under the direction of the private contractor, State engineer and/or the City Marshal.\u201d While in uniform \u201cperforming the work of a police officer\u201d on Washington Street, he was struck by a motor vehicle \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>without fault of his own \u2019 \u2019 and received an injury which totally incapacitated him for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>duty. He was granted leave without loss of pay from September 17, 1958, until October 17, 1959, except for a period from January 1 through February 8, 1959. On October 17, 1959, his name was removed from the payroll of the Salem police department and from October 18, 1959, he \u201ccontinued on leave with loss of pay.\u201d As of the date of the statement of agreed facts he remained totally incapacitated for duty because of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 111F, inserted by St. 1952, c. 419, provides that \u201cWhenever a police officer . . . of a city . . . is incapacitated for duty because of injury sustained in the performance of his duty without fault of his own, he shall be granted leave without loss of pay for the period of such incapacity\u201d; but \u201cno such leave shall be granted for any period after such police officer . . . has been retired or pensioned in accordance with law or for any period after a physician designated by the board or officer authorized to appoint police officers ... in such city . . . determines that such incapacity no longer exists.\u201d It was agreed that this statute applies to Salem and that the plaintiff has not been examined by a physician so designated. The defendant moved that \u201cupon the pleadings, opening and upon all the evidence, a verdict be ordered in its favor. \u2019 \u2019 This motion was treated as a motion \u201cfor finding\u201d for the defendant and was allowed subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The statement of agreed facts is in effect a case stated. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 126. We are free to draw therefrom such inferences and reach such conclusions as we think are warranted. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co. </em>310 Mass. 81. <em>Caissie </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>317 Mass. 346, 347. The parties must have meant by the term \u201ctraffic duty\u201d the duty commonly performed by police officers in directing and controlling vehicular traffic. The plaintiff was a public officer <em>(Buttrick </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>1 Allen, 172; <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>205 Mass. 246) obligated to perform this duty in accordance with the \u201cpower and authority bestowed by the law.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Tillinghast, </em>203 Mass. 539, 543. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 98. He was injured while in uniform, \u201cperforming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>the work of a police officer,\u201d by assignment of his superior officer. He was therefore injured \u201cin the performance of bis duty.\u201d In its performance he was not acting in the capacity of employee of the contractor. See <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Stair, </em>217 Mass. 534, 536; <em>Perras </em>v. <em>Hi-Hat, Inc. </em>326 Mass. <em>78; Kidder </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>336 Mass. 307, 308-309. It is irrelevant to the issue of performance that he was \u201cpaid for his assignment\u201d by the contractor. Whether this statement means that he was paid to accept the assignment or to compensate him for the work performed, in either case he was engaged in carrying out a public duty. Although it is stated that he \u201cworked under the direction of the private contractor, State engineer and/or the City Marshal\u201d the only direction relating to police work was the general assignment to traffic duty. The defendant raises no issue-as to the validity of \u00a7 111F. See <em>Quinlan </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>320 Mass. 124; <em>Berube </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Edgartown, </em>336 Mass. 634. There was error in finding for the defendant. The plaintiff was entitled to be paid his wages for the period specified in his declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
