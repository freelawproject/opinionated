These policies insured \u201cAgoos Leather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Companies, Inc. and/or Agoos Tanning Co.\u201d for an aggregate face amount of $100,000 with respect to \u201can idle . . . vacant and unsprinklered plant.\u201d The plaintiffs \u201cdecided to liquidate the business\u201d and the plant ceased operations as a tannery about Labor Day, 1956. It burned on November 29, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The jury found for the plaintiffs in the sum of $81,410 which included interest from December 5, 1956, which the defendants contend amounted to $11,429.85, thus maldng the principal sum of recoverable insurance $69,980.15. The defendants present their exceptions to the trial judge\u2019s refusal to direct a verdict for them and to certain rulings upon evidence. The evidence, including the facts already set forth, is stated in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">1. The policies are standard Massachusetts fire insurance policies (see G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 99, as amended through St. 1951, c. 478, \u00a7 1; see also G. L. c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 95, 96) and give coverage \u201cto the extent of the actual cash value of the property at the time of loss. \u2019 \u2019 The defendants, in support of their exception to the denial of a directed verdict, argue only that the plaintiffs failed to sustain their burden of proving the amount of their loss, i.e. the value of their buildings on the day of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The evidence of value was meager and some questions were not very clearly directed to value as of the day of the fire, although they could be interpreted as referring to value on that day. The plant had an aggregate content of 1,586,103 cubic feet. The oldest building was about eighty years old and \u201cthe most recent . . . was built in 1934.\u201d They were \u201cframe and brick\u201d or \u201cwooden structures with steel members, having party walls and passageways leading from one building to another. You could start at one end of the buildings and go through each one without going outside.\u201d There were at least four buildings. Building A was a four story building and an. adjacent building had at least three floors. There were also a brick boiler building and a two story building.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>After operation of the plant as a tannery ceased in September, 1956, the machinery, equipment, and other personal property in the plant had been sold and was being removed. Pipe was being broken up, including the sprinkler pipe system. There had been a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign on the plant and \u201c [p]eople came to see the plant from time to time.\u201d It was last \u201cshown ... to a prospective purchaser about three . . . weeks before the fire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">One Sart testified on the issue of value. He was president of Tanning and vice-president and general superintendent of Leather, \u201cin charge of repairs, replacement and construction.\u201d He \u201chad once owned his own tanning company and . . . [had been] involved in the purchase of a tannery by Mr. Agoos in Salem.\u201d At or about the time of trial he was a consultant to three leather companies and a shoe company in work which \u201cinvolved the entire field of tanning, buildings, and productive equipment. He . . . [had] been engaged in the tanning business for forty . . . years ..... From 1936 on he knew what was done to the buildings\u201d and \u201cwas . . . intimately familiar with\u201d them. On Labor Day, 1966, he \u201cknew the condition of the plant.\u201d It does not appear that any objection to Sart\u2019s testimony, mentioned below, was made specifically on the ground that Sart was not qualified to testify. In any event, the trial judge had ample ground for permitting Sart, a corporate officer who knew the plant and was also a tannery expert, to express an opinion as to value, even though he did not claim to be \u201c an expert on anything. \u2019 \u2019 See <em>Rubin </em>v. <em>Arlington, </em>327 Mass. 382, 384; <em>Winthrop Prod. Corp. </em>v. <em>Elroth Co. Inc. </em>331 Mass. 83, 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Subject to the defendants\u2019 exception, Sart testified that \u201cthe fair cash value of these buildings on the day of the fire without equipment and without personal property\u201d was in his opinion $250,000, including the land, but disclaimed knowing \u201canything about the values of land as an expert.\u201d He later testified that this opinion was on the basis that the plant would be \u201cconducted as a tanning place of business\u201d or \u201cfor the purpose of a tannery.\u201d There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>after he gave the opinion that \u201cthe value of the buildings\u201d was $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The defendants offered no expert testimony upon the issue of the value of the destroyed buildings. Their efforts to introduce evidence of a contract for demolition of the buildings (discussed <em>infra) </em>were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">\u201cThe words \u2018actual value\u2019 in the policies . . . are to be interpreted in the light of the nature of the insurance contract as a contract of indemnity. They import that recovery for loss cannot be based upon a value dependent upon fanciful considerations .... But the words \u2018actual value\u2019 do not import that recovery is limited to market value. . . . \u2018 [M] arket value does not in all cases afford a correct measure of indemnity. ... In some cases there is no market value, properly speaking, and in others, if there is, it plainly would not of itself afford full indemnity. \u2019 . . . [T]he so called market value of . . . buildings, based either on their market value for the purpose of removal or on the amount by which they increase the market value of the real estate as a whole, may not be a true measure of indemnity for direct loss by fire. . . . On the other hand, even where market value will not afford the indemnity for which the . . . insurance provides, the cost of replacement, less depreciation, is not conclusive as to the actual value .... But it is important evidence of such value to be considered with other evidence.\u201d See <em>Kingsley </em>v. <em>Spofford, </em>298 Mass. 469, 475-476; <em>Gechijian </em>v. <em>Richmond Ins. Co. </em>305 Mass. 132, 141; <em>New England Gas &amp; Elec. Assn. </em>v. <em>Ocean Acc. &amp; Guar. Corp. Ltd. </em>330 Mass. 640, 657-658; <em>Pinet </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Fire Ins. Co. </em>100 N. H. 346, 348-349, in which Kenison, C.J. said, \u201cBoth fair market value and replacement cost are permissible standards for determining fire losses but they are standards and not shackles\u201d; <em>McAnarney </em>v. <em>Newark Fire Ins. Co. </em>247 N. Y. 176, 180-186; <em>Britven </em>v. <em>Occidental Ins. Co. </em>234 Iowa, 682, 686-688; Bonbright &amp; Katz, Valuation of Property to Measure Fire Insurance Losses, 29 Col. L. Rev. 857, 878-900; Valuation and Measure of Recovery under Fire Insurance Policies, 49 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Col. L. Rev. 818-824; Couch, Insurance, \u00a7 2234; Sedgwick, Damages (9th ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 721-722; Sutherland, Damages (4th ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 821, 825; annotation, 61 A. L. R. 2d 711, 725-733.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">We do not agree with the defendants\u2019 contention that, even under the hroad principles just discussed, the plaintiffs have not sustained their burden (see <em>Heebner </em>v. <em>Eagle Ins. Co. </em>10 Gray, 131, 143; <em>Cory </em>v. <em>Boylston Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>107 Mass. 140, 147; Appleman, Insurance Law &amp; Practice, \u00a7\u00a7 12,093, 12,233) of proving their loss with reasonable certainty. \u201cIt is of course true that damages must be reasonably ascertainable from the evidence. . . . But the fact that there is an element of uncertainty in their assessment is not a bar to recovery. . . . \u2018The amount of damages seldom can be proved with the exactness of mathematical demonstration. Much must be left to estimate and judgment, sometimes upon meager evidence. \u2019 \u201d See <em>Dalton </em>v. <em>Demos Bros. Gen. Contractors, Inc. </em>334 Mass. 377, 378-379 (tort injury to property from a negligent blast). See also <em>Bond Pharmacy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>338 Mass. 488, 491-492, 493. Unreasonable certainty and precision are not to be required in proving the amount of this fire loss for which compensated insurers (cf. <em>Veneto </em>v. <em>McCloskey &amp; Co. </em>333 Mass. 95, 104) were bound to provide indemnity. This is not a case in which it is doubtful whether any fire loss has occurred. Cf. <em>Buffalo Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Spach, </em>277 F. 2d 529, 530-531 (5th Cir.). The \u201centire plant was demolished by fire.\u201d Recovery \u201cwill not be denied because . . ; damages are difficult to ascertain. While the damages may not be determined by mere speculation or guess, it is enough if the evidence shows the extent of the damages as a matter of just and reasonable inference. A reasonable basis of computation and the best evidence . . . obtainable . . . which will enable the jury to arrive at an approximate estimate of the loss is sufficient.\u201d See <em>Vanguard Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Connett, </em>270 F. 2d 868, 870-871 (10th Cir.). See also <em>Pruitt </em>v. <em>Hardware Dealers Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>112 F. 2d 140, 142 (5th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In <em>Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number><em>Travelers Fire Ins. Co. </em>146 Conn. 223, the proof went \u201cno further than to show that over two years before the fire the value of . . . [a convent] building was $67,750 and that demolition had progressed to the extent of about 10 per cent of the entire structure.\u201d The court stated (at p. 226) that the \u201cjury were not supplied with any proof from which they could estimate the actual cash value ... at the time of the fire with . . . reasonable certainty.\u201d Even if the jury could have inferred that the building in the two year period (p. 225) \u201chad lost nothing in value through depreciation or obsolescence, or otherwise,\u201d the court perceived in the evidence \u201cnothing to indicate the diminution in value due to . . . demolition\u201d which (at p. 226) \u201cmight well have caused a heavy diminution in the value of the building as a whole, over and above the value of the materials or property actually removed.\u201d We think that this Connecticut case is distinguishable from the case before us in which there was the direct testimony of Sart (even if it was very general in terms and far from a comprehensive analysis of either market value or reproduction cost) that the Agoos plant, as it existed at the date of the fire, was worth $200,000 for tannery purposes. If, however, the Connecticut case must be taken as calling for more precise proof than we here require, we are not prepared to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Under the principles applicable in the valuation of Massachusetts fire insurance losses S art\u2019s testimony about the value of the property for tannery purposes was relevant. The buildings had been used as a tannery and it could be inferred that such use of them was still appropriate if anyone wished so to use them. It could have been found that, within a few weeks of the loss, a possible (even if not probable) purchaser had visited the buildings. If a sale was in fact highly unlikely, that was a matter which only went to the weight of the testimony about value for tannery purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">It would have been appropriate for each of the parties to have given the jury far more guidance in appraising the loss, especially by presenting through competent engineers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>testimony about the reproduction cost of the buildings, their accrued depreciation, their estimated remaining useful life, and the effect upon value of any partial demolition or removal of equipment prior to the loss. In a case where there is a substantial possibility of removal or demolition of buildings, such testimony of replacement cost and proper adjustments to reflect other considerations affecting physical value is likely to be a more reliable guide to \u201cthe actual intrinsic cash value of the property destroyed\u201d (see <em>Washington Mills Emery Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Weymouth &amp; Braintree Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>135 Mass. 503, 505-507; see also <em>New England Gas &amp; Elec. Assn. </em>v. <em>Ocean Acc. &amp; Guar. Corp. Ltd. </em>330 Mass. 640, 657-658) than evidence of market value. This is because, under the <em>Washington Mills </em>case, the insured is entitled to recover \u201csuch a sum as it would have cost at the time of the fire to have replaced and restored the property to the condition in which it was before, without regard to the fact that it was to be removed.\u201d Under the doctrine of <em>Kingsley </em>v. <em>Spofford, </em>298 Mass. 469, 474-477, however, evidence of market value or going concern value, or special value for other purposes, is not to be excluded. The jury may apply their experience and judgment in determining whether and to what extent such evidence is to be given weight in the circumstances, notwithstanding that in such cases the authorities also permit consideration of replacement value. We think that the evidence of value on the date of the fire was not so slight and so indefinite as to require withholding the ease from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">2. The defendants called as a witness one Eosenburg, president, treasurer, and a director of Leather. He identified an agreement signed in the name of Leather by him as president, dated November 15, 1956. The agreement, when offered generally, was excluded upon the plaintiffs\u2019 general objection. The judge did not indicate the grounds of exclusion. An offer of proof consisting of the agreement itself was made with respect to each exclusion of testimony about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>The agreement, which recited that it was duly authorized, was between Mystic Building Wrecking Co., Inc., and Leather. It did not refer to Tanning or to any vote by any corporate body of Leather authorizing its execution. For the demolition of \u201cthe buildings ... on the land owned by\u201d Leather, the wrecking company was to receive $12,000. Work was to commence not later than December 10, 1956, subject to the right of Leather to request a delay in commencement of the work for a reasonable time thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The obvious reason for the general offer of the agreement was to show absence of market value. On that issue it had probative value as fully as would a contract for the sale of the buildings. See <em>Brush Hill Dev. Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>338 Mass. 359, 364-366. The agreement would have been admissible'if it had been shown to have been binding on both coowners, if both Leather and Tanning owned the buildings, or on the single corporate owner if there was only one owner. 'The ambiguous record, however, left in doubt the ownership of the buildings, and the precise relationship between Leather and Tanning, as well as whether Rosenburg was in fact authorized by either corporation to make this contract for the destruction of these substantial buildings. See <em>Horowitz </em>v. <em>S. Slater &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>265 Mass. 143, 147-148; <em>Stoneman </em>v. <em>Fox Film Corp. </em>295 Mass. 419, 425. See also <em>Kagan </em>v. <em>Levenson, </em>334 Mass. 100, 104-105; Restatement 2d: Agency, \u00a7 52, comment c; \u00a7 73. Cf. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Colonial Provision Co. Inc. </em>314 Mass. 177, 179-180. There was no proof of any knowledge of, or acquiescence in, Rosenburg\u2019s execution of the agreement on the part of any other director of either Leather or Tanning. Cf. <em>Bloomberg </em>v. <em>Greylock Bdcst. Co., ante, </em>p. 542. Because the record did not show that the agreement was binding on the plant\u2019s owner or owners, the judge\u2019s exclusion of the agreement must be upheld. See <em>Palm </em>v. <em>Kulesza, </em>333 Mass. 461, 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The agreement had some tendency to impeach Rosen-burg\u2019s testimony that he had no opinion on\u2018the value of the buildings. As a corporate officer he could hardly have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>signed the agreement, if he thought the real estate would be worth more to the corporation if the buildings were left standing than if the land became vacant. Nevertheless, we think that exclusion of the agreement, when offered for this purpose, was not prejudicial. Bosenburg, even if a hostile witness, had expressed no opinion as to the value which could adversely affect the defendants. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 132; <em>Kavanaugh </em>v. <em>Colombo, </em>304 Mass. 379, 381; <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Keresey, </em>307 Mass. 51, 53; Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7 1893.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
