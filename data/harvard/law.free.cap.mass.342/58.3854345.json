Fingold applied under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 9 (1), to the State board of retirement (the State board) for an accidental death benefit as the widow of Mr. George Fingold. At his sudden death on August 31, 1958, shown by the death certificate to have been caused by \u201ccerebral embolism \u2014 rheumatic valvular heart disease,\u201d he was Attorney General of the Commonwealth. She alleged that Mr. Fingold\u2019s death resulted from accidental injuries sustained on July 16, 1958, while in the performance of and within the scope of his duties. The State board unanimously denied the application. Mrs. Fingold appealed to the contributory retirement appeal board (the appeal board). After hearing, a majority of the appeal board, one member dissenting, reversed the State board\u2019s decision and ordered it to grant benefits. The State board then sought in the Superior Court a review (see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14) of the appeal board\u2019s decision. Mrs. Fingold\u2019s demurrer was overruled. The case was heard on the merits by a judge of the Superior Court upon the record before the appeal board. A decree was entered reversing the decision of the appeal board. Mrs. Fingold has appealed from the decree overruling the demurrer and from the final decree. One member of the appeal board has also purported to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">1. The individual member of the appeal board has no standing to appeal. As one member of a public board, he cannot act separately and individually in this manner. <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Medford, </em>334 Mass. 77, 79-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">2. One ground of Mrs. Fingold\u2019s demurrer is that the State board cannot be a \u201cperson . . . aggrieved\u201d within G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and that, accordingly, the Superior Court had no jurisdiction. Section 14 provides that \u201cany person . . . aggrieved by a final decision of any agency in an adjudicatory proceeding . . . shall be entitled to a judicial review.\u201d \u201cPerson,\u201d see c. 30A, \u00a7 1, \u201cincludes all political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>subdivisions of the commonwealth. \u2019 \u2019 Cf. <em>Robinson Clay Prod. Co. </em>v. <em>Beacon Constr. Co. of Mass. Inc. </em>339 Mass. 406, 407-408. By G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 18 (as amended through St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 2), the State board was created to administer the State employees \u2019 retirement system established under G. L. c. 32, especially \u00a7 20 (1) (b) and (5). Section 20 also provides for teachers \u2019 retirement, county, and city and town systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">There have been similar reviews at the instance of local retirement boards. See e.g. <em>Quincy Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>340 Mass. 56; <em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>340 Mass. 109; <em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>340 Mass. 112. See also <em>Natick </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Dept. of Pub. Welfare, </em>341 Mass. 618. The State board has an obligation to protect the integrity of the State system and the interests with respect to that system of the public and of the State\u2019s taxpayers. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 22 (7) (a), as amended through St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1. This obligation is of the same character as that of the local boards with reference to their respective systems. The rights of review granted by c. 30A are not to be interpreted narrowly where only the petitioner for review seems likely to attempt to protect aspects of the public interest. See <em>Wilmington </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util. </em>340 Mass. 432, 437-439; S<em>. C. </em>341 Mass. 599. The State board\u2019s counsel appeared before the appeal board and participated actively without objection. The State board was properly there treated as present either as of right or by acquiescence in an informal intervention. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (3) (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The demurrer was properly overruled. Nothing in <em>Percival's Case, </em>268 Mass. 50, in <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>324 Mass. 468, or in <em>Iannelle </em>v. <em>Fire Commr. of Boston, </em>331 Mass. 250, all relied upon by Mrs. Fingold, requires a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">3. The decision of the appeal board must stand unless, see G. L. e. 30A, \u00a7 14 (8) (e), it is \u201c [unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6). Accordingly, we must determine whether there was substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>upon which the appeal board could reasonably conclude (a) that Mr. Fingold \u201cdied ... as a result of cerebral embolism . . . precipitated by the duties of his office\u201d; (b) that his death \u201cwas . . . the natural and proximate result of a personal injury sustained ... as a result of, and while in the performance of, his duties ... as envisioned by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 9 (1) \u201d; and (c) that \u201chis spouse is entitled to . . . benefits.\u201d Relevant portions of c. 32, \u00a7 9 (1), inserted by St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1, are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Relevant evidence before the appeal board is summarized below.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">(1) The medical examiner answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question in his certificate whether the \u201cdisease or injury [was] in any way related to [the] occupation of [the] deceased.\u201d The board had before it the death certificate, already mentioned. See G-. L. c. 46, \u00a7 19 (as amended through St. 1950, c. 366).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">(2) In May, 1958, Mr. Fingold began work with two assistants on what was referred to in the evidence as \u201cthe Old Colony case.\u201d See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>337 Mass. 800. Mrs. Fingold testified that when this work began his \u201chealth seemed in normal, good condition.\u201d Mr. Fingold did something on the case almost daily, made several trips to New Haven for hearings, and worked on it at home as well as in his office. Upon his final return from New Haven on June 25, 1958, \u201c [h]e was extremely tired, and . . . went directly to bed.\u201d At times during the period of the hearings, he showed signs of weariness and perhaps of shortness of breath.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">This record contains the 497 page transcript of the Federal court hearings in New Haven, held on May 23 and 27, and on June 23, 24, and 25, 1958. Mr. Fingold appeared on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>May 23 and argued some preliminary matters. His participation in these hearings in open court consisted (a) on May 23, of some objections to evidence and possibly participation in a conference in the judge\u2019s office, (b) on May 27, of three brief colloquies, and (c) on June 23, of a brief statement at the opening of the hearing and cross-examina-tian (thirty-nine pages of the transcript) of the president of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. Mr. Fingold also participated in a conference of railroad officials, officers of the Commonwealth, and members of the Legislature, held in the judge\u2019s chambers on June 25. To this conference Mr. Fingold had been recalled by telephone on June 24, after he had returned that day to his home in Concord, Massachusetts. After June 25 Mr. Fingold conferred with officials and others in an effort to put into effect the arrangements negotiated at the conference with the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">(3) Prior to the Republican pre-primary convention on June 14, Mr. Fingold \u201ctraveled throughout the Commonwealth talking to . . . groups of delegates\u201d and \u201cconferred with a great many people.\u201d At the convention he made a speech accepting his nomination for the office of Governor. Thereafter he had numerous meetings with small groups in Boston and elsewhere about his campaign. Mrs. Fingold testified, however, that Mr. Fingold \u201cused . . . [politics] almost like a hobby\u201d and that political activity \u201cnever had taken any extra exertion out of him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">(4) Mr. Fingold had been treated for \u201ca heart condition from 1948.\u201d He had suffered from rheumatic heart disease. His gall bladder had been removed. In May, 1958, he had been treated at home for a virus infection, and he had been given shots \u201cfor the Asiatic flu. \u2019\u2019 There was conflicting evidence about the extent to which he had otherwise been treated by a doctor in 1957 and 1958. Dr. Duston, a general practitioner, had treated him \u201call these years\u201d for auricular fibrillation, \u201ca complication of his heart disease.\u201d Other doctors called in consultation in 1958 did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">(5) He was a hard worker and a vigorous campaigner, in his office substantially every day, usually by nine, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>arrived \u201chome . . . never until after seven ... on evenings that he did come home.\u201d He smoked cigars \u201cexcessively\u2019 \u2019 and his <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>eating habits were irregular. \u2019 \u2019 Anything \u201che did he did vigorously.\u201d There were times when he came home tired \u2014 and then he went to bed early. His doctor advised Mr. Fingold in June, 1958, \u201cnot to go to the office because he was in circulatory failure.\u201d Against the doctor\u2019s \u201cadvice . . . [Mr. Fingold] went to New Haven.\u201d The doctor then \u201cnoticed he had sort of an attitude of defeatism.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">(6) On July 16, Mr. Fingold \u201chad an attack in . . . [his] office\u201d in midafternoon. He had arrived about 8:30 a.m. looking \u201cpale, drawn,\u201d and had been holding conferences with assistants and other officials during the day. His doctor found him \u201cprostrate on a couch,\u201d with \u201csigns of having had a cerebral injury.\u201d At the hospital, he was treated by Dr. Neptune and Dr. Bradley, and examined by Dr. Lang of the Lahey Clinic. None of these doctors testified before the appeal board. He was discharged from the hospital on July 30, \u201cunable to speak clearly\u201d and \u201cto use his left eye. \u2019 \u2019 He had difficulty walking. The doctors advised him \u201cto have complete rest at home.\u201d For much of the period between July 30 and his death, he would make one trip downstairs each day. He saw at home a few people from his office, received his mail, and visited his doctor. After July 16, Mr. Fingold did not return to his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">(7) On August 30, Mr. Fingold returned from a boating party in Marblehead in the early afternoon. At 6:30 p.m. he went to a dinner and spoke for about twelve minutes to \u201ca large gathering\u201d in a \u201chot and sticky\u201d room. About 9:30 p.m. he went \u201cdirectly home.\u201d The next morning, while sitting in his garden about 11:30 a.m., he tried to get out of his chair, could not do so, and died suddenly.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">(8) Dr. Duston was asked a hypothetical question which assumed (a) \u201crheumatic heart disease . . . for more than seven years\u201d; (b) that Mr. Fingold \u201cwas under a great strain ... as Attorney General especially on the Old Colony case\u201d; (c) that \u201ctraveling back and forth to New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Haven\u201d and \u201cappearing in New Haven . . . weakened and exhausted him\u201d; (d) that he was hospitalized from July 16 to 30 after a \u201ccerebral embolism\u201d with a \u201cdiagnosis of rheumatic and valvular heart disease, mitral insufficiency, atrial fibrillation\u201d; and (e) that he died suddenly on August 31 \u201cfrom cerebral embolism.\u201d On these assumptions, Dr. Duston testified that Mr. \u201cFingold was more likely to suffer a cerebral accident when he was in a state of circulatory failure, than at any other time\u201d; that \u201ccerebral accidents are more likely to occur when the blood pressure is low\u201d; and that he (the doctor) believed that \u201cthe strain of his work aggravating his heart failure precipitated this cerebral accident.\u201d On cross-examination Dr. Duston admitted (a) that a man can have an embolism or a clot affixed to some part of the wall of the heart without any symptoms whatsoever and that the cause could not be told by anybody; (b) that he never saw Mr. Fingold\u2019s complete hospital record; and (c) that he did not know what Mr. Fin-gold\u2019s activities were on July 14, 15, and 16, and that, having that in mind, any opinion he gave was \u201cof necessity based at least in part on speculation and conjecture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">(9) Dr. Norman Welch, making essentially all the same assumptions already described in connection with Dr. Dus-ton\u2019s testimony, testified that in his opinion there was \u201ca relationship between the work which Mr. Fingold did and his death.\u201d Dr. Welch further stated that the \u201cevidence suggests to me that this man was not in good physical condition after . . . the New Haven . . . case . . . and . . . that this condition of poor health continued up until the time he was admitted to the hospital.\u201d He quite plainly rested his opinion in part at least on these matters which the evidence \u201c suggest [ed] \u201d to him. He also stated that \u201cwith a background of rheumatic heart disease and atrial fibrillation, stress and strain could be an important factor,\u2019\u2019 a factor \u201cgreater than a possibility.\u201d Dr. Welch admitted that he had not treated or examined Mr. Fingold when alive, that he never conferred at any time with any of the doctors who took care of Mr. Fingold at the hospital, and that he did not know what Mr. Fingold had done on any day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>from July 1 to July 16. He based bis opinion in part on the assumptions \u201cthat Mr. Fingold\u2019s health was not the same after the New Haven\u201d case, \u201cthat as a result of the New Haven case, Mr. Fingold was weak and exhausted,\u201d and that the \u201ccondition of weakness and exhaustion continued up until July 16. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The testimony summarized above does not amount to \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that the embolism from which Mr. Fingold died was \u201ca personal injury sustained ... as a result of, and while in the performance of, his duties at some definite place and . . . time,\u201d within G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 9 (1). The evidence that Mr. Fingold was \u201ctired\u201d on June 25 and thereafter is too vague to furnish basis for finding -that his condition was significantly different on June 25, 1958, after the Old Colony hearing, from what it was when he began work on that case in May. His work on the case was in no way unusual for a trial lawyer. Two of Mr. Fingold\u2019s assistants took the principal burden in these hearings. The conferences in chambers have not been shown to have involved special strain. The trial judge correctly concluded that the Old Colony case involved only \u201croutine court procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">This is a case in which medical testimony, entitled to probative value, is required in order to establish a causal connection between work and death. <em>Jacquot </em>v. <em>Wm. Filene\u2019s Sons Co. </em>337 Mass. 312, 318. See <em>LeBlanc\u2019s Case, </em>334 Mass. 265, 267. Cf. <em>Lovely\u2019s Case, </em>336 Mass. 512, 515-516. We agree with the trial judge that the somewhat vague and general answers to the hypothetical questions put to the doctors are without probative value, even if it be assumed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that medical science knows the relationship be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>tween work and the development of a thrombos or an embolism. The questions to Dr. Duston and Dr. Welch were each based upon assumptions not established in evidence. The answers are entitled to no weight. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>336 Mass. 609, 613-614. There is no adequate basis in the evidence for any assumption that Mr. Fingold \u201cwas under great strain in association with his work . . . especially on the Old Colony case\u201d or that his somewhat limited <em>\u2018 </em>appearances in court in New Haven . . . weakened and exhausted him\u201d or that any such weakness and exhaustion continued until July 16. \u2019 \u2019 There was little evidence of what Mr. Fingold did between June 25, when the court hearings in New Haven ended, and July 16. He was shown in June, 1958, to have been engaged in political and pre-primary convention activity, and to have received the convention\u2019s nomination for Governor. The record left to conjecture whether and to what extent his general heart condition after 1948, his office activity, his political activities, the natural deterioration in his physical condition as he grew older, and his tendency to lead a vigorous life were severally responsible for whatever weariness he showed in June and July. Testimony of Mr. Fingold\u2019s secretary that after the trips in June to New Haven Mr. Fingold was becoming tired all the time, . . . was always worried about getting back to the office,\u201d and described himself as \u201creally bushed,\u201d did not establish the cause of that weariness, or that work on the Old Colony case caused any significant change in Mr. Fingold\u2019s physical condition during May and June, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">4. The interlocutory decree overruling the demurrer and the final decree reversing the decision of the appeal board are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\"> Section 9 (1) reads in part: \u201cIf the board . . . finds that any member [of the system] in service died <em>as the natural and proximate result of a personal injury </em>sustained or a <em>hazard u/ndergone as a result of, </em>and <em>while vn the performance of, </em>his <em>duties at some definite place and at some definite ti/me </em>. . . without serious and wilful misconduct on his part, the payments . . . hereinafter referred to . . . shall be granted to his beneficiary ...\u201d (emphasis supplied). The meaning of this section in relation to heart disease was discussed in <em>Baruffaldi </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. </em>337 Mass. 495, 499-502.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\"> Dr. Howard B. Sprague, a well qualified cardiologist associated with the Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts General Hospital, testified in effect that it is totally unknown to medical science what causes a thrombos to form in the heart or an embolism to ensue. He had \u201cnever [before] heard stress and strain suggested as a cause of formation of clots in the . . . heart. \u2019 <em>\u2019 </em>In his opinion, the theory advanced in behalf of Mrs. Fingold had \u201cno justification whatsoever,\u201d and Mr. Fingold\u2019s work was \u201ctotally unrelated\u201d to the attack on July 16, 1958, and to his death. We need not determine, however, whether this theory must be disregarded because unknown to medical science and \u201ccontrary to common knowledge or common sense.\u201d See <em>Sevigny\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 747, 751-753.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
