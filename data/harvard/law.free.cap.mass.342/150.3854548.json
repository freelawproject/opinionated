This action of tort was referred to an auditor whose findings of fact were not to be final. He found for the defendant. A motion by the plaintiff to strike portions of the report was allowed. The ease was later tried before an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>other judge sitting with jury, who returned verdicts for the plaintiff. The only exception is to the action on the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The defendants contend that the judge\u2019s action on the report did not comply with G-. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 221, \u00a7 56, which provides in part: \u201cThe auditor\u2019s findings of fact shall be prima facie evidence upon such matters only as are embraced in the order; but the court at the trial shall exclude any finding of fact which appears in the report to be based upon an erroneous' opinion of law, or upon inadmissible evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The quoted language first appeared in St. 1914, c. 576, \u00a7 2. The phrase beginning, \u201cthe court at the trial shall exclude any finding,\u201d is a provision as to what the trial judge is to do in the nature of a ruling on evidence. It is not to be taken to preclude a judge before trial from acting upon a motion to strike part of the auditor\u2019s report. Orderly procedure often would require that a determination of the extent to which an auditor\u2019s report may be received in evidence should be made before the day of trial and even before final preparation for trial and the summoning of witnesses. This sequence is a matter of common sense and would enable a seasonable recommittal in an appropriate case. No motion to recommit was made in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\"What we have said also disposes of the defendants\u2019 argument that the judge acted without authority where the parts struck out were not \u201cbased upon an erroneous opinion of law, or upon inadmissible evidence.\u201d Those words are not applicable to a judge passing upon a motion to strike before trial. The matters struck were largely recitals of evidence which the auditor was not authorized to make.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It was a proper exercise of judicial discretion to delete them. A heavy burden rests upon a party who contends that he has been harmed by the granting of a motion to strike out statements of evidence voluntarily introduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>by an auditor into Ms report. <em>Davis </em>v. Noone, 341 Mass. 488, 490-491, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">An examination of the four parts of the report struck out shows that, in any event, the defendants were not harmed. The first two parts were narratives of some of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony on both direct and cross-examination. As to these, the defendants argue, \u2018 \u2018 The inconsistency and obvious endeavor to rationalize found in the plaintiff\u2019s testimony before the auditor may have been compelling and persuasive reasons for the auditor\u2019s conclusion.\u201d The tMrd part was, <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018 The above is substantially a resume of all the credible testimony given before me. \u2019 \u2019 TMs \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>credible \u2019 \u2019 testimony included that of the plaintiff wMch the defendants contend, and we agree, was inconsistent. On the face of the report, it could not all have been credible. In context, it was misleading. The fourth part was an introductory clause, namely \u201cBased upon the foregoing facts, and such inferences and conclusions as I am justified in drawing therefrom, having seen the witnesses and observed their demeanor and manner wMle giving testimony.\u201d This added nothing to the report, and its elimination subtracted nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">It is contended that \u201cthe action of the first judge was in effect a ruling on the admissibility of evidence to be offered at a later trial before a different judge, without knowing what the evidence would be at the later trial.\u201d In a sense it was, but that does not mean that we must accept the further contention that the first judge deprived the second judge of inherent power to use discretion and that he improperly restricted the jury trial. The record does not show what occurred at that trial with reference to the auditor\u2019s report; whether, for example, the defendants asked for any additional ruling in that respect. The second judge could have relied upon the ruling of the first judge as the law of the case. See <em>Papetti </em>v. <em>Alicandro, </em>317 Mass. 382, 385, 390; <em>Poland </em>v. <em>New Bedford, Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy., ante, </em>75, 79-80, and cases cited. On the other hand, he would not have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>obliged to apply the rule of the law of the case. <em>Gleason </em>v. <em>Hardware Mut. Cas. Co. </em>331 Mass. 703, 709-710. His was the power to act to the end that a just result be reached. <em>Falzone </em>v. <em>Burgoyne, </em>317 Mass. 493, 498, and cases cited. In his discretion, he could have revised the earlier ruling in any way which seemed proper to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\"> The rule was in the form prescribed in Buie 86 of the Superior Court (1954) : \u201cto hear the parties, examine their vouchers and evidence, state accounts, find the facts and report his findings to the court, together with such questions of law, arising in the course of his duty, as any party may request. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
