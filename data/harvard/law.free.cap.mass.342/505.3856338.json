L. c. 175. It has its home office and principal place of business here.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">Springfield is a member of American Foreign Insurance Association (AFIA) which develops for twenty-four member companies insurance business covering risks in certain foreign territory. AFIA acts as a foreign manager for Springfield in such territory and Springfield there insures risks through AFIA. In 1952, Springfield through AFIA entered into insurance covering risks in Hong Kong and Surinam and received from these risks in premiums $71,946.86 and $4,067.13 respectively. The contracts \u201cwere entered into through a foreign branch . . . of\u201d AFIA or through AFIA agents soliciting in foreign countries. \u201cPolicies were delivered\u201d by AFIA to each purchaser at his residence or place of business. Premiums were paid to AFIA and were deposited at the place of purchase to meet claims and expenses. Balances, after deducting normal operating costs, were transmitted to AFIA\u2019s home office to be distributed to its member companies, including Spring-field.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">Springfield was qualified to do business in Hong Kong and Surinam, neither of which imposes a gross premium tax or excise. AFIA paid in each place stamp taxes imposed upon documents of insurance as well as other documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">On February 27, 1953, Springfield filed its premium excise return, G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 25 (as amended through St. 1945, c. 721, \u00a7 4; see later amendment, St. 1953, c. 654, \u00a7 53), but did not include in computing the measure of the excise (see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>\u00a7 22, discussed infra) the 1952 premiums from risks in Hong Kong and Surinam. An additional 1953 excise of $2,189.20 was later imposed based upon the inclusion of these 1952 premiums within the measure of the 1953 excise levied under Gr. L. c. 63, \u00a7 22 (as amended through St. 1946, c. 387, \u00a7 l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Springfield applied for abatement of the additional excise contending \u201cthat the assessment based upon premiums for business written in foreign countries imposes an undue burden on foreign or interstate commerce and therefore violates\u201d art. 1, \u00a7 8, of the Federal Constitution. The State Tax Commission denied the application. Before the Appellate Tax Board, Springfield also contended that the additional excise was in violation of art. 1, \u00a7 10, cl. 2, and of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. The Appellate Tax Board entered a decision for the commission. Springfield appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">1. The history of the excise now imposed by G. L. C. 63, \u00a7 22 (see footnote 1, <em>supra), </em>reviewed in <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Boston Ins. Co. </em>328 Mass. 641, need not be repeated. The tax is \u201can excise upon the franchise of . . . a company as existing at a given date. \u201d <em>See Commissioner of Ins. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. </em>308 Mass. 385, 396. That case dealt with \u00a7 22, as appearing in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, but the same principles are applicable to the present \u00a7 22, despite more recent minor amendments. See St. 1945, c. 721, \u00a7 1; St. 1946, c. 387, \u00a7 1. It was recognized (at pp. 394-395) that the insurance excise was in nature and impact comparable to the excise on sav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ings banks originally also imposed by the same statute. See St. 1862, c. 224, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4, 8. Accordingly, the language in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Five Cents Sav. Bank, </em>5 Allen, 428, 437-438, describing the early savings bank excise, is applicable to the excise imposed under \u00a7 22, viz. \u201c [t]he subject to be taxed was the . . . existing value of the franchises . . . that is, the amount of benefit . . . which the charter . . . conferred on those who held it and enjoyed its privileges. . . . The excise is not laid on the business which each . . . [company] has transacted\u201d during a preceding period, but \u2018 upon the value of the franchise\u201d at the end of the period. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Provident Inst. for Sav. </em>12 Allen, 312, 314-315, affd. sub. nom. <em>Provident Inst. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>6 Wall. 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In the <em>Boston Ins. Co. </em>case, this court held that a domestic insurance company, which paid no premium tax in Canada on policies issued there, must include the premiums for such policies within the measure of the excise imposed by \u00a7 22, regardless of the circumstance that the company paid various license and registration taxes and fees in Canada. The court (at pp. 644-646) said that, under \u00a7 22 premiums of domestic companies are to be exempt only where \u201ca tax on [such] premiums\u201d is actually paid in another jurisdiction. \u201cThe purpose ... is to avoid double taxation.\u201d In the light of these decisions, we hold that under \u00a7 22 the measure of the franchise tax includes the additional premiums now in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">2. Springfield first submits that Massachusetts imposes an unconstitutional burden on interstate and foreign commerce by including within the excise measure premiums on Hong Kong and Surinam risks. For many years, in reliance upon <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>8 Wall. 168, 182-183, insurance contracts were regarded not as \u201cinter-state transactions\u201d but as \u201clocal transactions\u201d not constituting \u201ccommerce between the States.\u201d This view was unsettled by <em>United States </em>v. <em>South-Eastern Underwriters Assn. </em>322 U. S. 533, holding in effect that the Congress did not intend that insurance should be exempt from the operation of the Sherman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Act and that insurance was interstate commerce. The \u201cCongress then enacted the McCarran Act,\u201d now found in 15 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1011-1015 (1958). See <em>Insurance Co. of No. America </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>327 Mass. 745, 747-748. Pertinent provisions of the McCarran Act are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The purpose of the act was stated (House Rep. No. 143, 79th Cong. 1st Sess.) by the House Committee on the Judiciary. The committee pointed out that the <em>SouthEastern Underwriters </em>case had \u201craised questions ... as to the validity of State tax laws as well as State regulatory provisions; thus making desirable legislation by the Congress.\u201d The legislation was recommended \u201cso that the several States may know that the Congress desires to protect the continued regulation and taxation of the business of insurance by the several States.\u201d The committee said, however, that the legislation was not intended \u201cto clothe the States with any power to . . . tax . . . insurance beyond that which they had been held to possess prior to the\u201d <em>South-Eastern Underwriters </em>decision, hut announced that it desired to \u201cprovide for the continued regulation and taxation of insurance by the States, subject always, however, to the limitations set out in\u201d the controlling decisions of the Supreme Court, as, for instance, in <em>Allgeyer </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>165 U. S. 578, 591-593, <em>St. Louis Cotton Compress Co. </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>260 U. S. 346, 348, and <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>303 U. S. 77, 81-82, \u201cwhich hold, inter alla, that a State . . . [may] not . . . tax contracts of insurance . . . entered into outside its jurisdiction by . . . [persons] domiciled therein covering risks within the State,\u201d a situation different from that here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>In <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>328 U. S. 408, the Supreme Court held valid a South Carolina tax of three per cent upon premiums from interstate and local business done within that State by foreign insurance companies although no similar tax was imposed on South Carolina corporations. The court said (p. 427) that it was \u201cnot required to determine whether South Carolina\u2019s tax would be valid [under the commerce clause] in the dormancy of Congress\u2019 power. . .. Congress has expressly stated its intent... in the [Mc-Carran] Act.\u201d The court assumed (at p. 429) \u201cthat the tax would be discriminatory ... and that... [Prudential\u2019s] business ... [taxed] in South Carolina .. . [was] interstate commerce.\u201d It assumed also (p. 430) that the \u201cCongress . . . had full knowledge of the nation-wide existence of [S]tote systems of regulation and taxation; [and] of the fact that they differ greatly ... its purpose was ... to throw the whole weight of its power behind the [S]tote systems, notwithstanding these variations.\u201d The court, however, did not view the McCarran Act as necessarily validating \u201cevery . . . [S]tote .. . tax. For in all that mass of legislation must have lain . . . provisions . . . subject to serious question on the score of other constitutional limitations in addition to commerce clause objections arising in the dormancy of Congress\u2019 power.\u201d On these assumptions, the court held that the McCarran Act \u201cnecessarily was a determination by Congress that [S]tate taxes, which in its silence might be held invalid as discriminatory, do not place on interstate insurance business a burden which it is unable generally to bear or should not bear in the competition with local business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">We interpret the <em>Prudential </em>case (328 U. S. 408, esp. 427-430) as declaring that an excise measured by premiums, even if discriminatory, imposes no invalid or forbidden burden<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> upon interstate commerce, and as sustaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>the McCarran Act\u2019s affirmative authorization of such State taxes, notwithstanding any alleged burden upon interstate (or foreign) commerce, at least if they do not violate other constitutional limitations. This, in substance, is the view of the <em>Prudential </em>decision adopted in <em>Guardian Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>302 N. Y. 226, 240-241<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>. See <em>Wilburn Boat Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>348 U. S. 310, 316-321; <em>Federal Trade Commn. </em>v. <em>National Cas. Co. </em>357 U. S. 560, 562-565. See also <em>Maryland Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Cushing, </em>347 U. S. 409, 413, 436-437. Cf. <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Commn. </em>v. <em>Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co. </em>359 U. S. 65, 68; <em>Federal Trade Commn. </em>v. <em>Travelers Health Assn. </em>362 U. S. 293, 299-302.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">We are here concerned not with interstate commerce, but with an excise, measured in part by foreign premiums, which is alleged to burden foreign commerce. The commerce clause, the source of Congressional power to regulate insurance and its taxation, applies equally to \u201ccommerce with foreign nations, and among the several states. \u2019 \u2019 U. S. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. The language of the McCarran Act and the reasoning of the <em>Prudential </em>case are as appropriate to foreign commerce as to interstate commerce, and the act equally affects foreign and domestic commerce. If the insurance written for Springfield in Hong Kong and Surinam is foreign commerce, the McCarran Act leaves Massachusetts free to impose an excise, otherwise valid, measured by the premiums from that business.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The additional excise imposes no tax on either imports or exports in violation of the Federal Constitution. See art. 1, \u00a7 9, cl. 5 (\u201cNo tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state\u201d), and art. 1, \u00a7 10, cl. 2 (\u201cNo state shall, without the consent of the congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports . . .\u201d). Article 1, \u00a7 9, limits only the powers of the Congress, not those of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>States. See <em>Munn </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>94 U. S. 113, 136; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Chicago &amp; Pac. Elev. Co. </em>119 U. S. 388, 400; <em>Richfield Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, </em>329 U. S. 69, 76-77; <em>Empress Siderurgica, S. A. </em>v. <em>County of Merced, </em>337 U. S. 154, 156. See also <em>A. G. Spalding &amp; Bros. </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>262 U. S. 66, 69. Article 1, \u00a7 10, cl. 2, applies to the States, but has been interpreted principally as preventing taxes upon tangible goods which have so entered into or remained in the stream of foreign commerce as to be recognizable as imports and exports.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It also may apply to taxes on documents or activities essential to importation and exportation of goods, if the taxes are the equivalent of a direct tax upon the goods. See the <em>Richfield Oil Corp. </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 78-86. Cf. <em>Canton R.R. </em>v. <em>Rogan, </em>340 U. S. 511, 513-515. Cf. also <em>William E. Peck &amp; Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>247 U. S. 165, 173-175 (general Federal tax on net income from exporting) ; <em>National Paper &amp; Type Co. </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>266 U. S. 373, 376-377; <em>Barclay &amp; Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>267 U. S. 442, 447-451.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The additional excise is imposed upon Springfield\u2019s franchise. It is not a tax upon the tangible policy documents, if, indeed, they are shipped from Massachusetts to Hong Kong or Surinam, or directly upon the premiums themselves or the periodical transmission of the net premiums from the Orient to Springfield, or upon any export of Springfield\u2019s capital for employment in Surinam and Hong Kong. We see in the excise imposed by \u00a7 22 no such direct or indirect relation to imports or exports as would make relevant art. 1, \u00a7 10, cl. 2. We need not consider whether insurance can be . the subject of an export or whether, by the MeCarran Act, the Congress in any event has given its consent, within the meaning of art. 1, \u00a7 10, cl. 2, to the type of excise here imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">3. Springfield, contends that the additional excise, by in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>cluding within its measure gross premiums from foreign business, also violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution because such premiums are not subject to the \u201ccontrol and protection\u201d of this Commonwealth. We thus are asked to consider the validity of the Massachusetts practice, nearly a century old, in measuring its excise upon domestic insurance companies by gross premiums during a recent period (see St. 1862, c. 224, \u00a7 5) excluding, in order to avoid double taxation, those subjected to a premium tax elsewhere.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">States are permitted to make fair approximations of the value of franchises and privileges in imposing excises upon the corporations which they have created. See <em>State Tax Commn. </em>v. <em>John H. Breck, Inc. </em>336 Mass. 277, 300. See also <em>International Harvester Co. </em>v. <em>Evatt, </em>329 U. S. 416, 421-423, where the Supreme Court sustained an apportionment formula designed \u201cto arrive, without undue complication, at a fair conclusion as to what was the value of the intrastate business for which\u201d a foreign corporation was assessed an Ohio franchise tax. The court recognized (at p. 422) that, in comparable State tax situations, \u201c \u2018rough approximation rather than precision\u2019 is sufficient.\u201d For a franchise tax upon a domestic corporation many different, and not wholly precise, measures of franchise value have been held permissible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, some of these reflect values which the domiciliary State could not have taxed directly. See <em>Educational Films Corp. </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>282 U. S. 379, 388-392; <em>Pacific Co. Ltd. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>285 U. S. 480, 495-496; <em>Werner Mach. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number><em>Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Director of Div. of Taxn. </em>350 U. S. 492, 493-494. See also <em>Flint </em>v. <em>Stone Tracy Co. </em>220 U. S. 107,163-167.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The breadth of the States\u2019 power to tax the franchises of domestic corporations finds support in their power to tax their domiciliaries \u2019 income from sources outside the State and their intangibles held elsewhere; see <em>Maguire </em>v. <em>Trefry, </em>253 U. S. 12, 14-17 (affg. <em>Maguire </em>v. <em>Tax Commr. </em>230 Mass. 503); <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>286 U. S. 276, 279-281, and cases cited; <em>New York </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>300 U. S. 308, 312-315; <em>Greenough </em>v. <em>Tax Assessors, </em>331 U. S. 486, 490-497; and, perhaps also, in the power to impose death duties on the transfer of domiciliaries\u2019 intangible property reflecting out of State values. See <em>Curry </em>v. <em>McCanless, </em>307 U. S. 367, 363-374, esp. at 368; <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Schmidlapp, </em>315 U. S. 667, 662-665. See also <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>307 U. S. 383, 386-387; <em>State Tax Commn. </em>v. <em>Aldrich, </em>316 U. S. 174, 176-182; <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla, </em>357 U. S. 236, 246-247; Howard, State Jurisdiction to Tax Intan gibles, 8 Mo. L. Rev. 155. Even in respect of taxes treated essentially as property taxes (although some may have been excises), the Supreme Court has recognized that the State of incorporation has especially broad power to tax its corporate creatures. See <em>Cream of Wheat Co. </em>v. <em>Grand Forks, </em>253 U. S. 325, 328; <em>Northwest Airlines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>322 U. S. 292, 294; <em>Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>358 U. S. 450, 462-463 (which recognizes that apportionment formulae may work especially favorably to domiciliary States). See also <em>Miller Bros. Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>347 U. S. 340, 345. Cf. <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>342 U. S. 382, 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">We find in the decisions no due process barrier to this franchise tax upon a domestic insurance corporation in return for the benefits conferred in the charter. The record does not establish that including in the excise measure these premiums, not subjected to taxation elsewhere, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>unreasonable. Indeed, the record does not show that Springfield\u2019s own activities (as distinguished from those of AFIA), resulting in the production of these premiums, were not as intimately connected with home office executive direction as with its activities outside Massachusetts. Nothing contrary to our holding is suggested by <em>Shaffer </em>v. Carter, 252 U. S. 37, in this respect relied upon by Springfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">4. The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is affirmed. The State Tax Commission is to have costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-6\"> Section 22, as thus amended, reads, \u201cEvery domestic insurance company . . . [with exceptions not material] shall annually pay an excise of one per cent upon the gross premiums for all policies written or renewed, all additional premiums charged, and all assessments made by such company on policyholders during the preceding calendar year, exclusive of reinsurance; but such premiums and assessments for policies . . . for insurance ... of property or interests in other states or countries <em>where a tax is actually paid by such company, or its agents, shall not be so taxed\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). Springfield is a domestic company. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1. The tax imposed by \u00a7 22 is similar to, although by no means precisely like, premium taxes imposed by many other States. See Appleman, Insurance Law &amp; Practice, \u00a7\u00a7 10,581-10,592. The rate of the 1953 excise was increased to two per cent by St. 1951, c. 386, \u00a7 6. See St. 1959, c. 31, \u00a7 8.
