Cave is a party, brought on May 19, 1960, by Boxill, the natural son of Lillian A. Cave, to vacate a decree allowing her will. The will was dated May 18, 1928, and gave \u201call my property ... to my husband, Lewis A. Cave,\u201d and nominated \u201cmy said husband\u201d as executor. Lillian died July 30, 1946. Boxill caused an appearance to be entered for him in opposition to the allowance of the will. He also filed a petition for administration. This was dismissed on April 14, 1947, after Boxill had consulted with counsel and had been paid $1,500 from Lillian\u2019s estate, and had given written \u201cconsent to the allowance of . .\u2022 . [the] will and the appointment of . . . Cave ... as executor.\u201d The will was allowed on April 14, 1947, and Cave qualified as executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The petition to vacate was heard upon statements of counsel. - The probate judge filed a report of material facts, after entering a decree vacating the allowance of the will. The evidence (i.e. statements in lieu of evidence) is reported. The facts, so far as stated by counsel, do not appear to be in dispute. See <em>Worcester County Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Marble, </em>316 Mass. 294, 295. They are set out below on the basis of the report of material facts, supplemented by the statements of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u25a0Cave was married to a woman then living in the West Indies when he came here in 1910. His first wife died in 1923. Boxill was born in 1900, when Lillian was unmarried. In 1911 Lillian came to Boston from the West Indies. She lived here with Cave as man and wife, and together they worked, she as a cook and he as a butler, in the service of private families from 1911 to 1940. \u201cThey purchased real estate as husband and wife and ... were [so] introduced.\u201d In 1940 when Lillian was unable to work any longer, she and Cave went to Rhode Island where they went through a ceremonial marriage, he stating that he was a widower and she that it was her first marriage. Boxill\u2019s contention is that this marriage revoked Lillian\u2019s will made in 1928. The probate judge found that the 1940 marriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>was Lillian\u2019s first marriage and Cave\u2019s second. Cave died on July 27, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Boxill has not alleged or proved any ground for revoking the 1947 decree allowing Lillian\u2019s mil which would be a ground for a bill of review in equity. See <em>Stein </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>326 Mass. 767, 769. Cf. <em>Agricultural Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Bernard, </em>338 Mass. 54, 57. No mistake of fact, fraud, or other equitable ground has been established for vacating that decree. There is no basis in this record for any conclusion that revocation of the 1947 decree is appropriate to afford Boxill an opportunity to present a meritorious case which in 1947 he had no opportunity to present. See <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Remick, </em>333 Mass. 1, 9-10 ; Newhall, Settlement of Estates (4th ed.) \u00a7 28, and authorities there collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Where everything before the probate judge is before us and where he did not rely on any oral testimony, we are in the same position that he was, and have the same powers to determine facts and to exercise discretion. See <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Stanwood, </em>339 Mass. 549, 551. See also <em>Lowell Bar </em>Assn. v. <em>Loeb, </em>315 Mass. 176, <em>178; Gally, petitioner, </em>329 Mass. 143, 145. If any discretion now exists (see <em>Stein </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>326 Mass. 767, 769, <em>supra) </em>to revoke the 1947 decree, no occasion has been shown for exercising it.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">We do not find it necessary now to decide whether Lillian and Cave were married in 1928, or whether the 1928 will was in contemplation of a later marriage. See G. L. c. 191, \u00a7 9. The record adequately establishes that in 1947 there were obvious uncertainties as to Boxill\u2019s rights, when he consented to the probate of Lillian\u2019s mil, and that a reasonable basis existed for the decree then entered. Boxill in 1947, by the exercise of due diligence, could have presented the issues he now seeks to raise. He should not be allowed to raise them now by asking revocation of the decree then entered with his consent, even if, a matter which we need not decide, he is not now estopped to do so by his consent to the decree and waiver of appeal. See Page, Wills (3d ed.) \u00a7 623. See also <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>299 Mass. 166, 172. Cf. <em>Wyness </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>292 Mass. 461, 464; <em>Adoption of a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number><em>Minor, </em>338 Mass. 635, 642-643. Although there was no statutory compromise under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 204, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 15, the 1947 transaction has aspects of a compromise to which all possible finality should be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The decree is reversed. A new decree is to be entered dismissing Boxill\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
