The evidence appearing in the report to the Appellate Division is stated in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiff. On May 15, 1958, the plaintiff, who \u201cspeaks and understands little or no English, \u2019 \u2019 accompanied by her daughter, a nineteen year old college student who acted for her, left her mink coat for storage and repair with Halmor, Inc. (Hal-mor), a wholly owned subsidiary of Morton\u2019s Inc. She received a \u201cstorage receipt and contract\u201d on which appeared the name \u201cMorton\u2019s,\u201d and which limited the bailee\u2019s liability<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to $300, the coat\u2019s value as declared by the plaintiff. The plaintiff could have been protected up to a higher maximum by paying a storage charge equal to two per cent of whatever valuation she chose to place on the coat. The daughter translated at least some of the conversation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Wise, the representative of Hahnor, to her mother. The daughter knew what a minimum charge was and that her mother \u201cby paying a larger charge . . . could have more insurance.\u201d The plaintiff herself said hardly anything and did not understand that she could have insured the coat for a larger amount if she was willing to pay a higher charge, as her daughter failed to tell her.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u201cOn the same day\u201d on which the plaintiff\u2019s coat was left with Hahnor, it \u201cwas sent to the alteration shop . . . for the purpose of having the cuffs tacked. There is no evidence as to the whereabouts of . . . [the] coat after that time. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In the autumn of 1958, the \u201cplaintiff and her daughter . . . dropped in to Hahnor . . . and asked . . . [that] the coat\u201d be sent to them. \u201cThey were told that they would have it in about a week.\u201d Later the daughter was informed that there had been \u201cdifficulty in locating it. A thorough search was . . . made by both defendants, but . . . [the] coat could not be located.\u201d The plaintiff was tendered $300, \u201cthe claimed limit of liability, which [the] plaintiff refused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">At the trial the judge found for the defendant Morton\u2019s on a count for conversion of the coat, and for the plaintiff against Hahnor in the sum of $2,050 on count 2, a count for negligence, and on count 3, a count for conversion. The defendants filed requests for rulings, in essence (No. 1) that the plaintiff was bound by the contract, regardless of whether she read it, and by the limitation of liability therein, in the absence of fraud; (No. 2) that the document was a contract and not a cash receipt; and (No. 4) that there was no evidence supporting a finding for the plaintiff in excess of $300. Requests numbered 1 and 2 were denied as \u201cinapplicable to the facts found.\u201d Request numbered 4 was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The Appellate Division vacated the trial judge\u2019s findings for $2,050 on count 2 (negligence) and on count 3 (conversion) and ordered judgment for the plaintiff for $300 on count 2. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>1. We consider first the judge\u2019s refusal of request numbered 2, in effect that the \u201cstorage receipt and contract\u201d is a contract as a matter of law. \u201cWhere what is given to a plaintiff purports on its face to set forth the terms of a contract, the plaintiff, whether [s]he reads it or not, by accepting it assents to its terms, and is bound by any limitation of liability therein contained, in the absence of fraud,\u201d of which here there was no evidence. See <em>Kergald </em>v. <em>Armstrong Transfer Exp. Co. </em>330 Mass. 254, 255-256, where the relevant decisions are collected. See also <em>Polon-sky </em>v. <em>Union Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>334 Mass. 697, 701; <em>Mustard </em>v. <em>Eastern Air Lines, Inc. </em>338 Mass. 674, 676-677. The plaintiff is bound regardless of her ability to read. See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Santoianni, </em>330 Mass. 187, 193. In the <em>Ker-gald </em>case, it was also said that, where \u201cwhat is received is apparently a means of identification of the property bailed, rather than a complete contract, the bailor is not bound by a limitation upon the liability of the bailee unless it is actually known to the bailor. \u2019 \u2019 A baggage check was there held to be within the category of \u201cmeans of identification\u201d rather than a complete contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The \u201cstorage receipt and contract\u201d personally signed by the plaintiff was plainly so marked. Her signature appeared immediately below the words in legible capital letters \u201cI have read the reverse side hereof. \u2019\u2019 On the reverse side appeared the provisions already mentioned (see footnote 2). Above the figure of $300 inserted as the \u201cvaluation by customer\u201d on the front of the contract appeared the words \u201cliability not exceeding. \u2019\u2019 It could not properly have been ruled that this \u201cstorage receipt and contract\u201d was merely a \u201cmeans of identification. \u2019 \u2019 Requested ruling numbered 2 should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The plaintiff is concluded by the representation of her by her daughter, notwithstanding any failure or inability of her daughter to interpret the conversation with Wise accurately and fully. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vose, </em>157 Mass. 393, 394-395; Restatement 2d: Agency, \u00a7 14E. In the cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>cumstances, the plaintiff is also hound (see <em>Hannon </em>v. <em>Hayes-Bickford Lunch Sys. Inc. </em>336 Mass. 268, 273) by her daughter\u2019s testimony as to her understanding. Request numbered 1 should also have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">2. The parties contracted with respect to an agreed valuation of the bailed article. The plaintiff could have obtained a higher limit of liability by paying a higher rate. The daughter\u2019s testimony about her understanding of the contract shows that she realized the possibility of a higher insurance \u201cby paying a larger charge.\u201d In the circumstances, the limitation of liability in the storage receipt and contract is binding not only with respect to recovery on the contract of bailment but also with respect to recovery for ordinary negligence. This is the rule as to charges by carriers. See <em>Bernard </em>v. <em>Adams Exp. Co. </em>205 Mass. 254, 258-261; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R.R. </em>217 Mass. 203, 207; <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine R.R. </em>217 Mass. 274, 275; <em>Mustard </em>v. <em>Eastern Air Lines, Inc. </em>338 Mass. 674, 678; Restatement: Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 574, 575 (2). See also <em>Bigelow, Kennard &amp; Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>254 Mass. 53, 56-57. Cf. <em>Aradalou </em>v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R.R. </em>225 Mass. 235, 238, 242; <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Canadian Pac. Ry. </em>258 Mass. 372, 376-377. The doctrine of these cases is equally applicable to warehousemen and other persons providing storage facilities. See G. L. c. 105, \u00a7 10;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Samelson </em>v. <em>Harper\u2019s Furs, Inc. </em>144 Conn. 368, 371-373; <em>George </em>v. <em>Bekins Van &amp; Storage Co. </em>33 Cal. 2d 834, 845-848; Prosser, Torts (2d ed.) \u00a7 55, p. 307; Williston, Contracts (Rev. ed.) \u00a7 1046; Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7 1472 (see also \u00a7\u00a7 1068-1069). See also <em>Page </em>v. <em>Ace Van &amp; Storage Co. </em>87 Cal. App. 2d 294, 297-299; <em>Eckel </em>v. <em>Trencher Furs, Inc. </em>191 Misc. (N. Y.) 14, 15-16; Harper &amp; James, Torts, \u00a7 21.6, p. 1188, n. 14. Cf. <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Storage Warehouse Co. </em>219 Mass. 247, 249-250 (recovery permitted on oral contract of storage without consideration of later written agreement); <em>Taccetta </em>v. <em>Chauncey Rice &amp; Rogovin, Inc. </em>75 F. Supp. 373, 374 (S. D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>N. Y., apparently based on language of receipt); <em>Voyt </em>v. <em>Bekins Moving &amp; Storage Co. </em>169 Ore. 30, 47 et seq. It is generally recognized, however, that contractual limitations of liability do not protect a bailee or warehouseman against at least a wilful and intentional conversion for its own benefit. See <em>Menuez </em>v. <em>Julius Kindermann &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>19 F. Supp. 7, 8 (S. D. N. Y.); <em>Glinsky </em>v. <em>Dunham &amp; Reid, Inc. </em>230 App. Div. (N.

Y.) 273; <em>French </em>v. <em>Bekins Moving &amp; Storage Co. </em>118 Colo. 424, 429 (\u201cconversion must be by misfeasance\u201d and not by negligence to avoid limitation clause); annotation 99 A. L. R. 266. See also Bestatement: Contracts, \u00a7 575 (1); <em>Rappaport </em>v. <em>Storfer Bros. Inc. </em>2 Misc. 2d (N. Y.) 395, 396-397.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">3. We need not determine whether the evidence warranted a finding that Halmor was negligent or that (because it was acting as, or as agent for, a warehouseman) it had not satisfied the warehouseman\u2019s statutory burden of proof that it was not negligent, existing under G. L. c. 105, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This section provides that if a \u201cwarehouseman . . . fails to deliver the goods in compliance with a demand . . . accompanied [by certain tenders], the burden shall be upon . . . [him] to establish the existence of a lawful excuse for such . . . failure.\u201d See <em>Rudy </em>v. <em>Quincy Mkt. Cold Storage &amp; Warehouse Co. </em>249 Mass. 492, 493-495. See also <em>Denning Warehouse Co. </em>v. <em>Widener, </em>172 F. 2d 910, 912-913 (10th Cir.); <em>George </em>v. <em>Bekins Van &amp; Storage Co. </em>33 Cal. 2d 834, 839-840. Cf. <em>Bellows </em>v. <em>Worcester Storage Co. </em>297 Mass. 188, 192-193, referring to the common law rule as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>burden of proof of negligence or fault of a bailee; <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>244 Mass. 57, 61; <em>Sandler </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Station Co. </em>307 Mass. 470, 473; <em>National Dock &amp; Storage Warehouse Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>27 F. 2d 4, 6-8 (1st Cir.); <em>Castorina </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>290 N. Y. 445, 447-448; Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.) \u00a7 2508; McCormick, Evidence, \u00a7 309. Cf. also <em>Cargill, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commodity Credit Corp. </em>275 F. 2d 745, 751-753 (2d Cir.); annotation, 13 A. L. R. 2d 681, 685 et seq. Even if Halmor was liable for negligent loss of the coat, the limitation of liability would be applicable, either in an action on the contract of bailment or in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">4. The contract would not operate to limit Halmor\u2019s liability at least for a wilful conversion for Halmor\u2019s own benefit. If such a conversion has been established, the plaintiff could recover more than $300 on the count for conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The trial judge found that Halmor \u2018 \u2018 exercised complete dominion . . . over . . . [the coat] inconsistent with the plaintiff\u2019s title and that when it failed to return the coat upon . . . demand, it converted\u201d it. There was, however, no evidence sufficient to support a finding of conversion by any affirmative act of dealing with or misdelivery (cf. <em>Baer </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>261 Mass. 153, 154-155; <em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>Richards &amp; Hassen Enterprises, Inc. </em>172 F. 2d 464, 466 [2d Cir.]) or misappropriation of the coat by Halmor or by any agent of Halmor. See <em>George </em>v. <em>Bekins Van &amp; Storage Co. </em>33 Cal. 2d 834, 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">It is argued that Halmor committed a conversion when it obtained possession of the coat by a \u201ctacit representation that . . . [it] was operating its fur storage according to the laws of the Commonwealth.\u201d Halmor was not in fact licensed under G. L. c. 105, \u00a7 1 (as amended through St. 1935, c. 310, \u00a7 1), although its parent corporation, Morton\u2019s Inc., was a bonded warehouse, licensed under c. 105. Chapter 105, however, did not expressly purport to make acceptance of goods for storage by an unlicensed warehouseman in itself a conversion. At most it provided a penal sanction for violation of the statute. See G. L. c. 105, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>\u00a7 2; <em>Mezullo </em>v. <em>Maletz, </em>331 Mass. 233, 238-240. The trial judge incorrectly found a conversion on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The evidence did not warrant a finding that Halmor committed a conversion by obtaining possession of the coat by misrepresentation or deceit. It was not shown that in May, at the time of the deposit of the coat, Wise or Halmor made any false representation, that there was any intention to deceive the plaintiff, or that the plaintiff relied on any representation. Cf. Harper &amp; James, Torts, \u00a7 2.16. Cf. also <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>178 Mass. 397, 401-402; <em>Hagar </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>188 Mass. 47, 50; <em>Stadmiller </em>v. <em>Schirmer, </em>248 Mass. 244, 248-249; Restatement: Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 221 (b), 252, comment d.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">So far as the plaintiff relies to prove a conversion, as distinguished from a default under the contract of bailment, upon Halmor\u2019s failure to return the coat after demand, it must appear that Halmor still had the coat at the time of the demand in the autumn and was able to comply with the demand. See <em>De Young </em>v. <em>Frank A. Andrews Co. </em>214 Mass. 47, 50; <em>Premium Cut Beef Co. </em>v. <em>Karp, </em>318 Mass. 229, 230-231; <em>Marshall Vessels, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>331 Mass. 487, 489; Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 237, comment d; Prosser, Torts (2d ed.) \u00a7 15; Harper &amp; James, Torts, \u00a7 2.27. The only basis in the record for inferring that Halmor had the coat when demand was made was that the coat was in its possession on May 15, when it was received and sent to the sewing room, and that it could not be found. The report to the Appellate Division indicates that an unsuccessful search was made for it in the autumn but the report contains no detailed statement of the testimony about what Halmor did to discover and explain the cause and facts of the coat\u2019s disappearance. Whatever might have been the case if the period had been short, there Is in the circumstances slight basis for inferring that Halmor had the coat in the autumn merely because it had it in May. See <em>Mag-gio </em>v. <em>Zeits, </em>333 U. S. 56, 64-67. Considerations bearing against the reasonableness of such an inference (see <em>Jane-vesian </em>v. <em>Esa, </em>274 Mass. 231, 233; <em>Lioni </em>v. <em>Marr, </em>320 Mass. 17, 21) are the serious consequences to a bailee, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>criminal law and in terms of business reputation, if discovered refusing delivery of an item, actually in the bailee\u2019s possession, to one clearly entitled to its return.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The trial judge made no express finding that Halmor had the coat when demand was made. Indeed, it is not clear whether he directed his attention to that issue at all. The implication of one of his findings is that the coat was lost in or stolen from the sewing room because of Halmor\u2019s negligence. His finding \u201cthat thereafter the coat was never located\u201d seems inconsistent with any finding that Halmor had the coat when demand was made. We should, not imply, without a more specific statement to that effect by the judge, a finding of deliberate failure on Halmor\u2019s part to return to the plaintiff a coat actually in its possession to which she was clearly entitled, nevertheless, in a case involving summer fur storage where the coat ordinarily would not be redelivered until autumn, we cannot say that an inference that Halmor still had the coat in the autumn at the time of demand could not have been drawn in the absence of more explanation by Halmor about what in fact happened. Bequest numbered 4 could not have been given, because the limitation of liability would not have protected Halmor for a wilful failure to redeliver the coat if it had control of the coat when demand was made. In view, however, of the uncertainty, already mentioned, about the judge\u2019s findings, we cannot say that Halmor was not harmed by the erroneous rulings on requests numbered I and 2 as to the nature and effect of the storage receipt and agreement. The order of the Appellate Division is reversed. The findings for the plaintiff are vacated. It is ordered that there be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b270-10\"> Pertinent provisions of the contract included: \"3.
