An auditor, whose findings of fact were not final, found for the defendant. Thereafter there was a trial to a jury, at which the auditor\u2019s report was in evidence, and a verdict was returned for the plaintiff. The case is here on the defendant\u2019s exception to the judge\u2019s denial of his motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">The collision occurred in the afternoon of September 27, 1957, in Plainville on Route 1, a four lane road, running generally north and south. The operator of the plaintiff\u2019s car was driving north in the easterly lane and the defendant was driving south in the westerly lane. Neither car was proceeding at a speed which could be found improper. There was evidence that the defendant had attached to the rear of his car a two wheel \u201cbox\u201d trailer in which he was transporting a horse. As the two cars approached each other and were two or three car lengths apart this trailer or that part of it which contained the horse suddenly swerved across the road to its left and struck the plaintiff\u2019s car, causing substantial damage. After the accident the wheels of the trailer were found down an embankment on the westerly side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">The trailer weighed 350 pounds. It was about five feet wide and the sides of the box were five feet high. This box rested on two parallel three inch angle irons one quarter inch thick, which were seven feet long and extended the length of the trailer. Both angle irons were found broken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>after the collision. The trailer was connected with the motor vehicle which drew it by a so called \u201cstandard\u201d hitch.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The auditor found that the trailer \u201cbecame detached\u201d from the defendant\u2019s car; and that the cause of the accident was the breaking of the angle irons. He found that \u201cthe trailer hitch or hook and the coupling were properly fastened before the defendant started his trip\u201d and stated that he was \u201cunable to find that prior to the accident any part of the trailer was defective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">An expert called by the plaintiff testified without objection that the \u201cbox trailer was not properly constructed and he would not have built a trailer with a quarter inch angle iron,\u201d and that \u201cthe trailer hitch could not come off unless the defendant failed to tighten same in place before starting his trip.\u201d The defendant testified that he paid $145 for the trailer two or three months before; that its capacity was 1,000 pounds; and that he had used it two or three times a week to transport horses. The seven year old horse which he was carrying weighed approximately 800 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">There was no evidence introduced before the jury which would warrant a finding contrary to that of the auditor, namely \u201cthat the cause of the accident was the breaking of the angle bars on the trailer.\u201d This finding therefore has the \u201ccompelling effect\u201d of unrefuted \u201cprima facie evidence.\u201d Co<em>ok </em>v. <em>Farm Serv. Stores, Inc. </em>301 Mass. 564, 566. The mere breaking of the irons did not warrant a finding of negligence on the part of the defendant. <em>Zarrillo </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>317 Mass. 510, 512. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>299 Mass. 345, 348. If they were defective, and the auditor states that he was unable to find that they were, there was no evidence that the defendant knew or should have known of such defect. The testimony of the expert is not a sufficient base for charging the defendant with negligence. The expert admitted that he had not seen the trailer. His opinion that it \u201cwas not properly constructed\u201d and that \u201che would not have built a trailer with a quarter inch angle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>iron\u201d would not warrant a finding that it was unsafe to use it for transporting an 800 pound horse. The ease is governed by the decision in <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Bodkin, </em>300 Mass. 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ApsG\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
