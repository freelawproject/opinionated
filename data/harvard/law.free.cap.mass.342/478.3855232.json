He found for the plaintiff. Later tried to a jury on reservation by the defendant of the right to introduce further evidence (Rule 88 of the Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>[1954]) there were verdicts for the plaintiff. The judge then, on motion, entered verdicts for the defendant under leave reserved subject to the plaintiff\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The collision in question occurred on the morning of September 10,1967, at the intersection of Main and Morton streets in Andover. The plaintiff was driving her car westerly on Morton Street which was twenty-four feet wide. The defendant was driving a truck southerly on Main Street, a forty foot street. The vehicles collided approximately in the center of the intersection. The report of the auditor was in evidence. He found that the plaintiff entered the intersection first and that at the moment of contact her car was at a complete stop. The defendant was operating his truck at a speed greater than the established speed limit, and made no attempt to reduce its speed until it had entered the intersection. He could have seen the plaintiff before entering the intersection and \u201cshould by the exercise of reasonable care have prevented the collision.\u201d \u201c [T]he defendant was negligent and ... his negligence was a direct and proximate cause of the accident. . . . [The plaintiff\u2019s] failure to see the defendant\u2019s truck until after her car had entered the intersection was not due to any negligence on her part. . . . [A]t the time of the accident there was nothing on the windshield which would have interfered with her view of approaching traffic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The plaintiff testified that she stopped at a stop sign on Morton Street about two car lengths back from Main Street. She stopped again at the curb of Main Street. She was \u201ctaking it very slow\u201d because her vision was obscured somewhat by cars parked to her right on Main Street at the northeasterly curb about a car length from Morton Street. After stopping the second time she \u201cpulled out slowly\u201d and observed the defendant\u2019s truck about half a block away. She \u201cobserved traffic to her left and was slowly inching out when she saw the truck was almost upon her and applied the brakes.\u201d The point of contact was just over the middle line of Main Street. After the collision, skid marks on the road were observed thirty feet in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>length behind the truck and five feet in length behind the plaintiff\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">On cross-examination the plaintiff admitted that at the scene of the accident she said to both the defendant and a police officer that her windshield was covered with fog; that she did not see the defendant before the collision; and that the accident was her fault. 'She explained that she made the statements as \u201cnervous chatter\u201d which she said was a \u201ccontinuous thing\u201d from the time of the accident. On redirect examination she testified there was no fog on the windshield at the time the two vehicles came together and that she saw the defendant\u2019s vehicle prior to the impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">'The defendant contends that the statements to him and the police officer \u201cconclusively bar . . . [the plaintiff] from recovery as a matter of law, inasmuch as they constitute admissions of sole culpability on her part and, at the very least, contributory negligence in the operation of her motor vehicle.\u201d This contention cannot be sustained. The statements were evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence to be considered by the jury, but did not require a ruling that the collision was attributable to her fault. <em>Tully </em>v. <em>Mandell, </em>269 Mass. 307, 309. <em>Hartson </em>v. <em>Winship, </em>326 Mass. 380, 383. They were extrajudicial admissions, the probative value of which was to be weighed in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, and the subsequent testimony given by the plaintiff at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">There was evidence for the jury of the plaintiff\u2019s due care and the defendant\u2019s negligence. It was error to enter verdicts for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">\n<em>Judgments for the plaintiff on the verdicts of the jury.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
