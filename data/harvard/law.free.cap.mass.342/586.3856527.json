The cases were consolidated for trial. Certain facts were stipulated. The city offered evidence mentioned below which was excluded, subject to the city\u2019s exception. The trial judge found the facts to be as stated in the stipulation, ordered judgment for the defendant in each action, stayed all further proceedings, and reported \u201cthe cases, including the exclusion of the preferred testimony and the propriety of the orders of judgment,\u201d for the determination of this court. The facts are stated on the basis of the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Eeal estate (the locus) on Union Park Street in Boston was owned in fact and as of record by Dorothy Cordon from November 6, 1941, to December 31, 1952, and by Woodward Apartments, Inc. (Apartments), from December 31, 1952, to February 4, 1958. In their annual valuation list for each of the years 1948 to 1958, the assessors of Boston included the locus at a valuation of $34,500 and assessed a tax on the locus as of January 1 of such year to the owner on that date. During the middle part of each such year, the assessors committed their annual tax list (including the tax thus assessed) with their warrant to the collector, who thereafter made demand on the assessed owner for the payment of the tax together with any interest and costs. Each such tax remains unpaid, except so far as foreclosure of the tax title may have operated as payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">On June 28, 1950, by recorded instrument of taking, the Boston collector took (O. L. c. 60, \u00a7 53, as amended through St. 1933, c. 164, \u00a7 3<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) the locus for nonpayment of the 1948 taxes. Upon the city\u2019s books in the custody of its treasurer, there was set up a separate tax title account for the locus \u201cto which was charged . . . the . . . 1948 tax . . . and to which were subsequently added . . . upon certifica-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>tian\u201d (see G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 61, as amended through St. 1936, c. 93, \u00a7 1) the taxes for the years 1949 to 1956, inclusive. On February 4, 1958, upon a petition filed by the city on June 30, 1953, the Land Court entered a decree foreclosing (see G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 64 and \u00a7 65, as amended through St. 1938, c. 305; <em>Norwood </em>v. <em>Norwood Civic Assn. </em>340 Mass. 518, 522) all rights to redeem from the tax taking. At the time of the entry of this decree, neither the 1957 tax nor the 1958 tax had been certified under \u00a7 61, but this was subsequently done. During 1958 there was no material change in, or affecting, the locus.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">1. The first question for decision is whether any recovery sought is barred by the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The actions are brought under G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 35, as amended by St. 1946, c. 251, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See Nichols, Taxation in Massachusetts (3d ed.) pp. 381-382. Under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 57, both as amended through iSt. 1947, e. 522, \u00a7 1, and as later amended by St. 1949, c. 265, \u00a7 1, \u201cbills for real estate . . . taxes\u201d were to be sent out not later than June 14 of each year \u201cand shall be due and payable\u201d on July 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In the action against Dorothy Cordon the writ was dated more than six years after July 1, 1952, when the 1952 tax (the latest tax owed by her) became due and payable. If the six year statute of limitations contained in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2, as from time to time amended, is applicable to actions under G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 35, brought by Boston after the 1946 amendment, there can be no recovery in the action against her. The action against Apartments was brought within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>six years of the due date of each of the taxes recovery of which is sought in that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Prior to the 1946 amendment of \u00a7 35, the six year statute of limitations contained in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2, was applicable to an action by a collector under \u00a7 35. See <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Tuckerman, </em>121 Mass. 222, 223, and <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>241 Mass. 96, 99, where this result was reached with respect to the short statute of limitations applying to debts of a decedent, now found in G. L, c. 197, \u00a7 9, as amended by St. 1954, c. 552, \u00a7 1. Cf. <em>Milford </em>v. <em>Casamassa, </em>339 Mass. 702, 704-707. The city contends that the 1946 omission (see footnote 4, supra) from \u00a7 35 of the italicized words, \u201cin the same manner as for his own debt,\u201d was intended to make statutes of limitation governing actions by individuals inapplicable to actions under \u00a7 35. The last five words, thus omitted in 1946, were much relied upon in 1876 in <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Tuckerman, </em>121 Mass. 222, 223, in reaching the conclusion that statutes of limitation generally applicable to actions against administrators applied to actions brought under Gen. St. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 19, 20, which in part were predecessors of G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 35, and contained language similar to that found in \u00a7 35 prior to the 1946 amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">If the 1946 amendment was intended to make actions under \u00a7 35 no longer subject to statutes of limitation, that intention is not clearly expressed. The legislative history of the 1946 amendment<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> gives little support to the city\u2019s contention. The reasons for the 1946 change in the particular language of \u00a7 35 upon which the city relies \u201care too obscure to justify much reliance on . . . [it] as an aid to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>interpretation.\u201d See <em>Milford </em>v. <em>Casamassa, </em>339 Mass. 702, 707. If the Legislature had intended such an important change in the effect of \u00a7 35 as that suggested by the city, it would have been natural for it to express its intention plainly. Cf. situation considered in <em>State Tax Commn. </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>341 Mass. 555, 561. We hold that the statute of limitations contained in c. 260, \u00a7 2, as amended, bars any recovery in personam against the defendant Gordon on her personal liability, even though hens for such taxes, otherwise valid, may be enforced against the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">2. Recovery of the 1957 and 1958 taxes from Apartments is not barred by the foreclosure of the tax title on February 4, 1958. These taxes were not certified by the city collector to the city treasurer under G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 61 (as amended through St. 1936, c. 93, \u00a7 1), until after the foreclosure decree. On the date of the decree they formed no part of the tax title account. Their certification after February 4, 1958, did not operate to extinguish Apartments\u2019 personal liability for these taxes. See <em>Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>318 Mass. 183, 186-190. Until the decree of foreclosure, Apartments could have redeemed the locus from the tax title (see \u00a7 61) upon payment \u201cof the tax for which the estate was . . . taken and of such subsequent taxes <em>as shall have been . . . certified, </em>together with costs and interest\u201d (emphasis supplied). The city\u2019s tax title until foreclosure under \u00a7\u00a7 64 and 65 in effect was security for the payment of the amount in the tax title account from time to time. The foreclosure had no effect upon personal liability for later taxes not certified on or before the date of the decree. The collector was not thereby deprived of his alternative remedy by suit under \u00a7 35 to collect the 1957 and 1958 taxes. The statutory remedies for collection of the tax are cumulative. See the <em>Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at p. 188. See also <em>Boston </em>v. <em>DuWors, </em>340 Mass. 402, 404. The city, upon the facts found, is entitled to recover the 1957 and 1958 taxes from Apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>3. We next consider whether foreclosure of the tax title operated as complete payment of the taxes and other items then charged to the tax title account. Although, under G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 37 (as amended through St. 1943, c. 478, \u00a7 1), \u201cthere is a lien upon the land for the assessed tax, the primary liability to pay is upon the person assessed. \u2019 \u2019 See <em>Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>318 Mass. 183, 188. The various methods set out in c. 60 of enforcing the tax or the lien (see Nichols, Taxation in Massachusetts [3d ed.] pp. 369-424; Hardy, Municipal Law &amp; Practice, \u00a7\u00a7 910-931; Swaim, Cracker\u2019s Notes on Common Forms [7th ed.] \u00a7\u00a7 971-984), viz. by demand (c. 60, \u00a7 16), distress (\u00a7 24), imprisonment (\u00a7 29), suit (\u00a7 35), or sale or taking (\u00a7\u00a7 37-65), are all subsidiary to and in aid of the enforcement of the primary liability. The foreclosure (see \u00a7\u00a7 65, 69, 69A) of a tax title obtained by a taking (under \u00a7 53) merely applies to that liability the security afforded by the tax title. Although the collector obtains credit upon his bond under \u00a795 (as amended through St. 1949, c. 202) for \u201cthe amount of the taxes and costs, charges and fees where land has been purchased or taken by the town for non-payment of taxes; and upon certification in accordance with\u201d \u00a7 61, for \u201cthe amount of subsequent taxes which have become part of the terms of redemption in any tax title held by the town,\u201d these circumstances (see <em>Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at p. 189) are \u201cmere . . . internal municipal regulation not affecting the rights of the city against a taxpayer in default.\u201d- Nothing in the statutes purports to make the foreclosure of the tax title either a conclusive election by the city to use one only of its cumulative remedies, or, in the case of a taking under \u00a7 53,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>satisfaction of the taxes and charges certified under \u00a7 61 for which the tax title has been security.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The foreclosure of a tax title is analogous to the foreclosure of a mortgage by entry. See G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 1. See also <em>Grabiel </em>v. <em>Michelson, </em>297 Mass. 227, 229; <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>310 Mass. 400, 403-404. That a deficiency (existing after realizing upon the security) may be recovered in respect of a mortgage lends support to permitting recovery of a similar deficiency existing after foreclosure of a tax title. \"When a mortgagee takes possession by entry his act is comparable to a town\u2019s taking of a tax title under c. 60, \u00a7 53. \"When a mortgage is foreclosed by entry and possession for three years, the mortgage debt is discharged <em>\u201cto </em>the extent of the value of the land at that time.\u201d See <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>110 Mass. 458, 460; <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>117 Mass. 439, 441; <em>Hadley Falls Trust Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>110 F. 2d. 887, 889 (1st Cir.), reversing in part 22 F. Supp. 346, 351-352 (D. Mass.). See also Swaim, Crocker\u2019s Notes on Common Forms (7th ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 580-583, 588-589, 591. If the mortgagee is not satisfied, he may recover any deficiency, although under G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 36, the foreclosure is thereby reopened.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Joyner </em>v. <em>Lenox Sav. Bank, </em>322 Mass. 46, 54. If, however, there is compliance with G. L. c. 244, \u00a7\u00a7 17A-17C (inserted by St. 1945, c. 604, \u00a7 1), deficiencies in satisfying the mortgage debt may be recovered whether foreclosure is as a result of entry or by sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">\"We hold that foreclosure of the tax title to the locus operated to discharge the liabilities then reflected in the tax title account only to the extent of the fair market value of the locus on the date of the foreclosure decree. It follows that the city was entitled to introduce (a) competent opinion evidence that the fair market value of the locus was $7,500, on the date of the foreclosure decree, February 4, 1958, and (b) evidence of the actual sale of the locus for $7,500 on July 15, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The trial judge\u2019s report indicates that the expert wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>ness was qualified. The sale would be relevant, since it was agreed that no change affecting the locus took place during 1958. The exclusion of each piece of evidence was prejudicial error. See <em>Brigham </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>113 Mass. 538, 540-541; <em>Atherton </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>199 Mass. 199, 210; <em>Tremont &amp; Suffolk Mills </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>271 Mass. 1, 14-15; Nichols, Taxation in Massachusetts (3d ed.) pp. 213, 304-306. See also <em>Brush Hill Dev. Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>338 Mass. 359, 364-365.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Apartments, relying upon <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Lewitsky, </em>333 Mass. 379, 381, contends that it would be improper to permit the city to present testimony that land, which was assessed for $34,500 as of January 1, 1958, had a market value of only $7,500 on February 4, 1958, the date of the foreclosure decree. Assessors are public officers and not the agents of the city. See <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Segee, </em>206 Mass. 380, 382. Their acts are not admissions conclusive upon the city in this situation. The city\u2019s position involves no inconsistency which would require the exclusion of evidence of market value. Of course, the finder of the facts should properly give substantial weight to the circumstance that one group of public officers (the assessors) is contending that the value of land is high when it is to the city\u2019s advantage so to contend, and that the city represented by its collector is taking a contrary position when that is to the city\u2019s advantage. This action for collection of taxes is not the proper litigation in which to test, for assessment purposes, the correctness of the assessors\u2019 valuations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nevertheless, in proceedings to collect taxes, assessments upon which those taxes are based should be admitted in evidence where it is necessary to show (for a purpose connected with those taxes) the fair cash or market value of the assessed property as of a date reasonably close to the assessment day. See <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Heffron, </em>102 Mass. 148, 151-152; <em>Bay State Wholesale Drug Co. </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>280 Mass. 188, 191-192. See also <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>330 Mass. 487, 488-489. Cf. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Brookline Redev. Authy. ante, </em>418.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">4. In view of what has been said, the city is entitled to maintain its action against Apartments for (a) the amount of the items reflected in the tax title account for which Apartments is personally liable, together with interest and costs related to those items, <em>less </em>(b) that portion of the fair market value of the locus on the date of the foreclosure decree which is properly to be applied to payment of the items for which Apartments is personally liable. It thus becomes necessary to determine the basis for application of the fair market value of the locus on the date of foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The most pertinent statutory provision is G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 43 (as amended through St. 1935, c. 236<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>), the last sentence of which was added by St. 1935, c. 236. The amendment was recommended (see 1935 House Doc. No. 10, pp. 5-6) by the Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation, \u201cto make . . . unmistakable upon the collector\u2019s sale . . . the order of distribution of money received upon sale by the municipality or redemption.\u201d Difficulty had apparently been encountered in determining \u201cpriority of title or the disposition of funds upon sale.\u201d It seems that the amendment was intended to provide definitely \u201cthe sequence in which the proceeds were to be applied.\u201d See Nichols, Taxation in Massachusetts (3d ed.) p. 395. If in \u00a7 43, as quoted in footnote 9, <em>supra, </em>the italicized words \u201cin the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>order in which they were committed to the collector\u201d are construed as applying to the \u201ctaxes assessed on account of the municipality\u201d (mentioned in the section after the word \u201cfirst\u201d) as well as to \u201cany district taxes\u201d (mentioned following the word \u201csecond\u201d) the statutory priorities will he clear and complete. The italicized words were inserted by the House Committee on Bills in the Third Beading when it substituted 1935 House Bill No. 2012 for an earlier draft of the 1935 Act (1935 House Doc. No. 21; see 1935 House Journal, p. 806). There is no apparent practical reason, or explanation in the legislative history, for making the <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>order in which they were committed to the collector \u2019 \u2019 applicable to district taxes and not to municipal taxes, if such a differentiation was intended. Although the punctuation and language are ambiguous, the amendment as a whole indicates that the Legislature intended to provide a comprehensive program of priorities for dealing with the proceeds of redemptions, foreclosures, and later sales of foreclosed land, and that within each category of taxes all such proceeds were intended to be applied in the same sequence. Any other interpretation would leave the matter confused and uncertain so far as it relates to municipal taxes. Accordingly, we hold that the fair market value of the locus on February 4, 1958, is to be applied first to the municipal taxes reflected in the tax title account in the chronological order of their commitment to the collector. The purpose of the statute, as stated above, makes inapplicable the general rules of interpretation discussed in <em>Selectmen of Topsfield </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn. </em>324 Mass. 309, 312-313, and in <em>Iannelle </em>v. <em>Fire Commr. of Boston, </em>331 Mass. 250, 252-253. The case of <em>Chadwick </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>230 Mass. 580, 582-583, which was discussed at the arguments, has been affected by the amendments now found in \u00a7 61, and is not a controlling guide to the sequence of application of the value of the locus as of the date of the foreclosure of the tax title. See Nichols, Taxation in Massachusetts (3d ed.) pp. 415-416; 30 Mass. L. Q. No. 2, pp. 42-48. See also <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>315 Mass. 572, 575 et seq.

Where a town purchases the tax title at a tax sale (see \u00a7 48, as amended through St. 1933, c. 325, \u00a7 5), the statutory treatment of the taxes and charges constituting the town\u2019s purchase price in substance amounts merely to setting up the tax title account as a matter of town bookkeeping.

L. c. 60, \u00a7 69A (see also \u00a7\u00a7 69, 76), perhaps because of the special public interest in the complete and effective collection of taxes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b632-6\"> The taxpayer\u2019s exclusive remedy to obtain a reduction of his assessment is by proceedings under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59 (as amended through St. 1946, c. 199, \u00a7 1), and related statutory provisions. Cf. situation with respect to a void tax discussed in <em>Norwood </em>v. <em>Norwood Civic Assn. </em>340 Mass. 518, 523-524. A taxpayer cannot raise overvaluation as a defence to a petition to foreclose a tax title. See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>DuWors, </em>339 Mass. 773; <em>Boston </em>v. <em>DuWors, </em>340 Mass. 402, 404. The city\u2019s interest in a correct assessment should be protected by correct and intelligent assessment in the first instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\"> Section 43, as amended, provides that, in connection with a tax sale, the \u2018\u2018 collector, on behalf of such municipality and district [i.e. a taxing district wholly or partly within the municipality] . . . shall make a single . . . taking . . . for all unpaid taxes [i.e. all taxes which constitute a lien on the land assessed and which are lawfully placed upon the tax bill] ....
