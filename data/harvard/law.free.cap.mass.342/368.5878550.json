Wilkins, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"ahj-dedup-0\">The plaintiff and the defendant are licensed wholesalers of cigarettes under GK L. c. 64C, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>serted by St. 1945, c. 547, \u00a7 1, and are \u201cin competition with each other and a large number of other wholesalers within the Commonwealth.\u201d This bill in equity under GL L. c. 231A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 582, \u00a7 1, is brought for a declaratory decree as to the construction of certain provisions of Gr. L. e. 64C, as amended, prescribing the minimum price at which cigarettes may be sold at wholesale. The case was heard on agreed facts. The judge entered a decree declaring that in computing the minimum price a wholesaler must add the State cigarette tax <em>after </em>he has applied the markups of 2% and %% provided by c. 640, \u00a7 13 (c), to the invoice price paid by him to the manufacturer. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The parties and other wholesalers offer for sale to retailers substantially the same brands of cigarettes, and the price at which each wholesaler so offers his cigarettes is the principal factor in the determination of a particular retailer\u2019s choice among them. Under \u00a7 25 of c. 640, as originally inserted by St. 1945, c. 547, \u00a7 1, the Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation periodically issued rulings prescribing that the State cigarette tax be added to the wholesalers\u2019 invoice cost <em>before </em>adding the wholesalers\u2019 markups.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">By St. 1956, c. 354, \u00a7 11, it was provided that the cigarette excise tax inaugurated in c. 640 \u201cshall conclusively be presumed to be a direct tax on the retail consumer, pre-collected for the purpose of convenience and facility only.\u201d The purpose of this act was to make the cigarette excise tax paid by a consumer \u201can allowable deduction under \u00a7 164 (c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.\u201d Statute 1956, c. 720, \u00a7 1, amended c. 640, \u00a7 6, by providing compensation to the wholesaler for services rendered in collecting the tax. The commissioner<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has never changed the ruling under \u00a7 25, although he was notified by the defendant on December 9, 1959, that its wholesale price would thereafter be computed by adding the excise tax after and not before adding the wholesalers\u2019 markups to the invoice cost. The effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>this change of method was to reduce the computed minimum selling price by two cents a carton. From the enactment of c. 640 in 1945 until December, 1959, the wholesalers in this Commonwealth, without known exception, used a selling price computed by adding the excise tax to the invoice cost prior to adding the wholesalers\u2019 markups.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u201cWhen declaratory relief is sought, all persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration, and no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding.\u201d G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 8. It is clear that in any event the State tax commission has an interest which would be affected. The amendment of c. 64C, \u00a7 25, by St. 1953, c. 654, \u00a7 86, provides: \u201cThe administration of this chapter is vested in the commissioner. All forms necessary and proper for the enforcement of this chapter shall, with the approval of the state tax commission, be prescribed and furnished by the commissioner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state tax commission may prescribe regulations and rulings, not inconsistent with law, to carry into effect the provisions of this chapter, which regulations and rulings, when reasonably designed to carry out the intent and purpose of this chapter, shall be prima facie evidence of its proper interpretation.\u201d At the present moment a ruling issued by a previous commissioner and still outstanding is in direct conflict with the ruling of the judge, who may have relied upon one or more subsequent legislative amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">We are satisfied that any declaration which we might make would not end the controversy. See G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 3; <em>National Shawmut Bank </em>v. <em>Morey, </em>320 Mass. 492, 497. With the commission not a party, there is no need to give independent consideration to the extent of any interest of the \u201clarge number of other Avholesalers within the Commonwealth\u201d or of retailers.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">This is not an appropriate case in which to state views <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>not necessary to the decision, as in <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>313 Mass. 722, 731, and similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The decree is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court, where the plaintiff may within thirty days from rescript seek such amendment to its pleading as it may he advised. Otherwise the hill is to he dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\"> The agreed facts give no heed to the fact that under c. 64C, \u00a7 25, as amended by St. 1953, c. 654, \u00a7 86, the State tax commission has superseded the commissioner in the performance of the duty to prescribe \u201cregulations and rulings. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-8\"> One of the amendments to c. 64C, \u00a7 25, made by St. 1953, c. 654, \u00a7 86, was to strike out in line 4 the word \u201ccommissioner\u201d and to insert in its place the words \u201cstate tax commission.\u201d The word \u201ccommissioner\u201d appears twice in line 4. It is obvious that it is the word \u201ccommissioner\u201d only as it appears the second time in line 4 to which the amendment applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
