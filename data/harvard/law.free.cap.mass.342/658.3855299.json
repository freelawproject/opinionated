All the facts are agreed, and the case is reported without decision by a judge of the Superior Court. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The questions sought to be raised relate to Gr. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28A (as amended through St. 1959, c. 492, \u00a7 2), which provides: \u201cWhoever imports, prints, publishes, sells or distributes a pamphlet, ballad, printed paper, phonographic record, or other thing which is obscene, indecent or impure, or an obscene, indecent or impure print, picture, figure, image or description, or buys, procures, receives or has in Ms possession any such pamphlet, ballad, printed paper, phonograpMc record, obscene, indecent or impure print, picture, figure, image or other thing, for the purpose of sale, exMbition, loan or circulation, shall be pumshed by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than five years or in a jail or house of correction for not more than two and one half years, or by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five thousand dollars, or by both such fine and imprisonment in jail or the house of correction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">On October 18, 1960, the plaintiffs were arraigned in the District Court of Springfield upon complaints, each charging one of them (1) with having sold \u201ca certain pamphlet, printed paper and tMng, to wit, a magazine known as . . . [giving the name] which was and is obscene, indecent and impure,\u201d and (2) with having it in possession \u201cfor the purpose of sale.\u201d The plaintiffs pleaded not guilty. On October 26 they were tried on agreed facts, and the cases were continued without a finding pending the determination of the present controversy. The agreed facts were these. The allegations in the complaints are true, namely, that each plaintiff sold a magazine wMch was obscene, indecent, and impure witMn the meamng of the statute or had possession of the magazine for the purpose of sale. The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>tiffs are proprietors of newsstands wMeh sold and had for sale one hundred or more different \u201ctitles\u201d or kinds of magazines in addition to newspapers, pocket book editions, and othey literature. There was no allegation or proof that they had knowledge of the contents of \u201cthe magazines in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">One question reported is whether G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28A (as amended through St. 1959, c. 492, \u00a7 2), violates the First Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States or art. 16 of the Declaration of Rights. Its answer calls for a determination whether \u00a7 28A requires scienter as an element of the crime. We note that the word \u201cmagazine\u201d does not appear in \u00a7 28A. We also note that a magazine as closely resembles a book, which is the subject of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28B (as amended through St. 1959, c. 492, \u00a7 2<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>), as it does a \u201cpamphlet, printed paper and thing,\u201d a phrase which we quote from the complaints. The plaintiffs point out that \u00a7 28B, which was enacted with \u00a7 28A in the same section of St. 1959, c. 492, contains the phrase, \u201cknowing it to be obscene, indecent or impure. \u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In an ordinary case this factor might be persuasive. It cannot, however, be allowed to prevail over the principle that where a statute may be construed as either constitutional or unconstitutional, a construction will be adopted which avoids an unconstitutional interpretation. <em>Worcester County Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Banks, </em>340 Mass. 695, 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">We observe that the Legislature in the amendment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 30, by St. 1956, c. 724, \u00a7 1, relating to the distribution of certain literature to a child under the age of eighteen, clearly spelled out' an intention that scienter is not an element of that crime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The majority opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>California, </em>361 U. S. 147, 152, has indicated that legislation, even if aimed at obscene matter, may by dispensing with any requirement of knowledge on the part of the seller impinge upon the public\u2019s access to constitutionally protected matter. Although the <em>Smith </em>case dealt with a book, the constitutional theory must be the same when applied to a magazine. We do not accept as a valid distinction the defendants\u2019 argument: \u201cThis was not a hard-cover publication, but rather a \u2018magazine,\u2019 which is generally known to be of at least doubtful character.\u201d Accordingly, we construe \u00a7 28A as if it contained the words \u201cknowing it to be obscene, indecent or impure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Cases elsewhere support the result we reach. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>State, </em>125 So. 2d 560 (Fla.). <em>People </em>v. <em>Finkelstein, </em>9 N. Y. 2d 342. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>224 Ore. 337. But see <em>State </em>v. <em>Gump, </em>57 Wash. 2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">No separate discussion of art. 16 of the Declaration of Rights is required. Other questions reported need not be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The Commonwealth raises no question as to being made a party. Indeed the Attorney General has entered a general appearance. In <em>Executive Air Serv. Inc. </em>v. <em>Division of Fisheries &amp; Game, ante, </em>356, 357-358, we recently held that declaratory proceedings under G. L. c. 231A will not lie against the Commonwealth. The present situation differs from one where the Legislature has provided for proceedings to which the Commonwealth is authorized to become a party. See <em>Franklin Foundation </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>340 Mass. 197, 203. The issues are fully presented by the defendant members of the police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>A decree is to be entered declaring that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28A (as amended through St. 1959, c. 492, \u00a7 2), is not in violation of the First Amendment or the Fourteenth Amend - ment to the Constitution of the United States or of art. 16 of the Declaration of Eights.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\"> \u201cWhoever imports, prints, publishes, sells, loans or distributes, or buys, procures, receives, or has in his possession for the purpose of sale, loan or distribution, a book, knowing it to be obscene, indecent or impure, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than five years or in a jaU or house of correction for not more than two and one half years, or by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five thousand dollars, or by both such fine and imprisonment in jail or the house of correction.\u201d The parties in their stipulation as to facts filed on December 28, 1960, did not refer to the amendment to \u00a7 28B by St. 1960, c. 311, approved April 12, 1960, effective ninety days thereafter.
