(Bobin-son), as principal and the defendant American Surety Company (American) as surety. From an order sustaining the defendants\u2019 demurrer the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">The averments of the declaration in substance are \u2022 as follows: On April 25, 1956, Bobinson as principal and American as surety executed and delivered to the city of Beverly a bond in the penal sum of $35,000 \u201cconditioned upon the performance by . . . [Bobinson] of an agreement with the city ... to make certain improvements to land ... in accordance with definitive plans and specifications for a subdivision of land submitted to and approved by the planning board of said city.\u201d The bond, although running to the city, also provided that it was \u201cmade for the use and benefit of all persons . . . who may hereafter purchase lots upon any of said plans, and they and each of them are hereby made obligees hereunder, . . . and they and/or each of them may proceed or sue hereon.\u201d Belying on the bond, the plaintiff purchased several lots in the subdivision. Robinson, however, \u201cdid not faithfully perform all of the terms and conditions imposed by the planning board.\u201d Thus the obligations of the bond were not fulfilled and the plaintiff has sustained substantial damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>One ground of demurrer was that \u201cin so far as . . . [the] bond purports to confer the benefits thereon to persons other than the . . . city of Beverly . . . [it] is unenforceable . . . [since] the city . . . exceeded its statutory authority\u201d under Gr. L. c. 41. The demurrer was rightly sustained on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">At the time the bond was delivered the relevant portions of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U (inserted by St. 1953, c. 674, \u00a7 7), provided that \u201cBefore approval of a [subdivision] plan by a planning board it may require provision for the construction of ways and the installation of municipal services in accordance with its rules and regulations, and may specify the time within which such construction and installation shall be completed, <em>with proper bond, </em>or, at the election of the applicant, the deposit of money or negotiable securities, sufficient, in the opinion of the board, to secure performance\u201d (emphasis supplied). The statute does not define or explain the words \u201cproper bond\u201d; nor does it make any further reference to the provisions for security. Although there are no express provisions with respect to enforcement of the bond in \u00a7 81U, an examination of the statutory pattern shows that private enforcement of the bond by one in the position of the plaintiff is inconsistent with the general purpose of the law as well as with the powers given the planning board.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81M, it is declared that the \u201csubdivision control law . . . [was] enacted for the purpose of protecting the safety, convenience and welfare of the inhabitants of the cities and towns ... by regulating the laying out and construction of ways in subdivisions providing access to the several lots therein, but which have not become public ways, and ensuring sanitary conditions in subdivisions.\u201d The law is thus designed primarily to benefit the inhabitants of cities and towns generally and those who purchase lots in developments only secondarily. By \u00a7 81U the planning boards were empowered to \u201capprove, modify and approve, or disapprove\u201d plans, to require the construction of ways and the installation of municipal services, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>to specify the time within which this work should be completed. Upon completion of this work, the boards were required to issue certificates of performance which may be recorded. This, we think, manifests a legislative intent that the planning boards were to have the primary responsibility for administering the subdivision control law and thus safeguard the declared paramount interests of the community as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Our belief in the correctness of this interpretation is confirmed by subsequent amendments to \u00a7 81U which indicate the type of enforcement that was originally intended. See <em>Lubell </em>v. <em>First Natl. Stores, Inc. ante, </em>161, 165. By c. 377, \u00a7 1, of St. 1958, \u00a7 81U was replaced by a new \u00a7 81U. The provision for a \u201cproper bond\u201d was reenacted in substantially the same form.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But an express provision was made for the planning board to release the interest of the town in the bond when the board has determined that the work has been completed. And there is the further provision that \u201cupon failure of the performance for which any such bond or deposit was given\u201d the board, for the benefit of the city or town, may enforce the bond \u201cto the extent of the reasonable cost to such city or town\u201d of completing the unfinished work. Under \u00a7 2 of St. 1958, c. 377, the provisions of \u00a7 1 (the new \u00a7 81U) \u201cwith reference to the release of the interest of a town in a bond, the termination of the obligations under a bond and the return- of a bond or deposit . . . shall apply to all definitive plans whether filed <em>before or after </em>the effective date of this act\u201d; all other provisions of the act were to apply to plans filed after the effective date (emphasis supplied). These retroactive provisions evince a legislative intent that matters relating to the bond (its enforcement and the release of the town\u2019s interest in it) were to be in the centralized hands of the city or town. See <em>Stoneham </em>v. <em>Savelo, </em>341 Mass. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>The plaintiff, while conceding that the bond here was given pursuant to statutory authority, contends, however, that it was not exclusively a statutory bond and can be enforced as a common law obligation. In support of this position he cites <em>Johnson-Foster Co. </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amore Constr. Co. </em>314 Mass. 416. There the bond was not effective as a statutory bond under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, as appearing in St. 1938, c. 361, because the housing authority to whom it was given was not one of the governmental bodies enumerated in the statute. The bond, therefore, was not enforceable as a statutory bond and the principal question was whether subcontractors and materialmen could enforce the instrument as a common law obligation, and it was held that they could in view of certain provisions in the bond. See also <em>Waite Hardware Co. </em>v. <em>Ardini &amp; Pfau, Inc. </em>339 Mass. 634, 637-638. Although common law as well as statutory recovery was allowed in <em>Robinson Clay Prod. Co. </em>v. <em>Beacon Constr. Co. of Mass. Inc. </em>339 Mass. 406, 409-410, that decision rested on a holding of the New Hampshire Supreme Court that the New Hampshire statute in question did \u201cnot prohibit the incorporation of additional conditions.\u201d Compare <em>Metropolitan Pipe &amp; Supply Co. </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amore Constr. Co. </em>309 Mass. 380; <em>Philip Carey Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Peerless Cas. Co. </em>330 Mass. 319, 321-322. We do not decide that there cannot be situations where common law obligations may be included in a statutory bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Assuming that the provision for enforcement by the purchasers of the lots met the requirements of a common law obligation we think that it ought not to be treated as such. If the nonstatutory provisions permitting actions by the individual purchasers were enforced the statutory objectives, discussed above, would be thwarted. The possible rights of lot owners to require the enforcement of this bond are not in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\n<em>Order sustaining demurrer affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-6\"> A third alternative was added, which enabled the applicant to provide security <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>[b]y a covenant, executed and duly recorded by the owner of record, running with the land, whereby such ways and services shall be provided to serve any lot before such lot may be built upon or conveyed , .</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
