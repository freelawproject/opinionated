There was no express provision for the disposition of Maurice\u2019s share held in trust at his death. Maurice died in 1959, without issue, and a successor trustee sought instructions in respect of the fund held in trust since the death of his mother in 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The judge in the Probate Court instructed that the executor under Maurice\u2019s will is entitled to the fund and the accrued income. This appeal is by two children of grandson Benjamin, the only surviving issue of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The instruction was right. The will shows an intent to give Maurice the entire beneficial interest subject only to safeguards against Maurice\u2019s improvidence. <em>Chauncey </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>181 Mass. 513. <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>New England Trust Co. </em>321 Mass. 502. See, for the rule of construction, <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>272 Mass. 432, 438; <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Clapp, </em>337 Mass. 53, 60. Compare, for cases where intention was conjectural, <em>Springfield Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Dwelly, </em>219 Mass. 65; <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>236 Mass. 244; <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>314 Mass. 703, 709-710.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Except for provisions against improvidence of Maurice, each of the three grandsons was treated equally in article Seventh and throughout the will. In addition to the gifts in article Seventh, there were gifts to the grandsons in articles Eighth and Eleventh. Article Eighth left a fund to the trustees for the equal benefit of the three grandsons as income beneficiaries with equal principal payments to be made as follows: One third each to Benjamin and to Alfred upon his attaining the age of twenty-four years, and one third to Maurice upon or after his attaining the age of thirty years if and when in their uncontrolled judgment it should be wise and expedient. The provisions for remainders under article Eighth also treated the grandsons equally: to the issue of a deceased grandson, or, if no issue, to surviving grandsons \u201cat the time they would be entitled to their share of the principal fund as hereinbefore . . . provided,\u201d and a final remainder to the heirs at law of the last surviving grandson. Article Eleventh disposed of the income of a fund left at interest for a period in a partner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>ship. Benjamin and Alfred were each to receive $400 a year; the same yearly sum for Maurice was to be paid to the trustees to be held for his benefit upon the relevant trusts set out in article Eighth.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The intent to provide equally is emphasized by the provision in article Seventh that, if at the life beneficiary\u2019s death any of Maurice, Benjamin or Alfred should be deceased, the lawful issue of the deceased grandson should \u201ctake the same share that its parent would have taken or would have been beneficially entitled to if living,\u201d or, if there should be no issue of a deceased grandson, his share \u201cshall be given to the surviving grandsons.\u201d The statement that Maurice\u2019s share was one to which he would be \u201cbeneficially entitled ... if living\u201d shows an intention to make a full beneficial gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The general residuary clause is consistent with an intention that there be no interest under article Seventh to which that clause would apply. It provides, \u201cIf my son, Horace J. Phipps [uncle of the grandsons], shall survive me, or shall leave issue surviving at the time of my decease, then I give, devise, and bequeath unto the said Horace, if surviving me, otherwise to his issue, all the rest, residue, and remainder of my property, \u2014 real, personal, or mixed; and in case said Horace shall die before me leaving no issue surviving, then I give, devise, and bequeath unto the trustees named in the Eighth Article of my will the entire rest, residue, and remainder, to be held by them upon the same trusts and for the same uses therein set forth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The decree is affirmed, with costs of this appeal to be awarded in the discretion of the probate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
