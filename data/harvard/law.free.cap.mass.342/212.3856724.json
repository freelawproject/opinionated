The judge ordered the writ to issue. From a final judgment entered in accordance with this order the respondent appealed. G-. L. c. 213, \u00a7 ID, as amended by St. 1957, c. 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>On December 30, 1932, the petitioner with the approval of the county commissioners commenced work for the county of Middlesex as a junior messenger under the supervision of the superintendent of buildings. On June 11, 1937, pursuant to the provisions of G. L. c. 35, \u00a7\u00a7 48-55, the county commissioners appointed the petitioner to be senior messenger and janitor, under the supervision of the superintendent of buildings. This appointment, subject to review by the county personnel board, became final. On July 30, 1946, at the request of the then district attorney George E. Thompson, Esquire, and with the approval of the county commissioners, the petitioner was transferred to the district attorney\u2019s office to serve as special messenger under the district attorney\u2019s supervision. This appointment, also subject to review by the county personnel board, became final. The petitioner was not appointed to any office by the district attorney. General Laws c. 12, \u00a7 22, as amended through St. 1948, c. 423, \u00a7 6, is not applicable. He. was, in effect, placed at the disposal of the district attorney by the county commissioners as a county employee classified under the county classification plan as a special messenger. He continued in this position until December 31,1958. The successor district attorney James L. O\u2019Dea, Junior, Esquire, had on December 2,1958, notified the petitioner that his position would be \u201cabolished\u201d effective December 31, 1958, and that the county commissioners and county personnel board had been so informed. Thereafter the petitioner appealed to the county commissioners pursuant to G. L. e. 35, \u00a7 52, and requested a hearing on the action of the district attorney. He also appealed to the county personnel board and requested a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The county commissioners on January 20, 1959, after hearing notified the county personnel board that the petitioner\u2019s position was in the classified personnel service, that the position was not abolished by the district attorney\u2019s action, and that the petitioner was entitled to his salary and other benefits pertaining to his position. On July 22, 1959, following a full hearing, at which all inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>ested parties appeared, the personnel board upheld the decision of the county commissioners, reversed the action of the district attorney, and directed him \u201cto take such action as may be necessary in conformity with this decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The district attorney refused to comply with the board\u2019s order. The respondent John J. Droney, Esquire, thereafter succeeded Mr. O\u2019Dea as district attorney and has not reinstated the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The judgment entered in the Superior Court was right. The county commissioners and the county personnel board had jurisdiction to hear the petitioner\u2019s appeal under Gr. L. c. 35, \u00a7 52. The pertinent part of that statute is as follows: \u201cAny person aggrieved by the allocation or classification of his office or position <em>or by any other action </em>or by any failure to act, under any provision of sections forty-eight to fifty-five, inclusive, may appeal in writing to the board. Such appeal shall be filed with the county commissioners . . . who shall forward the appeal to the board, accompanied by a report and their recommendations thereon. . . . The board, after giving all parties interested an opportunity to be heard, shall pass upon the appeal and its decision shall be final and <em>binding upon all such parties, </em>including the county commissioners and the person appealing\u201d (emphasis added). The board\u2019s authority to entertain appeals is not limited to situations where an employee has been aggrieved by allocation, classification, or failure to act under any of the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 48 through 55 of the statute. An employee aggrieved \u201cby any other action\u201d may appeal to the board. This broad clause certainly includes such action as an attempt by an immediate superior, acting administratively and alone, to abolish a position which had been established, classified and allocated according to laws and rules pertaining to county personnel. G. L. c. 35, \u00a7 51. Cf. <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>County of Suffolk, </em>310 Mass. 318, 322-323. The board had jurisdiction to hear and act upon the petitioner\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The respondent contends that mandamus does not lie be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>cause it has not been shown as required (1) that he has a clear duty defined by law to reinstate the petitioner (see <em>Knights </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen. </em>236 Mass. 336, 337), and (2) that the duty, if there is one, is purely ministerial as opposed to judicial or discretionary (see <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Mayor of Holyoke, </em>216 Mass. 62, 64), The contention is groundless. Under the terms of Gr. L. c. 35, \u00a7 52, the board\u2019s decision upon an employee\u2019s appeal \u201cshall be final and binding upon all . . . parties.\u201d The word \u201cshall\u201d in a statute is commonly a word of imperative obligation and is inconsistent with the idea of discretion. <em>Elmer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>304 Mass. 194, 196. It was not within the respondent\u2019s discretion to ignore the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The statute imposes a clear duty upon the respondent to comply with the board\u2019s decision. The words of a statute are to be construed according to their natural import and approved usage. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welosky, </em>276 Mass. 398, 401. The word \u201cbinding\u201d commonly means \u201cobligatory.\u201d It means bringing or placing under definite duties or legal obligations. The discussion of the word \u201cbinding\u201d in <em>Meunier\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 421, 424-425, confirms this interpretation. Since the respondent has refused to act, mandamus is the proper remedy to compel him to act. <em>Knights </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen. </em>236 Mass. 336, 337. See <em>Scudder </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Sandwich, </em>309 Mass. 373, 375; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Dacey, </em>329 Mass. 598, 600. In the circumstances presented, mandamus is the only remedy available to the petitioner. The petitioner\u2019s situation is not like that of a civil service employee who has a statutory right to judicial review and order under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 45. In G. L. c. 35, \u00a7\u00a7 48-55, there is no provision for judicial review and order. \u201cThe usual remedy, in the absence of a specific statutory remedy like the one supplied for the removal of one in the classified civil service, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 31, \u00a7 45, as amended, is a petition for a writ of mandamus.\u201d <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Saugus, </em>335 Mass. 400, 402. See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Third List. Court of E. Middlesex, </em>316 Mass. 663, 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
