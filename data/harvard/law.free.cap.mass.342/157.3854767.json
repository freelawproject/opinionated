The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>judge, under leave reserved, set aside a verdict for the plaintiff and entered a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff duly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">. The jury could -have found these facts: While the plaintiff, then ten years of age, was skating by herself she was bumped or tripped by a line of five or six skaters who were holding hands. The plaintiff fell and was injured. The plaintiff had been to the rink eight or nine times, had not skated elsewhere, and was \u201ca beginner but a fair skater.\u201d The accident happened at a time when the directions given by the management were that \u201call skate,\u201d meaning that everyone on the rink could skate, but no more than two skaters hand in hand, In \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>trio skate \u2019 \u2019 three persons might skate together; at other times there were other directions such as \u201cladies only\u201d or \u201ccouples only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">There had been no \u2018 trio number \u2019 \u2019 prior to 3:30 p.m. and up to that time \u201cthe maximum number allowed to skate hand in hand was two.\u201d Nevertheless, as the plaintiff testified, lines had been doing the \u201cwhip\u201d in the course of the afternoon. For the \u201cwhip,\u201d five or six skaters would hold hands and skate fast, keep \u201cgoing until they came to a curve, and then they let go . . . [and] everybody would go in different directions\u201d and \u201cknock people down.\u201d This was against the rules (\u201cWe do not recognize the whip\u201d). There were two ushers on the rink at all times whose admitted duties were to deter fast skating, and stop \u201cany bad conduct.\u201d The defendant was in \u201ccomplete charge\u201d with power to eject offenders. Inferentially it was the duty of the ushers to stop whips, and lines of more than two skaters, or more than three skaters on a \u201ctrio number.\u201d One of the ushers testified he had never seen a whip at the rink. The plaintiff, however, as she testified, saw the whip going on \u201call the time\u201d; she was uncertain how many were knocked down by the whip. \u201cI don\u2019t know . . . exactly. Q. Well, was it a dozen or two dozen, or what? A. About two dozen.\u201d The ushers \u201cstopped some of them\u201d but \u201csome of them would\u201d start up again. This was going on all afternoon \u201cfrom half past one until four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>o\u2019clock,\u201d when the accident occurred according to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">There was no testimony that the line of skaters which bumped the plaintiff was about to snap the whip. The plaintiff showed by her testimony that she had inferred that it was a whip line. \u201cQ. You don\u2019t mean that . . . this whip . . . knocked other people down, do you . . .? A. Well, it knocked me down. ... Q. [T]hey hadn\u2019t snapped the whip after they went by you ... is that right? A. Yes. . . . I don\u2019t think they were doing that; . . . they were just holding hands. ... Q. It was just five or six skaters going by you hand in hand that accidentally bumped into you ... is that right . . .? A. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Perhaps the same inference could have been drawn by the jury, but we need not decide that. The jury reasonably could have concluded that if throughout the afternoon whips and skating hand in hand by more than two skaters had been effectively deterred, the line of skaters which ran into the plaintiff would not have formed. It is not controlling that there was no evidence to show that the skaters in the line which hit the plaintiff had previously formed a whip line or been skating together. The jury reasonably could have concluded that a line of five or six skaters made collision with a single skater much more likely and hence that it was a cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Doubtless it could have been found that some groups of skaters would form contrary to the rules notwithstanding all reasonable efforts to deter them. It was, however, for the jury to say whether the defendant had done all that was reasonably required to prevent injury from this known and recognized danger. <em>Rawson </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Operating Co. Inc. </em>328 Mass. 558, 560, and cases cited. <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Sum</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>ner Tavern Inc. </em>333 Mass. 144. <em>Ephremian </em>v. <em>Sholes, </em>72 R. I. 395, 401-402. Compare <em>Boehm </em>v. <em>S. S. Kresge Co. </em>336 Mass. 320; <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Boston Garden-Arena Corp. </em>338 Mass. 791; <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Riverview Rink &amp; Ballroom, </em>233 Wis. 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">We assume that a skater at an indoor rink assumes the risk of being bumped by another skater. But the facts do not require the ruling that the plaintiff assumed the risk of being injured by a line of skaters, in the circumstances that the formation of such a line was against the rules, and that the defendant, by the conduct of his ushers in stopping some such lines, had recognized his obligation to prevent them. The plaintiff\u2019s conduct must be judged in the light of her \u201cimmaturity . . . [and] the lack of the caution and judgment natural to youth.\u201d <em>Berdos </em>v. <em>Tremont &amp; Suffolk Mills, </em>209 Mass. 489, 495. <em>Ducas </em>v. <em>Prince, </em>336 Mass. 555, 557. The plaintiff could to some extent rely on the defendant\u2019s obligation to keep the rink in a reasonably safe condition for those using it. <em>Lemoine </em>v. <em>Springfield Hockey Assn. Inc. </em>307 Mass. 102, 105, and cases cited. The case of <em>Pouliot </em>v. <em>Black, </em>341 Mass. 531, is distinguishable for the risk of being hit by a golf ball while collecting balls on a driving range was inherent in the activity. Compare also <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Gow, </em>321 Mass. 666 (adult injured at <em>golf </em>driving range); <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Boston Am. League Baseball Co. </em>325 Mass. 419, 422-423.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The defendant does not argue that the posted signs reading \u201cnot responsible for accidents to patrons\u201d bar recovery. See <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>299 Mass. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Although the testimony of the- plaintiff was, in important respects, uncorroborated and contradicted, and could have been deemed of slight weight on balance with other testimony, it was sufficient, if accepted, to warrant a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\"><em> </em>The defendant testified that the accident occurred about 2:15 p.m., that he saw the plaintiff and the girl with whom she was skating fall down when \u201ctheir feet . . . [got] mixed up.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s younger sister, as she testified, saw lines of three people holding hands on \u201call skate\u201d and \u201cabout five times . . . there would be five\u201d holding hands. The auditor had found that \u201cthere was no fast skating, \u2018whip line,\u2019 group or formation skating other than by two\u2019s prior to the accident . . . [and that] the plaintiff . . . was caused to fall by her skates becoming entangled with those of her friend. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
