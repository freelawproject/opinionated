There is a count for consequential damages by the father. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6A, as inserted by St. 1939, c. 372, \u00a7 1. Verdicts were rendered for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-15\">The case comes before us on a consolidated bill of exceptions which presents for our consideration: (a) the defendant\u2019s exception to the denial of its motion for directed verdicts; (b) the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>and exclusion of certain evidence; and (c) the plaintiffs\u2019 exception to an instruction by the judge to the jury to disregard testimony that a valve on the convector was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The manner in which the child, then eighteen months old, received his injuries is not disputed. While the child\u2019s father and mother were in the kitchen attending their two other children, they heard screams and immediately went to the child\u2019s bedroom which was directly across from the kitchen and found him with his \u201cface ... on the return pipe and his arm was down in behind resting on the return pipe.\u201d The source of heat for the building was a central plant from which steam was conducted by pipes into and out of the rooms where the air was warmed by convectors. The convectors themselves were completely covered by metal guards to prevent a person being burned by contact. The convector in the child\u2019s bedroom was below the windows ; it was about three feet high and three feet wide; it stood about eight or ten inches above the floor; there was a shutoff-wheel type valve on the right of the convector and leading up to that valve from the wall was a pipe which had asbestos covering on it; there was a return pipe coming from the left hand bottom of the convector which projected out six or seven inches and made a \u201cmore or less TJ turn\u201d toward the floor and then went back into the wall after having gone underneath the convector, the return pipe then being about three inches above the floor; there was no asbestos covering on the return pipe. The foregoing description of the convector and its connecting pipes was given by the minor plaintiff\u2019s father who also testified that this description was true on December 15, 1956, when the tenancy began and was true on the day of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The judge, in submitting the case to the jury, limited the issue of liability to the question whether the exposed uncovered return pipe constituted a so called \u201chidden defect.\u201d He thereby impliedly excluded from the consideration of the jury all other theories of liability including the one set forth in the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration which apparently is based upon the theory of a failure by the landlord to comply with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>covenant to repair. No exception was taken by the plaintiffs to the action by the judge nor were any requests for instructions in this respect submitted to him. Upon the evidence the judge was right in excluding other theories of liability; but we think he was in error in submitting the case to the jury on the question of a \u201chidden defect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">In view of the facts of the case, it seems unnecessary to review the law relating to hidden defects. An exhaustive analysis of the cases, both in our own Commonwealth and elsewhere, was made in <em>Stumpf </em>v. <em>Leland, </em>242 Mass. 168. Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 358, adopts the majority rule as set forth in <em>Stumpf </em>v. <em>Leland, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">There was no breach of duty by the defendant to the tenant. \u201cIn the ordinary lease of real estate . . . [t]he lessee takes the premises as he finds them.\u201d <em>Gade </em>v. <em>National Creamery Co. </em>324 Mass. 515, 518. \u201cThe general rule is that the landlord is not liable to the tenant for defects in the premises existing at the time of the letting unless they are hidden defects of which he is aware and does not warn the tenant.\u201d <em>Ackarey </em>v. <em>Carbonaro, </em>320 Mass. 537, 539. <em>Condon </em>v. <em>Winn, </em>252 Mass. 146, 148. The landlord owes to the members of the household of the tenant in possession the same duty which he owes to the tenant, and no greater duty. <em>Chelefou </em>v. <em>Springfield Inst. for Sav. </em>297 Mass. 236, 238-239, and cases cited. <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Simcovitz, </em>310 Mass. 150, 153. See <em>Domenicis </em>v. <em>Fleisher, </em>195 Mass. 281, 283. Also, see Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">There was no hidden defect or concealed source of danger known to the landlord and not discoverable by the tenant. See <em>Cutter </em>v. <em>Hamlen, </em>147 Mass. 471, 474. The location, the exposed surface, the use and purpose of the return pipe, even if they constituted a dangerous condition, were as obvious to the tenant as they were to the landlord when the tenancy began. The defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdicts should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The plaintiffs were permitted to argue that liability could be imposed on the basis of a breach of an implied agreement to repair. \"While we are under no duty to consider this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>argument because that theory of liability was impliedly waived by going to the jury solely on the question of a hidden defect, we point out that a lease, similar in all material respects, was considered by this court in <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authy. </em>322 Mass. 299. It was decided that there was no such agreement; and that decision answers the plaintiffs\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The significance, if any (and on the record we perceive none), of the alleged defect in the shutoff valve has not been argued by the plaintiffs in their brief, and therefore we ignore it. Eule 13 of the Eules for the Eegulation of Practice before the Full Court (1952), 328 Mass. 698. See <em>Lolos </em>v. <em>Berlin, </em>338 Mass. 10, 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s exception to denial of motion for directed verdicts sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\n<em>Plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">\n<em>Judgments for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
