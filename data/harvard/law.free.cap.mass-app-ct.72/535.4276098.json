L. c. 31, \u00a7 59, as appearing in St. 1989, c. 174, which governs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>the promotional examination process for municipal police officers and fire fighters, and states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">\u201cAn examination for a promotional appointment to any title in a police or fire force shall be open only to permanent employees in the next lower title in such force . . . provided, however, that no such examination shall be open to any person who has not been employed in such force for at least one year after certification[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] in the lower title or titles to which the examination is open.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">A Superior Court judge interpreted the statute to require that in order to be eligible to sit for the fire captain\u2019s examination, an individual must have been certified for, and thus eligible to serve in, the lower position of fire lieutenant for at least one year, and not that the candidate actually must have served as fire lieutenant for one year. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">In the summer of 2003, the plaintiff, Paul Weinburgh, was certified for the position of fire lieutenant in the city of Haverhill (city) and placed on the fire lieutenant promotion list. After officially being appointed to this position on December 21, 2003, the plaintiff filed a bypass appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with the Civil Service Commission (commission) claiming that another fire lieutenant appointee did not meet residency requirements. To ensure proper seniority, the plaintiff and the city submitted a joint stipulation requesting that the commission backdate the plaintiff\u2019s appointment date to October 21, 2003. The commission took no immediate action because the parties had not reached an agreement on back pay and benefits. However, on May 26, 2005, the commission approved a modified stipulation submitted by the plaintiff and the city requesting that the plaintiff\u2019s fire lieuten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>ant appointment date be changed to November 19, 2003. The plaintiff waived any rights to back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">During these discussions, the plaintiff applied to sit for the fire captain promotional examination to be held on November 20, 2004, one year and one day after the plaintiff\u2019s retroactive appointment date eventually approved by the commission. The plaintiff was allowed to sit for the examination and, based on his score and work experience, subsequently was certified to the position of fire captain and placed on the promotion list.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">On July 8, 2005, another fire fighter filed a bypass appeal with the commission claiming that the plaintiff should not have been allowed to sit for the fire captain\u2019s examination because he had not actually served as a fire lieutenant for one year. After hearing, the commission agreed that in order to sit for the fire captain\u2019s examination, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 59, requires one year of actual service in the lower position of fire lieutenant. Because the plaintiff only served as a fire lieutenant for approximately eleven months, the commission ordered the plaintiff\u2019s name removed from the fire captain promotion fist.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The plaintiff filed a petition for judicial review in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44. A judge reversed the decision of the commission, concluding that it had misinterpreted the statute as matter of law. See <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Suffolk County Sheriff\u2019s Dept., </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 187, 192 (2004) (court may modify or set aside decision of administrative agency when decision is based upon error of law). The judge reasoned that if the Legislature intended to require one year of actual service in the lower position (in this case, fire lieutenant), the statute would have contained more definitive language requiring service.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, the judge explained, that by using the term \u201ccertification,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">\u201cthe legislature chose to separate the requirement of employment in the force (no rank) from that of a year\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>certification in the lower rank. At the very least, this wording indicates that an administrative landmark, rather than a factual one, should be used to determine eligibility to sit for a civil service exam.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Therefore, the judge correctly concluded that G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 59, requires that an employee (1) be on the promotion list (and, thus, certified) for the immediate lower position one year prior to taking the exam for the higher position; and (2) actually serve in the force for one year after certification, but not necessarily in that lower position. In this case, because the plaintiff was certified for the lower position of fire lieutenant in the summer of 2003 and had been employed \u201cin such force,\u201d see G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 59, for one year after certification, he was qualified to sit for the fire captain\u2019s examination in November, 2004.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\n<em>Order denying commission\u2019s motion to alter or amend judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\">\u201cCertification\u201d is defined in G.

L. c. 31, \u00a7 61, inserted by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11, provides, in part, that \u201c[f] olio wing his original appointment as a permanent full-time police officer or fire fighter in a city, or in a town where the civil service law and rules are applicable to such position, a person <em>shall actually perform the duties of such position on a full-time basis for a probationary period of twelve months </em>before he shall be considered a full-time tenured employee\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b564-8\">As we conclude that the plaintiff met the statutory requirements to sit for the fire captain\u2019s examination, we need not comment on the commission\u2019s authority to render settlements in civil service disputes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b564-9\">The commission\u2019s concern that this reading will allow individuals to skip rank by sitting for the fire captain\u2019s examination without ever serving in the lower position of fire lieutenant is addressed by the restrictive language in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 59, requiring that \u201c[a]n examination for a promotional appointment to any title in a police or fire force shall be open only to permanent employees in the next lower title in such force.\u201d Therefore, while we conclude that an individual need only be certified in the lower position for one year to sit for the higher position\u2019s examination, actual service of some length in the lower is required to be appointed to the higher.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
