L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-178P, to homeless sex offenders. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>450 Mass. 657 (2008); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scipione, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 906 (2007). The defendant, who registered with the Greenfield police department as a level three sex offender (listing his address as the \u201cstreets of Greenfield\u201d), was arrested by police in the neighboring town of Montague after they received information that he had begun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>spending nights in the apartment of a resident of that town. On appeal, the defendant contends that the evidence at his jury-waived trial was insufficient to support his conviction. We agree and reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\"><em>Facts and procedural background. </em>Viewed in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), the evidence at trial established the following facts. On June 6, 2006, the defendant came to the Greenfield police department to register as a level three sex offender.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Detective Laura Gordon assisted the defendant in filling out the registration form, by obtaining information from the defendant and filling in the blanks on the form. For the space designated \u201cPermanent Address,\u201d the defendant specified \u201cStreets of Greenfield, Franklin County, MA 01301.\u201d For the space designated \u201cMailing Address,\u201d the defendant specified \u201c178 Avenue A \u2014 P.O. Box 84, Montague, Franklin County, MA 01376.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The space provided for \u201cTemporary OR Out of State Address (If different than permanent)\u201d was not completed; Detective Gordon drew a line through the space.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">After completing the form, Detective Gordon read to the defendant the following notification, which appeared at the bottom of the registration form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">\u201cYou are advised that you must notify, in writing, the Sex Offender Registry Board or the Police Department in the city or town in which you reside not less than 10 days prior to any change in residence, employment, or attendance at an institute of higher learning. You are further advised that you are required to immediately contact and advise of your presence, the appropriate authorities in any other state in which you locate yourself for the purpose of residence, employment, or attendance at an institute of higher learning. Failing to do so may subject you to criminal prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">After Detective Gordon read the advisory to the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>the defendant checked the box stating that \u201cthe [above] requirements were read to me and I understand these requirements,\u201d and signed the completed form. Above his signature, the form contained an attestation, under the pains and penalties of perjury, that the information provided by the defendant was true and accurate. After the defendant signed the registration form, Detective Gordon gave the defendant a second form, which contained various information about the defendant\u2019s ongoing obligations. Among other things, the form stated that \u201c[w]e expect you to comply with the state law (M.G.L. c. 6 Sec. 178C through P) which requires you to notify us of any change of residence address, both full and part-time residences, a minimum of ten (10) days prior to the change.\u201d The defendant signed this form as well, under a statement certifying \u201cthat I have read or had read to me, the above information and that I fully understand my duties and responsibilities with regard to registering as a sex offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Near the end of July, 2006, the defendant met Lori Martinez. Martinez lived in a two-bedroom, second-floor apartment in the Turners Falls section of Montague.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Montague is adjacent to Greenfield, and Martinez\u2019s apartment is approximately two or three miles from the Greenfield courthouse. On the day they met, the defendant asked Martinez if he could spend the night in her apartment, as he had no place to stay. Martinez agreed, and the defendant slept on her sofa.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant stayed in Martinez\u2019s apartment twice more during July, but never more than one night in a row. The defendant did not pay Martinez for his stays or contribute to her household expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">On August 3, 2006, Martinez\u2019s mother died, and Martinez left her apartment to make funeral arrangements. Martinez locked her apartment upon her departure and did not notice anything different in her apartment when she returned several days later, following her mother\u2019s funeral. When Martinez returned to her apartment, the defendant came to visit her from time to time. Asked whether the defendant stayed overnight in her apartment in August, Martinez could not recall. Martinez was allowed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>testify, over the defendant\u2019s objection, that she was \u201caware\u201d that the defendant stayed at a neighbor\u2019s house on occasion, though the record does not indicate the source of her knowledge, the identity or address of the neighbor (other than that it was not in the same apartment building), the number of occasions the defendant stayed at the neighbor\u2019s, or the dates.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Staff Sergeant Christopher Williams of the Montague police department began an investigation of the defendant after receiving information that the defendant \u201cwas living on Fourth Street in Turners Falls.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On August 14, 2006, Williams knocked on the door to Martinez\u2019s apartment and asked for the defendant. Martinez went to a bedroom door, knocked, and told the defendant that someone was there to see him. Williams heard the bedroom door being unlocked, and then observed the defendant emerge from the bedroom, holding a cup of beer. Williams arrested the defendant. After a jury-waived trial in the District Court, the defendant was convicted on a charge of failing to provide notice of a change of address, as required under G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H(a)(iii), and sentenced to one year in the house of correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cThe Legislature adopted G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-1780, an extensive statutory registration scheme for sex offenders, in order to protect the public from \u2018the danger of recidivism posed by sex offenders\u2019 and to aid law enforcement officials in protecting their communities by providing them with information\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>450 Mass, at 659-660, quoting from St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 1. Convicted sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>offenders must register with the Sex Offender Registry Board (board), which then determines the classification level of the offender. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178E, 178K(2). The classification level in turn determines certain details of the offender\u2019s registration obligations. Level three sex offenders, such as the defendant, must verify their registration information annually in person at the local police department in the city or town in which they live.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178FV2. In addition, the board annually mails a nonforwardable verification form to the last reported address of the offender, and the offender is required within five days after receipt of the verification form to sign it and register in person at the police department in the municipality in which the offender lives. <em>Ibid. </em>Pursuant to G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 <em>178E(h), </em>a sex offender who intends to move to a different city or town within the Commonwealth must register his intended new address with the board by mailing to it a form, at least ten days before establishing the new residence. Included among the information offenders must provide is their home address and any secondary addresses or intended secondary addresses. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E(Z). \u201cSecondary addresses\u201d are defined as \u201cthe addresses of all places where a sex offender lives, abides, lodges, or resides for a period of 14 or more days in the aggregate during any calendar year and which is not a sex offender\u2019s primary address; or a place where a sex offender routinely lives, abides, lodges, or resides for a period of 4 or more consecutive or nonconsecutive days in any month and which is not a sex offender\u2019s permanent address, including any out-of-state address.\u201d G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 178H specifies the punishment to be imposed on a sex offender who knowingly fails to register, fails to verify registration information, fails to provide notice of a change of address, or provides false information. The statute specifies that level two or three sex offenders who reside at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>homeless shelter must register every ninety days<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but imposes no comparable requirement on homeless sex offenders not living in a shelter; however, that fact does not nullify the obligation of homeless sex offenders not living in a shelter to register. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178FV2; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scipione, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 906, 907 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">As a general matter, \u201ca statute is to be interpreted \u2018according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>444 Mass. 80, 85 (2005), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>388 Mass. 326, 328 (1983). Criminal statutes are construed narrowly; \u201c[w]e must resolve in favor of criminal defendants any reasonable doubt as to [a] statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>445 Mass. 161, 167 (2005), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kerr, </em>409 Mass. 284, 286 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The statute does not define the term \u201chome address.\u201d \u201c[Wjhere a statute does not define a term, we may interpret it \u2018in accordance with its generally accepted plain meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 81, 87, cert, denied, 129 S. Ct. 320 (2008), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>438 Mass. 274, 276 (2002). \u201cHome\u201d is defined as \u201cone\u2019s principal place of residence.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Inti. Dictionary 1082 (2002). The same text defines \u201cresidence\u201d as \u201cthe act or fact of. . . dwelling in a place for some time\u201d or \u201cthe place where one actually lives ... as distinguished from one\u2019s . . . domicile [or] a place of temporary sojourn.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1931. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 750, 546 (8th ed. 2004) (defining \u201chome\u201d as \u201c[a] dwelling place\u201d and \u201cdwelling house\u201d as \u201c[t]he house or other structure in which a person fives; a residence or abode\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">In construing the term, we also look to other provisions of the same statute for guidance. See <em>Locator Servs. Group, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>443 Mass. 837, 859 (2005), quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>from <em>Kargman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>389 Mass. 784, 788 (1983) (\u201cstatutes should be interpreted as a whole to constitute a consistent and harmonious provision\u201d). In particular, we consider the meaning of the undefined term \u201chome address\u201d with some reference to the definition of \u201csecondary addresses\u201d provided in the statute. As observed above, \u201csecondary addresses\u201d are those in which a sex offender \u201croutinely lives, abides, lodges, or resides for a period of 4 or more consecutive or nonconsecutive days in any month and which is not a sex offender\u2019s permanent address.\u201d From that definition, it is apparent that, within the statutory scheme, an offender\u2019s \u201chome address\u201d denotes some greater degree of permanence, and a greater frequency of residence, than the transitory (albeit \u201croutine\u201d) level of occupancy at a location for four or fewer nights in a month.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">That the term implies some degree of permanence is also indicated by the designation of the space furnished on the registration form for an offender\u2019s primary address: the applicable space on the form reads \u201cPermanent Address.\u201d The form, generated by the board, of course cannot amend the statute. However, the manner in which the form requests information about the offender\u2019s home address illuminates to some extent the interpretation of the statute by the administrative agency charged with its enforcement. See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>441 Mass. 846, 851 (2004).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">We conclude that the term \u201chome address\u201d in the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>refers to an offender\u2019s primary place of residence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To the extent that the Commonwealth suggests that an offender\u2019s \u201chome address\u201d is wherever the offender sleeps on any particular night, even if on a wholly transitory basis, the suggestion is incompatible with the common usage of the term, the greater frequency assigned under the statute to the lesser category of \u201csecondary addresses,\u201d and the implication of some degree of permanence set forth in the form promulgated by the board.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As applied to the facts of the present case, it is plain that the evidence at trial was not sufficient to establish that the defendant had changed his home address (or primary residence) from Greenfield to Turners Falls.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Our inquiry does not end with the conclusion that the evidence did not establish that the defendant changed his home address to Turners Falls. As the Commonwealth observes, a violation of the statutory obligation to register can also arise from a defendant\u2019s failure to report any secondary addresses, or changes thereto. Here, the term is clearly defined by the statute, and our examination accordingly may compare that definition to the evidence adduced at trial. As summarized above, the evidence established at most that the defendant spent three nonconsecutive nights in July, 2006, at Martinez\u2019s apartment in Turners Falls, and (perhaps) an unspecified number of other nights on unspecified dates at the apartment of another (unidentified) person in that town.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Since the statute defines secondary addresses to encompass four or more nights (consecutive or non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>consecutive) in any month (or fourteen or more nights in any calendar year), the evidence at trial failed to establish a violation of the registration obligation with respect to secondary addresses as well.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">We recognize that the circumstances of homeless sex offenders pose particular difficulties for the administration of the sex offender registration statute. In the present case, the registration form completed by the defendant at least placed officials in Montague on notice of the defendant\u2019s regular presence in that community, by listing a Montague address as the defendant\u2019s mailing address. Nonetheless, the inherently transitory nature of homelessness makes it difficult to apply to homeless sex offenders the same considerations of residence applied to offenders who are not homeless. The difficulties of fitting homeless persons into the statutory scheme are not newly discovered. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosado, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scipione, supra. </em>However, it is not our proper role or function to rewrite the statute to address what may appear to be gaps in its scope or practical operation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. at 94-96 (Cohen, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The evidence was insufficient as matter of law to support the defendant\u2019s conviction. The judgment of conviction is accordingly reversed, the finding is set aside, and the case is remanded for entry of a finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b645-9\">The record does not describe the offense or offenses that led to the defendant\u2019s classification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b645-10\">In the space for \u201cMailing Address,\u201d the registration form stated that the mailing address \u201cMUST accompany a permanent or temporary address.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Martinez testified that she had converted a living room into a third bedroom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Martinez testified that she had no romantic relationship with the defendant and understood that he had a girlfriend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Martinez\u2019s testimony concerning the neighbor occurred during two exchanges with the prosecutor. During the first exchange, after asking whether the defendant asked to stay in Martinez\u2019s apartment at any other time after the first night and eliciting that he had done so \u201ca couple other times,\u201d the prosecutor asked, \u201cDid you have information that he stayed at anyone else\u2019s house?\u201d and (after Martinez\u2019s affirmative response) \u201cWhat information did you have?\u201d Martinez responded to the latter inquiry that \u201cI just know that he stayed at the neighbor\u2019s occasionally.\u201d Later, during Martinez\u2019s testimony about her return to her apartment after her mother\u2019s funeral, the prosecutor asked, \u201cAnd at this time did you have information or were you aware that he was staying at other people\u2019s homes?\u201d Martinez responded, \u201cJust the neighbor\u2019s. Other than that I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Upon the defendant\u2019s objection, Williams\u2019s testimony that he had \u201creceived information\u201d was admitted for background purposes only, and not for its truth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Level two offenders are subject to the same requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The definition of \u201csecondary addresses,\u201d and the requirement to include secondary addresses as part of the information furnished by a sex offender upon registration, was added by amendment effective July 1, 2006. See St. 2006, c. 139, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 9-20. The obligation to notify the board of changes in secondary addresses accordingly was in effect at the time of the events giving rise to the charge against the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\">We note that by St. 2006, c. 303, \u00a7 3, effective December 20, 2006, the requirement has been changed to every forty-five days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\"> As noted above, \u201csecondary addresses\u201d also include addresses at which an offender resides for fourteen or more days during any calendar year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b650-8\">In any event, the request on the registration form for \u201cPermanent Address\u201d goes to the question of the defendant\u2019s intent, or knowing violation of his registration obligations under the statute. Having been asked to furnish his home address as his \u201cpermanent address,\u201d a registered sex offender would understand his obligation to notify the board of changes in his home address to attach only to nontransitory changes \u2014 at least as related to his \u201chome address.\u201d We note in passing that the terminology employed on the form, or in the accompanying notification given to the defendant at the time he registered, does not mirror the terminology of the statute; while the statute refers to \u201chome address,\u201d \u201cresidence,\u201d and \u201csecondary addresses,\u201d the registration form requests information concerning the offender\u2019s \u201cpermanent address,\u201d \u201ctemporary address,\u201d and \u201cmailing address,\u201d while the accompanying notification sheet refers to the offender\u2019s obligation to notify the board of any \u201cchange of residence address.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b651-6\">That is not, however, to erode the distinction between a residence and a domicile.
