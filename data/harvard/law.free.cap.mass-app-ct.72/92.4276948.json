L. c. 25A, \u00a7 11F, and 225 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 14.02 and 14.06 (2002),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by the Division of Energy Resources (division) to Greenville Steam Company (Greenville) and Boralex Livermore Falls, Inc. (Boralex). In considering motions to dismiss pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), 365 Mass. 755 (1974), by Greenville and Boralex, the judge concluded that the plaintiffs did not have standing to maintain the claim and accordingly dismissed the case. The question presented in the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is one of first impression in the Commonwealth: whether the owner or operator of a renewable energy generating unit that is an authorized participant in the renewable energy portfolio standard program established under G. L. c. 25A, \u00a7 11F, is a competitor in a regulated industry, and has alleged an injury within the area of concern of the statute or regulatory scheme, thereby according it standing to challenge governmental action threatening its competitive position. We conclude that the plaintiffs have established standing and therefore reverse the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\"><em>Background. </em>Indeck, Ridgewood, Greenville, and Boralex each operate advanced biomass renewable energy facilities in Maine or Rhode Island. Pursuant to G. L. c. 25A, \u00a7 11F, and the regulations promulgated thereunder and codified at 225 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 14.01 et seq., each facility has received a statement of qualification from the division, permitting each facility to sell renewable energy certificates, otherwise known as credits, in Massachusetts<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to retail electricity suppliers selling electricity to end-use customers. In their complaint, the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>allege certain procedural and substantive irregularities in the division\u2019s issuance of statements of qualification to Greenville and Boralex. These alleged irregularities include the division\u2019s issuance of statements of qualification to Greenville and Boralex without requiring a \u201c[v]intage [w]aiver,\u201d 225 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05(2); that the division inappropriately permitted Green-ville and Boralex to use construction and debris wood as a renewable fuel even though it does not qualify as an eligible biomass fuel under the regulations; and that the division failed to provide the required notice and comment period prior to the issuance of the statements of qualification. The plaintiffs further allege, quoting from the division\u2019s \u201cPolicy Statement on the Re[newable] P[ortfolio] Standard] Eligibility of Retooled Biomass Plants\u201d (Oct. 27,2005), that the division\u2019s actions \u201cthreaten Plaintiffs\u2019 business positions in the [renewable energy credit] market\u201d because \u201ca policy change on eligibility can result in \u2018an influx of [renewable energy credits]\u2019 that could in turn \u2018severely damage the [renewable energy credit market] in Massachusetts and adversely affect the goal of the [renewal portfolio standard] program to promote the development of \u201cnew\u201d renewable energy generating facilities.\u2019 \u201d Moreover, the plaintiffs allege that they made substantial investments to construct and operate their facilities in order to obtain their own statements of qualification, which would be rendered unnecessary and superfluous if the division\u2019s interpretation of its regulations, as implemented in Boralex and Greenville\u2019s statements of qualification, is allowed to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cIn order for a court to entertain a petition for declaratory relief, an \u2018actual controversy\u2019 sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss must appear on the pleadings. \u201d <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. 290, 292 (1977), quoting from G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 1. In addition, the particular plaintiffs bringing the action must demonstrate the requisite legal standing to secure a resolution of the actual controversy. <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Indep. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number><em>Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc., supra. </em>\u201cThe purpose of both the actual controversy and the standing requirements is to ensure the effectuation of the statutory purpose of G. L. c. 231 A, which is to enable a court \u2018to afford relief from . . . uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, duties, status and other legal relations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Galipault </em>v. <em>Wash Rock Invs., LLC, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 73, 84 (2005), quoting from G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">As the sole question presented here is one of standing, the defendants\u2019 challenge by way of a Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss was proper. <em>Ginther </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>427 Mass. 319, 322 (1998).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cA party has standing when it can allege an injury within the area of concern of the statute or regulatory scheme under which the injurious action has occurred.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc., supra </em>at 293. \u201cWhile standing requirements should be liberally construed for declaratory judgment purposes, the requirement that a party assert a legally cognizable injury, i.e., one within the area of statutory or regulatory concern, limits the nature of those disputes that can, in fact, be heard.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Cosmetology Schs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Cosmetology, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 706, 708 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In the present case, it is undisputed that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of injury derive from business competition. \u201cNormally, an injury derived from business competition is not sufficient to confer standing.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc., supra </em>at 293. \u201cThis rule does not apply, however, to competitors in a regulated industry . . . who are attempting to challenge governmental action threatening their competitive position.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Everett Town Taxi, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aidermen of Everett, </em>366 Mass. 534, 538 (1974). In order to fall within this regulated industry exception, the plaintiffs must show as a matter of law that \u201cthe alleged injury is within the parameters of the statutory concern\u201d of G. L. c. 25A, \u00a7 11F, and that the \u201cinjury alleged is inconsistent with the aims and purposes of the entire regulatory scheme.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc., supra </em>at 294. \u201cInherent in the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>of [the governmental] obligations [in the administration of the regulatory scheme] are certain expressed public policies or concerns which can be vindicated by allowing those injured by official action allegedly inconsistent with these policies to challenge them.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Only in such circumstances do the plaintiffs, as intra-industry competitors, have standing to contest a governmental action that allegedly causes them harm. See <em>Cablevision Sys. Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecommunications &amp; Energy, </em>428 Mass. 436, 438 (1998), and cases cited. We therefore begin with an analysis of the purposes G. L. c. 25A, \u00a7 11F.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">General Laws c. 25A, \u00a7 11F, was enacted in 1997 as part of a bill that restructured the electric utility industry in Massachusetts to establish consumer electricity rate savings through market-based competition. St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7 50. See generally <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>431 Mass. 251 (2000). The \u201ckey feature\u201d of Massachusetts\u2019s restructuring effort was the unbundling of the process of providing electricity to end-use consumers, which was accomplished by requiring the strict corporate separation of the responsibilities for generation, transmission, distribution, and retail sale of electricity. Alperin &amp; Chase, Consumer Law \u00a7 27.4 (2d ed. 2001). It was anticipated that the introduction of competition in each stage of the generation and distribution process would encourage innovation and efficiency and improve service for all market participants. St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 <em>1(f) </em>&amp; (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Encompassed within the purview of St. 1997, c. 164, was the Legislature\u2019s intention to promote renewable energy production, which it linked with long-term rate reduction and the fostering of competitive balance in Massachusetts\u2019s utilities market. See St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7 1(1) (\u201cthe primary elements of a more competitive electricity market will be customer choice, preservation and augmentation of consumer protections, full and fair competition in generation, and enhanced environmental protection goals\u201d). The Legislature attempted to accomplish this goal, in part, by enacting G. L. c. 25A, \u00a7 11F, which establishes the renewable energy portfolio standard. Section 11F of c. 25A requires all retail electricity suppliers selling electricity to end-use customers to supply a certain percentage of that electricity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>from new renewable energy generating sources.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In order to satisfy the renewable energy portfolio standard, retail electricity suppliers must purchase the quantity of renewable energy credits specified by the division from qualifying renewable energy generating units as so designated by the division. See 225 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 14.07-14.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">The division has promulgated \u201crenewable energy portfolio standard\u201d regulations to establish a procedure by which the owner or operator of a qualifying generating unit can obtain a license \u2014 known as a statement of qualification \u2014 to sell renewable energy credits to retail electricity suppliers. 225 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.06. In order to obtain a statement of qualification, an owner or operator must first submit an application to the division. 225 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.06(1). The division then evaluates the application to determine if the generating unit meets the eligibility requirements. <em>Ibid. </em>If an owner or operator receives a statement of qualification, the generating unit remains subject to periodic emissions testing by the Department of Environmental Protection and an obligation to report changes in operation to the division. 225 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.06(3). Once an owner or operator obtains a valid statement of qualification, it may sell the renewable energy credits accrued from renewable electricity generation to Massachusetts retail electricity suppliers. See 225 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 14.07-14.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">With this understanding of the purposes of G. L. c. 25A, \u00a7 11F, we turn to the judge\u2019s ruling that, as pleaded, the plaintiffs were not in a \u201cregulated industry,\u201d as that term is used to determine standing, and did not meet the regulated industry exception. In addressing the issue, the judge concluded that the purpose of G. L. c. 25A, \u00a7 11F, is \u201cto promote the use of renewable energy in generating power in the electric market in Massachusetts\u201d and that the statute does not \u201cregulate competition, nor does it control pricing or the market in which electricity is generated and sold.\u201d The judge further concluded that issuance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>of the statement of qualification \u201cis not a control over competition or pricing,\u201d that the role of the division under the statute is \u201cthat of a gatekeeper, not a regulator,\u201d and that \u201c[o]nce an entity is through the gate, the market in [renewable energy credits] is essentially and wholly unregulated.\u201d This analysis, which fails to take into account the considerable authority that the Legislature granted the division to establish, develop, and administer the renewable energy credit market, was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Here, we are persuaded that renewable energy generators participating in the renewable energy portfolio standard program created under G. L. c. 25A, \u00a7 11F, are part of a regulated industry as that term has been used in determining standing under the regulated industry exception. While there is no formally-stated test in Massachusetts jurisprudence for determining when an industry is \u201cregulated,\u201d we take note of several factors, including those distilled from the cases which have discussed the applicability of the regulated industry exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">We begin with the important point that the renewable energy portfolio program, which is the responsibility of the division, is entirely a creature of government. As we have discussed, G. L. c. 25A, \u00a7 11F, was enacted, in part, to require retail suppliers of electricity in Massachusetts to purchase a certain percentage of their electricity sales portfolio from renewable energy generators. G. L. c. 25A, \u00a7 11F. It was enacted to foster competition in a dormant renewable energy market. The effectuation of that goal and program is lodged largely in the intervention and oversight by the division.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The defendants counter that the renewable energy portfolio program was part of a legislative deregulation scheme to unbundle the process of providing electricity to end users and that thus, by definition, the renewable energy portfolio standard program cannot be characterized as implicating or creating a \u201cregulated industry.\u201d We think that such an argument is unpersuasive and sweeps too broadly. Here, the statutory scheme does not contemplate governmental abdication of involvement in the energy markets, but a restructuring of the roles of participating entities. Moreover, and very significantly, the defendants\u2019 characterization is inapposite because relevant aspects of the legislation at issue actually regulate <em>renewable </em>energy purchases by creating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>a market that would not otherwise exist. In accordance with the express purpose of G. L. c. 25A, \u00a7 11F, and the stated purpose of St. 1997, c. 164, the division thus is tasked with regulating retail electricity suppliers to achieve long-term competitive balance and consumer rate reductions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Absent c. 25A, \u00a7 11F, a retail electricity supplier in Massachusetts would have no obligation to purchase renewable electricity for its customers. The division\u2019s role under c. 25A, \u00a7 11F, is especially significant given the Legislature\u2019s determination that, as part of the long-term plan for reducing consumer electricity rates, the promotion of renewable electricity generation is necessary. G. L. c. 25A, \u00a7 11F St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7 1(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">It is also significant, as an indicium of a government-dependent artificial market \u2014 subject to regulation with resulting price impact \u2014 that the division retains the exclusive control over the annual percentage of the electricity portfolio that must be comprised of renewable energy and must be purchased from the market established by the Legislature and administered by the division. As G. L. c. 25A, \u00a7 llF(a), sets forth: \u201cEvery retail supplier shall provide a minimum percentage of kilowatt-hours sales to end-use customers . . . from new renewable energy generating sources, according to the following schedule: (i) an additional 1 per cent of sales by December 31, 2003, or one calendar year from the final day of the first month in which the average cost of any renewable technology is found to be within 10 per cent of the overall average spot-market price per kilowatt-hour . . . , whichever is sooner; (ii) an additional one-half of 1 per cent of sales each year thereafter until December 31, 2009; and (iii) an additional 1 per cent of sales every year thereafter until a date determined by the division of energy resources.\u201d See 225 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.07(1) (establishing cumulative minimum percentage of renewable power a retail electricity supplier must purchase), and \u00a7 14.07(2) (giving the division the power to suspend the annual one-half percent increase after 2009 as well as the discretion as to when to reinstitute the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>increase). As such, the division is not a passive gatekeeper, but retains considerable discretion over the present and future demand by retail electricity suppliers for renewable energy credits. See <em>South Shore Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Board of Bank </em>Incorporation, 351 Mass. 363, 367-368 (1966) (defendant\u2019s statutory requirement to account for the effect bank relocation had on competitors was of import in establishing standing under the regulated industry theory). In this manner, the division influences, in a significant way, the pricing of renewable energy credits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This impact distinguishes the present case from our earlier decision in <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Cosmetology Schs., Inc., </em>where the applicable statute specifically stated that the board of registration in cosmetology was not authorized \u201cto regulate or fix compensation or prices.\u201d 40 Mass. App. Ct. at 709 (purpose of the statute did \u201cnot encompass the control of competition or pricing in the . . . industry\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Another indicium of a regulated industry, present here, is that the competitors are regulated by the division at all stages of the process. Thus, at the very outset, the division maintains control over market entry. As we have noted, the division defines the market participants in a very real way and exercises exclusive control over the minimum annual percentage each retail supplier must purchase from renewable energy generating sources. Green-ville and Boralex acknowledge that the division \u201chas broad discretion in establishing the criteria for qualifying generators.\u201d In order to receive a statement of qualification, an owner or operator seeking to qualify a generating unit must prepare a detailed application, submit to a thorough review by the division, and satisfy the eligibility requirements of 225 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.06. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Only after receiving the statement of qualification is the owner or operator entitled to sell renewable energy credits accrued at its facility to retail electricity providers in Massachusetts to allow those providers to satisfy the renewable energy portfolio standard. While this degree of regulation, considered alone, may not be outcome determinative, see <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Cosmetology Schs., Inc., supra </em>at 709 (licensing and operating requirements alone are insufficient to make participants part of a regulated industry), it is a relevant factor in determining whether a regulated industry exists for the purpose of standing analysis.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Furthermore, the division retains a substantial continuing supervisory role over market eligibility. This includes the requirement that the owner or operator of a qualifying facility notify the division of any change in eligibility status. 225 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.06(3). In addition, the division may \u201csuspend or revoke a Statement of Qualification\u201d for noncompliance with the applicable regulations. 225 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.06(4). By maintaining this continuing involvement with respect to market eligibility, the division has considerable ongoing influence over the supply of renewable energy credits reaching its market.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Finally, we note that another indicium of a regulated industry is a scheme designed to promote reasonable competition within the industry or to protect intra-industry competitors from an uneven playing field. <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc., </em>373 Mass, at 295. See generally Breyer, Regulation and Its Reform 15-35 (1982) (variety and mixture of rationales). The judge here concluded that the renewable energy portfolio program cannot be a regulated industry on the ground that G. L. c. 25A, \u00a7 11F, only creates incentives for use of renewable energy sources, but does not impose restraints on competition. However, as we have discussed, the statute here embodies a scheme to promote and to control competition in the renewable energy marketplace. This includes specific language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>restricting energy source types and inclusion of energy based on the operation dates of certain facilities. Promotion of competition by maintaining a level playing field is a valid purpose for the regulated industry exception. See <em>Everett Town Taxi, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Everett, </em>366 Mass, at 538-539 (multiple taxicab companies operating in Everett had standing to sue other competing taxicab companies based on allegation of conflict of interest; \u201ccompetitors of those receiving favored treatment ought to be within the class of persons protected and thereby have standing to sue under the statute\u201d). This component of promotion of competition distinguishes the renewable portfolio program from other cases where that component was absent, and where the regulated industry exception did not apply so as to confer standing for competitors.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Cosmetology Schs., Inc., supra </em>at 708-709 (statutory scheme did not attempt to control or promote competition in the industry; in fact, a specific statutory provision essentially stated that the board could not restrict or control competition); <em>Circle Lounge &amp; Grille, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>324 Mass. 427, 429-430 (1949) (concern was land use regulation, not protection or control of competition).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">As we have concluded, in light of the foregoing factors, that competitors in the renewable energy portfolio program participate in a regulated industry, we must next consider the second prong of the regulated industry exception \u2014 whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claims fall within the scope of the statute so as to show \u201csufficient injury to establish standing.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc., supra </em>at 294. See <em>Enos </em>v. <em>Secretary of Environmental Affairs, </em>432 Mass. 132, 135 (2000). Here, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims do fall within the scope of G. L. c. 25A, \u00a7 11F, as they allege that the division\u2019s procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>and substantive irregularities in issuing the statements of qualification disrupted pricing in the renewable energy credit market and inappropriately awarded the allegedly nonqualifying facilities permission to participate in the Massachusetts market. These alleged irregularities, which purportedly permitted an influx of inappropriately granted renewable energy credits into the Massachusetts market, threaten the plaintiffs\u2019 competitive position in that market by forcing them to compete against renewable generating units allegedly using impermissible fuel sources. The plaintiffs allege that these units did not necessarily require the substantial construction investments required to obtain a statement of qualification and now have lower operating costs due to the impermissible fuel sources \u2014 resulting in a competitive disadvantage to the plaintiffs who have complied with the regulations. The division\u2019s purported actions, if substantiated, disrupt the renewable electricity credit market and frustrate the promotion of competitive renewable electricity generation in Massachusetts. See <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc., supra </em>at 295 (where the Legislature defined goals including precluding unreasonable competition and discriminatory rate setting, the plaintiffs, who were participants in the industry, alleged unreasonable competition and business injury, satisfying standing). The division\u2019s alleged allowance of impermissible fuel sources does not foster actual, renewable energy generation in Massachusetts and is thus inherently inconsistent with the intent of St. 1996, c. 164, and G. L. c. 25A, \u00a7 11F. As they have alleged, the \u201c[pjlaintiffs have an interest in ensuring that the [renewable energy credits] market is not diluted by power that is not truly \u2018new\u2019 (i.e. post-1998) and \u2018renewable\u2019 (i.e., based on use of organic materials as opposed to [construction and demolition debris]).\u201d In sum, the plaintiffs have alleged an economic and competitive injury \u201cwhich on its face implicates the effectuation of [the] important public policies . . . within the statutory zone of concern\u201d embodied in G. L. c. 25A, \u00a7 11F. <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc., </em>373 Mass, at 295. Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiffs have established standing. The judgment of the Superior Court of October 2, 2006, is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b119-10\">All references to Title 225 of the Code of Massachusetts Regulations are to the April 26, 2002, version.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b119-11\">In accordance with New England Power Pool Generation Information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>System Operation Rules 2.1(a) (2004), a renewable energy credit is awarded for every megawatt-hour of electricity produced.

Regs. \u00a7 14.08(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b126-7\">While the defendants claim that the regulated industry exception requires that an agency actually control or fix pricing within the industry, there is no case that so holds. Rather, the tenor of the cases is consistent with a requirement that the agency\u2019s decision must affect in a meaningful way the over-all parameters of competition, which may include the price of the good or service. See, e.g., <em>South Shore Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Board of Bank Incorporation, supra </em>at 367-368 (banking industry); <em>Everett Town Taxi, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Everett, </em>366 Mass, at 538 (taxicabs).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u201cInsofar as the defendants appear to argue that to satisfy the regulated industry exception, the plaintiffs must establish that the government issued mutually exclusive privileges or licenses, we note that the exception has been applied and standing found in cases involving multiple competitor/nonexclusive licensing situations. See <em>Everett Town Taxi, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Everett, </em>366 Mass, at 538-539; <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc., </em>373 Mass, at 294.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b128-5\">We note that while it might be the case that the statutory framework also regulates retail electricity suppliers by mandating purchase of renewable energy credits, that objective neither diminishes nor is inconsistent with our determination that the renewable energy generators are direct participants in a regulated industry and market. We further note that as the current market is designed, those suppliers have no real incentive to ensure fair play between the renewable energy generators. Given that the division has allegedly issued impermissible statements of qualification, the only market participants with any real incentive to ensure that renewable energy generators are abiding by the applicable regulations are competing generators.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
