Following a difficult and stressful nine-month tenure as the department\u2019s superintendent, Fender attempted suicide, was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, and was unable thereafter to return to work. The Plymouth County retirement board rejected his application for accidental disability retirement benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7, and this denial was subsequently upheld by both the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB) and a judge in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">Fender appeals, arguing that the great weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that his permanent disability was caused both by an identifiable, uncommon workplace condition and by a series of work-related events, and that he is thus entitled to accidental retirement disability benefits. Because CRAB failed to explain the basis of its conclusion regarding several of the events proffered by Fender to satisfy his evidentiary burden, the matter must be remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\"><em>Background. </em>The following facts either were found by the division of administrative law appeals magistrate or are drawn from the materials and testimony specifically cited by the magistrate in support of these findings. Beginning in 1995, Fender was employed in the department, working primarily as town engineer. For approximately eight months in 1998, Fender functioned as both town engineer and acting superintendent of the DPW. Thereafter he again worked full time as town engineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>At or about the end of 2001, Fender again became acting superintendent of the DPW. In January of 2003, Fender was promoted to the position of superintendent. One month later, Marshfield experienced 51.3 inches of record snowfall, straining the capacity of Fender and the DPW to respond adequately, and causing Fender to worry whether the department could handle any further snow that season. In March, about two months after Fender\u2019s promotion to superintendent, Joe Roderick, who had been head of the Marshfield operations department<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for some forty years, passed away unexpectedly. Roderick had been an integral part of the operations department as well as the main liaison between management and the union; his passing was a considerable loss to Fender.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Throughout the spring and summer of the same year, 2003, Marshfield experienced a severe seaweed problem on its beaches, which fell to the DPW to resolve. Its budget, however, did not include allocations for the extensive and unexpected cleanup expenses that proved necessary. In addition, Fender had to deal with conflicting complaints from those who worried about the environmental impact of cleanup machinery and those who were eager to use the beaches, causing Fender to experience further stress.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Then, in August of that year, Joe Davis, Roderick\u2019s replacement in the operations department, attempted suicide with a shotgun; Davis did not return to work thereafter. Before taking the job as head of the operations department, Davis had been the highway supervisor, a position that was filled by an equipment operator when Davis became head of operations. When Davis did not return to work, the same equipment operator took over as the head of operations. The equipment operator position remained unfilled throughout this time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Shortly thereafter, a DPW employee in the engineering department<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> died of Legionnaires\u2019 disease. This caused hysteria in Marshfield and within the DPW because of the highly infectious nature of the disease. It also created yet another vacancy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>within the already short-staffed department with which Fender had to contend, amplifying his feelings of stress.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Throughout August and September, 2003, Fender was working up to fifteen hours per day in the department and also attending evening town meetings. Fender worked throughout the day on Saturday, September 13, 2003, to prepare for a budget meeting scheduled for the following Monday. On that Monday, September 15, 2003, the air conditioning system malfunctioned in the highway garage, and staff members threatened Fender that they would leave work unless the cooling system was fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">At that evening\u2019s DPW board meeting \u2014 a meeting that lasted until 11:00 p.m. \u2014 Fender and his supervisors discussed the performance of the DPW and of Fender himself. In particular, there was discussion about creating goals, tied to compensatory incentives, for Fender to accomplish. The board also criticized Fender\u2019s management style.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">On Tuesday, September 16, 2003, Fender worked but did not feel well. He felt as though he was unable to keep up with the work demanded of him. The next day, Fender did not go to work but walked the beach contemplating suicide. On Thursday, September 18, 2003, Fender unsuccessfully attempted suicide by slicing his wrists and taking an overdose of Paxil. Over the next several months, Fender underwent a lengthy psychiatric hospitalization and psychotherapy, ultimately filing an application for accidental disability retirement benefits on March 17, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">Fender\u2019s application cited \u201cextreme work related stress resulting in severe clinical anxiety and depression leading to a serious suicide attempt.\u201d Fender listed as cause the above-described events. A regional medical panel, convened at the behest of the Plymouth County retirement board, examined Fender on August 13, 2004. The panel, comprised of two board-certified psychiatrists and one neurologist, answered unanimously in the affirmative to all certificate questions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 6(3). In re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>sponse to a request for clarification from the Plymouth County retirement board, the medical panel further unanimously opined that \u201cthe personal injury sustained or hazard undergone [by Fender] which is the basis of the claimed disability is the continuing inadequate staffing for demands made upon the claimant by his superiors.\u201d On January 4, 2005, the Plymouth County retirement board denied Fender\u2019s application for accidental disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Fender timely filed an appeal with the division of administrative law appeals. After an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate affirmed the denial of benefits. In her memorandum of decision, the magistrate recited the above facts and concluded that Fender had not proved the requisite causal nexus between a work-related injury and his disability. Specifically, the magistrate concluded that the September 15, 2003, meeting with the DPW board constituted a noncompensable \u201cbona fide, personnel action\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and could not be considered in the analysis of Fender\u2019s application. The magistrate also declined to include in the calculus the \u201ctwo deaths and one suicide attempt in [Fender\u2019s] department\u201d; they \u201ccannot form the basis of [Fender\u2019s] claim,\u201d she stated, \u201cbecause these events are not \u2018personal injuries\u2019 to [Fender].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">On March 6, 2006, CRAB adopted as its own the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact in their entirety and summarily affirmed her disposition of Fender\u2019s application. Pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, Fender took an appeal in the Superior Court; the judge there declined to disturb CRAB\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>Judicial review of CRAB decisions under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7, is \u201cnarrow and highly deferential,\u201d <em>Sugrue </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd.., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 5 n.5 (1998), as reviewing courts give considerable deference to CRAB\u2019s experience and discretionary administrative authority. <em>Plymouth County Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number><em>Appeal Bd., </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 114, 119 (2003). A CRAB decision may only be set aside or modified if, \u201cafter giving due regard to GRAB\u2019S expertise . . . , the appellant has convincingly demonstrated that CRAB\u2019s decision was, considering the entirety of the record \u2014 including non-medical as well as medical facts . . . \u25a0 \u2014 \u25a0 based upon an error of law or wholly unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Sugrue </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. at 5 n.5.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We take an approach \u201cof judicial deference and restraint, but not abdication.\u201d Arn<em>one </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Social Servs., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 33, 34 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">For its part, in order to enable meaningful judicial review, CRAB must with each decision provide \u201ca statement of reasons for the decision, including determination of each issue of fact or law necessary to the decision.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(8). Administrative decisions such as these must be based on substantial evidence as well as reasoned findings; this is what makes effective judicial review possible. \u201cAlthough \u00a7 11(8) does not call for all agency decisions to include a lengthy statement of factual and legal conclusions, it does require an agency to make subsidiary findings of fact on all issues relevant and material to its decision and <em>to explain its reasons for reaching the conclusion(s) that it has based on those subsidiary findings\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). <em>Vinal </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 85, 92 (1982). Without such guidance, reviewing courts are hampered in ascertaining whether CRAB \u201capplied correct principles of law to the facts found\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">With respect to the substance of an application for accidental disability retirement benefits, an applicant must show that he is \u201cunable to perform the essential duties of his job and that such inability is likely to be permanent ... by reason of a personal injury sustained ... as a result of, and while in the performance of, his duties . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7(1), as amended by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>St. 1996, c. 306, \u00a7 14. It is well established that \u201c[e]motional disability may constitute a personal injury within the meaning of the workers\u2019 compensation act, G. L. c. 152,[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] see <em>Kelly\u2019s Case, </em>394 Mass. 684, 686 (1985), and the term \u2018personal injury\u2019 is given the same meaning under G. L. c. 32. <em>Zavaglia </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd,., </em>345 Mass. 483, 486 (1963).\u201d <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 479, 482-483 (1985). See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>414 Mass. 360, 361 n.1 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">In order to establish his entitlement to accidental disability retirement benefits as a result of his emotional disabihty, Fender was required to prove \u201cone of two hypotheses: that his disability stemmed from \u2018a single work-related event or series of events,\u2019 <em>Kelly\u2019s Case, </em>394 Mass, [at] 688 . . . ; or, if the disability was the product of gradual deterioration, that \u2018the employment [had] exposed [Fender] to \u201can identifiable condition . . . that is not common and necessary to all or a great many occupations.\u201d \u2019 <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. 590, 595 (1982). Proof of either hypothesis had to satisfy the strict causation standard imposed by [G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7(1)]: that [Fender\u2019s] employment was \u2018a natural and proximate cause of the incapacity.\u2019 <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 1018 (1984).\u201d <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">On appeal from the Superior Court judgment affirming CRAB\u2019s decision, Fender contends that CRAB erred in determining that he did not suffer a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d within the terms of G. L. c. 152 and, further, that he satisfied the requirements under both of the alternate theories of eligibility enunciated in <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra </em>at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">1. <em>Identifiable condition. </em>CRAB concluded that stress caused by job pressures, including increasing demands by superiors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>unfilled departmental vacancies, is common to management positions across a broad spectrum of employment and that Fender therefore did not satisfy his burden with respect to the second <em>Blanchette </em>theory. See <em>ibid. </em>We discern no error in CRAB\u2019s comparative analysis of different professions, an undertaking that was, in the circumstances of this case, properly within the province of its expertise. See <em>Lisbon </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 257 (1996) (agency\u2019s \u201cexperience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge\u201d granted deference). Nor do we detect anything in the evidence pointing to an \u201coverwhelming probability\u201d that CRAB erred in this analysis. <em>Cobble </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Social Servs., </em>430 Mass. 385, 391 (1999), quoting from <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 466 (1981). Hence, we decline to disturb its conclusion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">2. <em>Work-related events. </em>As noted, a mental or emotional disability stemming from a series of work-related events has long been recognized as being a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 152 on which a grant of accidental disability retirement benefits may properly be based. See <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 485; <em>Plymouth County Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. at 118. See also <em>Albanese\u2019s Case, </em>378 Mass. 14, 14-15 (1979) (\u201cWe hold that if an employee is incapacitated by a mental or emotional disorder causally related to a series of specific stressful work-related incidents, the employee is entitled to compensation\u201d); <em>Robinson\u2019s Case, </em>416 Mass. 454, 458-460 (1993); <em>May\u2019s Case, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 209 (2006). Fender relies upon the following series of events as having caused his disability: (1) the 51-inch snowfall, (2) the death of Joe Roderick, (3) the seaweed cleanup, (4) Joe Davis\u2019s suicide attempt, (5) the fatal case of Legionnaires\u2019 disease and its aftermath, (6) his onerous work schedule in August and September of 2003, (7) the threatened walkout by employees, and (8) the DPW board meeting on September 15, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">As to the eighth event, the September 15, 2003, board meeting, Fender argues that it was error for CRAB to conclude, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A) (see note 5, <em>supra), </em>that the DPW board meeting was a \u201cbona fide, personnel action,\u201d and thus did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>not qualify as a triggering event for a personal injury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is true that the question whether a mental or emotional injury arises \u201cprincipally out of a bona fide, personnel action\u201d is normally within the scope of a magistrate\u2019s competence. <em>Robinson\u2019s Case, </em>416 Mass, at 459 n.3. However, even if the subject board meeting was a \u201cbona fide, personnel action,\u201d a matter we need not decide, CRAB conceded at oral argument that there was no evidence to support a finding that Fender\u2019s disability arose \u201cprincipally\u201d out of that meeting. We can thus discern no basis on which to exclude the DPW board meeting from the series of events that Fender contends gave rise to his personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">With respect to Roderick\u2019s death, Davis\u2019s suicide attempt, and the employee\u2019s death from Legionnaires\u2019 disease, Fender does not contend that each such event itself caused the personal injury he sustained. He claims instead that each event carried in its wake direct \u201cfallout,\u201d such as personnel vacancy and staffing concerns, that had a significant impact on him, each being part of the series of work-related events that gave rise to his personal injury. That is to say, Fender maintains that the increased workplace demands on him and the increased stress he experienced after and because of the deaths and suicide attempt, combined with all of the other events cited, together caused his disability. CRAB concluded without explanation that the three events could not form the basis of Fender\u2019s claim because the individual events themselves were not \u201cpersonal injuries\u201d to Fender. The view articulated by CRAB departs from the statutory definition of the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as set forth in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A) (see note 7, <em>supra), </em>and from the construction of the term in relevant decisional law. See, e.g., <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd.., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 485 n.4 (\u201cAs <em>Kelly\u2019s Case </em>makes clear [394 Mass, at 687], the specific event or series of events need not be unusually stressful or traumatic to support a recovery so long as the event or events in fact cause the disability\u201d); <em>May\u2019s Case, 61 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 213, quoting from <em>Robinson\u2019s Case, </em>416 Mass, at 460 (\u201c[t]here is nothing in [G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>c. 152] to suggest that emotional disability is compensable only if it resulted from an \u2018unusual and objectively stressful or traumatic event.\u2019 . . . The finding that the employee\u2019s disability was causally related to a series of events at work is sufficient as long as those events [meet the required causal standard] bringing about the employee\u2019s disability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Apart from its apparent misapprehension of the statutory language, CRAB\u2019s conclusory declaration regarding the deaths and suicide attempt, without more, does not permit meaningful judicial review of its decision. CRAB fails to provide a reasoned explanation that would illuminate the basis for its decision to disregard these incidents. Simply put, we cannot discern why the subject events were not factored into the analysis whether Fender\u2019s disability constituted a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d within the meaning of the statute and, if these events were to be considered, whether CRAB\u2019s conclusions as to Fender\u2019s eligibility for benefits would change.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We are left in the untenable position of not knowing which principles of law were applied to the facts found and why CRAB omitted the subject events from its inquiry. Under such circumstances, we must remand for clarification by the agency. See <em>Vinal </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. at 92-93; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 1032, 1035 (1989). See also <em>Retirement Bd. of Somerville </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 673, 678-679 (1995), and cases cited.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">On remand, and consistent with the foregoing, CRAB is to review Fender\u2019s application for accidental disability retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>benefits to the extent that his claim of a cognizable personal injury is predicated on the series of work-related events proffered. Because the \u201cretirement law is notoriously complex,\u201d we \u201chope to have the benefit of [CRAB\u2019s] experience\u201d by its further consideration of the issues and a fuller explanation of its reasoning. <em>Namay </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 456, 463 (1985). \u201cBy no means are we saying that [CRAB] should find for [Fender],\u201d <em>Yerardi\u2019s Moody St. Restaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Randolph, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 301 (1985), nor are we endorsing the opposite result. Indeed, regardless of the outcome, CRAB must provide a reasoned explanation of both its reevaluation of this issue and any conclusions it may reach concerning Fender\u2019s eligibility for accidental disability retirement benefits under other relevant statutory criteria. Further fact finding, if necessary to satisfy the requirements of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(8), may also be undertaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of the Superior Court is vacated and a new judgment shall enter affirming the decision of CRAB insofar as it found that Fender was not eligible for disability retirement benefits under the \u201cidentifiable condition hypothesis,\u201d vacating the decision insofar as it found that Fender was not eligible under the \u201cseries of work-related events hypothesis,\u201d and recommitting the case to CRAB for a redetermination of Fender\u2019s entitlement to disability retirement benefits consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\">The operations department is a subdivision of the Marshfield DPW; Roderick reported to Fender, the superintendent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b783-9\">As with the operations department, the engineering department is a subdivision of the DPW under the purview of the superintendent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b784-9\">The medical panel answered unanimously in the affirmative to the following standard certificate questions: \u201c(1) Is the member mentally or physically incapable of performing the essential duties of his or her job as described in the current job description?\u201d <em>\u201c(2) </em>Is said incapacity likely to be permanent?\u201d \u201c(3) Is said incapacity such as might be the natural and proximate result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>the personal injury sustained or hazard undergone on account of which retirement is claimed?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b785-10\">By St. 1986, c. 662, \u00a7 6, G.
