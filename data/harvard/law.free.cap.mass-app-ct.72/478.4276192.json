L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(m), and one count of possessing ammunition without a firearm identification (FID) card (indictment number BRCR 2005-00946-2), in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(A). Prior to pleading guilty, the defendant moved for relief pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 13(c), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1517 (2004), arguing that the sentencing provisions of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(m), are ambiguous and contradictory. After a hearing, that motion was allowed. The defendant then entered a plea of guilty on all counts and was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>On the counts pertaining to the first offense, the defendant was sentenced to a term of not less than one year and not more than one year and one day. On the second offense, the defendant was sentenced to three years of probation to commence from and after the defendant\u2019s release from incarceration on the first offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commonwealth\u2019s appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">General Laws c. 269, \u00a7 10(m), inserted by St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 70, provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u201cany person . . . who knowingly has in his possession . . . a large capacity weapon . . . who does not possess a valid . . . license to carry firearms . . . shall be punished by imprisonment in a state prison for not less than two and one-half years nor more than ten years. The possession of a valid firearm identification card issued under section 129B shall not be a defense for a violation of this subsection; provided, however, that any such person charged with violating this paragraph and holding a valid firearm identification card shall not be subject to any mandatory minimum sentence imposed by this paragraph. The sentence imposed upon such person shall not be reduced to less than one year, nor suspended, nor shall any person convicted under this subsection be eligible for probation, parole, furlough, work release or receive any deduction from his sentence for good conduct until he shall have served such minimum term of such sentence . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The defendant contends that the sentencing provisions of \u00a7 10(m) are hopelessly ambiguous and, as a result, he is entitled to application of the so-called \u201crule of lenity,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Carrion, 431 Mass. 44, 45-46 (2000), with the result that the minimum sentence that may be imposed on the defendant is the minimum term of <em>imprisonment </em>described in the third sentence of \u00a7 10(m), viz., one year (\u201c[t]he sentence imposed upon such person shall not be reduced to less than one year\u201d), as opposed to the two and one-half year minimum sentence described in the first sentence (\u201cshall be punished by imprisonment in a state prison for not less than two and one-half years\u201d). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Without question, this statute is no grammatical paragon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, that fact does not relieve us of the burden of applying the traditional rules of statutory construction in our interpretation of the provision. Of particular relevance here is the principle requiring us, if at all possible, to give effect to all the words of a statute, assuming none to be superfluous. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Shea, 46 Mass. App. Ct. 196, 197 (1999). Likewise, where possible, we must seek to harmonize the provisions of any statute with related provisions where they are part of a single statutory scheme. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hampe, </em>419 Mass. 514, 518 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Mindful of these precepts, we conclude that \u00a7 10(m) must be interpreted as follows. In general, a person convicted under \u00a7 10(m) who, at the time of the offense, did not possess a valid FID card, must be sentenced to a minimum sentence of two and one-half years in a State prison, but not more than ten years. Further, by its express terms, and consistent with G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133, the so-called \u201ctruth in sentencing act,\u201d no portion of any sentence imposed under \u00a7 10(m) may be suspended.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, a person so convicted under \u00a7 10(m) must serve a minimum term of imprisonment in a State prison of not less than one year, and that term may not be reduced by any means, including (but not limited to) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>those enumerated in the statute (i.e., parole, furlough, and so forth). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>431 Mass. 772, 775-777 (2000) (discussing earlier version of home invasion statute, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As for a person convicted under \u00a7 10(ra) who, at the time of the offense, possessed a valid FID card, we express no opinion as to the sentence that may be imposed, since the defendant does not assert that he ever possessed an FID card. However, to the extent that \u00a7 10(m) provides that a holder of a valid FID card \u201cshall not be subject to any mandatory minimum sentence\u201d prescribed in the subsection, it would arguably appear that such a person could not be subject to the minimum term of imprisonment provision of \u00a7 10(m) either. In any event, we have no occasion to decide that issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">This result is consistent with our holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 16-17 (1986), in which we concluded that the phrase \u201c[t]he sentence imposed upon such person shall not be reduced to less than one year,\u201d as it appeared in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24G(a), did not operate to change the minimum sentence prescribed for violation of that section; rather, the phrase merely defined the minimum term of imprisonment that must be served in connection with such a sentence (i.e., the minimum term of actual incarceration). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 776-777 (low end of sentencing range in statutes that prescribe a penalty expressed in terms of a range is \u201cmandatory minimum sentence,\u201d not the minimum term of imprisonment). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Claudio, </em>418 Mass. 103, 109 (1994). We note that the basis for imposing such a reading on \u00a7 10(ra) is even stronger than in the statute under review in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley. </em>Section 10(ra), unlike \u00a7 24G(a) at the time <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley </em>was decided, after setting out both the sentencing range and the requirement of a one-year minimum term of imprisonment, goes on to state that a person convicted under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>this section shall not be released \u201cuntil he shall have served such minimum term of such sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This construction makes it plain that the provision relating to the minimum term of imprisonment (\u201csuch minimum term\u201d) is wholly independent of the language setting out the sentencing range (\u201csuch sentence\u201d), and so preserves the two and one-half year minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">This construction also has the salutary effect of harmonizing \u00a7 10(m) with the over-all statutory scheme of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10. Had we adopted the approach urged by the defendant and concluded that, under a rule of lenity or otherwise, the third sentence of \u00a7 10(m) reduced the minimum end of the sentencing range for persons convicted under that provision to one year, it would have had the result of imposing a lesser penalty on persons convicted of possessing a large capacity weapon as opposed to those convicted of possessing an ordinary firearm, as to which the minimum sentence is two and one-half years in State prison and the minimum term of imprisonment is eighteen months. See G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a). In view of the enhanced threat posed by large capacity weapons, and their concomitant stricter regulation under the statutory licensing scheme, see, e.g., G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129B(6), such a result would be illogical.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The order allowing relief pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 13(c) is reversed. As to indictment number BRCR 2005-00946-1, the convictions are affirmed and the judgment is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court for resentencing in conformity with the foregoing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-14\">As defined in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-8\">No party has appealed from the conviction or sentence relating to this indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b506-6\">We would be remiss if we failed to acknowledge the degree of difficulty presented to trial judges when called upon to interpret this statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Our conclusion in this regard is based on the disjunctive use of the phrase \u201cnor suspended\u201d in the third sentence of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(;ra). The language in \u00a7 10(m) regarding the minimum term of imprisonment is essentially boilerplate, used in precisely the same form for many years, in many different criminal statutes long before the enactment of G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>369 Mass. 904, 905 n.1 (1976). It thus would not be reasonable to conclude that the sentencing provisions of \u00a7 10(m) could have been intended by the Legislature to modify in any way the operation of \u00a7 133. Indeed, fairly read, the two are harmonious; both prohibit suspended sentences altogether and the minimum term of imprisonment imposed by \u00a7 10(m) is included within the minimum imposed by \u00a7 133 (i.e., \u00a7 10[m]\u2019s \u201cnot be reduced to less than one year\u201d does not conflict with the enhanced two and one-half year minimum term of imprisonment required by \u00a7 133). Any other interpretation of \u00a7 10(m) would effectively nullify \u00a7 133 as to a large number of criminal statutes containing sentencing language similar to \u00a7 10(m), see, e.g., G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B(a); G. L. c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 24(l)(a)(l), 24(2)(a V2)(2), 24G, and 24L(1); G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a), a result that would be incompatible with our responsibility to reconcile related statutes where possible. See <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 347, 350 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b507-6\">We note that \u00a7 10(m), like the provision at issue in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>prescribes a sentence expressed in terms of a range (two and one-half to ten years), and so complies with the requirements of G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24, which requires that sentences to State prison be expressed in terms of a maximum and minimum penalty. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>449 Mass. 183, 191 n.4 (2007) (applicable only in situations where criminal statutes do not prescribe penalty expressed in terms of a range and so conflict with the requirements of G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\">It is worth noting that Justice Kaplan in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley </em>recommended precisely this additional language to improve the clarity of such statutes. <em>Id. </em>at 17. General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24G(a), has since been amended to add this phrase. See St. 1986, c. 620, \u00a7 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b508-7\">Green, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoCR\">(concurring). I agree with the result reached by the court, as well as the reasoning of the court\u2019s opinion. I write separately to observe that the sentencing provisions of the statute at issue in the present case suffer from much the same incoherence as formerly afflicted the home invasion statute, G. L. c. 265, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>\u00a7 18C, prior to its amendment by St. 2004, c. 150, \u00a7 17. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>431 Mass. 772, 780-781 (2000). In particular, though the third sentence of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(m), prohibits reduction of the two and one-half year minimum sentence prescribed by the first sentence of that section, under applicable good time and parole procedures no such reduction would be possible even in the absence of such a prohibition. Our interpretation of the statute nonetheless to require a mandatory minimum sentence of two and one-half years accordingly risks rendering the provisions of the third sentence meaningless or superfluous, in contravention of the familiar canon of construction acknowledged by the majority. See <em>ante </em>at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The portion of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C, added by St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 57, and described as \u201clacking in coherence\u201d by the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 780, was not directly at issue in that case. Three years later, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berte, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 29 (2003), when forced to confront the provision directly, we construed the language to authorize a judge to impose a sentence of less than twenty years on a person convicted of home invasion while armed with a firearm, notwithstanding that the statute mandated a minimum sentence of twenty years for home invasion armed with a weapon other than a firearm, basing that conclusion on the principle of lenity. See <em>id. </em>at 33, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrone, </em>387 Mass. 702, 705 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Despite these tensions, I join with the majority in the present case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berte, supra, </em>is distinguishable from the present case in that the phrasing of the portion of the home invasion statute added by the 1998 amendment did not impose a mandatory minimum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In any event, \u201c[wjhen rules of statutory construction produce conflicting results, we must discern, as closely as possible, what the Legislature intended. See <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Stockholms Enskilda Bank, </em>293 U.S. 84, 89 (1934) (canons of statutory construction apply to ascertain meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>statute, but if one canon does not effectuate purpose of statute as whole, it yields to \u2018the wider view in order that the will of the legislature shall not fail\u2019); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dale D., </em>431 Mass. 757, 760-761 (2000), and cases cited (\u2018We construe statutes in accordance with the Legislature\u2019s intent and in order to effectuate the purpose of their framers\u2019).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ R., </em>433 Mass. 515, 521 (2001). I am satisfied that (as observed by the majority) the Legislature did not intend to impose a lesser sentence on persons possessing a large capacity weapon than on those possessing an ordinary firearm, see <em>ante </em>at 482, and that any internal conflict in the phrasing of \u00a7 10(m) is the product of inadvertence rather than intent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Unlike the sentencing language contained in the first sentence of \u00a7 10(m), the first sentence of the 1998 amendment to the home invasion statute purported to impose a \u201csingle-term\u201d sentence of twenty years, language ordinarily interpreted by reference to the indeterminate sentencing statute, G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24, to set the maximum sentence rather than the minimum. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lightfoot, </em>391 Mass. 718, 718 n.1, 721 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-5\">I note that, apparently in response to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berte, supra, </em>the Legislature enacted St. 2004, c. 150, \u00a7 17, which deleted the portions of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7' 18C, previously described by the Supreme Judicial Court as \u201cnonsensical,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 780 n.12, thereby suggesting an intent other than the result produced by the <em>Berte </em>opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
