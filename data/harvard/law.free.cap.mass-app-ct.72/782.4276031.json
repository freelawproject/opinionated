The mother responded with a motion for summary judgment, which was allowed by the judge. As we agree with the father that summary judgment should not have entered for the mother, we vacate the judgment dismissing the father\u2019s complaint for modification and remand the matter to the Probate and Family Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The parties were married in 1984 and were divorced by a judgment of divorce nisi dated January 30, 2004. During the divorce proceedings the parties executed a separation agreement, which provided that they would share legal custody of the minor children and that the mother would have sole physical custody of the children.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judgment of divorce nisi appears to have incorporated that provision of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">On or about June 11, 2004, the father filed a complaint for modification alleging, as changes in circumstances, that the mother was neglecting, abusing, or otherwise ignoring Tom, that Tom had \u201cbecome extremely lonely and depressed\u201d as a result of the lack of attention, and that Tom, on numerous occasions since the divorce, had expressed his desire to live with the father.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The father requested that the court modify the divorce judgment so as to award him physical custody, or \u201cat least shared physical custody,\u201d of Tom and that Tom be allowed to relocate to Connecticut. Thereafter, the judge appointed counsel for the children and, on the father\u2019s motion, a guardian ad litem to investigate and make findings concerning the physical custody of the minor children and a visitation schedule for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">2. <em>The guardian ad litem\u2019s reports. </em>The guardian ad litem, Linda Cavallero, Ph.D.,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> submitted a thirty-three page initial report in November, 2005, and a supplemental report in Febru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>ary, 2006. Both reports are included in their entirety in the summary judgment materials and are relied on by the parties. Doctor Cavallero interviewed both the parties and the children on multiple occasions. In addition, she spoke with numerous \u201ccollateral contacts,\u201d including Helena Friedman, the children\u2019s (former) attorney; Peter G. Grey, Ph.D, a psychological consultant retained by the parties to help them \u201cwork out\u201d an agreement on child issues; the children\u2019s former and present nannies; the children\u2019s pediatrician; and a number of educators at the children\u2019s schools. Doctor Cavallero also conducted psychological testing on the parties and reviewed dozens of \u201crecords,\u201d including a letter of Dr. Grey to the parties dated October 21, 2004 (discussed <em>infra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Doctor Cavallero indicated that the parties are well educated successful professionals. Their divorce was a bitter one. The father reported to Dr. Cavallero that since the divorce Tom has repeatedly requested to live with him. The father also voiced his concern that the mother paid little attention to Tom and that Tom was \u201clonely\u201d at her home. Tom reported to Dr. Cavallero that his mother leaves for work in the morning before he leaves for school; the nanny drops him off at the bus stop and picks him up later. Continuing, Tom stated that although he sometimes \u201cdo[es] things\u201d with his mother in the evening, they really do not \u201cdo much.\u201d Tom acknowledged that, on occasion, he goes for a bicycle ride or plays golf with his mother. Tom indicated that he would like to try living with his father and \u201cthinks\u201d that his mother told him it would be all right with her. Tom stated that the \u201cbad side\u201d of such an arrangement would be that he would not see his mother as much. Tom reported that he was not really close to his sister. School personnel reported to Dr. Cavallero that Tom was doing well in school and was a \u201cpleasure\u201d to have in class. The children\u2019s current nanny, a college student and friend of Molly, \u201cexpressed no concern about the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Helena Friedman, who was involved with the family as counsel for the children between August, 2004, and the spring of 2005, reported that Tom had told her that he does a lot of activities with his father and that with his mother he goes to the movies, shops, plays golf, and has friends over. Tom informed Friedman that he wanted to live with his father and included within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>his reasons that the \u201cmother spent a lot of time going with [Molly] to the barn for horseback riding [counsel stated that Molly was involved with horseback riding on a daily basis; she apparently owns or has regular access to a horse], and that he had more fun at his father\u2019s house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">Doctor Peter Grey, who met with the parties and the children (on two occasions) to better understand the family situation, reported to the guardian ad litem that both parents are \u201cvery busy and stated that the children were raised by whoever was with them.\u201d He described Molly as \u201cindulged\u201d and \u201csomething of a \u2018manipulator\u2019 \u201d and stated that the mother\u2019s household \u201cseemed to be setup around [Molly\u2019s] needs more than [Tom\u2019s].\u201d He noted, for example, that when Molly went for riding lessons, Tom had to go along and spent his afternoon in the car rather than playing with peers. Doctor Grey reported that Tom \u201cwas not \u2018the prize child\u2019 at least by the mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">A nanny who had cared for the children for seven years (until the summer of 2002), but who had subsequently been given some access to the children by the father, expressed concern that Tom \u201cdoes not seem happy and that other people who have known him for a long time report that he looks \u2018sad.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Doctor Cavallero stated in her conclusions in her initial report that, in her opinion, \u201cboth parents are basically capable and love their children. [The mother\u2019s] strengths as a parent are her hard work and her commitment to her children.\u201d She noted, however, that the father appears to have a better appreciation of Tom\u2019s needs and experience, and that his \u201cstrengths are his empathy for both children, especially [Tom], and his willingness to adapt his current schedule to meet their needs.\u201d In contrast, the mother \u201ctends to view the situation from her perspective\u201d and in a \u201cself-serving manner.\u201d Doctor Cavallero stated that the father <em>\u201ccorrectly </em>notes that [Tom] is somewhat lonely in the mother\u2019s household, that his needs are not the priority and that [Tom] frequently comes second to the needs of his sister and his mother\u201d (emphasis supplied). Doctor Cavallero also stated that Tom had consistently expressed his preference to live with his father to numerous individuals (including Dr. Grey, attorney Friedman, his parents, and the guardian ad litem) and had stated as reasons that he had a longing to spend more time with his father, that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>been unable to spend consecutive days with him, and that he enjoyed the activities that he engaged in with his father. Doctor Cavallero opined and recommended that \u201cgiven [Tom\u2019s] long standing and developmentally appropriate request to live with his father and his apparently well-reasoned rationale, [Tom] should be allowed to move to the primary custody of his father with an access schedule with his mother comparable to what he has at the present with his father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Pursuant to an order of the court directing the guardian ad litem to speak with the child\u2019s current therapist, Dr. Cavallero contacted Anthony Wolf, Ph.D, who had been seeing Tom since some time after November 10, 2004, and submitted a supplemental report. Doctor Wolf reported on February 18, 2006, that at the time therapy began, Tom was suffering from stomach aches that most likely were related to stress. Indeed, both parents had expressed their concern that Tom was in the middle of their contentious disagreements concerning the divorce and parenting plan. Continuing, Dr. Wolf reported that Tom\u2019s stomach aches had substantially diminished and that he appears to be a well-functioning child who has a good relationship with his mother and enjoys the time he spends with his father. He described Tom as \u201cgenerally upbeat\u201d and did not think that he was depressed. Doctor Wolf acknowledged that he generally hears about \u201cissues\u201d from the mother, not from Tom, but stated that Tom is \u201cpretty open\u201d if questions are asked. Doctor Wolf also stated that at an earlier point in time when he discussed with Tom the possibility of living with his father, Tom had expressed an interest in spending more time with his father, although Dr. Wolf was not sure that Tom had thought through the issues thoroughly. Doctor Cavallero declined to modify her conclusions or recommendations as stated in her principal report subsequent to her conversation with Dr. Wolf.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">3. <em>The motion for summary judgment and opposition thereto. </em>On May 31, 2006, the mother filed a motion for summary judgment and an affidavit of undisputed facts (supported by numerous papers, including excerpts from the guardian ad litem\u2019s report, the guardian ad litem\u2019s supplemental report, excerpts from deposition transcripts, and school records). See Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 56(a) (1997). The mother averred in her affidavit that she did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>\u201cnot believe that anything [had] changed since the date of the divorce . . . that would warrant a change in custody.\u201d She stated, among other things, that Tom was a well behaved and well adjusted child with whom she participated in many activities, including golf and bicycle riding. She also stated that Tom participates in various sports, including karate, baseball, and swimming (activities which, she states, she attends), that he is in a stable environment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that he is doing well in school. Pointing to Dr. Cavallero\u2019s reports, the mother stated that at no time did the guardian ad litem find (nor did Dr. Grey, Dr. Wolf, or attorney Friedman report) that she had neglected or abused Tom or that Tom was depressed. To the contrary, the mother stated that Dr. Cavallero had found that she (the mother) was capable and loved her children, and that Dr. Wolf had concluded that Tom was not depressed and was generally upbeat. The mother also stated that the father had moved on several occasions within Connecticut, that a subsequent marriage of the father had been annulled, and that she did not believe that the father could provide a stable home for Tom. The mother indicated that Tom had never been away from home for more than two weeks and that a dramatic change in his living conditions (e.g., a new home, a new school, and new classmates) could be detrimental to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Thereafter, pursuant to Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 56(b) (2000), the father filed an opposition to the mother\u2019s motion together with an affidavit of disputed facts (supported by numerous papers) (rule 56[b] affidavit) and an affidavit of undisputed facts. A central thrust of the father\u2019s rule 56(b) affidavit is that the mother had misrepresented Dr. Cavallero\u2019s report and that the guardian ad litem did, in fact, find that Tom was lonely and neglected in the mother\u2019s household and that his needs were not being met by the mother. The father also attached as an exhibit to his rule 56(b) affidavit a letter from Dr. Grey to the parties dated October 21, 2004.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Doctor Grey states in his letter that Molly (who, Dr. Grey noted, has an active social life) was heavily invested in her equestrian interests and, in a very adolescent way, \u201cis aware that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>[Tom] exists but doesn\u2019t pay much attention to him.\u201d Continuing, Dr. Grey stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-5\">\u201cTen-year-old [Tom] presents a more complex picture and I have explained to both of you that I am concerned about his being more than just unhappy. He is dismayed about your arguing and suggests that the attention paid to [Molly] shortchanges him. Most importantly he is tom by the notion that his feelings about where he might like to live would wound or hurt one of you. Regardless of the decision (for which the adults in this matter need to be responsible) I believe that all of the parties need to work together so that he is not emotionally harmed. In my opinion, [Tom] is a child at risk to become clinically depressed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The father also averred that Tom had missed all or part of forty-three days of school in the last one and one-half years and that he was no longer involved in many sporting activities (which, he stated, the mother seldom attended). In addition, the father stated that because he had made new hires in his business, he had a \u201cgreat deal more flexibility\u201d to be with Tom. The father stated in his mle 56(b) affidavit that Tom is not given attention by his mother, that his needs are not being met, and that he continues to be a \u201csecond class citizen to his sister who\u201d is indulged by the mother. Continuing, the father stated that Tom has requested repeatedly that the father \u201ccontinue [the modification] process because he does not want to live in his mother\u2019s household.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">4. <em>The memorandum of decision and judgment. </em>After a hearing on the motion, the judge issued a memorandum of decision in which he found that \u201cwhile there are many allegations, assertions and charges made, there is an absence of genuine issues of material fact in dispute.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge noted, for example, that \u201csome of the assertions predate the entry of the divorce\u201d and \u201c[t]hat a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>ten year old boy may have \u2018reflected\u2019 that he wants to live with another parent is not necessarily surprising or unusual but does not rise to the level of the required change of circumstances even if proven.\u201d Continuing, the judge stated that \u201c[i]n terms of genuine issues of material fact to be tried regarding the allegations of [the mother\u2019s] ignoring, neglecting and abusing the child, they do not exist.\u201d The judge stated that the father\u2019s \u201coffers of proof simply cannot show that [the mother] is neglecting [Tom], even when considered in a light most favorable to [the father]. In place of evidence from which a trier of fact can infer that [Tom] is neglected, [the father] has produced conclusory statements and allegations by him not grounded on [the father\u2019s] personal knowledge.\u201d Based on the foregoing, the judge determined that the mother was entitled to summary judgment and dismissed the father\u2019s complaint for modification.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">5. <em>The governing legal principles. </em>Rule 56(a) of the Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure provides that \u201c[a] party may move for summary judgment subsequent to the commencement of any proceeding under these rules in actions for modification and actions to modify or enforce a foreign judgment.\u201d A judge shall grant a motion for summary judgment \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and responses to requests for admission under [Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P.] 36, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 56(h) (2003). The moving party, here the mother, \u201cmust \u2018affirmatively demonstrate] that there is no genuine issue of material fact on every relevant issue, even if [she] would have no burden on an issue if the case were to go to trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Department of Rev. </em>v. <em>Mason M., </em>439 Mass. 665, 674 (2003), quoting from <em>Pederson </em>v. <em>Time, Inc., </em>404 Mass. 14, 17 (1989). See <em>Kernan </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 378, 382 (2007). See also <em>Jupin </em>v. <em>Kask, </em>447 Mass. 141, 146 (2006) (party moving for summary judgment \u201cmay prevail by showing that the nonmoving party has no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of his case at trial\u201d). All eviden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>tiary inferences are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion for summary judgment. <em>Nunez </em>v. <em>Carrabba\u2019s Italian Grill, Inc., </em>448 Mass. 170, 174 (2007). \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, a court does not resolve issues of material fact, assess credibility, or weigh evidence.\u201d <em>Kernan </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">While an original judgment awarding sole physical custody of a child to a party is presumed to have been right, <em>Hersey </em>v. <em>Hersey, </em>271 Mass. 545, 554 (1930); <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Money, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 261 (2001), it is not immune from modification. General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 28, provides that a judge of the Probate and Family Court may modify an earlier divorce judgment concerning the custody of a minor child on finding \u201cthat a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and the judgment of modification is necessary in the best interests of the children.\u201d See <em>Ardizoni </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 734, 738 (1996) (in determining modifications of custody awards based on changed circumstances, \u201cthe guiding principle always has been the best interests of the children\u201d). An award of custody will not be sustained \u201cunless all relevant factors in determining the best interests of the child have been weighed.\u201d <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merida, </em>428 Mass. 182, 191 (1998), quoting from <em>Bouchard </em>v. <em>Bouchard, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 899, 899 (1981).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As the present case appears to raise for the first time before an appellate court of the Commonwealth the propriety of a grant of summary judgment in the child custody context,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we comment initially on the use of summary judgment in custody modification proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">We perceive nothing in the language of Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 56,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or in the nature of child custody in general, cf. <em>Houston </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number><em>Houston, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 529, 534-535 (2005) (child custody \u201cholds a peculiar place in our jurisprudence and implicates a \u2018societal interest\u2019 \u201d), that would necessarily preclude the use of summary judgment in child custody modification actions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The parties in the present case do not contend otherwise. That said, we think it is important that a judge proceed with great caution in deciding whether summary judgment is appropriate in a custody modification proceeding. Both the question whether there has been a material change in circumstances, and, if so, the question whether modification is necessary in the best interests of the children, will most often involve the resolution of disputed issues of material fact or the weighing of evidence. Such considerations, as we have stated, would render inappropriate summary judgment. With regard to the former question, we recognize that in the initial instance the judge must review the factual allegations to determine whether they involve facts that are material, see <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>386 Mass. 367, 370, cert, denied, 459 U.S. 970 (1982), quoting from <em>H &amp; M Cake Box, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bakery &amp; Confectionery Workers, Intl. Union, Local 45, </em>454 F.2d 716, 719 (1st Cir. 1972) (\u201ccourt should only \u2018determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exist[s]\u2019 \u201d); disputed facts are material only if they have a bearing on the outcome of the case. <em>Jupin </em>v. <em>Kask, </em>447 Mass, at 145-146. Once the judge determines that there are facts bearing on the outcome of a custodial contest that are in dispute, summary judgment does not he. See <em>Brush </em>v. <em>Brush, </em>414 So. 2d 37, 38 (Fla. App. 1982) (\u201cWe caution that summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>merits should be granted sparingly upon petitions for modification of custody because of the inherent factual disputes prevalent in such proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Furthermore, in most cases, once a determination is made that there has been a material change in circumstances, summary judgment will be inappropriate. This is especially so in light of the \u201cwidest range of permissible evidence\u201d that the judge may consider in determining a child\u2019s best interests. <em>Ardizoni </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. at 738. See <em>Adoption of Irene, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 613, 617 (2002) (\u201c[w]here the objective is a . . . child\u2019s best interests, factual determinations are necessarily involved\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Goulart </em>v. <em>Canton Hous. Authy., </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 440, 441 (2003) (\u201cOrdinarily, summary judgment is not an appropriate means to resolve negligence cases, because usually the question of negligence is one of fact\u201d). Each case must be carefully analyzed and any \u201c[djoubts as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact are to be resolved against the party moving for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Allmerica Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>449 Mass. 621, 628 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">6. <em>Factual issues. </em>The father argues that the judge erred in determining that no genuine issues of material fact exist regarding his allegations that the mother neglected Tom and further erred in determining that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to him, cannot show that the mother was neglecting Tom. We agree with the father that summary judgment should not have entered for the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">At the outset, we note that the mother, in arguing that the father cannot demonstrate, and there is no evidence, that she has been neglecting Tom since the January, 2004, judgment, takes the position that \u201cneglect\u201d must be interpreted in accordance with the regulations of the Department of Children and Families to mean the \u201cfailure <em>by a caretaker, </em>either deliberately or through negligence or inability, to take those actions necessary to provide a child with minimally adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical care, supervision, emotional stability and growth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>or other essential care ...\u201d (emphasis in original). 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.00 (1996). In the mother\u2019s view, her conduct must \u201crise to this high level\u201d to be sufficient to warrant the drastic measure of a change of custody. Putting to one side the facts that the mother cites to no authority in support of her position and that her memorandum in support of her motion for summary judgment makes no reference to the above quoted definition (which was in effect at the time her motion was heard),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we reject such a restrictive view of \u201cneglect\u201d in custody modification actions. As stated in the American Law Institute\u2019s (ALI) Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution, the changed-circumstances test \u201cdoes [not] require circumstances as severe as those that require the state to intervene under its abuse and neglect statutes. There are circumstances that might justify a parent in obtaining an alteration in his or her child\u2019s custodial arrangement that would not otherwise justify interference by the state.\u201d ALI, Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution: Analysis and Recommendations \u00a7 2.15 comment c (2002).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the father, it reasonably can be inferred from Dr. Cavallero\u2019s reports and Dr. Grey\u2019s letter of October 21, 2004, that although the mother has engaged in some activities with Tom and has ensured that he is seeing a therapist, Tom\u2019s emotional needs are not being adequately met in the mother\u2019s household as he is largely ignored there. Such evidence includes (1) Tom\u2019s report to Dr. Cavallero that he does not \u201cdo much\u201d with his mother, his suggestion to Dr. Grey that the attention paid to Molly \u201cshortchanges him,\u201d and his repeated requests (discussed more fully, infra) that he be allowed to live with his father; (2) Dr. Grey\u2019s observations that the mother\u2019s household seems to be set up around Molly\u2019s needs more than Tom\u2019s and that the mother is invested primarily in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>activities with Molly that draw Tom from his peers; and (3) Dr. Cavallero\u2019s statements that Tom\u2019s needs are not the priority and \u201cfrequently come second to the needs of [Molly] and [the mother].\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, Dr. Cavallero stated specifically that Tom is somewhat lonely in the mother\u2019s household and Dr. Grey voiced his concern about the child being \u201cmore than just unhappy\u201d and \u201cat risk to becoming clinically depressed.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Such evidence is, of course, contrary to the mother\u2019s statements and evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>child is doing well in her household, that his needs are being met, and that he is not neglected.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Further evidence bearing on the issue of \u201cneglect\u201d and its impact on the child\u2019s emotional health may be found in the child\u2019s repeated and, apparently, more urgent requests that he be allowed to live with the father. While a child\u2019s expression of custodial preference must be treated with caution and the preference of an eleven year old child is not given decisive weight,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> it is a factor to be considered by the court in the context of all other circumstances. See <em>Custody of </em>Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590, 599 n.11 (1996); <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 820 (1981); <em>Ardizoni </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>40 Mass.

See also ALI, Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution: Analysis and Recommendations \u00a7 2.16 comment e (\u201cIn a majority of jurisdictions that require a showing of changed circumstances before a custody order may be modified, a child\u2019s wish for a custody change ordinarily will not, in itself, constitute a sufficient change of circumstances!;] . . . [i]n combination with other factors, however, a child\u2019s preference often appears to make a difference\u201d); 2 Atkinson, Modem Child Custody Practice \u00a7 10.1 (2007) (while holdings of some courts that child\u2019s preference to live with noncustodial parent is not, by itself, sufficient basis to modify custody, \u201cthe practical meaning of the holding is that a child\u2019s preference is often not enough to modify custody if the child gives no reason for the preference or if the reason given is not a good one\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">The mother also argues that the father did not sustain his \u201cburden to show that the \u2018changed circumstances\u2019 did not exist prior to the most recent judgment.\u201d More specifically, she states that the father cannot \u201cshow, and there is no evidence on the record to demonstrate, that [she] behaved any differently toward [Tom] before the January 30, 2004, judgment than she did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>afterwards.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The mother also notes, correctly, that Tom expressed a preference to reside with the father before the divorce (although she acknowledges that \u201caccording to the father, the frequency of, and the manner in which such statements were made increased thereafter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">As a threshold matter, the summary judgment materials are sketchy as to the mother\u2019s possible inattention toward Tom prior to the divorce and the then effect (if any) of such conduct upon the child. At all events, there was evidence in the present case in (at least) the form of Tom\u2019s complaints subsequent to the divorce concerning the mother\u2019s conduct toward him; Tom\u2019s increasing insistence that he be allowed to live with his father, see <em>Basden </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>123 P.3d 566, 569-570 (Wyo. 2005) (although child had expressed preference to live with mother prior to divorce, in determining whether there has been change in circumstances in custody modification action judge properly may consider with other factors child\u2019s more urgent expressions of preference to live with mother subsequent to divorce); the statements of Dr. Cavallero and Dr. Grey that Tom\u2019s needs are not a priority in the mother\u2019s household; and Dr. Grey\u2019s concerns about Tom being \u201cmore than just unhappy\u201d and \u201cat risk to becoming clinically depressed\u201d (see note 18, supra) which, when viewed in the light most favorable to the father, could support a finding of a material change in circumstances.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>Freedman, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 519, 522-523 (2000) (if alternating custody arrangement is not operating in best interests of child, Probate and Family Court has power to reexamine arrangement \u201cas an adverse effect on the child would constitute a material change in circumstances\u201d); <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Branciforte, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 212, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>220 (2002) (upholding transfer in custody where probate judge, in determining whether there had been material change in circumstances, concluded, inter alia, that mother\u2019s performance as custodial parent demonstrated that she was not able to separate her needs and interests from those of child). But compare <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 372, 377 (1974) (where there was no evidence that custodial parent had, in any respect, been inadequate parent); <em>Delmolino </em>v. <em>Nance, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 209, 213-214 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">7. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment dismissing the husband\u2019s complaint for modification is vacated and the matter is remanded to the Probate and Family Court for further proceedings.

In the summary judgment materials, and on the appeal, both parties also rely on evidence subsequent to that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b815-6\">In view of the decision he reached, the judge determined that the father\u2019s request for \u201crelocation relief [was] moot as [the father does] not have any form of physical custody.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b816-6\">In <em>Ardizoni </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. at 738, we noted that when determining the best interests of children a judge may consider \u201cthe widest range of permissible evidence, including the reports and testimony of [the guardian ad litem], evidence of the history of the relationship between the child and each parent, evidence of each parent\u2019s home environment,\u201d and any expression of preference by a child. See <em>Adoption of Hugo, </em>428 Mass. 219, 231 n.21 (1998), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Hugo P. </em>v. <em>George P., </em>526 U.S. 1034 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b816-7\">We decide this day a second case in which summary judgment was entered for the mother on the father\u2019s complaint for modification of visitation. <em>R.S. </em>v. <em>M.P., post </em>798 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\">We recognize that certain aspects of custody proceedings do not fit readily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>within the traditional summary judgment framework. For example, the report of a guardian ad litem, which is generally admissible in evidence in custody proceedings as long as the guardian ad litem is available to testify at trial and the source of the material is sufficiently identified, see <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>349 Mass. 259, 264 (1965); <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>369 Mass. 598, 604-605 (1976); <em>Adoption of Georgia, </em>433 Mass. 62, 69 (2000), will often contain hearsay information, including multiple level hearsay. See <em>Adoption of Georgia, </em>433 Mass, at 68-69. In the instant matter, both parties rely upon the statements of individuals reporting to the guardian ad litem and the mother has accepted as true the numerous \u201cfacts\u201d stated in her brief for purposes of summary judgment. See and compare <em>Adoption of Sean, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 261, 263-265 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b817-6\">At least one appellate court has held that because each of the factors identified in its State code with respect to the modification of custody requires a factual determination, summary judgment is never appropriate in a child custody determination. <em>Hemingway </em>v. <em>Sandoe, </em>676 N.E.2d 368, 370-371 (Ind. App. 1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b818-7\">We recognize that there may be exceptional circumstances where the determination that modification is necessary in the best interests of a child is essentially compelled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The judge made no reference to the definition in his memorandum of decision. Moreover, in his memorandum, the judge characterizes the father\u2019s complaint as containing an allegation that the mother \u201cignores\u201d Tom, which suggests that he did not adhere to such a strict definition. We note that at the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, the father took the position that the mother\u2019s \u201clack of attention [to Tom] is a form of neglect.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b819-7\">In all events, as we shall discuss, the father submitted evidence that calls into question whether the mother is providing the child with minimally adequate emotional stability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b820-4\">We do not find persuasive the mother\u2019s argument that the statements of Dr. Cavallero and Dr. Grey on which the father relies to support his claim of \u201cneglect\u201d are insufficient as matter of law to defeat summary judgment as they are conclusory and speculative. See <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>446 Mass. 814, 821 (2006). As we have indicated, both professionals had the opportunity to speak with and observe Tom and other family members. Moreover, it may fairly be inferred from the statements of Dr. Cavallero and Dr. Grey (again, viewed in the light most favorable to the father) that whatever limited free time the mother has with respect to the children is directed primarily toward Molly\u2019s needs and activities (including her equestrian endeavors). To the extent the mother also asserts that the statements and opinions of Dr. Cavallero and Dr. Grey are inadmissible (and thus not sufficient to create an issue of fact regarding her conduct toward Tom) as they have not been shown to be reliable under the <em>\u201cDaubert/Lanigan </em>standard,\u201d see <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 25-26 (1994), we disagree. Even were we to assume that the <em>Daubert/ Lanigan </em>standard may have application in a case such as the one presently before us, the mother points to nothing in the record to suggest that she formally made a <em>Lanigan </em>challenge to the statements of the professionals, and indeed, both parties have relied heavily in their summary judgment materials on the guardian ad litem\u2019s reports. See <em>Molly A. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Mental Retardation, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 267, 284-285 n.24 (2007); <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Providence Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 341, 342 n.3 (2007). In all events, the thrust of the mother\u2019s argument is that there simply is no showing on the record to ascertain the basis for the professionals\u2019 opinions, a point we reject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The mother asserts that any sadness or loneliness experienced by Tom is the result of interparental conflict and litigation that has existed even prior to the divorce. This assertion ignores certain of Dr. Grey\u2019s statements that appear to link Tom\u2019s unhappiness (at least in part) to the attention paid to Molly and the evidence pointing to the secondary position to which Tom has been relegated in the mother\u2019s household. At a minimum, the mother\u2019s assertion creates factual issues that warrant further exploration. Cf. <em>Kernan </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. at 384 n.12. Similarly, the mother\u2019s assertion that the judge was not required to rely on Dr. Grey\u2019s \u201copinion,\u201d as adopted by Dr. Cavallero, concerning Tom\u2019s mental health because his information was \u201cstale,\u201d and that Dr. Wolf\u2019s statements (i.e., that Tom is upbeat and not depressed) \u201cpresent[] a more accurate picture of [Tom\u2019s] condition and relationships,\u201d involve factual determinations and the weighing of evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\">The father argues that the judge\u2019s finding that the child was ten years old when he expressed his preference to live with the father is clearly erroneous. Rather, he states, the child was eleven when the guardian ad litem filed her report and \u201cnearly 12\u201d when the judge rendered his decision. In the father\u2019s view, the child\u2019s age reflects upon his maturity to make an informed statement of preference. In view of the decision we reach, we find it unnecessary to address this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The mother points, for example, to the father\u2019s report to Dr. Cavallero that the mother was self-centered and desirous of material things during the marriage and the former nanny\u2019s report to the guardian ad litem that the mother tended to go shopping and pay more attention to Molly\u2019s interests during the marriage while Tom was put on the \u201cback burner.\u201d It is apparently the mother\u2019s position that even accepting that she has ignored or neglected Tom somewhat since the divorce, such conduct cannot constitute a material change in circumstances as it is consistent with her treatment of Tom prior to the divorce. Putting to one side any possible incongruity in the mother\u2019s position, her argument fails for the reasons discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\">We do not, of course, intimate that a transfer of custody is ultimately required in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
