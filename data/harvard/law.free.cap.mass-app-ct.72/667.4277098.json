The mother was unwilling or unable to acknowledge her husband\u2019s prior abuse or the risk that he posed to her son, Anton. The mother also used drugs provided by her husband while she was pregnant with another child and had trouble securing adequate housing due in part to her refusal to separate from her husband. Finally, the mother neglected Anton\u2019s dental care, causing serious decay of his baby teeth. The mother appeals, claiming that there was not clear and convincing evidence of her unfitness to parent Anton. We affirm the decision of the Juvenile Court judge terminating the mother\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\"><em>Facts. </em>The following facts, found by the trial judge, are relevant to the present appeal. In February of 2002, at twenty-seven years of age, the mother gave birth to Anton, who was five years of age at the time of trial. Anton\u2019s biological father left after Anton\u2019s birth and is not part of these proceedings. For the first three to four months of Anton\u2019s life, the mother lived with her own mother (grandmother) in Rockland before moving in with her then boyfriend, now husband, Ben Marks,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in New Bedford.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Marks has an extensive criminal history. Most significantly, in 1988, Marks was convicted of sexually abusing his five year old stepdaughter on five separate occasions, for which he received a five- to seven-year suspended sentence and was put on probation. In 1993, Marks reoffended with the same child, despite having completed therapy, a sex offender evaluation, a psychological evaluation, and other reunification services offered by the Department of Children and Families (DCF). From 1993 to 1999, Marks served his previously suspended sentence. During his incarceration, he completed the intensive treatment program, phase IV, and developed a comprehensive relapse prevention plan. That plan prohibited him from being in a relationship with a woman who had a child between three and five years of age. The plan also called for Marks to attend sex offender therapy regularly and support group sessions as needed, neither of which he was doing at the time of trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plan also required that he abide by all laws, including those governing registration as a sex offender. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H(a)(l). Marks was classified as a level three sex offender at the time of trial. Marks had been previously diagnosed as having a psychosexual disorder, i.e., pedophilia, a substance abuse problem, and a borderline personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">The mother had learned of Marks\u2019s sex offender status in 2003. She believed, however, that the charges were \u201ca result of his former wife who was out to get him during their divorce.\u201d Despite his admission to the crime of child rape, the mother believed that \u201cthere was not enough evidence against [Marks]\u201d and that this lack of evidence is the reason he \u201creceived a suspended sentence.\u201d She also believed that he had \u201cno choice but to plead guilty because of his lawyer at the time.\u201d The judge found her \u201cunrealistic in her interpretation of the events regarding [Marks\u2019s] sexual offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The mother, Marks, and Anton lived together in New Bed-ford until approximately April, 2004, when the mother and Anton moved to Michigan. The following month, Marks joined the mother and Anton, and all three lived together in Michigan. On December 14, 2004, Marks was arrested for failing to register as a sex offender in Michigan. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E(\u00bf), as amended by St. 2003, c. 140, \u00a7\u00a7 6 &amp; 7; G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H(1). At the time of Marks\u2019s arrest, Anton was alone with him in the home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Marks was incarcerated briefly in a Michigan jail where the mother would visit him twice a week, occasionally bringing Anton. Marks was then extradited to Massachusetts in February of 2005, where the mother followed him, leaving Anton with her sister in Michigan. Marks remained in jail until June of 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>On July 15, 2005, the mother married Marks before returning to Michigan shortly thereafter to bring Anton back to Massachusetts. The three lived together until August 19, 2005, when DCF took temporary custody of Anton. Custody was granted to DCF because of concerns about Anton\u2019s safety while living with a level three sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">On September 13, 2005, approximately one month after Anton was removed from the mother\u2019s care, DCF filed a G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A, report alleging dental neglect because many of Anton\u2019s twenty baby teeth were seriously decayed, of which two were so badly decayed that they had broken off at the root. The decay was painful for Anton and made it difficult for him to eat.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Since returning to Massachusetts in August, 2005, the mother has lived in at least two different apartments and at least three different shelters. After Anton was taken into DCF\u2019s custody, the mother moved into the Sisters of Charity shelter. The mother testified that she moved to this shelter because DCF did not want her to live with Marks. The mother then moved into an apartment in New Bedford, where she lived alone, although Marks lived close by and had keys to the apartment. In August of 2006, the mother moved into another apartment in New Bedford. Then, in October, 2006, the mother was in a women\u2019s shelter for approximately one month before returning to an apartment where Marks lived with her for at least two weeks before they were both evicted. Upon eviction in November of 2006, the mother entered the Harbor House Family Shelter, but was asked to leave because she continued to see Marks.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the time of trial, the mother was back in the Sisters of Charity homeless shelter awaiting admission to the Donovan House shelter.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Beginning with Anton\u2019s removal, DCF prepared a total of four service plans, the first two of which had the goal of reunification, and the final two had the goal of adoption. Marks did not sign any of the plans. The mother signed the first three service plans, but wrote on the third that she did not \u201cagree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>with 90% of the accusations and proof of it all.\u201d The mother\u2019s tasks on her service plans included (1) individual counselling to discuss the risk to Anton from her involvement with Marks; (2) documented progress that she understands the risk; (3) a psychological evaluation; and (4) appropriate discussions with Anton during visits. The final plan included random drug screening, a substance abuse evaluation, and obtaining appropriate housing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On January 20, 2006, DCF changed the goal for Anton to adoption.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Subsequently, on February 15, 2006, the mother\u2019s psychological evaluation showed that she had made no progress in understanding the risks posed to Anton by living with a level three sex offender. Based on that evaluation and the mother\u2019s continuing to make inappropriate comments to Anton during visits, foster care reviews dated February 22, 2006, and September 7, 2006, concluded that the mother had \u201cinsufficiently completed her service plan tasks.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Additional evidence of her noncompliance was her inability to secure permanent housing for herself and Anton.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">On November 17, 2006, the mother gave birth to Marks\u2019s child, Evan,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Anton\u2019s half-brother. Ten days later, on November 27, 2006, DCF filed a G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A, allegation of neglect of Evan, which was supported under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B, due to the mother\u2019s ingestion of cocaine and marijuana in March, 2006, while pregnant with Evan. While there is no evidence of sustained or continued drag use by the mother, Marks has a long history of drug use and supplied the mother with the cocaine and marijuana she admitted to using.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">On December 15, 2005, and February 27, 2006, Anton was evaluated for developmental and behavioral problems at the Center for Children and Families. He was found to have signi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>ficant developmental delays in speech, expressive and receptive language, and cognitive and fine motor skills. He was also described as aggressive and hyperactive, as swearing frequently, and as suffering from encopresis and enuresis. He also spread his feces with his hands around the house. After December 21, 2006, Anton did not show affection toward the mother and regressed after visits with her. Following Anton\u2019s therapist\u2019s suggestion, DCF reduced the mother\u2019s visits from weekly to biweekly.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Although the mother had indicated that she and Marks have separated since DCF\u2019s involvement with her family, the trial judge found the mother to be dishonest about her relationship. The mother\u2019s social worker had observed, on unannounced visits, Marks in and around the mother\u2019s home and with keys to the home. Additionally, the social worker had seen the mother and Marks in public together.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, the mother frequently talked on the telephone with Marks when they were living in separate shelters and continued to regard Marks as her sole source of support besides her counsellor.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\"><em>Procedural history. </em>On August 19, 2005, DCF was granted temporary custody of Anton because of the mother\u2019s alleged neglect pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24. On February 21, 2006, DCF filed its notice of intent to proceed under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, and G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3. Trial was held on January 19 and 26, 2007, and February 23, 2007. On April 26, 2007, the trial judge found Anton in need of care and protection and dispensed with parental consent to adoption.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The mother filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\"><em>Standard of review. </em>In care and protection cases, the trial judge\u2019s subsidiary findings must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence and will only be disturbed if clearly erroneous. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Laura, </em>414 Mass. 788, 793 (1993); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number><em>Custody of Eleanor, </em>414 Mass. 795, 799 (1993). Taken together, these findings must then prove clearly and convincingly that the parent is currently unfit to provide for the welfare and best interests of the child. <em>Adoption of Quentin, </em>424 Mass. 882, 886 (1997). The judge is free to rely on a parent\u2019s \u201cprior patterns of neglect and misconduct in determining her current unfitness.\u201d <em>Adoption of Mario, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 767, 773 (1997). Parental unfitness is determined by considering a parent\u2019s character, temperament, conduct, and capacity to provide for the child\u2019s particular needs, affections, and age. <em>Adoption of Mary, </em>414 Mass. 705, 711 (1993). The mother challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the judge\u2019s conclusion that she was unfit, disputing individual facts and arguing that the subsidiary facts do not establish her unfitness by clear and convincing evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The judge\u2019s findings<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> are both \u201cspecific and detailed,\u201d demonstrating, as we require, that close attention was given to the evidence. <em>Adoption of Helen, </em>429 Mass. 856, 859 (1999). Those findings, which reflect endangerment and neglect of Anton, provide clear and convincing evidence of the mother\u2019s unfitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">1. <em>Failure to protect Anton from risk of sexual abuse. </em>First and foremost, the mother\u2019s ongoing relationship with Marks presents a high risk of sexual abuse of Anton that was an \u201cappropriate and relevant\u201d consideration in the judge\u2019s determination of the mother\u2019s fitness. <em>Care &amp; Protection of Isabelle, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 548, 549 (1992). Marks was convicted of sexually abusing his stepdaughter from another marriage in 1987 and again in 1993, even after completing therapy, a sex offender evaluation, and other reunification services provided by DCF. He has been diagnosed with pedophilia. See, e.g., <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 1211 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>447 Mass. 750, 765-766 (2006) (discussing special risks posed by pedophiles). As a level three sex offender, he has been deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>mined by law to present a high risk of reoffense and dangerousness. G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K(1). His relapse prevention plan required that he stay away from women with children between three and five years of age; Marks had not complied with this condition because of his relationship with the mother.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178K(2)(c). Further, he was not engaged in sex offender therapy at the time of trial, nor had he attended support group sessions as mandated by his relapse prevention plan. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>444 Mass. 15, 24 (2005) (failure of pedophile to continue sex offender treatment \u201cparticularly relevant\u201d to his risk of reoffending). In sum, given Marks\u2019s prior rapes of his stepdaughter, his pedophilia, his level three sex offender status, and his noncompliance with his relapse prevention plan, the judge correctly considered Marks a significant danger to Anton. Neither the judge or DCF had to wait for Anton to be sexually abused before requiring an appropriate response from the mother. See <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 620 (1986) (threatened physical abuse sufficient); <em>Adoption of Katharine, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 32 (1997) (\u201cneither agencies responsible for the welfare of children nor judges sitting on these sorts of custodial questions need to wait for inevitable disaster to happen\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">In determining the fitness of a mother involved in a relationship with a high-risk sex offender, the judge properly considered whether the mother had been informed of and acknowledged his prior abuse, demonstrated an understanding of the risk that the sex offender posed to her child, and taken appropriate actions in response to that risk. See generally <em>Adoption of Carlos, </em>413 Mass. 339, 351 (1992) (emphasizing that mother had made \u201c \u2018significant progress\u2019 with respect to her critical area of potential unfitness, namely her denial that her child had been sexually abused\u201d); <em>Adoption of Kimberly, </em>414 Mass. 526, 530 (1993) (mother unfit who \u201cwas very slow to acknowledge and deal with the impact of\u201d sexual abuse of her children and continued to live with abuser of her children); <em>Care &amp; Protection of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number><em>Isabelle, supra </em>at 552 (mother not unfit where she terminated her relationship and cut ties with her child\u2019s father, who had sexually abused his son from prior relationship).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In the instant case, the mother was fully informed of the extensive evidence of prior abuse, including Marks\u2019s admissions and convictions. The mother nonetheless failed to accept that any of the admitted, repeated acts of sexual abuse had occurred. See <em>Adoption of Kimberly, supra; Adoption of Larry, </em>434 Mass. 456, 472 (2001) (\u201cpersistent refusal or inability to recognize and address the father\u2019s intentional, violent conduct\u201d evidence of unfitness). See also <em>Adoption of Carlos, supra. </em>The mother denied that Marks presented a risk to her child despite expert views to the contrary and counselling to that effect. Finally, she continued the relationship despite Marks\u2019s refusal even to attend therapy or comply with other requirements of his own relapse prevention plan. See <em>Adoption of Larry, supra </em>(mother found unfit where father made no strides toward addressing abusive behavior and mother excused father\u2019s refusal to attend joint counselling). Contrast <em>Care &amp; Protection of Isabelle, supra </em>(mother agreed not to reunite with father or allow him access to child and removed child immediately when she saw father together with child). The mother had not separated herself from Marks, but rather attempted to conceal her relationship from DCF. Empty gestures at separation will not suffice. See <em>Adoption of Mary, </em>414 Mass, at 711 (finding no separation had occurred where mother continued to visit spouse in jail); <em>Adoption of Larry, supra </em>at 471 (disbelieving authenticity of divorce proceedings where mother indicated emotional dependence on her spouse).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The mother maintained her essentially unconditional allegiance to Marks despite being informed that such an allegiance jeopardized the safety of Anton and her parental rights. Her willingness to ignore \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d of Marks\u2019s past abuse and to adopt a protective attitude toward Marks and not the child provided clear and convincing evidence that she cannot protect Anton from Marks. See <em>Adoption of Larry, supra </em>at 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">2. <em>Other evidence of unfitness. </em>There is other significant evidence of the mother\u2019s over-all unfitness to care for Anton. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Where a parent is ineffective in obtaining medical care for a child, causing neglect of the child, it is relevant to finding of unfitness. <em>See Adoption of Ramon, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 709, 711 (1996). The mother\u2019s failure to obtain the dental care necessary to keep Anton\u2019s teeth healthy was correctly considered in the determination of her ability to continue to care for Anton.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The mother\u2019s inability to secure \u201cadequate stable housing\u201d was also properly considered in determining her unfitness. See <em>Adoption of Vito, </em>431 Mass. 550, 555 (2000) (inadequate housing properly considered along with other evidence of unfitness); <em>Petition of Catholic Charitable Bureau of the Archdiocese of Boston, Inc., to Dispense With Consent to Adoption, </em>395 Mass. 180, 184 (1985) (judge properly concluded that parent\u2019s unstable housing \u2014 moving six times in less than two years \u2014\u2022 had deleterious effect on child). From August, 2005, to the date of trial in 2007, the mother had moved at least seven times and had lived in at least three different homeless shelters. Though the mother\u2019s DCF service plan required her to obtain appropriate housing, she was unable to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Evidence of alcohol or drug abuse is also relevant to a parent\u2019s willingness, competence, and availability to provide care. <em>Care &amp; Protection of Frank, </em>409 Mass. 492, 494 (1991). In this case, the mother admitted to cocaine and marijuana use at least twice while pregnant with her second child, Evan. The drugs were provided by Marks. Where, as here, drug use was a factor contributing to established neglect, it is properly considered in a determination of unfitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Also properly considered is a psychologist\u2019s prediction that a child will regress if returned to the mother. See <em>Adoption of Frederick, </em>405 Mass. 1, 8 (1989). As previously noted, Anton\u2019s therapist recommended reducing visits with the mother because of Anton\u2019s regression and need for days of recuperation after those visits. Anton showed minimal affection toward the mother during her visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">3. <em>Services directed at reunification. </em>For the first time on appeal, the mother claims that DCF failed to provide adequate services prior to proceeding to terminate parental rights. We disagree. The first two service plans were directed at reunification and multiple services were offered to the mother, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>parenting classes, individual counselling, psychological evaluations, and visitation. Moreover, \u201ca parent must raise a claim of inadequate services in a timely manner so that reasonable accommodations may be made.\u201d <em>Adoption of Gregory, </em>434 Mass. 117, 124 (2001). The mother did not do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated above, we affirm the decree entered by the Juvenile Court on April 26, 2007, finding the mother unfit and dispensing with her consent to adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The mother contests the finding that Marks had not been attending sex of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>fender therapy at the time of trial. There was ample evidence that Marks refused to continue sex offender therapy, but there was testimony that two weeks prior to trial, he began some sort of therapy \u201cbecause of stress and lack of sleep.\" This does not appear to have been sex offender therapy. Moreover, this is not the type of sustained, ongoing sex offender therapy required by his relapse prevention plan to address his pedophilia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b695-9\"> On January 28,2005, Michigan Protective Services (the Michigan equivalent of DCF) filed an investigation for suspected sexual abuse of Anton by Marks. However, the doctor found Anton\u2019s physical exam to be within normal limits, noting only that Anton was too young to verbalize sexual abuse, even if it had occurred. The mother had previously had Anton evaluated for sexual abuse in 2003 when the mother and child were living with Marks and a young adult. The mother had become concerned because Anton was touching himself and others inappropriately. Sexual abuse was not established.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Because of Marks\u2019s sex offender status, the mother was forbidden to see Marks while staying in the Harbor House Family Shelter to protect the other shelter residents from a known abuser.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Drug screening and a substance abuse evaluation were included after the mother admitted to using marijuana and cocaine while pregnant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b697-7\">There is dispute whether DCF changed the goal for Anton to adoption on January 20, 2006, or December 20, 2005. However, the possible discrepancy of a month is not material to the issues here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\">The mother had previously told Anton that policemen are bad and that firemen will light him on fire. When Anton then saw policemen or firemen, he became frightened. During visits, she made inappropriate comments, including comments regarding the foster mother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b697-9\">A pseudonym. This child is not involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\">For example, on December 14, 2006, the mother was seen walking with Marks, holding hands. This was seven days after the mother had been shown Marks\u2019s psychological evaluation, police reports with details of his sexual offenses, and his admissions about abusing his brother and sister as a child. After being shown the documents, the mother had said she was going to leave him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b698-9\">The judge found that the current adoption plan included \u201cexploring a placement with [Anton\u2019s] maternal aunt in Michigan who has come forward.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The mother claims that thirteen findings of fact were clearly erroneous. Most of these objections arise out of disagreements concerning credibility findings. See <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 618 (1986); <em>Adoption of Larry, </em>434 Mass. 456, 467 (2001) (trial judge in best position to assess credibility). Our review of the record shows that the challenged findings were adequately supported, immaterial, or both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The mother\u2019s argument that Marks\u2019s victims are only female children and thus he posed no risk to Anton is unpersuasive: as a child, Marks abused his brother and was abused himself by his father and his uncle. Further, there is nothing in the relapse prevention plan limiting the restriction to girls.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
