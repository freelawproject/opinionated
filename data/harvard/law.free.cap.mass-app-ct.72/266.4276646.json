In <em>Southwick </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Plymouth, </em>65 Mass. App Ct. 315 (2005), we concluded that the plaintiff trustee\u2019s ownership of a nearby lot gave him standing to challenge the approval by the planning board of Plymouth (board) of a subdivi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>sion plan for a parcel of land owned by defendant Jonathan Wildes. <em>Id. </em>at 319-320. We concluded further that the board\u2019s decision must be annulled because the subdivision proposed by Wildes was without the right of access on which it depended. <em>Id. </em>at 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">After the entry of judgment after rescript in the Superior Court, Wildes filed a motion for relief from judgment. The motion was allowed under Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), which authorizes relief on the ground of fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party. Thereafter, a new judgment entered dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and ordering that the decision of the board be affirmed. The plaintiff brings the present appeal from the new judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The relevant background may be summarized as follows. On June 22, 2001, several months prior to the filing of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint on August 3, 2001, the town of Plymouth, acting pursuant to G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 54, took title to the lot in question on account of unpaid taxes. On September 22,2003, while the plaintiffs case was pending in the Superior Court, the trust\u2019s right of redemption was foreclosed. Later, on December 22, 2004, in connection with the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment, the plaintiff submitted an affidavit misstating that the trust continued to own the lot. In ruling on the motion to vacate, the judge found that the plaintiff\u2019s misstatement was unintentional,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but nevertheless determined that it was inequitable for the plaintiff to retain the benefit of the judgment in \"his favor, given that he lacked standing and subject matter jurisdiction was implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">We conclude that the new judgment must be reversed and the original judgment reinstated for the following reasons: (1) to the extent that the judge\u2019s decision may have been based on the assumption that the plaintiff\u2019s lack of standing rendered the judgment void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, this was legal error; (2) to the extent that the decision rested on the judge\u2019s determination, under rule 60(b)(3), that it was inequitable for the plaintiff to retain the benefit of the judgment, it was an abuse of discretion to vacate the judgment based solely upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s unintentional misrepresentation and without consideration of other factors militating in favor of preserving the judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">1. The judge may have been under the impression that the plaintiff\u2019s standing remained a live issue at the rule 60(b) stage, as reflected by his observation that the lack of standing was not a mere technical defect in the plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit, but rather an issue of subject matter jurisdiction. See <em>Planning Bd. of Marshfield </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Pembroke, All </em>Mass. 699, 703 (1998). However, standing is an issue of subject matter jurisdiction only in the sense that it is a criterion that must be met in order for the court to exercise jurisdiction, when the court otherwise is competent to decide the case. See <em>Sarin </em>v. <em>Ochsner, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 421, 424 (2000). See also <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Raynham, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 680, 681 n.2 (2002). Once a court has rendered judgment, and opportunities for appeal have been exhausted, a subsequent showing that the plaintiff did not, in fact, have standing does not mean that the judgment is void and must be vacated; the judgment is immune from postjudgment attack unless the court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction constituted a \u201cclear usurpation of power.\u201d <em>Sarin </em>v. <em>Ochsner, supra </em>at 424, quoting from <em>Lubben </em>v. <em>Selective Serv. Sys., </em>453 F.2d 645, 649 (1st Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Here, the court undoubtedly was competent to decide the case. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 8 IBB (permitting appeals from planning board decisions concerning subdivision plans to be brought in Superior Court or Land Court). Furthermore, until the trust\u2019s right of redemption was foreclosed, the plaintiff was entitled to rely upon the trust\u2019s interest in the lot as a basis for standing. See <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 420, 425 (2004). Thus, even assuming that the plaintiff had no alternative basis for standing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>there was, at most, an error in the continued exercise of subject matter jurisdiction after September 22, 2003, when the right of redemption was foreclosed, but there was no \u201cclear usurpation of power\u201d by the court. See generally <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Sannella, </em>400 Mass. 392, 395 (1987); <em>O\u2019Dea </em>v. <em>J.A.L., Inc., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 449, 455 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">2. It is questionable whether the judge had discretion to grant Wildes relief under rule 60(b)(3) on account of an unintentional misrepresentation. See <em>Gaw </em>v. <em>Sappett, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 405, 411 (2004) (expressing doubt as to applicability of rule 60 [b] [3] in cases not involving culpable misconduct); Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass.R.Civ.P. 60 (b) (3), Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Civil Procedure, at 1103 (LexisNexis 2007) (\u201cRule 60 [b] [3] includes any <em>wrongful </em>act by which a party obtains a judgment under circumstances which would make it inequitable for him to retain its benefit\u201d [emphasis added]). See also <em>Pina </em>v. <em>McGill Dev. Corp., </em>388 Mass. 159, 165-168 (1983) (upholding denial of rule 60 [b] [3] motion where defendant failed to establish that plaintiff committed peijury or otherwise employed judicial system in unconscionable manner). Regardless, even if we assume that the judge had such discretion, it should not have been exercised to grant relief in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In considering whether equity required that the judgment be vacated, whatever personal benefit the plaintiff may have derived from the case should not have been viewed in isolation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge also should have taken into account the countervailing inequity of allowing Wildes to have the benefit of an erroneous board decision permitting him to develop property to which he has no legal right of access, as well as the public interest in not disturbing an adjudication that the board\u2019s decision was based on a flawed essential premise and was required to be annulled. See <em>Southwick </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Plymouth, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. at 320. When these additional considerations are factored into the analysis, relief under rule 60(b)(3) was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of dismissal entered on December 20, 2006, is vacated. The judgment after rescript entered on April 7, 2006, annulling the decision of the planning board of Plymouth approving the subdivision, shall be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b293-8\">It may be inferred that the judge accepted the plaintiffs explanation that he had no knowledge either that another trustee had failed to pay the taxes owed, or that the town had taken and foreclosed on the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In light of the view we take of the case, we do not address the plaintiff\u2019s contention that he had standing to pursue the zoning appeal on alternative grounds, i.e., that as developer of the neighboring subdivision of which the subject lot was a part, the plaintiff\u2019s trust remained obligated under a covenant with the town requiring, among other things, that the trust maintain the roads that Wildes sought to use for access to his own subdivision. The judge rejected this contention, concluding that even if such a covenant could serve as the basis for standing, the covenant in question had been superseded by an escrow agreement securing the performance of other obligations, but not the ongoing repair and maintenance of the roads.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Although the judge identified no particular benefit to the plaintiff from the preservation of the judgment, we assume that the judge considered the benefit to the plaintiff to be the achievement of his objective of preventing the development of the Wildes subdivision, even though the plaintiff\u2019s trust no longer owned the affected lot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
