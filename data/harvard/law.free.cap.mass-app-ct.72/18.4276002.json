L. c. 119, \u00a7 54, alleging that the juvenile was an accessory after the fact, G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 4. This indictment was dismissed by a judge of the Juvenile Court, and the Commonwealth appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 54, as amended by St. 1996, c. 200, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\u00a7 2, grants the government the authority to obtain an indictment in juvenile proceedings provided an alleged offender has, inter alia, \u201ccommitted an offense against a law of the Commonwealth . . . [that] involves the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm.\u201d In determining whether any particular offense \u201cinvolves the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm,\u201d it is necessary to determine whether the \u201cconduct constituting the offense itself\u201d involves the form of harm described in the statute. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clint C., </em>430 Mass. 219, 225 (1999). That is to say, it is necessary to determine actual conduct undertaken by the defendant, rather than merely the elements of the underlying crime, in determining whether an indictment is authorized under \u00a7 54.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Here, the Commonwealth sought to bring the offense underlying the allegation of delinquency within G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 4, as amended by St. 1943, c. 488, \u00a7 1, which provides that \u201c[whoever, after the commission of a felony, harbors, conceals, maintains or assists the principal ... or gives such offender any other aid . . . with the intent that he shall avoid or escape . . . arrest . . . shall be an accessory after the fact, and ... be punished.\u201d Based on the evidence presented in the Juvenile Court proceedings, the judge below could have found as follows: the juvenile was present in a house where her boyfriend, Luis Torres, shot another man during a fight, wounding him. The juvenile then fled with Torres and another man, Michael Pinel. The trio went to a nearby convenience store, where the juvenile arranged for a taxicab to transport the group to an apartment in a neighboring town. When police tracked Torres to that apartment, the juvenile initially denied that Torres was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The Commonwealth contends \u2014 as it must in order to provide a basis for the indictment obtained under \u00a7 54 \u2014 that by abetting Torres\u2019s escape and subsequently helping to conceal him from police, the juvenile\u2019s conduct \u201cinvolve[d] the infliction or threat of serious bodily harm.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In so characterizing the juve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>nile\u2019s actions, the Commonwealth essentially ascribes to the juvenile vicarious liability for the violent act committed by Torres. We disagree with this approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">In its argument, and by means of the cases on which it relies,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Commonwealth seeks to conflate the form of accessorial liability with which the defendant is charged here with general joint venture liability or liability as an accessory before the fact and, thereby, place her on the same footing as Torres. Such comparisons, however, are inapposite.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is no question that the law in the Commonwealth, as in most jurisdictions, equates the culpability of a joint venturer or accessory <em>before </em>the fact with the culpability of the principal. As set out in G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 2, as amended through St. 1973, c. 529, \u00a7 1, \u201c[wjhoever aids in the commission of a felony, or is an accessory thereto before the fact . . . shall be punished in the manner provided for the punishment of the principal felon.\u201d See G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 3. Likewise, a joint venturer is subject to the same penalties as the principal whom he or she assists (or stands ready to assist). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>450 Mass. 894, 898 (2008). By contrast, under G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 4, an accessory <em>after </em>the fact (i.e., the charge underlying the youthful offender indictment here), is subject to a maximum sentence of seven years regardless of the maximum punishment associated with the offense committed by the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">This distinction derives, inter alia, from the fact that an ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>cessory before the fact or a joint venturer ordinarily must share the same mental state required for conviction of the principal, and also be involved (or be ready, willing, and able to become involved) in the planning or execution of the crime. See G. L. c. 274, \u00a7\u00a7 2 &amp; 3; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chhim, </em>447 Mass. 370, 378 (2006). However, an accessory after the fact need not, and generally does not, have any advance knowledge of the principal\u2019s intent to commit an offense and is, by definition, not involved in its planning or execution; rather, an accessory after the fact need merely \u201cknow the identity of the principal perpetrator and have knowledge of the \u2018substantial facts of the felonious crime\u2019 that the principal committed\u201d and, possessed of such knowledge, aid the principal in avoiding punishment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>437 Mass. 186, 190 (2002), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Devlin, </em>366 Mass. 132, 134 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">On the basis of this crucial distinction, we reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that Torres\u2019s violent acts must be imputed to the juvenile in assessing her vulnerability to indictment under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 54. Accordingly, and consistent with the decision in <em>Clint C., supra, </em>we look only to the juvenile\u2019s own conduct in assessing the applicability of that provision. Her actions in facilitating Torres\u2019s escape and avoiding arrest did not involve the requisite \u201cinfliction or threat of serious bodily harm\u201d described in the statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quincy Q., </em>434 Mass. 859, 863 (2001) (youthful offender indictment dismissed where based on charges of indecent assault and battery upon a child where the assault consisted of touching only and so did not involve the infliction or threat of infliction of bodily harm). Needless to say, the outcome may well have been different had the juvenile been charged as an accessory before the fact or joint venturer. However, that is not the situation here. The Juvenile Court\u2019s order dismissing the youthful offender indictment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b44-15\">In the same proceedings the juvenile was found to be a youthful offender on the basis of unrelated charges and sentenced to a committed term of eighteen months to be served in the custody of the Department of Youth Services (DYS) until such time as the juvenile reached the age of seventeen years, and thereafter in the Berkshire County house of correction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b45-7\">We note that under an elements-based approach, there is no question that the standard imposed by \u00a7 54 would not be met; as set out <em>infra, </em>G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 4, does not require proof of a violent act or any threat to commit same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b45-10\">The Commonwealth concedes, as it must, that this was the only potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>statutory basis for application of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 54, in the particular circumstances of this case. Section 54 also permits the Commonwealth to obtain a youthful offender indictment where a juvenile previously has been committed to DYS custody or where a juvenile is alleged to have committed defined offenses involving the use or possession of illegal firearms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b46-11\">In <em>State in the Interest of B.T, </em>145 N.J. Super. 268, 277 (1976), the juveniles were all involved in procuring the weapon used in a homicide, and two were present at the time of the killing. None fairly might be characterized as merely an accessory after the fact. In <em>In re Luis R., </em>204 Conn. 630, 635-636 (1987), the decision does not recite the facts of the case in any detail. However, the opinion makes it plain that the juvenile shared with the principal \u201cthe mental state required for the commission of [the] offense.\u201d From this we infer that the juvenile was either a coventurer or an accessory before the fact. In <em>Flakes </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>153 P.3d 427, 430-431 (Colo. 2007), the juvenile was charged with murder as a principal in addition to being charged as an accessory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b46-12\">We note that nowhere in its brief did the Commonwealth point out the important distinction between the cases on which it relies and the situation here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
