L. c. 265, \u00a7 13D, and resisting arrest, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B. He appeals from an order denying his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the Commonwealth, the jury could have found the following facts. On the afternoon of April 3, 2005, Boston police Officer Michael Leary was directing traffic near what was then known as the Fleet Center following a Boston Celtics basketball game. Officer Leary signalled for a crowd of pedestrians to stop so that automobile traffic could exit a garage, waving the automobile traffic on with one hand while holding the other out to direct the pedestrian crowd to stop. The defendant walked into Officer Leary\u2019s arm, then pushed the officer in the chest with both hands, forcing him back four or five feet. Officer Leary told the defendant that he was under arrest and attempted to gain hold of him. The two struggled and Officer Leary fell backward, hitting his head on the pavement. Several pedestrians came to the officer\u2019s assistance. Pedestrians also alerted Sergeant Kenneth O\u2019Brien, who was twenty-five or thirty feet away. When Sergeant O\u2019Brien reached the scene, the defendant was on top of or adjacent to Officer Leary, who was bleeding from his head. Sergeant O\u2019Brien pulled the defendant off Officer Leary. After the officers gained control of the defendant, he was handcuffed and placed inside a police cruiser, where he attempted to kick out the windows while screaming threats. A police wagon was called and the defendant was transferred to it. In addition to treatment at a hospital for the cut on his head, Officer Leary required approximately six weeks of physical therapy due to shoulder injuries he received in the altercation. The defendant did not deny that an altercation took place; he argued however that Officer Leary had initiated the encounter by assaulting him, and that he acted out of necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">At the outset, we are faced with a jurisdictional question. Although the parties both take the position that this appeal was timely filed, confusion on the docket sheet prompts us to verify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>independently that we have jurisdiction to decide the case. See <em>Mark </em>v. <em>Kahn, </em>333 Mass. 517, 519 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The trial judge signed her order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial on August 18, 2006. The defendant\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on March 13, 2007. The notice of appeal recited that the order \u201cwas not evidently docketed correctly and did not issue to the parties until March 8, 2007.\u201d In his brief, the defendant states that the order \u201cwas filed incorrectly and not distributed to the parties until March 8, 2007.\u201d The Commonwealth states in its brief that \u201cthe parties were not notified of the judge\u2019s order until March 8, 2007.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The thirty-day period for filing a notice of appeal runs not from the time an order denying a new trial is signed, or from the time the parties receive notice of it. Rather, it runs \u201cfrom the date of entry\u201d of the order. Mass.R.A.P. 4(b), as amended, 378 Mass. 928 (1979). This means that date on which notation of the judgment or order was actually entered on the docket, whether by hand or by input of data into a computer. The computer-generated docket sheet of the Boston Municipal Court (BMC) in this case does not clearly show the date of entry of the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. Indeed, it does not provide the date of \u201centry\u201d of anything included upon it. Cf. Mass.R.Civ.P. 79(a), 365 Mass. 839 (1974) (\u201cThe entry of an order or judgment shall show the date the entry is made\u201d). Rather, it lists only a date when each item was \u201cfiled.\u201d It states that the order denying a new trial was \u201cfiled\u201d on August 18, 2006, the date it was signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The word \u201cfiled\u201d typically refers to the date on which parties submit materials to the court. See, e.g., Mass.RA.P. 13(a), as amended, 406 Mass. 1601 (1990) (stating, inter alia, that \u201cfiling\u201d is timely when \u201cpapers are received by the clerk within the time fixed for filing\u201d). It is not necessarily the same as the date on which those filings are entered on the docket. See, e.g., <em>Samuels </em>v. <em>SUFA Corp., </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 922, 922 (1995) (distinguishing filing of document from entering it on docket). To the extent the computer-generated BMC docket sheet includes notations about such filings by parties, it thus appears that the date indicated is the filing date, rather than the date of entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The notation on the computer-generated docket sheet of a \u201cfiling\u201d date for the order denying a new trial below, however, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>more confusing. The date of filing of court orders and judgments has no legal significance under the rules. The only relevant date under the rules is the date of entry, but the date denominated \u201cfiled\u201d is the only date apparent on that docket sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">In the absence of any contrary indication, the \u201cfiled\u201d date might be thought to indicate that that was the date the order was not only signed, but entered on the docket. If the order had been entered on the docket on August 18, 2006, the notice of appeal in this case would have been filed well beyond the thirty-day period specified in the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">There is also, however, for reasons that are not apparent to us, a separate handwritten BMC docket sheet in this case. Some entries appear on both the computer-generated docket sheet and the handwritten docket sheet. Others appear only on one or the other docket sheet. The handwritten docket contains a two-line entry dated March 9, 2007, that reads, \u201cDecision on [Defendant\u2019s] Motion for New Trial/Denied on August 18, 2006.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">There is no indication on the handwritten docket that the March 9, 2007, date is anything but the date this notation was entered upon the docket. The presence of this entry suggests that the order was entered on the docket on March 9, 2007, and that the computer-generated docket sheet does not recite the date of entry. Indeed, we can see no reason why the March 9, 2007, entry would have been made had the order already been entered on the docket on August 18, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Further, the computer-generated docket also has an entry with a \u201cfiled\u201d date of March 15, 2007, which states \u201cBMC [a]ppeal [l]etter/[s]ent on: 03/15/2007.\u201d Under Mass.R.Crim.P. 32(c), 378 Mass. 903 (1979), the clerk was required upon entry of the order denying the motion for a new trial to \u201cimmediately mail\u201d to the parties \u201ca notice of th[e] entry\u201d of that order and to \u201crecord the mailing in the docket.\u201d This additional docket entry apparently refers to this rule 32(c) letter. The indication that the letter was mailed on March 15, 2007, provides further support for the conclusion that the order from which the defendant appeals had on that date only recently been entered on the docket. Cf. <em>Standard Register Co. </em>v. <em>Bolton-Emerson, Inc., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 570, 571-72 (1993) (discussing entry of judgment and parallel Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that notwithstanding the ambiguous computer-generated docket, the order denying a new trial was entered on the docket on March 9, 2007, not August 18, 2006. We are thus satisfied that the notice of appeal was timely filed and therefore that we have jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">On the merits of the appeal, the defendant argues that his waiver of counsel did not conform to the standards for waiver of counsel we articulated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mott, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 47 (1974). This is familiar ground. First, the request to proceed pro se must be made unequivocally. Second, it must be asserted prior to trial. Finally, it must be exercised knowingly and intelligently. <em>Id. </em>at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The first two requirements were met here. The defendant\u2019s appointed counsel failed to appear at the scheduled time for the defendant\u2019s pretrial conference, apparently due to an illness in the family. After meeting counsel before the rescheduled proceedings, the defendant asserted before one judge (not the judge who had previously appointed counsel) that he wanted to represent himself, and he signed a waiver of counsel form. At the next pretrial hearing, held before a second motion judge, he asked for the appointment of standby counsel, but again asserted, \u201cI want to represent myself.\u201d He asked if it would be \u201cpossible for you to appoint an attorney to help guide me . . . just to make sure I follow the procedures.\u201d At no time once he sought to represent himself did the defendant equivocate with respect to his desire to proceed pro se. And, as the recitation above makes clear, his request to proceed pro se was made well in advance of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">The record, however, is inadequate to support a conclusion that the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel was knowing and intelligent. In determining whether a waiver is knowing and intelligent, it is our task to evaluate \u201cthe defendant\u2019s subjective understanding of his decision and its consequences.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>399 Mass. 385, 391 (1987). In <em>Mott, </em>we spoke of the need for a \u201cmeaningful inquiry\u201d by the trial judge \u201cafter being informed that the defendant preferred to defend himself.\u201d 2 Mass. App. Ct. at 52. This is not to say that a knowing and intelligent waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>requires that any specific questions or answers be given. The Supreme Judicial Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">\u201cWe have not prescribed the questions that a judge must pose to an accused who desires to represent himself nor is there any \u2018particular piece of information that is essential to an effective waiver of counsel.\u2019 <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>545 F.2d 273, 279 (1st Cir. 1976). ... The focus of our review is the defendant\u2019s subjective understanding of his decision and its consequences. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>394 Mass. 209, 216-217 (1985). We must be confident that the defendant was \u2018adequately aware of the seriousness of the charges, the magnitude of his undertaking, the availability of advisory counsel, and the disadvantages of self-representation.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>376 Mass. 790, 795 (1978).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>425 Mass. 718, 719-720 (1997), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>399 Mass, at 390-391.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">When the defendant initially sought to represent himself, the first motion judge, at least on the record, made no inquiry of the defendant, nor did she provide him with any information. She said simply, \u201cOkay. Could we give Mr. Mullen a [wjaiver of [cjounsel?\u201d The defendant was given and signed a waiver form.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There was thus no colloquy on the record concerning the defendant\u2019s decision to proceed pro se. We have expressed a preference for \u201cinquiry about [the defendant\u2019s] understanding of his situation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 208 n.5 (1983); see <em>id. </em>(\u201cA colloquy between the judge and defendant by which the defendant is warned of the difficulties involved in rejecting the assistance of counsel would be a useful procedure to nail the point down\u201d). We recognize that defendants who seek to proceed pro se may sometimes strongly insist that they be permitted to represent themselves; indeed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>judge\u2019s decision denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial may be read to suggest that that was the case here. But the court must nonetheless make sure a defendant\u2019s waiver is made with the required understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Standing alone, the interaction with the first motion judge and the defendant\u2019s signature on the waiver form are inadequate to permit us to conclude that the defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing and intelligent. He was provided with none of the information necessary to make an informed decision, nor was he asked whether he understood the consequences of the decision he made. Further, the waiver form he signed did not contain the certification required by S.J.C. Rule 3:10, as amended, 416 Mass. 1306 (1993), which requires that waiver of counsel be accomplished by signing a form that contains a certificate signed by the judge that he or she has properly informed the defendant in accordance with that rule and G. L. c. 21 ID, \u00a7 5, of his or her right to counsel, and that the party has knowingly elected to proceed without a lawyer. See S.J.C. Rule 3:10, \u00a7 3. The judge\u2019s signing of the required certification, while not conclusive, provides some evidence that the defendant\u2019s waiver is knowing and intelligent. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>371 Mass. 46, 54 &amp; n.5 (1976).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">At the subsequent hearing where the defendant requested standby counsel, the second motion judge said to standby counsel, in the defendant\u2019s presence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">\u201cI would hope that after talking with [the defendant], he would realize that you are an experienced, competent and excellent trial attorney, who is more than capable of representing [the defendant],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">\u201cBecause if [the defendant] wishes to go pro se, since he\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>not skilled in the areas of the law and/or evidence, it could be a situation \u2014 and this does carry a jail penalty. [The defendant] could be jeopardizing himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">\u201cSo, [the defendant], I can tell, the way he\u2019s written the motions, is an intelligent person. And I would assume that after he sits down and talks to you, he would feel very comfortable in having you represent him in the matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The Commonwealth argues that this \u201ccolloquy was sufficient to establish that the defendant\u2019s decision to waive his right to counsel and exercise his right to self-representation was made knowingly and intelligently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The second motion judge was doubtless unaware that the defendant had not participated in an adequate colloquy at the time of his initial waiver, and his statement was obviously not intended to replace a proper colloquy on the defendant\u2019s request to proceed pro se. In theory, such a statement could have apprised the defendant of the seriousness of the charges, the magnitude of the undertaking, and the disadvantages of self-representation. But there is nothing in the record from which we can establish what the Commonwealth correctly acknowledges is the important fact: that the defendant subjectively understood his decision and its consequences. There is no evidence that the defendant heard and understood the information in the second motion judge\u2019s statement. It did not call for a response and none was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The Supreme Judicial Court has also permitted consideration of \u201cnot only the trial record, but also the defendant\u2019s \u2018background, experience and conduct.\u2019 This includes \u2018such factors as his involvement in previous criminal trials, his representation by counsel before trial, and the continued presence of advisory counsel at trial in determining whether he understood what he was getting into.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>399 Mass, at 391, quoting from <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>545 F.2d at 278, 279. There is nothing in the defendant\u2019s background, experience and conduct, however, that demonstrates the requisite understanding. We have no information indicating that the defendant had \u201cconsiderable\u201d experience with the criminal justice system.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Compare <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Pamplona, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 241-242 &amp; n.l (2003).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nor is this a case where the defendant was represented consistently by counsel prior to trial or in which standby counsel was present at trial. Compare, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>399 Mass, at 391 (\u201cThe colloquy between the judge and Barnes, Barnes\u2019s two prior experiences with the criminal justice system, and the availability of counsel in the pretrial proceedings and the trial itself, convince us that Barnes\u2019s waiver was constitutionally effective\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Finally, the Commonwealth suggests that the defendant \u201cconducted himself appropriately\u201d during the proceedings below, undertaking formally appropriate actions (he cross-examined witnesses, moved to dismiss the charges at the end of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, and made a closing argument). But even assuming without deciding that, in the absence of a colloquy or some other indication of understanding, the quality of a defendant\u2019s attempt at self-representation might be considered in evaluating his decision to proceed without counsel, it would have to rise well above the basic level of appropriate conduct described here to demonstrate that any prior waiver was knowing and intelligent. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>394 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>at 219 (legal sophistication of pro se defendant cited only as providing \u201cfurther support\u201d for conclusion of knowingness and intelligence that court had already reached); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 209 (noting that \u201cdefendant also appears to be somewhat conversant with court procedures\u201d as part of lengthy discussion of many indications that defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing and intelligent).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Because the record does not support a finding that the defendant\u2019s decision to waive his right to counsel was both knowing and intelligent, we conclude that his waiver was constitutionally ineffective. The judgments must be vacated, findings set aside, and the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-8\">That form stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">\u201cI, the above-named defendant, have been informed of my right to have a lawyer appointed by the court at public expense if I am found indigent or to hire a lawyer at my own expense to represent me at any stage of the proceedings in this case. I understand this right to a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">\u201cI ELECT TO PROCEED WITHOUT A LAWYER AND I WAIVE MY RIGHT TO A LAWYER.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b168-8\">The defendant hypothesizes that the court used an \u201coutdated\u201d form, although the certification requirement was added to the Supreme Judicial Court Rules some fifteen years ago in 1993. See S.J.C. Rule 3:10, as amended, 416 Mass. 1306 (1993). Judicial compliance with rule 3:10 is mandatory, and the rule is designed to remind the judge accepting the waiver of his or her responsibility properly to inform the defendant of his or her rights and to ensure that any waiver is voluntary. Following the proper procedure here might well have avoided the instant dispute. \u201cThe primary responsibility for insuring that a written waiver of counsel form has been executed and filed lies with the court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hurst, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 603, 604 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b169-9\">The Commonwealth does not contend otherwise. At sentencing, the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>monwealth reported to the trial judge that the defendant had no other criminal record in Massachusetts. The Commonwealth reported that it had information from a newspaper article that suggested the defendant had some type of record from Rhode Island, but that there was no information available about it because it appeared to have been \u201cexpunged\u201d or \u201csealed.\u201d And, as the Commonwealth acknowledged, even if a court could rely on this, there is no indication on the record that the incident to which the newspaper report referred even involved a matter that went to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pamplona, supra </em>at 241-242, we relied upon our conclusion that the defendant had considerable experience with the criminal justice system in holding that, in all the facts and circumstances, \u201cthe judge\u2019s colloquy\u201d was not \u201cinsufficient.\u201d In that case there was a \u201ctruncated\u201d colloquy when the defendant asserted, after jury selection, that he did not want to proceed with appointed counsel \u2014 an act we held the trial judge could properly have concluded was \u201ca manipulative eleventh hour attempt to obstruct the orderly disposition of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 207. The trial judge properly explained to the defendant there that the consequence of refusing without good cause to proceed with appointed counsel would be self-representation, and in the ensuing colloquy the defendant asserted in response to questions that he understood that there were difficulties inherent in representing himself and that knowledge of the law and of the rules of evidence would be helpful at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 241-242.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b171-6\">We note that in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pamplona, supra </em>at 243, we examined the propriety of the defendant\u2019s conduct of his defense at trial only in evaluating his claim that he had not been competent to waive his right to counsel, not in our discussion of the knowingness and intelligence of that waiver. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>While the defendant has not raised a claim of incompetence here, we also note that at sentencing below, the trial judge did order the defendant to obtain psychiatric treatment as a condition of probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
