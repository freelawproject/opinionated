L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, the so-called anti-SLAPP statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cStrategic litigation\u201d is indeed implicated in this case, although not as the Legislature intended, nor as the defendants argue. The statute was enacted in order to protect ordinary citizens from meritless litigation brought by large private interests for the purpose of tamping or threatening citizens\u2019 rights to petition their government. See <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass. 156, 161 (1998); <em>Matter of the Discipline of an Attorney, </em>442 Mass. 660, 673 (2004). In this case the statute is instead invoked by the defendant workers\u2019 compensation insurer and one of its employees, claiming that their petitioning rights have been threatened by the plaintiff, a now-homeless, injured employee to whom the insurer denied workers\u2019 compensation benefits and against whom the insurer later groundlessly urged insurance fraud charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\"><em>Background. </em>On October 8, 2000, while working at the Bay State Paper Company (Bay State), the plaintiff, Jesse Maxwell, injured his shoulder, neck, and back by picking up a 100-pound drain grate. He promptly reported the injury to Bay State and sought medical treatment for the injury. X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging showed that he had a tom left rotator cuff. Maxwell\u2019s injuries limited the mobility, strength, and range of his left, dominant arm and caused him serious pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Maxwell attempted to return to work, but his injuries precluded him from resuming his duties. As a result, on October 18, 2000, Bay State\u2019s human resources coordinator completed a \u201cFirst Report of Injury or Fatality\u201d (a form of the Department of Industrial Accidents [DIA]), reporting the incident and stating that, as of that date, Maxwell was totally or partially incapacitated.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">The record does not show what, if any, investigation Bay States\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation insurer, AIG Domestic Claims, Inc. (AIG), made after receiving this report or before denying Maxwell all benefits on October 31, 2000. The only reason AIG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>gave for denying benefits was that it had not received medical documentation with the claim. That was rectified shortly thereafter when Maxwell, through his attorney, submitted to AIG medical records documenting his injury and his total disability. Despite the fact that its previous denial had purportedly been based only on the fact that it had not received medical documentation, nothing in the record shows that AIG reevaluated its position once it received the medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Maxwell filed a claim with the DIA on November 29, 2000. At the same time, being without a job or benefits, he sought refuge in various homeless shelters, including the one at the Boston branch of the YMCA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a condition of residence at the YMCA shelter, Maxwell was required to participate in a job training program conducted by Community Work Services,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a requirement with which he complied from February, 2001, through May, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Community Work Services is a nonprofit organization that has been in operation since the late Nineteenth Century. The Community Work Services program in which Maxwell participated was a training program for those who are homeless and who, by virtue of their disabilities or economic challenges, cannot be employed in the competitive open labor market. The purpose of the program is to provide vocational and rehabilitative training to help people return to the workforce. Maxwell was never employed by Community Work Services, and he received neither earnings nor wages for his participation in the program.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">In April, 2001, AIG retained a private investigator to follow and observe Maxwell. There is nothing in the record to indicate why AIG decided to hire a private investigator, let alone any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>evidence in the record to suggest that AIG had any reason to believe that Maxwell was not entitled to benefits or had not truthfully submitted a claim. In any event, under AIG\u2019s direct supervision, the investigator conducted a preliminary investigation on April 3 and 4, 2001. First, the investigator searched motor vehicle records for Maxwell and his family.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> No explanation is given, nor is one readily apparent, as to why AIG believed Maxwell\u2019s motor vehicle records \u2014 or those of his family members \u2014 bore on Maxwell\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Second, through surveillance and questioning, the investigator attempted to determine whether Maxwell continued to live on Stuart Street in Boston, his former address. He determined that Maxwell did not live there. However, the investigator, following AIG\u2019s instruction to suspend surveillance, did not pursue this line of inquiry further. As a result, the investigator did not discover that Maxwell was at this point living in a homeless shelter at the YMCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">AIG next authorized the investigator to search court records for any criminal records relating to Maxwell. The record does not reflect what, if any, basis AIG had for imagining that Maxwell had a criminal history or, more importantly, how it might bear on, or relate to, his work injury or subsequent claim for benefits. No criminal records were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Maxwell underwent an examination by an impartial medical examiner (IME) on April 25, 2001. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As part of his medical examination, Maxwell completed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>\u201cPatient Information Sheet\u201d that asked him, \u201cAre you working now?\u201d Maxwell responded, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">As previously arranged with AIG,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the investigator waited for Maxwell outside the IME\u2019s office. The investigator followed Maxwell as he took several forms of public transportation to the Naval Reserve Recruitment Center (recruitment center) in Quincy, where \u2014 for no more than an hour \u2014 the investigator observed Maxwell cleaning up trash and mopping the floor. For a couple of hours the following morning, the investigator again observed Maxwell carrying trash and mopping the floor at the recruitment center. Both days\u2019 observations were reported to AIG.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The next day the investigator submitted to AIG his final report, in which he concluded that \u201cthe claimant Jesse Maxwell is currently employed as a janitor at the Naval Reserve Recruitment Center in Quincy.\u201d The investigator\u2019s report does not indicate what, if anything, the investigator did to establish or verify that Maxwell was in fact employed as a janitor at the recruitment center. Indeed, Maxwell was not so employed. Rather, he was participating in the Community Work Services training program, and his activities at the recruitment center were part of that training.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">On April 30, 2001, an administrative law judge heard Maxwell\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim. Prior to the hearing, apparently as part of an attempt on AIG\u2019s part to lay a perjury trap, AIG\u2019s counsel asked Maxwell to complete a DIA form entitled \u201cEmployee\u2019s Earnings Report.\u201d The form stated that Maxwell had \u201can affirmative duty to report to the insurer all earnings, including wages or salary from self-employment.\u201d Maxwell reported no earnings on the form and checked and signed a box stating, \u201cI have not received earnings for any period in which I was entitled to receive Workers\u2019 Compensation Benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The administrative judge ordered AIG to pay Maxwell total temporary incapacity benefits from October 9, 2000, to the date of the hearing and partial incapacity benefits from the following day forward. AIG was also ordered to pay Maxwell\u2019s medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>costs under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 30.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> AIG did not appeal this order. Instead, on the same day as the administrative judge\u2019s award, it opened an internal fraud investigation based on its view that Maxwell had lied when he had completed the patient information sheet and the employee\u2019s earnings report.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The internal investigation was conducted by Tito Medeiros, who summarized his findings in a report dated May 28, 2001. Because it is included in Medeiros\u2019s report, we know that by that date AIG had been informed that Maxwell was involved with Community Work Services. However, the report incorrectly stated that Community Work Services was a \u201ctemp agency.\u201d Medeiros submitted his report, including this incorrect information, to the insurance fraud bureau (IFB),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and alleged that Maxwell was suspected of having engaged in insurance fraud by (a) working as a cleaning person for the recruitment center; (b) stating on the patient information sheet he filled out as part of the IME that he was not \u201cworking\u201d; and (c) stating that he had no \u201cearnings\u201d when he filled out the DIA\u2019s employee\u2019s earnings report.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In June, 2001, Community Work Services provided a packet of documentation to AIG\u2019s counsel concerning Maxwell and the training program in which he participated. Among other things, the packet described the program and the nature of Maxwell\u2019s injuries. The record does not reflect that AIG forwarded this information to the IFB even though it clearly bore on (and undercut) the allegations of fraud that AIG had made against Maxwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">On August 30, 2001, the IFB reported that it had \u201cconcluded that a material fraud, deceit or intentional misrepresentation\u201d had occurred and referred the matter to the Suffolk County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>district attorney\u2019s office. That office, in turn, on October 10, 2001, charged Maxwell with workers\u2019 compensation insurance fraud, in violation of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14, and larceny in excess of $250, in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30(1). The record does not contain any information to show that the IFB or the district attorney\u2019s office conducted any independent investigation. Instead, the evidence in the record is consistent with a finding that the IFB and the district attorney\u2019s office each relied on the investigation conducted by, and materials supplied by, AIG.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">On December 5, 2001, Maxwell attempted suicide and was admitted to McLean Hospital, a psychiatric facility. Maxwell, still homeless, reported on admission that he was \u201ctired of living,\u201d that he had previously been injured at work, that he had been denied workers\u2019 compensation, and that the insurance company was \u201ctrying to \u2018get him\u2019 for fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Two weeks later, AIG asked Maxwell to \u201cvoluntarily\u201d sign off on his workers\u2019 compensation benefits. In a subsequent confirmatory letter, defendant Alice Hathaway, alternatively described as AIG\u2019s \u201csenior complex specialist\u201d or \u201cdisability specialist,\u201d pointedly emphasized to Maxwell\u2019s counsel, \u201cAs you are aware, your client has been arraigned on Workers\u2019 Compensation Fraud and is due back in court. . . .\u201d Hathaway continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">\u201cIt is our belief that it would be in your client\u2019s best interest to sign off of weekly compensation. Since you have declined my offer to have your client sign off benefits voluntarily, I will seek to terminate your client\u2019s benefits through the Department of Industrial Accidents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">On January 14, 2002, true to its word, AIG filed with the DIA a motion for redetermination and recoupment of benefits based on Maxwell\u2019s alleged fraud and the fact that (based on AIG\u2019s report) Maxwell had been criminally charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">AIG followed this up with a letter to Maxwell\u2019s attorney on January 31, 2002, in which Hathaway offered to settle the case by dropping the motion for redetermination and paying Maxwell one dollar. Hathaway again emphasized the pendency of the criminal charges: \u201cPlease note that this offer did not include the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>waving |&gt;z'c] of any recoupment or dismissal of the pending criminal proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">After his attempted suicide on December 5, 2001, Maxwell continued to suffer from mental illness, leading to his hospitalization on several occasions during 2001 and 2002.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Hathaway, apparently frustrated that the criminal proceedings had been postponed because of Maxwell\u2019s hospitalizations and that he refused to relinquish his benefits despite her reminders concerning the criminal charges, wrote to the district attorney\u2019s office on March 25, 2002. After mentioning several times that she believed Maxwell \u201cconveniently signs himself into McLean\u2019s Hospital\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in order to avoid appearing in court, Hathaway asked that Maxwell be surrendered on an <em>unrelated </em>drug charge so that \u201cwe could suspend his weekly benefits.\u201d Hathaway had apparently earlier made the same request to Maxwell\u2019s probation officer, who had refused it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">On April 24, 2002, the DIA conducted an extensive hearing on AIG\u2019s request that Maxwell\u2019s benefits be terminated and that he be ordered to repay what had already been paid to him. The evidence during that hearing (significant parts of which are in the record before us) included unambiguous and extensive testimony from the controller of Community Work Services concerning the nature of the program in which Maxwell had participated, the fact that he had received no earnings or wages, that he had not been employed, and that his participation had been required as a condition to being allowed to stay at the YMCA homeless shelter. Despite this <em>uncontradicted </em>testimony during the DIA hearing, AIG continued to urge that the criminal charges be pressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">On November 13, 2003, Maxwell pleaded guilty to the criminal charges against him and, shortly thereafter, was ordered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>pay restitution to AIG in an amount exceeding $9,000, the amount of the benefits he had received pursuant to the administrative judge\u2019s order of April 30, 2001. The record contains no contemporaneous explanation why Maxwell decided to plead guilty, let alone why he did so at this point in time (it had been more than a year since the last event of any significance noted in the record). However, Maxwell subsequently claimed that his decision was related to his continuing precarious mental condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">On May 7, 2004 (i.e., slightly more than two years after it heard the matter), the administrative judge of the DIA issued a lengthy, detailed memorandum in which she found Maxwell had suffered a left rotator cuff tear by lifting a 100-pound grate while at work; he had promptly sought medical treatment for the injury; the injury, as well as its cause, was confirmed repeatedly in the medical records AIG had received; Maxwell had attempted to return to work but his injuries had prevented him from doing so; Maxwell had a history of continuous employment before then; Maxwell\u2019s homelessness was \u201cdirectly related to the injury sustained at work\u201d; Maxwell\u2019s participation in the Community Work Services program was required by the YMCA homeless shelter; Maxwell had received training in that program and was not \u201cworking\u201d; and Maxwell \u201chad no intention of defrauding the insurer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The administrative judge also found that AIG should have authorized and paid for Maxwell\u2019s rotator cuff surgery and that AIG\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">\u201c[fjailure to provide the employee with reasonable and necessary medical care in the absence of any effort to introduce contrary medical evidence is simply inexcusable. Moreover, had the insurer provided the requisite medical care, the employee might have been able to perform meaningful work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Finally, she found that AIG\u2019s refusal to pay for the rotator cuff surgery placed Maxwell under \u201cextreme stress\u201d that \u201cprecipitated a crisis\u201d and impaired his judgment and capacity to think clearly during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Although the administrative judge\u2019s rulings regarding the lack of fraud could not have been more clear (indeed, her find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>ings can be fairly characterized as forceful), on March 4, 2005, AIG wrote to the chief probation officer of the Boston Municipal Court Department, asserting Maxwell\u2019s failure to pay the restitution that had been part of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">On June 27, 2005, a judge of the District Court allowed Maxwell to withdraw his guilty plea because \u201cthe nature of [Maxwell\u2019s] ongoing struggle with mental illness may have clouded his judgment as to whether his plea was in his best interests.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Subsequently, the Commonwealth, through the Attorney General\u2019s Office, filed a nolle prosequi on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Almost five years had elapsed since Maxwell\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\"><em>The underlying case. </em>Maxwell brought the underlying suit against AIG and Hathaway, asserting claims for malicious prosecution and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The complaint, which is short, in sum alleges that the defendants failed to investigate adequately and did not have sufficient cause to urge criminal charges or pursue civil claims of insurance fraud and larceny. A judge of the Superior Court denied the defendants\u2019 special motion to dismiss made pursuant to the anti-SLAPP statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cWe review the judge\u2019s decision to grant the special motion to dismiss to determine whether there was an abuse of discretion or error of law.\u201d <em>McLarnon </em>v. <em>Jokisch, </em>431 Mass. 343, 348 (2000). The motion judge did not err when he found that the defendants had not met their burden of showing that Maxwell\u2019s claims are based solely on their petitioning activities. <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., </em>427 Mass, at 167-168 (the anti-SLAPP movant has the burden to show that the claims against it are based solely on its petitioning activities and have no other substantial basis). As is clear from the complaint itself, Maxwell\u2019s claims are based fundamentally on AIG\u2019s inadequate investigation. Neither AIG\u2019s internal investigation nor the one conducted by the private investigator AIG hired and directed, was \u201cpetitioning\u201d within the meaning of the anti-SLAPP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This alone was sufficient to defeat the defendants\u2019 special motion to dismiss. However, in addition, Maxwell\u2019s emotional distress claims are based on other nonpetitioning activities, including AIG\u2019s efforts to compel Maxwell to relinquish his benefits,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and its refusal to pay for required surgery despite the administrative judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The defendants ask us to ignore the acts mentioned above, arguing that Maxwell\u2019s claims rest solely on petitioning activities, namely the defendants\u2019 report to the DFB,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the urging of criminal charges, and the request to the chief of probation that Maxwell be surrendered. This argument fails for two reasons. First, as noted above, the defendants did not meet their burden of showing that Maxwell\u2019s claims rest solely on the defendants\u2019 petitioning activity, and the fact that some petitioning activity is implicated is not enough where, as here, the root of the claims (the investigation) is nonpetitioning. See <em>Garabedian </em>v. <em>Westland, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 427, 432 (2003) (the special movant must show that the \u201cclaims are based on the petitioning activi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>ties of the movant <em>alone </em>and have no substantial basis beyond those activities\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Second, even had Maxwell\u2019s claims been based solely or substantially on the defendants\u2019 petitioning activities, he met his burden of showing<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> that the defendants\u2019 exercise of their \u201cright to petition was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law\u201d and that the defendants\u2019 acts caused him actual harm. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H. The defendants referred Maxwell\u2019s claim as a case of suspected insurance fraud to the IFB based on what can, at best, be characterized as an incomplete investigation into the alleged fraud. AIG\u2019s conclusion that Maxwell was \u201cemployed\u201d and earning \u201cwages\u201d appears to have been based on nothing more than the private investigator\u2019s observation of Maxwell though a window while he mopped and took out the trash at the recruitment center. This was not \u201creasonable factual support,\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, particularly because AIG knew at the time it referred the matter to the IFB that Maxwell was involved in Community Work Services. Moreover, AIG\u2019s referral to the IFB was based on its assertion that Community Work Services was a \u201ctemp\u201d agency \u2014 an assertion that the record shows was flatly incorrect.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Even if AIG\u2019s petitioning was not completely \u201cdevoid\u201d of all reasonable factual support as of the day it reported the case to the IFB, it certainly became so in June, 2001, when it received documentation directly from Community Work Services showing that Maxwell was in a training program and not employed. The record does not show that AIG submitted this information to the IFB, or that it ever corrected the misstatement it had previously made to the IFB. AIG had this information in hand before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>IFB referred the matter to the district attorney\u2019s office for criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The defendants\u2019 subsequent petitioning, in the form of urging criminal charges and seeking to have Maxwell surrendered on unrelated criminal charges, rested on even fewer facts. The defendants continued to urge enforcement of the restitution order even though they knew that the uncontradicted evidence was that Maxwell had not been employed and had not received wages. They alleged, without any basis, that Maxwell was feigning mental illness and \u201cconveniently\u201d checking himself residentially into McLean Hospital. Nothing but conjecture and cynicism supported this statement, which was the sole basis in turn for requesting that Maxwell be surrendered on unrelated charges so that AIG could stop paying benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Thus, the special motion was properly denied both because the defendants did not meet their initial threshold burden of showing that Maxwell\u2019s claims were based solely on their petitioning activities and because, to the extent that their petitioning was implicated in Maxwell\u2019s claims, it was devoid of reasonable factual support.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Finally, the motion judge did not err in determining that Hathaway was not exercising her own right of petition but was instead at all times acting on AIG\u2019s behalf. The anti-SLAPP statute does not apply unless a party is exercising her own right of petition. See <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Gastfriend, </em>443 Mass. 327, 332 (2005); <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Lint, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 364-365 (2007). Accordingly, the motion was correctly denied with respect to Hathaway.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">\n<em>Order denying the special motion to dismiss affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b712-9\">\u201cThe acronym SLAPP stands for \u2018strategic litigation against public participation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Garabedian </em>v. <em>Westland, </em>59 Mass.
