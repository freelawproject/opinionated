L. c. 111, \u00a7 1271, to bring a vacant property owned by Jadwiga Rochalska into compliance with State sanitary and building codes. After the receiver had been appointed, his role was limited to \u201ctak[ing] all necessary steps to enable the Boston Fire Department to enter the premises in the event of a fire.\u201d Having completed that task, the receiver was discharged, and following a hearing to establish the reasonableness of his claimed expenses, he was awarded $124,353.49.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The intervener, Marian Sklodowski, filed this appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from various orders and judgments of the Housing Court, primarily claiming that G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 1271, does not apply to vacant buildings and it was thus error to deny his motion to vacate the appointment of a receiver. He also appeals from the denial of Rochalska\u2019s motion to dismiss the city\u2019s petition to appoint a receiver (based on a claim of insufficiency of service of process); the denial of his own motion to amend findings of fact and rulings of law (asserting, inter alia, that the receiver committed a fraud on the court); and the award of $124,353.49 to the receiver, claiming that findings regarding certain allowed expenses of the receiver were not supported by the evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>1. <em>Background and proceedings. </em>Some years prior to the commencement of the within proceeding, the city through its inspectional services department condemned the property located at 199-201 Athens Street in Boston (property) as unfit for habitation due to various sanitary and building code violations, and issued a vacate order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On January 16, 2002, the city filed its petition in the Housing Court for the appointment of a receiver for the property, alleging that the abandoned property had been condemned as unfit for human habitation in that, among other things, the porches were in a badly deteriorated state and conditions at the property presented a public safety hazard and a danger of vandalism, trespass, fire, and illegal activities occurring there.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">As also set forth in the complaint, Rochalska had not applied for permits to remedy these conditions after the condemnation of the property entered, and there was a risk that the building would be destroyed beyond repair absent the appointment of a receiver who would be obligated to secure the property, repair it, and bring it into conformity with applicable sanitary and building codes. Following several unsuccessful attempts to personally serve Rochalska with the petition, the city\u2019s motion for service by publication was allowed, and on March 19, 2002, Jonathan Kaye was appointed receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Some two weeks later, Rochalska, through an attorney, filed a motion supported by affidavits to stay the receivership, claiming that she was never served with notice of the proceedings and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>prepared to \u201cimmediately commence the rehabilitation of the entire subject property.\u201d The motion to stay was allowed by an order dated May 14, 2002, on the ground that \u201cit is in the interests of justice to afford the respondent [Rochalska] an opportunity [within twenty-one days] to show that she is capable of rehabilitating the premises.\u201d The order did not fully divest the receiver of authority, however, but rather authorized Kaye \u201cto take all necessary steps to enable the Boston Fire Department to enter the premises in the event of a fire.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Two motions to dismiss the petition for appointment of a receiver were thereafter filed on Rochalska\u2019s behalf by another attorney (not apparently associated with the attorney who filed the motion to stay). The first sought to dismiss the petition without prejudice on the basis that Rochalska \u201chas conveyed the property to Mari[a]n Sklodowski, an experienced contractor . . . [who] is now prepared to renovate the property and bring it into compliance with the applicable codes.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The second motion was brought pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.R 12(b)(5), 365 Mass. 755 (1974), and alleged insufficient service of process.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Both motions to dismiss were eventually denied.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Sklodowski\u2019s motion to intervene as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>party defendant was allowed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In December, 2002, Sklodowski, as intervener, filed a motion seeking to \u201cvacate and/or dissolve\u201d the receivership, contending that the property was unoccupied and thus not subject to the appointment of a receiver under G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 1271. Two weeks later, the motion to vacate the receivership was denied but the motion to dissolve it was allowed, and Sklodowski was ordered \u201chereafter responsible for the rehabilitation of the property in question and bringing it into compliance, under continued court supervision, and subject to the right of [the city] to move for the appointment of a receiver for the property should the rehabilitation work fail to progress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">A hearing was conducted before a judge of the Housing Court to determine the amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the receiver for work undertaken from the date of his appointment, March 19, 2002, to December 5, 2002. In his order dated September 30, 2003, the judge determined that $124,353.49 in costs and expenses had reasonably been incurred and that, $50,000 having been paid, the balance due to the receiver was $74,353.49, plus $7,597.19 in interest. The judge denied without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>hearing Sklodowski\u2019s motions for new trial and to amend findings of fact and mlings of law pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(b), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996). Final judgment entered on March 24, 2005.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">2. <em>Summary of findings. </em>\u201cWe give a summary account of this protracted case embodied in a very extensive record. In doing so we apply the rule that findings of fact made by the judge below are to be accepted by us unless clearly erroneous, Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a), . . . and we also take the view that more general appraisals by the judge ... are entitled to respect although they are not binding on us.\u201d <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Authy., </em>379 Mass. 703, 705 (1980). Additional findings and evidence to support them will be included in our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The property, which consists of two three-story buildings each containing three dwelling units, was vacant when the petition to appoint a receiver was filed. Rochalska was the owner of the property and had allowed it to become vacant when she received numerous notices of health and building code violations at the property; she attended hearings held by the city\u2019s inspectional services department that, in August, 2000, resulted in the issuance of an order of condemnation and an order to vacate the building. The property was in a dilapidated condition with rear porches in danger of imminent collapse. As a result of homeless people frequenting the building, several fires occurred there; the building was without essential utilities or smoke alarms, and debris and furniture blocked ingress and egress, rendering the property impassable. The Boston fire department had declared that the building was unsafe and dangerous, posting a red \u201cX\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>on the door. Despite having been given time to obtain permits and make repairs after the building was condemned, Rochalska did not undertake any substantial repairs, and a receiver was then appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Kaye, as receiver with authority to undertake the repairs necessary \u201cto enable the Boston Fire Department to enter the premises in the event of a fire,\u201d cleared the debris, discarded furniture that blocked ingress and egress to the property, and reconstructed the rear porches.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">3. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Service of process. </em>The claim that Rochalska was not properly served with process and that the judge thus erred in denying Rochalska\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.R 12(b)(5) was waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Passing the question (not raised by the parties) of the intervener\u2019s standing to appeal from the denial of Rochalska\u2019s motion, cf. <em>Box Pond Assn. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass. 408, 415 (2001), we note that when Rochalska requested the Housing Court to stay the receivership so that she could \u201ccommence the rehabilitation of the entire subject property,\u201d she was asking that the court exercise its jurisdiction over the parties; as such she \u201cwaive[d] all questions in regard to service [of process] and submitted her]self to the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>286 Mass. 329, 333 (1934), quoting from <em>Gahm </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>206 Mass. 39, 44-45 (1910). See <em>Bateman </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>297 Mass. 483, 486 (1937) (\u201cparty may lose the right to object to lack of proper service of process by . . . pleading to the merits\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">b. <em>Scope of G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 1271. </em>We disagree with Sklodowski\u2019s argument that his motion to vacate the receivership was wrongfully denied<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> because G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 1271, does not apply to unoccupied buildings.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He argues that the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>language permits a court to appoint a receiver only when such appointment is \u201cin the best interest of the occupants residing in the property\u201d and is thus inapplicable to an unoccupied property. This misreads the language of the statute, particularly when viewed in the light of legislative intent as reflected in the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u201cWe must ascertain the intent of a statute from all of its parts, from the subject matter to which it relates, and we must construe it so as to render the legislation effective, consonant with reason and common sense.\u201d <em>Bay Colony Mktg. Co. </em>v. <em>Fruit Salad, Inc., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 662, 664-665 (1996), and cases cited. We read \u00a7 1271 as setting forth circumstances that permit a court to appoint a receiver (i.e., when it \u201cmay\u201d do so) as well as those circumstances when appointment of a receiver is mandated (i.e., when it \u201cshall\u201d do so). This case involves facts warranting the court\u2019s permissive appointment of a receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">In its opening paragraph, \u00a7 1271 provides that when \u201caffected occupants\u201d or a \u201cpublic agency\u201d (such as the city\u2019s inspectional services department) files a petition to enforce provisions of the sanitary code, the court has the discretion to choose among three options: the court may (1) issue an injunction; (2) order that affected tenants make use and occupancy payments to the clerk of the court; or (3) appoint a receiver. See <em>Brittle </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>439 Mass. 580, 594 (2003) (\u201cmay\u201d is permissive, not mandatory). Nothing in the language of this portion of \u00a7 1271 limits to occupied buildings the court\u2019s exercise of discretion to enforce the sanitary code through appointment of a receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Section 1271 goes on to describe circumstances where the court\u2019s discretion is limited, providing that the court <em>\u201cshall </em>ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>point a receiver\u201d if a petitioner shows that sanitary code violations \u201cwill not be promptly remedied unless a receiver is appointed <em>and </em>the court determines that such appointment is in the best interest of occupants residing in the property\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 1271, third par. See <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, </em>388 Mass. 607, 609 (1983) (\u201cshall\u201d is interpreted as imposing a mandatory obligation); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>439 Mass. 826, 832 (2003) (\u201cWhen \u2018shall\u2019 and \u2018may\u2019 are used within the same section of a statute, there is a presumption that the Legislature realized the difference and was aware of their meanings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Section 1271 may thus be seen as requiring the appointment of a receiver to undertake remedial action when there are ongoing sanitary code violations in an occupied building \u201cand the court determines that such appointment is in the best interest of occupants residing in the property,\u201d but making the appointment discretionary when the building is unoccupied or, if occupied, when the best interests of occupants do not require appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">A review of the broader context in which the statute was enacted supports this reading of \u00a7 1271 as applicable to vacant as well as to occupied buildings. See <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>Police Dept. of Boston, </em>446 Mass. 46, 50 (2006) (\u201cin determining the legislative intent, an appellate court should construe the statute as a whole, to ensure that the statute serves its intended purpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u201cGeneral Laws c. 111, \u00a7\u00a7 127A-127N, reflect a comprehensive legislative attempt to effectuate compliance with minimum health and safety standards for residential premises.\u201d <em>Negron </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>373 Mass. 199, 202 (1977).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These sections of c. Ill address the need to protect the health and safety of occupants of buildings as well as that of the general public where vacant buildings pose a threat of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Section 127A of G. L. c. Ill, as appearing in St. 1983, c. 84, \u00a7 1, provides for the adoption of public health regulations, to be known as the \u201cstate sanitary code,\u201d which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">\u201cshall deal with matters affecting the health and well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>being of <em>the public </em>. . . [and] may provide for the demolition, removal, repair or cleaning by local boards of health and, in the cit[y] of Boston, ... by the commissioner of housing inspection, of <em>any structure </em>which so fails to comply with the standards of fitness for human habitation ... as to endanger or materially impair the health or well-being of <em>the </em>public\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Nothing in this language limits the scope of \u00a7 127A to occupied buildings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Other provisions in G. L. c. Ill further demonstrate a legislative intent to protect the health and safety of both the occupants of a building and members of the general public, and to do so through the appointment of a receiver when necessary. Section 127B provides that upon determining that a building \u201cis or may become <em>a nuisance </em>... or may be a cause of sickness or home accident to the occupants <em>or to the </em>public\u201d (emphasis added), a board of health may issue an order to vacate a building or to bring it into compliance with the sanitary code. In the event of failure to comply with the board of health\u2019s requirements, the court may appoint a receiver to enforce the board\u2019s orders.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">We note further that nothing in the General Laws defines a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>nuisance as being limited to occupied buildings. A common nuisance is defined, inter alia, as \u201ca burnt, dilapidated or dangerous building or other structure.\u201d G. L. c. 139, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1970, c. 649, \u00a7 2. A local board of health is empowered by G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 131, when \u201cnecessary for preservation of life or health to enter any land, building or premises . . . within its town, to examine into and destroy, remove or prevent a nuisance . . . .\u201d See G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 129 (permitting court to order nuisance to be removed or destroyed); G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 130 (permitting court to enjoin the maintenance of a nuisance).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">We conclude that G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 1271, is applicable both to vacant and occupied buildings.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Such an interpretation comports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>with the plain meaning of the statute and serves the intended purpose of the statute to promote and ensure compliance with minimum health and safety standards through appointment of a receiver, when a failure to do so poses a risk of harm to the health or well-being of occupants of such buildings or to members of the public who come in contact with or live near vacant buildings that are not in compliance with applicable codes.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Here, the city complied with the requirements of G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 1271, when, after some sixteen months of inaction by Rochalska, it sought the appointment of a receiver to remedy the sanitary code violations that remained after the property had been condemned and any occupants ordered to vacate the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">c. <em>Fraud on the court. </em>Sklodowski argues that, had the judge amended his findings as requested, those additional findings would have established that Kaye as receiver committed fraud upon the court by purporting to make payments to Daniel Buckley of Hearthstone Development Group, LLC ($47,000 on April 13, 2002, and $44,525 on August 12, 2002), that in fact were returned to Kaye (by two checks to Kaye on May 3, 2002, and August 19, 2002), and by misrepresenting the amounts billed and payments made in connection with the removal and repair of the rear porches.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">A fraud on the court results from an \u201cunconscionable scheme calculated to interfere with the judicial system\u2019s ability impartially to adjudicate a matter by improperly influencing the trier or unfairly hampering the presentation of the opposing party\u2019s claim or defense.\u201d <em>Wojcicki </em>v. <em>Caragher, </em>447 Mass. 200, 210 (2006), quoting from <em>Paternity of Cheryl, </em>434 Mass. 23, 35 (2001). We need not decide whether this principle would have application to the facts as proposed by Sklodowski.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The judge, in denying Sklodowski\u2019s motion to amend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>findings of fact, implicitly discredited the evidence that Sklodowski cites as supporting the proposed findings.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cWe recognize that the judge, who has a firsthand view of the presentation of evidence, is in the best position to judge the weight and credibility of the evidence. . . . Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the fact finder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Lily Transp. Corp. </em>v. <em>Royal Inst. Servs., Inc., </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 179, 181 (2005), quoting from <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 509-510 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The judge did not abuse his discretion in failing to make additional findings. See <em>West Springfield </em>v. <em>Olympic Lounge, Inc., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 923, 924 (1998) Gudge has discretion not to revisit findings when denying motion to amend findings of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">d. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>Sklodowski contends that the evidence does not support an award of $9,694.68 for lumber and $12,575.00 for labor to reconstruct the rear porches; $20,000 for supervisory services provided by Buckley; and $9,500.00 for the \u201cReceiver\u2019s Fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">As previously stated, we accept as true the judge\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. See <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 717 (2004). With this principle in mind, we discuss each of the claimed erroneous findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">(i) <em>Rear porches. </em>There was sufficient evidence to support the award of $9,694.68 for lumber and $12,575.00 for the demolition and reconstruction of the rear porches. The evidence includes an invoice from Wachusett Lumber for $9,694.68, and check stubs reflecting payments made to Charles D. Joseph, totaling $12,575. Permit applications to remove the rear porches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>list Charles Derrick Joseph as the contractor, and Buckley testified that Joseph was licensed to work on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">(ii) <em>Receiver\u2019s fee. </em>The judge\u2019s determination that $9,500 was a reasonable fee for the receiver\u2019s services finds support in Kaye\u2019s testimony that he had received a fee of $7,500 for another receivership that was \u201cmuch less complex and less time consuming,\u201d and that, because the project had tied up his working capital, it prevented him from taking on other work. The award was not clearly erroneous. See <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass, at 510 (\u201c[W]e do not review questions of fact found by the judge, where such findings are supported on any reasonable view of the evidence, including all rational inferences of which it was susceptible. So long as the judge\u2019s account is plausible in light of the entire record, an appellate court should decline to reverse it\u201d [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">(iii) <em>Quantum meruit. </em>The judge observed that \u201c[t]he most troublesome part of the Receiver\u2019s claim involves Daniel Buckley of Hearthstone Development. . . . [T]he relationship between the Receiver and Daniel Buckley was not an arms length relationship since Buckley had worked for the Receiver as a job superintendent on a number of occasions.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> However, the judge found that \u201cthere is no doubt that Buckley performed general supervisory services for the Receiver on the subject property and is entitled to reasonable compensation for same.\u201d Concluding that \u201csubstantial work was accomplished on the project under supervision of Buckley,\u201d the judge awarded $20,000 \u201con a quantum mer[u]it basis\u201d for services performed by Buckley.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">No view of the evidence supports the amount of this award. Even crediting Buckley\u2019s testimony that he provided supervisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>and security-related services for fourteen weeks, and on this basis awarding $400 per week,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> which is the amount actually paid to Buckley for his services for eleven of the claimed weeks,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the total amount would be, at most, $5,600, not $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the orders denying (1) Rochalska\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition; (2) the intervener\u2019s motion to vacate the appointment of a receiver; and (3) the intervener\u2019s motion to amend findings of fact and rulings of law. As to the order and judgment awarding the receiver $124,353.49 for his reasonable expenses, we vacate the award of $20,000 for services provided to the receiver by Daniel Buckley of Hearthstone Development Group, LLC, and remand for such further proceedings as may be appropriate to determine a reasonable amount of reimbursement; we affirm the balance of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Rochalska apparently conveyed an interest in the property to Sklodowski during the course of these proceedings. In allowing Sklodowski\u2019s motion to intervene, the judge determined, without ruling on his specific ownership status, that Sklodowski held some interest in the property. See notes 6, 9, and 10, <em>infra. </em>Although no suggestion of death appears in the record on appeal, see Mass.R.A.P. 30(a), as amended, 378 Mass. 925 (1979), the city, in its brief, avers that Rochalska is now deceased. In any event, Rochalska never filed a brief in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Sklodowski\u2019s additional claims require no extended discussion. He asserts (in addition to his claim of fraud on the court, discussed in part 3.c, <em>infra), </em>that during trial the receiver made \u201cmeritless misrepresentations\u201d to the court regarding expenses incurred in repairing the property, but makes no argument (and cites no authority) tying the assertions to any claim of legal error. See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>451 Mass. 290, 297 (2008); <em>Redstone </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>70 Mass.

To the extent that the provision in the original order survived the entry of the stay order, the judge did not abuse his discretion in considering the receiver\u2019s application for expenses, given the judge\u2019s finding that \u201cthe Receiver proceeded with accomplishing emergency repairs whereby the . . . property was cleared of debris and discarded furniture, thus resulting in the reduction of the risk of fire, as well as reconstructing the rear porches which were in danger of imminent collapse.\u201d We address the reasonableness of the awards and the amounts in part 3.d, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The Housing Court judge found that condemnation occurred \u201c [approximately eight (8) or nine (9) years ago.\u201d The record reflects that the building was condemned, and a vacate order issued, in August, 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The initial order of appointment provided, among other things, that the receiver \u201cshall have all the rights, duties, obligations and protections of a Receiver as established by [G.

At least in part because a report from the GAL was not yet available, the court delayed ruling on several pending motions, including both motions to dismiss and the motion to intervene, until December 5, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b266-11\">In an order dated December 5, 2002 (see note 8, <em>supra), </em>which, inter alia, allowed Sklodowski\u2019s motion to intervene, a judge of the Housing Court found that Rochalska \u201cretained an interest in the property as set forth in the Addendum to the Deed,\u201d and that, on the basis of the deed and addendum thereto, see note 6, <em>supra, </em>Sklodowski \u201cmay only own a portion of the premises.\u201d The judge determined, nevertheless, that Sklodowski had \u201cdemonstrated enough of an interest of record in the premises\u201d to support allowance of the motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">Kaye, who did not appeal from the order allowing Sklodowski to intervene or from the judgment awarding the receiver\u2019s expenses, now argues that Sklodowski lacks standing to bring this appeal because the deed transferring the property from Rochalska to Sklodowski was defective in that it was recorded after notice of receivership of the property was recorded. \u201cWe treat standing as an issue of subject matter jurisdiction,\u201d <em>Ginther </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>427 Mass. 319, 322 (1998), that cannot be waived by the parties. See <em>Braun </em>v. <em>Braun, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 846, 852 (2007), and cases cited. On the facts of this case, we conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing SHodowski\u2019s motion to intervene.

App. Ct. 392, 394-395 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Apparently addressing motions or pleadings concerning a dispute between Rochalska and Sklodowski as to ownership of the property (filed after entry of the interlocutory order determining the reasonableness of the receiver\u2019s expenses), the judge who had decided the issue of the receiver\u2019s expenses determined, in an order dated March 24, 2005, that the \u201climited purpose\u201d for which the court had exercised its jurisdiction \u201chas been satisfied and the receivership was effectively terminated.\u201d The judge noted that \u201cwith consent of . . . Rochalska, as well as her Guardian Ad Litem, [Sklodowski] proceeded to take corrective action in place of the Receiver, thereby effectively dissolving the receivership, and [Sklodowski] brought the property in question up to code as a result of which said property has been rehabilitated and put back on the rental market.\u201d The order further alludes to actions brought by the GAL, then pending in the Probate and Family Court, contesting Sklodowski\u2019s claim of title to the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b268-9\">We reject Kaye\u2019s claim that the absence of the transcript from the hearing held on March 19, 2002, which resulted in the appointment of the receiver, precludes Sklodowski from arguing that the judge made any error in the appointment. Sklodowski\u2019s appeal does not relate to issues presented during the March 19, 2002, hearing. Rather than relying on facts that may have been elicited during that hearing, Sklodowski instead bases his argument on his interpretation of G. L. c.
