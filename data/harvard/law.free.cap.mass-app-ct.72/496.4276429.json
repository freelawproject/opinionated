Immediately after the termination of her rights to emergency assistance by the Department of Transitional Assistance (department), Nogeiro secured a temporary restraining order staying the decision until a preliminary injunction hearing could be held. Prior to that hearing, she entered into an advantageous settlement with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>department without further involvement of the court. As Federal law requires that a judge order or sanction the material change in the legal relationship of the parties, we conclude that Nogeiro is not entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\"><em>Background. </em>Nogeiro and her eighteen month old daughter had been receiving temporary emergency shelter benefits from the department for approximately fifteen months before the department terminated her benefits on November 16, 2005, for noncompliance with her self-sufficiency plan, a requirement of the assistance program.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, Nogeiro had not saved the amount of money per month required by the self-sufficiency plan and had not found a tutor to help her obtain her GED. Prior to the termination of her benefits in November, 2005, Nogeiro had received both written notice from the department that she was not in compliance with her self-sufficiency plan and a hearing before a department hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">On December 7, 2005, Nogeiro filed a complaint in the Superior Court seeking judicial review pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. Nogeiro\u2019s complaint asserted that department\u2019s decision was procedurally flawed and substantively incorrect, that certain findings were not supported by substantial evidence, that the termination violated State and Federal due process guarantees, and that it violated Federal benefit payment procedures. Nogeiro requested several forms of relief, including $7,200 in attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. Nogeiro also filed a motion for a stay, \u201cin the nature of a temporary restraining order and/or a preliminary injunction,\u201d of the department\u2019s termination decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">On December 7, 2005, the day that the complaint and motion for stay were filed, a judge of the Superior Court held a meeting with counsel in chambers<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and subsequently granted a temporary restraining order requiring that the department stay the decision to terminate Nogeiro\u2019s benefits until a preliminary injunction hearing was held on December 16, 2005. The judge issued no findings or statement of reasons with the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Before the preliminary injunction hearing on December 16, 2005, the department and Nogeiro agreed that the department would rescind its decision to terminate Nogeiro\u2019s emergency assistance benefits and would maintain Nogeiro and her daughter in emergency shelter \u201cunless and until some subsequent ground for termination arises.\u201d The parties agreed that Nogeiro would have until December 30, 2005, to file a motion for attorney\u2019s fees, although the department did \u201cnot concede that plaintiff qualifies as a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 for purposes of a fees award and specifically reserve[d] the right to argue that she [was] not . . . .\u201d The agreement, which was reflected in a letter from Nogeiro\u2019s counsel, further provided that \u201c[u]pon resolution of the motion for fees, the parties will enter into a stipulation for dismissal without prejudice.\u201d The agreement was not presented to the court. The December 16, 2005, hearing on the preliminary injunction did not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Nogeiro filed her motion for attorney\u2019s fees on December 30, 2005. The department opposed the motion, arguing that Nogeiro was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. On January 31, 2006, the Superior Court judge ruled that the plaintiff was not the prevailing party as the \u201cparties waived [their] right to attorney\u2019s] fees by entering into a negotiated settlement.\u201d The parties thereafter entered into a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In entering into the stipulation, Nogeiro expressly did \u201cnot waive her claim to an award of attorney\u2019s fees and expressly reserve[d] her right to appeal\u201d the denial of the motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Nogeiro then timely appealed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>Nogeiro\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b), which provides that in actions to enforce specific statutes, including 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000), \u201cthe court, in its discretion, may allow the <em>prevailing party . . . </em>a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nogeiro asserts that she is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under \u00a7 1988(b) and therefore that she is entitled to $7,200 in at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>tomey\u2019s fees. On appeal, \u201c[w]e review the judge\u2019s decision that the plaintiff is not a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 de novo.\u201d <em>Newell </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Retardation, </em>446 Mass. 286, 298, cert, denied, 549 U.S. 823 (2006) <em>(Newell).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">According to <em>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>West Virginia Dept. of Health &amp; Human Resources, </em>532 U.S. 598, 605 (2001) <em>(Buckhannon), </em>in order for a party to prevail, she must have obtained a \u201cjudicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.\u201d This requires both a \u201cmaterial alteration of the legal relationship of the parties,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 604, quoting from <em>Texas State Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>489 U.S. 782, 792-793 (1989), and \u201cjudicial imprimatur on the change.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605. See <em>Newell, </em>446 Mass, at 297-298. It is not enough for the litigation to be a catalyst for a defendant\u2019s voluntary change in conduct. See <em>Buckhannon, supra </em>at 605; <em>Newell, supra </em>at 289. Cajoling and even orders that promoted the voluntary settlement of the matter are not sufficient. See <em>Newell, supra </em>at 300. The court must order the material change in that relationship, or at least impose its judicial sanction on the agreed-upon material change in the legal relationship. See <em>Buckhannon, supra </em>at 605. Thus \u201cenforceable judgments on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees create the \u2018material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties\u2019 necessary to permit an award of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In the instant case, we conclude that there has not been a judicially ordered or sanctioned material change in the relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 605. Rather, the lawsuit catalyzed a voluntary change by the department. The judge\u2019s involvement was limited to the issuance of a temporary restraining order staying action by the department until a hearing could be held on a preliminary injunction. Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 65.2 (1981) (\u201cThe [temporary restraining order] serves principally to maintain the status quo pending a hearing\u201d). As provided in Mass.R.Civ.P. 65(a), 365 Mass. 832 (1974), temporary restraining orders ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>pire after ten days at the most.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They are also \u201cfrequently made on the basis of greatly abbreviated records . . . with little opportunity for the respondent to work up a carefully considered, let alone well-documented, response.\u201d <em>Royal Dynasty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chin, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 171, 173 (1994). With their informal process, ten-day lifespan, and purpose of preserving the status quo, temporary restraining orders are not in and of themselves judicial orders of sufficient enduring substance and effect to support a \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees award.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In the instant case, we need not confront the issue left unresolved by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Sole </em>v. <em>Wyner, </em>551 U.S. 74 (2007), a decision in which the Court held that a party who \u201cgains a preliminary injunction does not qualify for an award of counsel fees under \u00a7 1988(b) if the merits of the case are ultimately decided against her,\u201d but also stated that \u201c[w]e express no view on whether, in the absence of a final decision on the merits of a claim for permanent injunctive relief, success in gaining a preliminary injunction may sometimes warrant an award of counsel fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86. See <em>T &amp; D Video, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>450 Mass. 107, 108 (2007) (\u201ca party who obtains a preliminary injunction . . . may be required to await further developments in the case to clarify whether it is a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Here, no preliminary injunction hearing was held, and no substantive order addressing the merits was ever issued. The temporary restraining order that did issue contained no analysis and dissolved by its own terms and the requirements of rule 65(a) within ten days. See generally <em>Sole </em>v. <em>Wyner, supra </em>at 84 (\u201cThe provisional relief immediately granted expired before appellate review could be gained, and the court\u2019s threshold ruling would have no preclusive effect in the continuing litigation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Unlike the temporary restraining order, the agreement between Nogeiro and the department did reflect and produce a material change in the legal relationship between the parties. The department reversed its decision, thereby allowing Nogeiro and her daughter to remain in its emergency shelter program. This settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ment agreement was not, however, sanctioned by the court. Rather, it was only a letter agreement between the parties. Therefore, although it was catalyzed by the legal action, the agreement that provided Nogeiro with her desired legal relief \u201clacks the necessary judicial <em>imprimatur </em>on the change\u201d for the award of legal fees pursuant to \u00a7 1988. <em>Buckhannon, 532 </em>U.S. at 605. As the court stated in <em>Newell, </em>\u201cin order to recover attorney\u2019s fees, any beneficial arrangements [attorneys] secure for their clients must be reduced to a written agreement endorsed by a judge.\u201d 446 Mass, at 303. That requirement has not been met here.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Nogeiro also received assistance under the Federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program for herself and the Transitional Assistance to Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC) program for her daughter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b523-9\">While this meeting in chambers was not reported in the record, both parties stated in their appellate briefs that the meeting occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The parties did not follow the agreement in this respect because, as previously noted, the agreement specified that the case would be dismissed <em>without </em>prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Nogeiro\u2019s application for direct appellate review was denied by the Supreme Judicial Court on January 31, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b524-11\">For the first time on appeal, the department asserts that Nogeiro should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>precluded from claiming attorney\u2019s fees because she did not specifically assert a claim under an enumerated statute as required by \u00a7 1988(b). We disagree because the complaint adequately alleged a \u00a7 1983 action. <em>Woodbridge </em>v. <em>Worcester State Hosp., </em>384 Mass. 38, 44 n.7 (1981) (\u201cIt is settled that... if a cause of action under \u00a7 1983 is stated, a failure to plead the statute should not result in dismissal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\">In addition, such orders may be extended for another ten days for good cause shown or for a longer period with the consent of the opposing party.
