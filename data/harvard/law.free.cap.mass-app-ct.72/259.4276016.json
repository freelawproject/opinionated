L. c. 32, \u00a7 7(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Worcester, </em>431 Mass. 163, 167 (2000). While working as a 911 dispatcher for the city of Brockton police department, Teresa Damiano was injured in a fall due to the horseplay of a fellow employee. Damiano <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>injured her At the time her desk w then to a si quired for retirement ight wi the hoi Ith the ipply ro her job oenefits, st and elbow and could not return to work, \u00a1eplay began, Damiano had just stood up at ntention of going to the ladies\u2019 room and &gt;m to obtain additional copies of forms reDamiano requested accidental disability alleging that her wrist and elbow injuries were incurred as a result of and in the performance of her duties and rendered her permanently disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\">The retirement board of Brockton (board) denied Damiano\u2019s request for accidental disability retirement benefits on the basis that Damiano\u2019s injury did not occur \u201cwhile in the performance of her duties,\u201d where she was injured when she stood up from her desk intending to go to the ladies\u2019 room. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7(1). In reliance on <em>Namvar </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>422 Mass. 1004, 1005 (1996), and <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Worcester, supra, </em>the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB) upheld the board\u2019s decision. On appeal to the Superior Court, a judge vacated CRAB\u2019s decision, reasoning that Damiano\u2019s state of mind did not negate the fact that she had been injured while standing at her desk.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">While we agree with the Superior Court judge that Damiano\u2019s subjective intent does not control her eligibility for accidental disability retirement benefits, we conclude that CRAB did not err in denying Damiano accidental disability benefits on the basis that her injury was not sustained \u201cwhile in the performance of her duties.\u201d See <em>Lisbon </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 257 (1996) (if supported by substantial evidence and not legally erroneous, CRAB decision must be affirmed).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>In addition to answering 911 calls, Damiano\u2019s job as a civilian 911 police dispatcher also required her to receive calls from police officers who were calling in sick. Damiano recorded the officers\u2019 information by hand on call slips that she obtained periodically from a supply room. At approximately 9:00 a.m. on August 31, 2002, almost one hour into her shift, Damiano realized that she needed more call slips. She stood up from her desk, intending to go first to the ladies\u2019 room and then to the supply room to pick up supplies.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">As Damiano stood in front of her desk and computer, a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>officer approached her from behind and, i i an illladvised at-The cfficer pulled :ight feet across a tempt at horseplay, placed her in a headlocl Damiano away from her desk and about break room where their feet became entangled ayd they fell against a wall and then to the floor. Damiano injured her wrist and, more severely, her elbow, such that she never returned to work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Judicial review of a CRAB decision under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, is narrow. We are not called upon to determine whether the CRAB decision is based on the \u201cweight of the evidence,\u201d nor may we substitute our judgment for that of CRAB. <em>Lisbon </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra </em>at 252 n.6. A court may not set aside a CRAB decision unless the decision is legally erroneous or not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">To be eligible for accidental disability retirement benefits, Damiano must be unable to perform the essential duties of her job \u201cby reason of a personal injury sustained or a hazard undergone as a result of, and \u00a1while in the performance of, [her] duties.\u201d G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7(1). The parties do not dispute the facts that give rise to Damiano\u2019s injury. Nor, for present purposes, do they contest that Damiano\u2019s injuries render her permanently unable to perform the essential duties of her job. Rather, the sole dispute is legal \u2014 whether Damiano\u2019s injury arose \u201cwhile in the performance of\u201d her duties as a civilian 911 dispatcher. Following the long line of cases that have consistently and strictly construed the requirements of the accidental disability retirement statute, CRAB concluded, and we agree, that Damiano\u2019s disability, if any, was not owing to \u201ca personal injury sustained or a hazard undergone . . . while in the performance of her duties.\u201d See <em>Namvar </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra </em>at 1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">Damiano\u2019s entitlement to accidental disability retirement benefits under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7(1), is different altogether from her entitlement to benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Act. See GIL. c. 15 ', \u00a7 26. It cannot be gainsaid that the entitlement of wojkers, b&lt; th public and private, to workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries incurred on the job does not equate with the entitlement of a public employee to accidental disability retirement benefits for injuries incurred while in the performance of a job undertaken on behalf of the public. See <em>Hough </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd.., </em>309 Mass. 534, 537-538 (1941) (disabling injury while employed by town insufficient by itself to entitle employee to statutory disability retirement benefits; employee must additionally prove causal connection between disability and accident occurring, or hazard encountered, while engaged in work duties); <em>Lisbon </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 255-259. As noted by the Supreme Judicial Court, the language of the accidental disability retirement statute is \u201cmuch more restrictive\u201d than that of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, which allows compensation to one receiving \u201ca personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26. See <em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>340 Mass. 109, 110-111 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The reason for this distinction is plain: because accidental disability retirement benefits are more generous than those available under ordinary retirement or under a nonservice- connected disability retirement, the Legislature has created a higher bar for their invocation. \u201c [Accidental disability retirement under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7, [is] a form of retirement that provides higher benefits than ordinary (superannuation) and disability (nonserviceconnected) retirement. General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 5 and \u00a7 6, respectively.\u201d <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 172, 173 (1997). See also <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Metropolitan Dist. Commn., </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 455, 460-461 (1992) (accidental disability retirement affords more generous pension than ordinary disability retirement). In consequence, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7, \u201crequires not only that the injuries must result from one\u2019s duties but that they must also be sustained \u2018while in the performance\u2019 of these duties. The requirements are conjunctive.\u201d <em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra </em>at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Damiano sustained her injuries \u201cas a result of\u201d her duties, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>least insofar as that term has been construed in the cases. Damiano\u2019s duties required her presence at the police station, and it was at the station that she was injured. See <em>id. </em>CRAB does not argue otherwise. \u201cBut [G. L. c. 32,] \u00a7 7[,] does not stop there.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The accidental disability retirement statute also requires that the employee be unable to perform the essential duties of her job by reason of a personal injury sustained or a hazard undergone \u201cin the performance\u201d of her duties. \u201cThe construction which [Damiano] would have us place on \u00a7 7 would give little or no importance to the second requirement.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The second, and conjunctive, statutory requirement necessitates that the claimed injury be sustained \u201cin the line of duty\u201d \u2014 that is, during the actual performance of the duties that the employee has undertaken to perform on behalf of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Whether the disability complained of is owing to an injury sustained or a hazard undergone \u201cwhile in the performance of\u201d an employment duty is a factual inquiry particular to each case. \u00c1 firefighter who is injured while rushing into a burning building, or fighting a fire, as well as the police officer who is injured while directing traffic, or apprehending a fleeing felon, can easily be understood to have been injured while \u201cin the performance of\u201d duties undertaken on behalf of the public. The same cannot be said of Damiano.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Damiano\u2019s disability is not owing to an injury sustained \u201cwhile in the performance\u201d of her duties as a civilian 911 dispatcher. Rather, her disability arises from an occurrence having nothing to do with the performance of her job duties, or even, with a hazard of the type reasonably to be expected in the performance of those duties. To say that Damiano sustained her injury \u201cwhile in the performance\u201d of her duties as a civilian 911 dispatcher when the injury was sustained as a result of ill-advised and unanticipated horseplay by a fellow employee would stretch the meaning of the statutory \u201cwhile in the performance\u201d requirement beyond permissible limits. Indeed, to do so would, render insubstantial the requirement that there be a nexus between the claimant\u2019s injury and the actual performance of her job. See <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Worcester, </em>431 Mass, at 166 (statute requires that disabling injury occur while employee \u201cactually engaged in the performance of an employment duty\u201d). Compare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>340 Mass, at 111 (recognizing distinction under Workers\u2019 Compensation Act between actual performance of work and something incidental to such work).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Damiano\u2019s claim fails not because her subjective intent was to go to the ladies\u2019 room at the time the officer grabbed her in a headlock. Nor does it fail even because of the sequence in which she anticipated visiting the ladies\u2019 room or retrieving the slips. Compare <em>Namvar </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>422 Mass, at 1005; <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Worcester, supra. </em>Rather, her claim fails because her disability does not arise from an injury sustained, or a hazard undergone, <em>while in the performance of </em>her job. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In sum, Damiano\u2019s injury, which had nothing to do with the performance of her duties as a 911 dispatcher, was not sustained while in the performance of those duties. She sustained her injuries on account of an intervening fortuity unrelated to her job and while not actually engaged in the performance of her job. While Damiano\u2019s injuries may entitle her to compensation under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, or perhaps to a nonserviceconnected disability retirement, they do not entitle her to accidental disability retirement benefits for injuries sustained while in the performance of her duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">We recognize the counterintuitive nature of a result where a public employee who is injured while at work may be entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits but not to accidental disability retirement benefits on account of the same injury. The disparity results from the fact that \u201cthe causation element [of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] is far less restrictive than that of the accidental disability retirement statute.\u201d <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Worcester, supra </em>at 167. We recognize as well, as the Supreme Judicial Court has previously, that \u201cthe strict causation requirement of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7(1), can yield harsh results for employees who have suffered disabling injuries. However, . . . unless and until the Legislature amends the accidental disability retirement statute to relax this requirement, fairness demands that we apply the statute\u2019s terms consistently to all claimants.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cConsistency of treatment provides fairness among employees. If the Legislature wants to make a change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>and to devote more public funds to accidental disability retirement benefits, it can do so.\u201d <em>Namvar </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra </em>at 1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment entered below and a new judgment shall enter affirming CRAB\u2019s denial of accidental disability retirement benefits to Damiano.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-12\">In pertinent part, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7(1), as amended through St. 1996, c. 306, \u00a7 14, provides accidental disability retirement benefits to a member of a public retirement system \u201cwho is unable to perform the essential duties of his job [before attaining the maximum age for his retirement group] by reason of a personal injury sustained or a hazard undergone as a result of, and while in the performance of, his duties at some definite place and at some definite time ....\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b287-10\">In light of the board\u2019s view that Damiano did not sustain her injuries in the performance of her duties, no regional medical panel was convened to determine whether she was unable to perform the essential duties of her job and whether that inability was likely to be permanent.
