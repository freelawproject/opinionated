(O\u2019Connor), appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court affirming a decision and order of the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) on a claim brought by Jarvis Aldridge, an African-American employee of Rustic Fire Protection (Rustic). The MCAD ordered O\u2019Connor to pay Aldridge $50,000 in emotional distress damages on account of offensive racial remarks made to or about Aldridge on four different occasions by Paul Daley, O\u2019Connor\u2019s job site superintendent. The MCAD also ordered O\u2019Connor to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and to conduct annual training sessions for a period of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">On appeal, O\u2019Connor asserts that (1) imposition of liability on O\u2019Connor under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(4A), for the racially offensive remarks of Daley, is error where no employment relationship existed between O\u2019Connor and Aldridge and O\u2019Connor neither knew nor had reason to know of Daley\u2019s remarks; (2) Daley\u2019s remarks were insufficiently severe and pervasive to create a racially hostile work environment; and (3) the evidence was insufficient to support an award of emotional distress damages. We affirm, albeit on grounds different from those relied on by the MCAD. We conclude that O\u2019Connor is directly liable for tolerating the hostile work environment created by Daley where it had notice of Aldridge\u2019s claim but failed to remedy or take sufficient corrective action and, instead, returned Daley to supervise the work site.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>On December 7, 1998, Aldridge filed a complaint with the MCAD against O\u2019Connor claiming that he was an employee of O\u2019Connor and that Daley, a supervisor, had engaged in unlawful discrimination on the basis of race and color in violation of G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4(1). The alleged unlawful discrimination consisted of Daley\u2019s use of racial epithets when talking with or about Aldridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">A hearing officer concluded that Daley made the racially offensive remarks alleged; that Aldridge was not the employee of O\u2019Connor, but of Rustic; and that notwithstanding the absence of an employment relationship with Aldridge or liability under \u00a7 4(1), O\u2019Connor was liable under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(4A), on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>account of Daley\u2019s interference with Aldridge\u2019s right to a non-hostile work environment. The hearing officer awarded Aldridge $25,000 in emotional distress damages<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and ordered O\u2019Connor to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and to conduct annual training sessions for all of its employees, managers, and supervisors for a period of five years. On review, the MCAD affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, but deemed the award of emotional distress damages inadequate and vacated it. The MCAD also modified the annual training order by hmiting its application to managers and supervisors. On remand, the hearing officer awarded $50,000 to Aldridge for emotional distress damages and the MCAD affirmed. A judge of the Superior Court affirmed the MCAD decision and order and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">2. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the facts found by the hearing officer. O\u2019Connor was the general contractor on a project for renovation of two buildings at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell (UMass-Lowell). Rustic was a subcontractor at the project, responsible for installation of a new sprinkler and fire protection system. Besides Rustic, two other subcontractors worked on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Daley, who was the job site superintendent, served as O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s chief spokesperson and authority at the project. His responsibilities entailed overseeing of the work of the subcontractors, including coordinating and assisting in scheduling of the work. Daley unlocked and opened doors to various areas of the job site, and occasionally gave keys to the subcontractors and their employees, including Aldridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Daley did not assign work to Rustic\u2019s employees, order supplies on their behalf, supervise them, or tell them what to do. Ron Russell, Rustic\u2019s foreman, directly supervised and provided materials to Rustic\u2019s employees, including Aldridge. When Russell was on vacation, Aldridge served as acting supervisor. Aldridge received compensation only from Rustic for his work on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">From November 27, 1997, until the end of August, 1998, Da<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>ley and Aldridge interacted without difficulty. Thereafter, on four separate occasions, Daley made racially offensive remarks to or about Aldridge or James Lucas, an African-American who worked for O\u2019Connor as a laborer. Specifically, on August 27, 1998, in the presence of Russell and Aldridge, Daley referred to Lucas as a \u201cfucking dumb nigger.\u201d When Aldridge asked Daley if he knew what the word meant, Daley responded, \u201cIt\u2019s a phrase used in the Holocaust with reference to Jews.\u201d Upon being told that the slur referred to \u201cblack people,\u201d Daley laughed.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">A few weeks later, on September 21, in the presence of Aldridge alone, Daley again referred to Lucas as a \u201cfucking dumb nigger.\u201d Aldridge turned and walked away. The next day, during the lunch break and following a conversation about sports, Daley referred to Aldridge as a \u201cblack bastard\u201d in the presence of Russell and other pipefitters. Although angered by the remark, Aldridge did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Finally, on September 24, 1998, while Daley and Russell were driving to New Hampshire, Daley complained to Russell that Aldridge reaped the benefits of a prevailing wage job because he is a \u201cfucking nigger.\u201d On returning to the job site, Russell told Aldridge of Daley\u2019s remark. Aldridge became visibly upset. Russell also told Rustic\u2019s project manager, Chad Duboc, of Daley\u2019s comments. Aldridge informed John Duboc, Rustic\u2019s owner, about Daley\u2019s remarks and requested that he (Aldridge) be removed from the work site. John Duboc told Aldridge that Rustic needed him at the project and denied his request to work elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Aldridge wrote a letter, dated September 30, 1998, and addressed \u201cTo Whom It May Concern,\u201d detailing the four incidents. He gave the letter to Lucas and then to a union business agent in the hope that the letter would find its way to O\u2019Connor, which it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Joseph Vogel was O\u2019Connor\u2019s project manager for the UMassLowell project. Vogel visited the work site one or two times per week. In October, 1998, upon hearing that Daley had made racial comments to Aldridge, Vogel went to the work site and asked Aldridge, \u201cJarvis, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Aldridge responded angrily, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being a black man.\u201d Aldridge told Vogel that he should \u201cread the letter\u201d and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>(Aldridge) would be pressing charges against O\u2019Connor. Vogel told Aldridge that he would \u201cget to the bottom of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Daley was away on his honeymoon when Vogel began his investigation. When Daley returned, Vogel told him not to report to the job site. On October 19, Vogel and other O\u2019Connor officials met with Daley to discuss the charges. Daley adamantly denied making any racial slurs. Vogel then spoke with Russell and with Lucas, one of O\u2019Connor\u2019s own employees. Russell corroborated Aldridge\u2019s account, advising Vogel that he would \u201cback his man.\u201d Lucas denied ever being directly subjected to discrimination in any form by Daley; but when O\u2019Connor presented Lucas with a written statement to that effect, Lucas refused to sign the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">O\u2019Connor concluded its investigation without again speaking with Aldridge, without disciplining Daley, and without notifying Aldridge of the results of its investigation or that Daley would be returned to the work site. In its internal investigation summary, O\u2019Connor took the position that \u201c[sjince the specific situation is not known at this time, we will wait until a \u2018claim\u2019 is actually in house and review before taking action. (The term claim in house is referencing an \u2018official action\u2019 generated against O\u2019Connor ... \u2014 this might not happen at all).\u201d O\u2019Connor reassigned Daley to the project job site. Daley had been off the site for two weeks while on his honeymoon and an additional two weeks while the matter was investigated. Upon seeing Daley back at the job site, Aldridge packed up his tools and left work that, in his words, he loved \u2014 a job with \u201cgood money\u201d and at which he worked with \u201cgood people\u201d \u2014 because he could no longer tolerate working there while Daley was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The hearing officer credited the testimony of Aldridge and his wife that at the time of the racial remarks, Aldridge began coming home from work very disturbed and angry. He confided to his wife that his attitude was in response to Daley\u2019s racial slurs. Aldridge experienced physical manifestations of distress. He lost weight and had difficulty sleeping. He became withdrawn and isolated; he stopped playing with his children, ceased communicating with his wife, and locked himself in his room to avoid contact with them. Aldridge\u2019s outlook improved temporarily when Daley was away, but the withdrawn behavior returned when Daley returned to the job site.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>3. <em>Liability of O\u2019Connor. </em>The working arrangement that serves as backdrop to the present claim is commonplace in large construction projects where a general contractor and specialized subcontractors interact at a common work site. Aldridge\u2019s claim is unusual, however, in that he sought recovery not against Rustic, his employer,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or even against Daley, the perpetrator, but against O\u2019Connor, the general contractor, on account of Daley\u2019s racially offensive remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The MCAD did not rest its decision on G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(1), under which Aldridge brought his claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The hearing officer found, and the parties do not challenge, that Aldridge was an employee of Rustic, but not of O\u2019Connor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Absent such an employment relationship, the MCAD concluded that O\u2019Connor could not be liable to Aldridge under \u00a7 4(1), either directly or derivatively, for the acts of its supervisor, Daley.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Instead, the MCAD ruled that O\u2019Connor was liable to Aldridge under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(4A), inserted by St. 1989, c. 722, \u00a7 14, which makes it an unlawful practice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">\u201cFor any person to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with another person in the exercise or enjoyment of any right granted or protected by this chapter . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Guided by one of its decisions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that imposed liability on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>direct perpetrator<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of discrimination not part of the employment unit, the MCAD interpreted G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(4A), so as to make O\u2019Connor liable for Daley\u2019s actions regardless of its knowledge. See <em>Modern Continental/Obayashi </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against </em>Discrimination, 445 Mass. 96, 105 (2005) <em>(Modern Continental) </em>(statute to be interpreted liberally to effectuate purpose of eliminating workplace discrimination). The MCAD reasoned that O\u2019Connor and Aldridge were \u201cperson[s]\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1(1), inserted by St. 1946, c. 368, \u00a7 4, and that the right to work in an environment free from unlawful racial harassment is among the rights encompassed by the statute. Moreover, relying on <em>College-Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>400 Mass. 156,163-167 (1987) (College-Town) (employer hable under \u00a7 4[1] for intentional acts of its supervisory personnel regardless of its notice of those acts), it concluded that O\u2019Connor could be held hable under \u00a7 4(4A) for the acts of Daley regardless of its knowledge of those acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">We agree with the MCAD that O\u2019Connor could not be liable to Aldridge under \u00a7 4(1) because there was no employment relationship between O\u2019Connor and Aldridge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, no Mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>sachusetts appellate decision ever has interpreted \u00a7 4(1) to apply to an action brought by or against someone outside the employment unit. See <em>Modem </em>Continental, 445 Mass, at 97, 105 (declining to read G. L. c. 151B in manner that would absolve <em>employer </em>of all responsibility to <em>its </em>own employee for hostile work environment attributable to actions of subcontractor).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">We also agree with the MCAD that O\u2019Connor, the general contractor, is liable to Aldridge, the employee of a subcontractor at the work site, under \u00a7 4(4A). Where on the present facts we conclude that O\u2019Connor is liable to Aldridge for failing to remedy a racially hostile work environment of which it had notice, we need not resolve the more difficult question whether O\u2019Connor could be liable under \u00a7 4(4A) solely on account of Daley\u2019s remarks without regard to its awareness of those remarks.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Although no Massachusetts appellate decision ever has interpreted \u00a7 4(4A) to make an employer liable to someone other than its employee, the statutory language admits of such a result.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4(4A), makes it unlawful for \u201cany person\u201d to \u201ccoerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>person\u201d in the exercise or enjoyment of rights granted under the chapter. O\u2019Connor, Aldridge, and Daley are all \u201cpersons\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1(1), and the right to work in an environment free from unlawful racial harassment is unquestionably among the rights encompassed by the statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In our view, the present problem lies in the application of \u00a7 4(4A) not to acts of which O\u2019Connor was aware but to acts of O\u2019Connor\u2019s employees of which O\u2019Connor was not aware. We acknowledge that, generally speaking, a corporation is a legal entity that must act through agents and employees. Nevertheless, we are concerned that broad application of this principle in the context of \u00a7 4(4A) could produce untoward results not contemplated by either the language or the intent of that subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Unlike the language of \u00a7 4(1), as appearing in St. 1989, c. 516, \u00a7 4, which contemplates derivative liability by making it unlawful for \u201can employer, by himself or his agent,\u201d to engage in discriminatory practices, the language of \u00a7 4(4A), by contrast, omits any reference to agents and speaks only to the direct liability of a \u201cperson.\u201d Nor does the tort doctrine of respondeat superior dictate vicarious liability under \u00a7 4(4A). \u201c[RJespondeat superior is the proposition that an employer, or master, should be held vicariously liable for the <em>torts </em>of its employee, or servant, committed within the scope of employment\u201d (emphasis supplied). Dias v. <em>Brigham Med. Assocs., </em>438 Mass. 317, 319-320 (2002). See <em>Kavanagh </em>v. <em>Trustees of Boston Univ., </em>440 Mass. 195, 198 (2003). A discrimination action under G. L. c. 151B is, however, a statutorily created right, not a common-law tort. See <em>Jancey </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Everett, </em>421 Mass. 482, 500-501 (1995) (despite historical connection statute prohibiting discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>may have with common-law tort or contract claims, \u201cacts of discrimination \u2014 whether intentional or unintentional \u2014 do not thereby become torts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">That principles of vicarious liability operate differently, and that caution is in order in applying such principles throughout the various subsections of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, is evident from <em>College-Town, </em>400 Mass, at 163-167. There, the court considered the scope of an employer\u2019s vicarious liability under \u00a7 4(1) for discrimination in the workplace arising from the acts of its agent. Taking note that language of \u00a7 4(1) \u201cprohibits discrimination by \u2018an employer, by himself or his agent,\u2019 \u201d the court concluded that the Legislature had made clear its intent to impose vicarious liability under that section. <em>Id. </em>at 165, quoting from G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4. \u201cIt is clear that the Legislature intended that an employer be liable for discrimination committed by those on whom it confers authority.\u201d <em>College-Town, supra. </em>Guided by the Legislature\u2019s expressed intent, and without resolving the extent to which \u201cG. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 [4(1)], imposes an affirmative obligation on an employer to ensure that its workplace is not pervaded by harassment based on race, color, religious creed, national origin, sex, or ancestry, regardless of [its] source,\u201d the court held that the employer was \u201cvicariously liable for the acts of its agents \u2014 its supervisory personnel.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Significantly, in our view, <em>College-Town </em>limited the employer\u2019s vicarious liability under \u00a7 4(1) to the acts of its supervisory personnel, not those of all of its workers, as would have been the case in a common-law tort. We note, as well, that the considerations relied on in <em>College-Town </em>for holding an employer vicariously liable under \u00a7 4(1) for its supervisor\u2019s discriminatory actions either do not exist, or exist with diminished force in the context of a claim under \u00a7 4(4A) by a person like Aldridge who is not part of the employment unit. When the claimant is not part of the employment unit, the supervisor does not exercise direct supervisory authority over him. Nor does harassment by the supervisor carry the same implied threat of punishing resistance through exercise of supervisory powers as exists within the employment unit. See <em>id. </em>at 165-166. Likewise absent is the concern regarding the anomaly that a notice requirement creates when the perpetrator is also the supervisor to whom notice would be given by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>employee. See <em>id. </em>at 166-167. When the claimant is not part of the employment unit, no chain of command considerations restrict his ability to notify those with the ability to rectify the problem. Indeed, as was done here, he is free, if not obliged, first to approach <em>his own </em>employer, which has an obligation to protect its employee, whether by notifying the perpetrator\u2019s employer or by removing the claimant from the situation should notification or other protective measures prove unsuccessful. See <em>Modem Continental, </em>445 Mass, at 108-109.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Likewise, as was done here, the claimant is free to provide notice of the discrimination to those in the corporate hierarchy of the perpetrator\u2019s employer and seek protection from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We are concerned that application of principles of vicarious liability enunciated in <em>College-Town </em>for a claim under \u00a7 4(1), to a claim under \u00a7 4(4A), would render an employer strictly and immediately hable for discrimination directed at nonemployees that it had no opportunity to control. Such liability would arise regardless of the employer\u2019s knowledge of the discrimination, regardless of the remedial steps taken upon learning of the discrimination, and regardless even of the existence of strong preventive programs already in place to combat discrimination in the workplace. Such a broad application of derivative liability in the context of \u00a7 4(4A) could render an employer liable to a broad spectrum of third-party nonemployees, including subcontractors, delivery persons, and canteen workers who conduct their business on the employer\u2019s work site.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Without need to do so, we are hesitant to resolve the difficult, uncertain, and potentially limitless contours of an employer\u2019s derivative liability under \u00a7 4(4A) for acts of its own personnel of which it is unaware.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We need not do so here where O\u2019Con-nor is liable to Aldridge under \u00a7 4(4A) directly for its failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>remedy a racially hostile work environment of which it had notice. \u201cAn employer who passively tolerates the creation of a hostile working environment implicitly ratifies the perpetrator\u2019s misconduct and thereby encourages the perpetrator to persist in such misconduct, whatever the employer\u2019s precise legal relationship to the perpetrator.\u201d <em>Modem Continental, </em>445 Mass, at 105. See <em>College-Town, </em>400 Mass, at 167-168 (employer that fails to take remedial action after notification of harassment is liable therefor).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Having commenced an investigation into Aldridge\u2019s allegations against Daley and corroborated the existence of at least those comments made in the presence of Russell, O\u2019Connor failed to take the remedial steps that would discipline Daley and assure Aldridge that his concerns had been heard and that Daley\u2019s behaviors would not be tolerated. Instead, O\u2019Connor returned Daley to his job as work site superintendent. Such apparent inaction led directly, and reasonably predictably, to Aldridge\u2019s leaving the work that he loved at considerable emotional cost. In such circumstances, we hold that an employer who is on notice of unlawful discriminatory acts by its supervisor, directed toward an employee of a subcontractor at a unitary work site, and fails to take reasonably adequate remedial action is liable under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(4A).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">4. <em>The severity and pervasiveness of the hostile work environment. </em>We need not dwell long on O\u2019Connor\u2019s contention that there was insufficient proof that Daley\u2019s conduct created a racially hostile work environment. Daley\u2019s repeated, offensive, racist remarks were sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment. See <em>Gnerre </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>402 Mass. 502, 508-509 (1988); <em>Muzzy </em>v. <em>Cahillane Motors, Inc., </em>434 Mass. 409, 411 (2001); <em>Cuddyer </em>v. <em>The Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co., </em>434 Mass. 521, 522 (2001). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Daley\u2019s remarks intimidated, humiliated, and stigmatized Aldridge and other workers of his race in such a way as to pose a \u201cformidable barrier to the full participation of an individual in the workplace.\u201d <em>College-Town, </em>400 Mass, at 162. A workplace at which the job site superintendent of a general contractor repeatedly refers to African-American employees of subcontractors at the work site with epithets such as those employed by Daley and at which the general contractor, upon learning, fails to take appropriate remedial action creates a racially hostile work environment that is sufficiently severe and pervasive as to permit recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">5. <em>The emotional distress damages award. </em>The award of emotional distress damages fully was supported by the record. See <em>Stonehill College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>441 Mass. 549, 576 (2004) (emotional distress damage award must be supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d and factual basis must be \u201cmade clear on the record\u201d). Substantial evidence supports the hearing officer\u2019s findings and conclusion that Aldridge suffered emotional distress, lost weight and had difficulty sleeping as a result of the racially hostile work environment. Aldridge came home from work very disturbed and angry as a result of Daley\u2019s racial slurs. He experienced physical manifestations of distress, became withdrawn and isolated, stopped playing with his children, and ceased communicating with his wife. Such evidence was sufficient to support the determination that Aldridge suffered emotional distress and was compelled to curtail his life\u2019s activities as a result of the unlawful discrimination. See <em>ibid. </em>The award of emotional distress damages and the other remedial action ordered was within appropriate bounds. See <em>DeRoche </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn.

Characterizing Aldridge\u2019s claim a so-called \u201cinterference\u201d claim encompassed within the plain language of \u00a7 4(1) begs the question whether O\u2019Connor is a \u201ccovered employer\u201d vis-a-vis Aldridge within the meaning of that section. That Daley scheduled work, unlocked and opened doors, and occasionally gave keys to subcontractors does not transform O\u2019Connor into Aldridge\u2019s employer \u25a0\u2014 either directly or indirectly. Indeed, the Federal cases on which the concurrence relies to posit \u00a7 4(1) liability are inapposite, <em>post </em>at 563 nn.3, 4. Under the common-law agency test, no direct employer-employee relationship exists between O\u2019Connor and Aldridge because O\u2019Connor did not control the \u201cmeans and manner\u201d of Aldridge\u2019s performance or supervise Aldridge\u2019s work on the site. See <em>Moland </em>v. <em>Bil-Mar Foods, </em>994 F. Supp. 1061, 1068-1071 (N.D.

The <em>Sibley </em>line of cases, which has \u201crealized widespread attention, though not universal acceptance\u201d by Federal courts, see <em>Moland </em>v. <em>Bil-Mar Foods, supra </em>at 1072, operates within the limited circumstance where an employer that controls access to the job market and job opportunities denies a claimant the opportunity to work because of discriminatory practices. See <em>id. </em>at 1071-1072, and cases cited. Where an employer controls access to the job market and denies that access to an individual based on unlawful criteria, an employment relationship is deemed to exist even though the claimant is someone else\u2019s employee. Even were we to accept the <em>Sibley </em>rationale as applicable to claims brought under \u00a7 4(1), no such denial of access to the job market or job opportunities is present in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b582-8\">While neither the MCAD nor the Superior Court judge predicated O\u2019Connor\u2019s liability on this narrower ground, \u201cwe may affirm the lower court\u2019s judgment on any ground supporting it.\u201d <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Canton Inst. for Sav., </em>56 Mass.

Daley was a supervisor of O\u2019Connor\u2019s job site in the sense that he directed the access to the site and the timing of the work of the various subcontractors, including Rustic, Aldridge\u2019s employer.

I agree with the court\u2019s affirmance of the judgment of the Superior Court. I conclude, however, that Thomas O\u2019Connor Constructors, Inc. (O\u2019Connor), is liable under the ordinary and long-standing rule in this Commonwealth that an employer is li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>able for the discriminatory acts of its supervisory personnel. O\u2019Connor was thus liable independent of and prior to O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s failures of investigation and remediation. See <em>College-Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>400 Mass. 156 (1987) <em>(College-Town). </em>The question whether O\u2019Connor is vicariously liable for its supervisor\u2019s actions must be addressed in order to resolve this case: the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (commission) found for Jarvis Aldridge on the basis that O\u2019Connor was vicariously liable for the conduct of Paul Daley. The damages award under review includes compensation for emotional distress, some of which is described by the majority, that began well before the notice and failure to take corrective action on which the majority relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The claim by Aldridge against O\u2019Connor is what is known as an \u201cinterference\u201d claim \u2014 a claim that an individual or entity covered by statute has discriminatorily interfered with a complainant\u2019s hiring, continued employment, promotion, or compensation by, or with other terms, conditions or privileges of his or her employment with, a third-party employer. I agree with the majority that such a claim may be brought under G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4. Contrary to the majority, however, I believe that an interference claim is provided for in this case by the plain language of both G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(1), and G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(4A).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Section 4(1), as appearing in St. 1989, c. 516, \u00a7 4, prohibits a covered \u201cemployer\u201d from discriminating on the basis of race or color against \u201cany individual\u201d with respect to the \u201cterms, conditions or privileges of employment\u201d not just its own employees or potential employees. O\u2019Connor is a covered employer under c. 151B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Identical language in the Federal antidiscrimination statute, Title VB of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1) (2006), has been virtually uniformly construed over the past thirty-five years to provide for an interference claim, starting with Judge McGowan\u2019s decision for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1973 in <em>Sib</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><em>ley Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>488 F.2d 1338 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The <em>Sibley </em>court concluded that the words \u201cany individual\u201d should be given their ordinary meaning, and said that \u201c[t]o permit a covered employer to exploit circumstances peculiarly affording it the capability of discriminatorily interfering with an individual\u2019s employment opportunities with another employer, while it could not do so with respect to employment in its own service, would be to condone continued use of the very criteria for employment that Congress has prohibited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1341.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><em>Sibley </em>has been followed by all the Federal courts of appeals to consider the issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Federal courts, applying <em>Sibley </em>and the decisions following it, have entertained interference claims alleging not only discrimination with respect to hiring, but claims like the instant one alleging a hostile work environment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The reasoning of <em>Sibley, </em>while not binding on us, see <em>College-Town, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>400 Mass, at 163, is persuasive. Under that reasoning, \u00a7 4(1) provides for an interference claim against O\u2019Connor.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Further, as the majority holds, G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(4A), added to \u00a7 4 in 1989, see St. 1989, c. 722, \u00a7 14, independently and explicitly provides for an interference claim, not merely against employers, but against all \u201cperson[sj,\u201d defined by the statute to \u201cincluded one or more individuals, partnerships, associations, [and] corporations . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 1946, c. 368, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And, indeed, the commission has, for more than a decade, construed \u00a7 4(4A) to recognize an interference claim brought against one who is not the complainant\u2019s employer. See <em>Erewa </em>v. <em>Reis, 20 </em>M.D.L.R. 36, 38 (1998). In its capacity as a corporation, then, O\u2019Connor is independently subject to an interference liability claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">As for O\u2019Connor\u2019s liability for the actions of Daley, it is the long-established rule in our Commonwealth that an employer is responsible for the discriminatory acts of its supervisory personnel. See <em>College-Town, supra </em>at 156.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Daley was clearly in the category of supervisory personnel. He was O\u2019Connor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>chief spokesperson and authority at the project. Daley\u2019s job as a supervisor entailed control over and maintenance of the very work environment at issue in this case. Not only did his responsibilities for O\u2019Connor include oversight of all the work of all the subcontractors at the job site, he controlled the physical environment in which the work there, including Aldridge\u2019s, was undertaken, having control of the keys and locking and opening doors to various areas of the job site.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><em>College-Town </em>imposes vicarious liability upon employers under \u00a7 4(1) for the acts of supervisory personnel.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>1 also agree with the commission \u2014 to whose reasonable interpretation of the statute we owe deference<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 that the ordinary rule of vicarious liability articulated under <em>College-Town </em>applies under \u00a7 4(4A). The majority suggests that <em>College-Town </em>does not apply to \u00a7 4(4A) because the language of \u00a7 4(4A) is not precisely the same as that in \u00a7 4(1). Section 4(1) imposes liability for acts of \u201can employer, by himself or his agent,\u201d \u2014 e.g., a supervisor \u2014 whereas \u00a7 4(4A) imposes liability for acts of \u201cany person.\u201d In the present context this is a distinction without a difference. \u201cPerson\u201d is defined to include \u201ccorporations,\u201d which is the capacity in which O\u2019Connor is subject to liability under \u00a7 4(4A). The word \u201ccorporation\u201d does not need additional verbiage to clarify that a corporation may be liable for the acts of its agents. \u201cA corporation is a creature of the law, a \u2018separate and distinct legal entity . . . [that] can only act through its agents.\u2019 Its liability is \u2018necessarily vicarious.\u2019 That corporations may be vicariously liable for the acts of their agents is axiomatic.\u201d <em>Sarvis </em>v. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 86, 96 (1999) (citations omitted). Under <em>College-Town, </em>principles of respondeat superior were applied to impose liability because \u201cthe authority conferred upon a supervisor by the employer\u201d gave the supervisor the particular ability to create a discriminatorily hostile work environment. See <em>id. </em>at 166. Where a supervisor acting within the scope of his or her employment discriminatorily interferes with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>employment with a third party in violation of \u00a7 4(4A), that circumstance also exists.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And indeed, in <em>Sarvis </em>v. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 86, 94-97 (1999), we construed language from the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act essentially identical to that in \u00a7 4(4A), utilized by the Legislature in a similar remedial context, to impose ordinary principles of respondeat superior liability. Accord G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, as appearing in St. 2002, c. 223, \u00a7 2 (instructing that c. 151B \u201cshall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of its purposes\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>It is also clear that the conduct at issue was actionably discriminatory. If harassment or abuse in the workplace on the basis of race is sufficiently severe or pervasive it will create a hostile work environment. O\u2019Connor\u2019s supervisor deliberately created a profoundly offensive, racially hostile work environment. He repeatedly referred to African-Americans employed at the workplace for which he was responsible, including Aldridge, with the use of racial epithets, primarily the one that is widely regarded as the most hateful and offensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Because of its effects on the workplace and those, including Aldridge, who worked within it, such conduct cannot be characterized, as O\u2019Connor suggests, merely as \u201cfour isolated comments.\u201d Such racial discrimination is sufficiently severe and independently sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment. Such racial discrimination, with its attendant public and private humiliation and degradation, cf. <em>College-Town, </em>400 Mass, at 162, has consequences that may endure long after the offensive remarks are made. This conduct by O\u2019Connor\u2019s supervisor gave rise to liability under \u00a7 4 prior to its failures of investigation and remediation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The majority expresses concern that recognition of interference liability could render \u201can employer liable to a broad spectrum of third-party nonemployees,\u201d all the way down to \u201cdelivery persons . . . and canteen workers who conduct their business on the employer\u2019s work site.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Ante </em>at 559. While I am sensitive to this concern about the potential scope of liability, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>not well founded. As the small number of interference claims decided since their recognition by the Federal courts and by the commission makes clear, recognition of interference liability here will not lead to the \u201climitless\u201d liability hypothesized by the majority. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">An employer like O\u2019Connor can not be liable to anyone unless its discriminatory acts interfere with a complainant\u2019s employment, for example his or her hiring, promotion, or continued employment; his or her compensation; or the terms, conditions, or privileges of his or her employment. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(1). With respect to a hostile work environment claim like the one at issue here, the employer, whether directly or vicariously liable, would have to engage in harassment or abuse sufficiently severe or pervasive to pose a \u201cbarrier[] to full participation in [the individual\u2019s] workplace.\u201d <em>College-Town, </em>400 Mass, at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">There are substantial limits to such liability. On the one hand, it is unlikely that the actions of an employer toward, for example, a delivery person who comes on premises for a few minutes during his or her work day could rise to that level. On the other, the discriminatory creation by a company\u2019s supervisor of a hostile environment in which on-premises cafeteria workers employed by a third party are required to work only can occur where the supervisor has the ability to create such an environment \u2014 and this is precisely the type of conduct the Legislature in enacting G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, intended to root out. Compare <em>King </em>v. <em>Chrysler Corp., </em>812 F. Supp. 151, 153-154 (E.D. Mo. 1993). The reason an interference claim by Aldridge is available against O\u2019Connor here is precisely because Aldridge, unlike most employees of third-party employers, worked for a subcontractor of O\u2019Connor at a work site that was controlled by O\u2019Connor. Only that circumstance gave Daley the ability to render Aldridge\u2019s work environment racially hostile.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Although I conclude that O\u2019Connor\u2019s liability arose prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>and independent of its subsequent failures, I agree with the majority that the defendant here did not conduct a \u201cfair or thorough investigation of [the] allegation,\u201d <em>College-Town, </em>400 Mass, at 167, and that its remedial actions were insufficient to meet its legal obligations. The findings of the hearing commissioner amply demonstrate the inadequacy of O\u2019Connor\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Finally, because I conclude that O\u2019Connor was liable for the discriminatory actions of its work site supervisor, I agree with the majority that the damages award properly should be upheld in full. An emotional distress damage award must be supported by \u201csubstantial evidence and its factual basis must be made clear on the record.\u201d <em>Stonehill College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>441 Mass. 549, 576 (2004). As the majority describes, <em>ante </em>at 561, there was in the record substantial evidence supporting an award of emotional distress damages, and there was \u201csubstantial evidence of a causal connection between the complainant\u2019s emotional distress and the respondent\u2019s unlawful act.\u201d <em>DeRoche </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn.

See <em>College-Town, supra </em>at 165.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b591-6\">While the Superior Court judge did not address \u00a7 4(1), as the majority notes, \u201cwe may affirm the lower court\u2019s judgment on any ground supporting it,\u201d <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Canton Inst. for Sav., </em>56 Mass.

But in a case like this where a general contractor hires subcontractors to assist with its own project, taking place in a unitary work site, the general contractor\u2019s supervisor does exercise supervisory authority over the workplace environment of the employees of the subcontractor, and it is that authority that provides him or her with the ability to render that environment discriminatorily hostile. The majority also notes that harassment by O\u2019Connor\u2019s supervisor does not carry \u201cthe same implied threat of punishing resistance through exercise of supervisory powers as exists within the employment unit.\u201d <em>Ibid.., </em>citing <em>College-Town, </em>400 Mass, at 165-166. The <em>College-Town </em>court referred to that factor as part of its explanation for rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim that \u201cthe authority conferred on a supervisor is not related to the creation of a sexually harassing environment.\u201d <em>College-Town, </em>400 Mass, at 165. <em>College-Town </em>involved sexual harassment, including a request by the supervisor that he and the complainant \u201cget[] together.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158. The point of the decision, though, was that supervisors were liable for discriminatory acts within the scope of their authority when that authority provides them the ability to create a hostile work environment \u201cpresent[ingj a serious barrier\u201d to \u201cfull participation in the workforce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166. Finally, contrary to the suggestion by the majority, <em>College-Town </em>did not in imposing vicarious liability rely upon any \u201crestriction]\u201d rooted in \u201cchain of command considerations\u201d on a complainant\u2019s ability to notify of discrimination those above the supervisory level. <em>Ante </em>at 559.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The majority is also incorrect when it states that failure to impose vicarious liability would not create the anomaly \u2014 noted in <em>College-Town </em>\u2014 \u201cthat a notice requirement creates when the perpetrator is also the supervisor to whom notice would be given by an employee.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 558-559. If Aldridge had been discriminated against by a less senior O\u2019Connor employee at the work site, a complaint to Daley, its work site supervisor, would have sufficed to put O\u2019Connor on notice such that it would be liable if Daley \u201cfail[ed] to remedy or report\u201d it. <em>College-Town, </em>400 Mass, at 167. It would be anomalous if Daley\u2019s own discriminatory conduct did not similarly give rise to liability. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">In fact, failure to impose vicarious liability upon a general contractor like O\u2019Connor that operates a unitary work site would be anomalous for an additional reason because recognizing such liability would impose no additional legal requirements upon the general contractor. Under <em>College-Town, </em>O\u2019Connor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>already could have been vicariously liable for Daley\u2019s acts in creating a hostile work environment at its work site. If James Lucas, an African-American employed by O\u2019Connor at the work site, for example, had brought this same action on the basis of Daley\u2019s conduct, O\u2019Connor would have been subject to suit regardless whether O\u2019Connor itself had notice or failed to take adequate remedial steps, see <em>College-Town, </em>400 Mass, at 165-166. Cf. <em>ante </em>at 558-559. O\u2019Connor, therefore, already must take precisely the same care in the hiring and the oversight of its supervisors that it would have to take were it held vicariously liable for its supervisors\u2019 conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\">It was Daley\u2019s conduct, not any subsequent actions or inactions by O\u2019Connor, that created the hostile environment at the work site. I do not read the majority\u2019s reference to \u201cthe general contractor, upon learning, failing] to take appropriate remedial action\u201d to mean otherwise. Compare <em>ante </em>at 561.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b593-9\">While framed as an objection to vicarious liability, this really amounts to a reservation about the interference claim that the majority recognizes today, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>one of several such reservations contained in the majority\u2019s opinion. <em>Ante </em>at 556 n.10, 557-559.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b594-8\">The majority\u2019s suggestion that it would be easier for a subcontractor\u2019s employee to report discrimination to \u201cthe corporate hierarchy of the perpetrator\u2019s employer\u201d when the perpetrator works for the general contractor, <em>ante </em>at 559, takes inadequate account of the nature of the workplace. While that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>employee might know the relevant corporate actors of his or her own employer, there is no reason to think he or she will know anything about the corporate structure of the general contractor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b595-7\">After O\u2019Connor\u2019s project manager told Aldridge that he would \u201cget to the bottom of it,\u201d no one from O\u2019Connor ever spoke with Aldridge again regarding his complaint, either to take his statement, to tell him what steps the investigation would entail, to inform him of its progress, or to explain its conclusion. See <em>College-Town, </em>400 Mass, at 167-168. The hearing officer found that, instead of fulfilling its legal obligation, O\u2019Connor \u201cbegan taking a defensive posture in anticipation of litigation.\u201d When asked, Lucas apparently reported to O\u2019Connor that he had only heard of the racial slurs second-hand through Rustic Fire Protection\u2019s Ron Russell and Aldridge. O\u2019Connor prepared a statement for Lucas to sign that read, \u201cI have never been harassed nor suffered discrimination from any O\u2019Connor Constructor Supervisory or other personnel during my employment with O\u2019Connor Constructors up to and including this date.\u201d Lucas refused to sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">An internal document makes clear that O\u2019Connor terminated the investigation after a deliberate decision not to complete it, choosing instead to wait until a claim, if any, was filed against it. Indeed, the investigation did not even reach a conclusion about what had happened. Instead, Daley simply was returned to the work site.

There was no evidence that Aldridge attended counselling, or took medication in an attempt to mitigate his harm, but that alone does not render the award unreasonable.
