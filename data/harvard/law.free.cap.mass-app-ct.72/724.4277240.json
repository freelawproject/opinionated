The board summarily affirmed a decision of an administrative judge, who found Eady to be partially disabled and awarded him weekly benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 30, and 35. Pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(/)-(g),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Eady argues that the administrative judge\u2019s assignment of a $975 weekly earning capacity was unwarranted by the facts, arbitrary or capricious, and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-13\"><em>Background. </em>At the time of the administrative hearing, Eady was forty-nine years old. He is a high school graduate and has been employed as union ironworker his entire adult life. Before his injury, he had been working at Keystone Engineering Cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>poration (Keystone) as an ironworker welder. His position required him to work in awkward positions on beams, ladders, and scaffolding, stand for prolonged periods, bend repetitively, and stoop and lift up to one hundred pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">While working at Keystone, Eady injured his back. The insurer voluntarily began payment of temporary total disability benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, but then filed an application to discontinue or modify those benefits. After conciliation and conference, an administrative judge ordered discontinuation of the \u00a7 34 benefits, and ordered the insurer to pay partial disability benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, based upon an earning capacity of $975 per week. Both parties appealed, and a de novo hearing was held before the same administrative judge. Eady was the only witness to testify. The administrative judge also considered the deposition of Dr. Nabil Basta (the impartial examiner) and Eady\u2019s medical records, including medical reports by Dr. John Doherty and Dr. James Sami.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The administrative judge found Eady to be partially disabled. He adopted the medical opinions of Doherty and Sami, both of whom opined that Eady was disabled from returning to work as an ironworker, and would be unable to perform work that required him to repeatedly bend, twist, or lift more than fifteen or twenty pounds on a regular basis. However, the administrative judge refused to credit Eady\u2019s testimony as to the extent of his back pain and inability to perform any work, finding that Eady had general knowledge of construction, was able to operate a motor vehicle, and was able to perform tasks with his hands. The administrative judge then concluded, \u201c[Considering the employee\u2019s age, education, transferable skills, work experience, his physical restrictions and the totality of the medical evidence, ... the employee is capable of light duty employment. I find that Mr. Eady is partially disabled and has an earning capacity of $975.\u201d The board summarily affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>Eady argues that the administrative judge\u2019s assignment of an earning capacity of $975 per week was unwarranted by the facts, arbitrary or capricious, and an abuse of discretion. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(/)-(g).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>summarily affirmed, we review the findings and conclusions of the administrative judge. See <em>Dalbec\u2019s Case, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 306, 313 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Where, as here, neither party submitted any vocational evidence, the administrative judge could rely upon his \u201cown judgment and knowledge\u201d in calculating earning capacity. See, e.g., <em>Mulcahey\u2019s Case, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 3 (1988). However, as we recently made clear with <em>Dalbec\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 317, \u201c[a] monetary figure cannot emerge from thin air and survive judicial review as a mystery.\u201d The decision maker must therefore support the earning capacity he assigns by explaining its \u201csource and application,\u201d including a \u201cfactual source\u201d for the monetary figure. See <em>id. </em>at 316, 317. A decision that does not contain such a factual source, along with a reasoned explanation, is \u201carbitrary within the meaning of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(g).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(8) (requiring statement of reasons including determination of facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The need for a reasoned explanation that refers to a factual source is clear from the Administrative Procedure Act (Act), G. L. c. 30A, which requires that \u201c[ejvery agency decision shall be . . . accompanied by a statement of reasons for the decision, including determination of each issue of fact or law necessary to the decision,\u201d in the absence of a statutory exception. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(8), inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1. The Act also requires that administrative decisions not be \u201c[arbitrary or capricious.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(g), as amended by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3. Further, as the Supreme Judicial Court has long held, subsidiary findings must be sufficiently specific and detailed as to \u201cadequately] reveal the basis for the [decision maker\u2019s] ultimate finding.\u201d <em>McElroy\u2019s Case, </em>397 Mass. 743, 746 (1986). The reason for the assignment of earning capacity must be clear from the factual findings and the decision maker\u2019s explanation. See <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 258 (1994) (reviewing court is to determine \u201cwhether the decision is factually warranted and not \u2018[arbitrary or capricious,\u2019 in the sense of having adequate evidentiary and factual support and disclosing reasoned decision making within the particular requirements governing a workers\u2019 compensation dispute\u201d). The factual source requirement \u201creflects the fundamental requirement of rationality for every administrative decision.\u201d <em>Dalbec\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 313 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>From the case law, we discern three elements, or subsidiary findings, that support an assignment of earning capacity: (1) the employee\u2019s medical limitations, see <em>Trant\u2019s Case, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 983, 984-985 (1986), (2) the employee\u2019s employment capabilities, including age, education, work experience, and transferable skills, see <em>Ballard\u2019s Case, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1068, 1068-1069 (1982), and (3) the market for the employee\u2019s skills. See <em>Dalbec\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 316-317, 318 n.14. See also <em>Sylva\u2019s Case, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 679, 681 (1999) (referring to the third element as the \u201ceconomic element\u201d). We note that the third element does not necessarily require the decision maker to identify \u201cparticular jobs which were within [the employee\u2019s] limited ability to perform and which were in fact available.\u201d <em>Mulcahey\u2019s Case, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The administrative judge\u2019s decision refers to Eady\u2019s medical limitations and personal capabilities, but is wholly silent with respect to the third element, namely what Eady might reasonably command as a salary in the marketplace. Consequently the determination of earning capacity in this case appears to present even more of a \u201cmystery\u201d than that in <em>Dalbec\u2019s Case. </em>There, the administrative judge determined that the employee could still drive a tractor trailer after his injury, and opined without further basis that such driving-only positions paid $900 per week. <em>Dalbec\u2019s Case, 69 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 316. However, because neither the <em>Dalbec </em>decision nor the administrative record contained any \u201cfactual source or reasoned explanation for the $900 figure,\u201d we remanded for a \u201creasoned computation\u201d of earning capacity. <em>Id. </em>at 316, 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Here, the administrative judge found that Eady was capable of \u201clight duty employment\u201d and, without explanation, simply \u25a0 assigned an earning capacity of $975 per week. As in <em>Dalbec\u2019s Case, </em>the administrative judge referred to no factual source for the $975 figure, nor does the administrative record contain any such source. Although the decision maker has substantial discretion to exercise his own judgment and knowledge in determining earning capacity, we cannot approve of a decision that, as in <em>Dalbec\u2019s Case, </em>contains \u201cno explanation whatsoever\u201d for the earning capacity figure. See <em>id. </em>at 317. Because the finding of a $975 weekly earning capacity is not grounded in specific sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>sidiary findings sufficient to enable us to discern any basis, it is purely arbitrary. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(g); <em>Dalbec\u2019s Case, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. at 316. See also <em>McElroy\u2019s Case, supra. </em>Keystone characterizes as sufficient the findings on Eady\u2019s medical limitations and employment capabilities; as stated above such findings are necessary, but they are insufficient unless accompanied by a factual source for the monetary figure determined to be available in the job market for an individual with those characteristics. See <em>Dalbec\u2019s Case, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. at 316. Finally, the administrative judge\u2019s reference to \u201clight duty employment\u201d without any explanation of what such a position would entail makes his assignment of a $975 per week earning capacity even more difficult to parse.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">For these reasons, we vacate the amount of the partial disability award and remand for a reasoned computation of that amount consistent with this opinion, including a reference to the factual source(s) for the monetary figure. On remand, the \u201cinformation already present in the case file, or reliable publications of labor statistics, or additional evidence\u201d may be consulted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 318 n.14. In all other respects, the decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-14\">Eady also mistakenly relies upon G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(e), as amended by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3, which allows reversal of administrative decisions that are \u201c[u]nsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d Section 14(7)(e) does not apply to appeals from decisions of the board. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b751-9\">There is no appeal from the administrative judge\u2019s determination of partial disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\">In <em>Dalbec\u2019s Case, </em>69 Mass.
