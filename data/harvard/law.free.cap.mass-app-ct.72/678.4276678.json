During that month, the defendant delivered two checks totaling $8,000 to the landlord, ostensibly toward the arrearage. The checks were drawn on a closed account with a bank that no longer existed, facts the landlord discovered before attempting to negotiate the checks. The defendant was tried and convicted on a charge of larceny by check. See G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 37. On appeal, the defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>tion as matter of law, arguing that a conviction on that charge may not rest on checks tendered in satisfaction of an antecedent debt. We agree and reduce the defendant\u2019s conviction to the lesser included charge of attempted larceny by check.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\"><em>Background. </em>The defendant\u2019s company, Goren Printing, had occupied space in the Norwood Commerce Center for more than twenty years, initially under a lease but eventually as a tenant at will. At the times relevant to this case, the monthly rent was $2,450, so that the arrearage as of December, 2004, represented well more than one year\u2019s unpaid rent. Before falling into arrears, the defendant typically had paid rent by means of either third-party checks or money orders. The departure from that past practice (by delivering two checks drawn on the company\u2019s account), combined with the relatively large size of the checks, led the landlord to ascertain whether they were good before attempting to negotiate them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The landlord attempted to call Cambridge-port Savings Bank, but could not find a listing for that institution. Eventually, the landlord determined that Cambridgeport Savings Bank had no telephone listing because it had been acquired, in August of 2003, by Citizens Bank. Calls to Citizens Bank did not improve the situation; the landlord eventually learned not only that the defendant had no account with Citizens Bank, but also that the account on which the checks were drawn had been closed prior to Citizens Bank\u2019s acquisition of Cambridgeport Savings Bank. The landlord attempted to contact the defendant, but was unable to do so until late January of 2005, at which time the defendant and landlord met. The defendant furnished no satisfactory response when asked to explain why he had delivered checks drawn on a closed account, and the meeting ended without resolution. Sometime in February of 2005, the landlord learned that Goren Printing had vacated the premises. Further discussions between the defendant and the landlord were unproductive, and the landlord eventually reported to police the defendant\u2019s delivery of the two bad checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>Like most States, Massachusetts law imposes criminal consequences on the intentional delivery of checks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>drawn against insufficient funds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The provisions of the Massachusetts bad check statute, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 37, are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As provided in the statute, the delivery of a check drawn against insufficient funds generally will be sufficient by itself to support a conviction on a charge of attempted larceny (the insufficiency of funds standing as prima facie evidence of intent to defraud, unless the maker pays the payee in full by other means within two days). The crime increases from attempted larceny to larceny if the maker obtains money, property, or services by means of the check. It is the latter element that the defendant challenges in the present case: the defendant observes that, because he tendered the checks in ostensible payment on an antecedent debt, he obtained no money or property or services in exchange for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">No Massachusetts case has considered whether a check tendered in payment on an antecedent debt can support conviction on a charge of larceny by check.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, we agree with the defendant that he obtained nothing in fact in exchange for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>checks he tendered. His occupancy of the premises without payment of rent, though ongoing, had continued for more than one year prior to tender of the checks, and did not depend on their tender in any respect. Moreover, the defendant did not obtain, even temporarily, any reduction in the amount of the arrearage he owed for back rent. The tender of the bad checks did not induce the landlord to part with any property or other item of value, and did not confer any benefit upon the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The Commonwealth counters the defendant\u2019s argument in two ways. First, the Commonwealth observes that the defendant\u2019s company remained in possession of the premises for approximately two months after the defendant tendered the checks. However, the facts cannot support any inference that the landlord granted any forbearance to the defendant by reason of the defendant\u2019s tender of the checks; indeed, the landlord was suspicious of the checks upon receipt of them, quickly ascertained that they were no good, and never attempted to negotiate them. Moreover, the landlord continued in its attempts to negotiate with the defendant a recovery of the rent arrearage for approximately two years, without initiating legal proceedings, belying any suggestion that any forebearance (or continued occupancy by the tenant) flowed from the tender of obviously invalid checks.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The Commonwealth also contends that the statute does not require a contemporaneous or prospective exchange of money, property, or services to support a conviction of larceny by check. That contention is at odds with the plain language of the statute. The statute clearly and expressly treats the mere delivery of a fraudulent instrument as attempted larceny, and reserves the charge of larceny to those instances in which \u201cmoney or property or services are obtained thereby\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Our conclusion is in accord with the vast majority of States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>that have considered the question. See the summary of statutes and cases in the Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Because the defendant challenges only the element requiring that \u201cmoney or property or services are obtained thereby,\u201d the evidence was sufficient to support the lesser included offense of attempted larceny by check, and we remand the matter to the trial court for resentencing on the lesser charge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>447 Mass. 161, 168-169 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Finally, because the landlord incurred no loss as a result of the bad checks, the order of restitution must be vacated. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>436 Mass. 829, 834 (2002) (order of restitution must be limited to loss or damage causally connected to the offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The judgment of conviction on the charge of larceny by check and the order for restitution are vacated. The case is remanded to the District Court for entry of a judgment on the charge of attempted larceny by check, and for sentencing on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">Most States\u2019 statutes require (like Massachusetts) that property or something of value be obtained in exchange for a fraudulent check, and cases decided under substantially all such statutes have concluded that the statute does not apply to a check tendered in payment of an antecedent debt.

However, the seller did not mail the title to the truck to the purchaser until after he had received the fraudulent check. See <em>id. </em>at 450. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>114 N.M. 721, 723 (Ct. App. 1992), the Court of Appeals of New Mexico (interpreting N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30-36-4 [2008]) concluded that the statute is satisfied when the fraudulent check is tendered as part of a contemporaneous transaction, even though the property is delivered before payment is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In States where the statute does not require that property be obtained by means of the bad check, courts have typically interpreted the statute to apply to checks tendered to pay an antecedent debt.
