We go a little further afield.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">By a development which need not be traced in detail here, the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2, taken in connection with G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, the wrongful death statute, provides a remedy, up to a limit of $100,000, for death (apparently not including attendant conscious pain and suffering) caused by negligent maintenance of public roads (see text to note 7, <em>infra). </em>The course of statutory interpretation to this conclusion may be followed in the cases: <em>Gallant </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>383 Mass. 707, 712-715 (1981); <em>Kromhout </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>398 Mass. 687, 689-692 (1986). Section 10(b) of G.L. c. 258, as appearing in St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 15, excepts from this sweep of potential liability \u201cany claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a public employer or public em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>ployee, acting within the scope of his office or employment, whether or not the discretion involved is abused.\u201d The difficult concept of \u201cdiscretionary function or duty\u201d was described in <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>373 Mass. 208, 216-220 (1977), decided before the passage of the legislation: discretionary acts were said to be those which involved \u201cweighing alternatives and making choices with respect to public policy and planning.\u201d At 218. More recent attempts at definition appear in <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>392 Mass. 745, 752-754 (1984); <em>Patrazza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>398 Mass. 464, 467-470 (1986); <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional School Dist., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 211, 213-217 (1983). See also Cervone &amp; Hardy, The Massachusetts Governmental Tort Liability Act and Its Discretionary Function Immunity: An Analysis and a Modest Proposal, 14 Suffolk U.L. Rev. 1251, 1252-1258 (1980). Whatever the exact boundaries of the \u201cdiscretionary\u201d concept, we agree with the judge that a municipality carries out a discretionary function where, as in the present case, it approves the location of utility poles according to the procedures prescribed by G. L. c. 166, \u00a7 22, as amended by St. 1948, c. 550, \u00a7 36.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The same, we think, holds for the design of public roads, which would readily be recognized as belonging in the \u201cpublic policy and planning\u201d category. Decisions supporting this view are <em>Patrazza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>398 Mass. at 469-470; <em>Drivas </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 750, 756-757 (1987). And see G.L.c. 82, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The day to day care and maintenance of a public road seems at the opposite end from policy and planning: the <em>Whitney </em>case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>speaks of the \u201ccarrying out of previously established policies or plans,\u201d 373 Mass. at 218, and municipal negligence in such a respect is not sheltered as a discretionary function. See <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>392 Mass. at 753; <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Belmont, </em>396 Mass. 271, 276-277 (1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This, we think, is where the alleged failure to prune the overhanging branch properly fits. See <em>Doherty </em>at 276. Accordingly, the summary judgment should have been refused, further proceedings being confined to the particular element of claimed negligence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The town tries to avert the result by invoking a rule that has been applied under the statutes, still in force, which allow recovery, up to $4,000/$5,000, for negligent maintenance of public roads resulting in injuries (including conscious pain and suffering related to death). G. L. c. 81, \u00a7 18; c. 84, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By this rule a municipality is held responsible only if its negligence is the sole cause of the injuries. See <em>Scholl </em>v. <em>New England Power Service Co., </em>340 Mass. 267, 271 (1960); <em>Tomasello </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>398 Mass. 284, 286 (1986). We think, however, that such an idea should not be imported into the Tort Claims Act, which invokes the principles of private tort law; thus G.L. c. 258, \u00a7 2, as amended by St. 1984, c. 279, \u00a7 1, describes a liability of public employers \u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances\u201d (with stated exceptions). Anyway, the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>as far as developed on summary judgment do not establish that the casualty resulted from aught but the alleged municipal negligence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Again, the town argues that there was no duty of care owed to this plaintiff because as he rode to his death he was merely a member of the general public in no special relationship to the town. See <em>Dinsky </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>386 Mass. 801, 810 (1982); <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>405 Mass. 29, 31 (1989). We hold, to the contrary, that such a relationship subsisted between travelers using the Rock Harbor way and the town of Orleans. Cf. <em>Gallant </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>383 Mass. at 715; <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>392 Mass. at <em>757-758; Kromhout v. Commonwealth, </em>398 Mass. at 692; G. L. c. 84, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 15. And see Glannon, The Scope of Public Liability Under the Tort Claims Act: Beyond the Public Duty Rule, 67 Mass.L.Rev. 159, 159-161, 167 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-7\"> The parties agreed that summary judgment for the defendant was appropriate on the counts of the complaint based on other alleged theories of liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-8\"> These were the facts as told in an affidavit by James Brewer, plaintiff\u2019s friend, the only witness of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b437-9\"> The specifications of negligence appear from the plaintiff\u2019s memoranda submitted in opposition to summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b438-6\"> The statute sets out the procedures by which a company secures approval to locate utility lines. These include public hearing on notice to abutters, followed by action by the board of aldermen or selectmen granting or denying permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The plaintiff now suggests that, while locating the poles may be \u201cdiscretionary,\u201d a decision about the materials of which the poles shall consist is not, and here, plaintiff says, there was negligence in the selection of materials which did not yield sufficiently to impact. The point was not adequately raised below or on the present record appendix, and in any event it would likely be held that the statute, c. 166, \u00a7 22, covers materials as well as location, and the choice is \u201cdiscretionary.\u201d Indeed the statute says, \u201cin respect to overhead lines [the board of aldermen or selectmen] may also specify the kind of poles . . . which may be used ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b439-6\"> \u201c[I]f there is a readily ascertainable standard by which the action of the government servant may be measured, whether that standard is written or the product of experience, it is not within the discretionary function exception .... It requires no manual, for example, to instruct an installer of street lights in Boston that the wind may blow mightily and that lightposts had better be anchored accordingly.\u201d <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 215. A doctor in treating a patient was not engaged in a discretionary function when \u201cgoverned by the standard of accepted medical practice, an ascertainable guide to proper conduct.\u201d <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>395 Mass. 659, 665 n.6 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b439-7\"> We do not enter upon the elements of proof that will be required to establish the town\u2019s negligence in failing to see to the tree branch.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b439-8\"> These statutes in effect carve out exceptions to the Tort Claims Act. See the discussion in <em>Gallant v. Worcester, </em>383 Mass. at 710-712; <em>Kromhout </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>398 Mass. at 691.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b440-7\"> The plaintiff attempted to use the cited statutes \u2014 G.L. c. 81, \u00a7 18, and c. 84, \u00a7 15 \u2014 which have no exception for \u201cdiscretionary\u201d functions, to support a further contention that the Tort Claims Act should be interpreted in similar fashion in respect to death claims for road injuries. The text of the Act refutes the contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
