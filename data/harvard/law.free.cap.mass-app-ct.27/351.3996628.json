Umina in Marlboro. Since January, 1985, the children\u2019s home had been with their mother in Colorado. For reasons to which we shall return, the father on July 28, 1986, petitioned in Probate Court for modification of a Massachusetts divorce judgment entered May 15, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">A judge of the Probate Court determined that, under G. L. c. 209B, the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, as inserted by St. 1983, c. 680, \u00a7 1, jurisdiction over custody of the children lay in Colorado. The correctness of the judge\u2019s application of c. 209B and whether, in any event, he should have conducted an evidentiary hearing before ordering the children to be brought before a Colorado judge are the principal questions on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">During their eight years of marriage, Leonard Umina and Kathryn Malbica had three children, all bom in Massachusetts. Divorce proceedings commenced in August, 1984. A separation agreement, later incorporated in a divorce judgment, provided that Kathryn would\"be the custodial parent. She lawfully removed to Colorado at the end of 1984 or the very beginning of 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">Fifteen months later, on March 21, 1986, the mother sent the oldest child, Amy (then almost nine years old) to stay with her father. Amy and her mother had been getting along badly. The following June, Laura (age six) and Suzanne (age three) came to Massachusetts to visit. The three girls settled cheerfully into their father\u2019s household. He had remarried.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Accounts of abuse and neglect by their mother, Kathryn, began to emerge. Umina took the children to a psychologist who concluded that the likelihood of serious abuse by the mother was such as to require a report to the Department of Social Services. The department substantiated the allegations of abuse and neglect on July 25, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">On the strength of this professional reinforcement of what his children (one supposes mostly the older two) had reported, Umina sought a modification of the divorce judgment which would give him custody of the three girls. A Probate Court judge granted the father temporary custody, pending further hearings. Further proceedings came before a second Probate Court judge who, after studying memoranda of counsel, decided that, under the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, questions of custody of the children were within the jurisdiction of Colorado, not Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">As authorized in the statute (G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 7[c] and [f]), the Massachusetts judge communicated with his Colorado counterpart to notify her that he was ordering the parties and the children to appear before her and to recommend that custody be awarded to the father. See <em>Redding </em>v. <em>Redding, </em>398 Mass. 102, 104-105 &amp; n.3 (1986). To that course the father was extremely resistant. His view was that taking the children to Colorado, even in his care, would be grievously upsetting to them. October 26, 1987, the day which the Probate Court judge had established (apparently with cooperation of the Colorado judge) for the hearing in Colorado, came and went.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">On December 1, 1987, the mother filed in Probate Court an ex parte petition for habeas corpus to compel the children\u2019s appearance before the Colorado court. There were overtones that Umina had declared his refusal to allow the children to be taken to Colorado and that he might hide them. The Probate Court judge issued the writ with instructions that a probation officer, escorted by a deputy sheriff, take the three girls in custody and bring them before the Colorado court.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Proceedings before the District Court for Jefferson County in Colorado wound up with an award of custody of the children to the father, with whom they now reside in Marlboro, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>1. <em>Mootness. </em>The appeal is from the orders of the second Probate Court judge declining jurisdiction and issuing the writ which produced the children in Colorado, issues in which Umina no longer has any personal stake, beyond intellectual and emotional ones. The questions he raises are, therefore, moot. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Parole Bd., </em>369 Mass. 701, 703 (1976). <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Optometry, </em>403 Mass. 621, 627 (1988). Yet the underlying questions of how these difficult and emotionally charged cases should proceed fall under the rubric \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review,\u201d <em>Southern Pac. Terminal Co. </em>v. <em>Interstate Commerce Commn., </em>219 U.S. 498, 515 (1911), as the underlying child custody issue will, as here, have been resolved before the appeal is resolved. <em>See Adoption of Emily, 25 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 579, 580 n. 1 (1988). The questions presented affect the public interest beyond the parties. <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943). <em>Brach </em>v. <em>Chief Justice of the Dist. Court Dept., </em>386 Mass. 528, 532-533 (1982). <em>County of Suffolk </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 127, 131 (1983). Constitutional issues are not involved, compare <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. 780, 782-784 (1984), and explication of the statute may be of some use.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Superintendent of Worcester State Hosp. </em>v. <em>Hagberg, </em>374 Mass. 271, 274 (1978); <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, </em>388 Mass. 607, 608-609 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">2. <em>Jurisdiction over custody arrangements. </em>When construing G. L. c. 209B, the Massachusetts Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (hereafter referred to as the \u201cMCCJA\u201d and sometimes \u201cthe Massachusetts act\u201d), it bears keeping in mind that the MCCJA is far from a carbon copy of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (hereafter referred to as the \u201cUCCJA\u201d and sometimes the \u201cuniform act\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 9(Pt. 1) U.L.A. 123 (Master ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>1988). See <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 3), </em>392 Mass. 728, 731 n.3 (1984) (\u201csimilar but not identical\u201d); <em>Tazziz </em>v. <em>Tazziz, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 809, 814 (1988) (\u201cThe chapter [209B] appears to be based in some degree upon the [UCCJA] but varies from that draft statute in material respects\u201d). At least one commentator has written that Massachusetts \u201cmay not, strictly speaking, be considered a UCCJA state.\u201d Blakesley, Child Custody \u2014 Jurisdiction and Procedure, 35 Emory L.J. 291, 296 n.26 &amp; 358 n.371 (1986). Cases from other States based on the UCCJA may, therefore, often be of marginal utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Under the Massachusetts act, determination of jurisdiction requires a two-step analysis: first, whether \u00a7 2 of the MCCJA confers jurisdiction upon the Massachusetts court at all; and, second, whether, after weighing the criteria in \u00a7 7 of the MCCJA (the inconvenient forum provision), the court <em>should </em>exercise jurisdiction. In that respect the MCCJA resembles the method prescribed by \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 7 of the UCCJA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">If there is a basis for jurisdiction, \u00a7 7 of both the UCCJA and the MCCJA sets out a series of criteria to be considered when the court makes its discretionary decision whether to accept jurisdiction. <em>Tazziz </em>v. <em>Tazziz, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 814. <em>McCarron </em>v. <em>District Court, </em>671 P.2d 953, 956 (Colo. <em>1983). </em>Brown <em>v. Brown, 195 Conn. 98, 109-110 (1985). Larsen </em>v. <em>Larsen, </em>5 Kan. App. 2d 284, 292 (1980). <em>Breneman </em>v. <em>Breneman, </em>92 Mich. App. 336, 342 (1979). <em>Wenz </em>v. <em>Schwartze, </em>183 Mont. 166, 180 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1071 (1980). <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>387 N.W.2d 234, 236 (N.D. 1986). <em>Oehler </em>v. <em>Clinton, </em>282 S.C. 25, 28 (1984). Failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>recognize such discretion constitutes an error of law. <em>Tazziz </em>v. <em>Tazziz, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 814 &amp; n.5. Cf. <em>In re Marriage of Hopson, </em>110 Cal. App. 3d 884, 901 (1980). The court should, and in some instances must, explain its exercise of discretion in written findings. <em>Tazziz </em>v. <em>Tazziz, 26 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 813. See also <em>Szmyd </em>v. <em>Szmyd, </em>641 P.2d 14, 19 (Alaska 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">In drawing the circle of jurisdiction, the MCCJA is more confined than the UCCJA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 3(a) of the UCCJA, a court is competent to decide a child custody determination if: \u201cit is in the best interest of the child . . . because (i) the child and his parents, or the child and at least one contestant, have a significant connection with [the State in which jurisdiction is sought].\u201d 9(Pt. 1) U.L.A. 143. The MCCJA does not authorize application of a \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d test unless \u201cit appears that no other state would have jurisdiction under paragraph (1) [of the MCCJA].\u201d G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2(a)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In providing that an emergency may be the basis for jurisdiction, the MCCJA is again more limited than the uniform act. Section 3(a)(3) of the UCCJA provides that a court has jurisdiction if a child \u201cis physically present in this State and . . . (ii) it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because he has been subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse or is otherwise neglected [or dependent].\u201d 9(Pt. 1) U.L.A. 144. Similar language appears in the MCCJA, but it is qualified by a proviso that, if jurisdiction might lie in another State, the Massachusetts court may invoke \u201cemergency\u201d jurisdiction only to the extent of \u201centering such temporary order or orders as it deems necessary unless the court of the other state has declined to exercise jurisdiction, has stayed its proceedings or has otherwise deferred to the jurisdiction of a court of the common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>wealth.\u201d G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2(a)(3). The reader will observe that the Massachusetts act is more deferential than the uniform act to the \u201chome state,\u201d of which we shall speak presently.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">a. <em>\u201cHome state\u201d jurisdiction. </em>The first basis for jurisdiction under \u00a7 2 of the MCCJA is as the \u201chome state\u201d of the children \u201con the commencement of the custody proceeding.\u201d G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 2(a)(1). Section 1 of the MCCJA defines the \u201chome state\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\u201c[T]he state in which the child immediately preceding the date of commencement of the custody proceeding resided with his parents, a parent, or a person acting as a parent, for at least 6 consecutive months, and in the case of a child less than 6 months old the state in which the child lived from birth with any of the persons mentioned. Periods of temporary absence of any of the named persons are counted as part of the 6-month or other period;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Here, the parties\u2019 three children had resided with their mother in Colorado for fifteen consecutive months. They had been with their father before the complaint for modification was filed in Massachusetts for approximately three months (in the case of the oldest daughter) and one month (in the case of the younger daughters). Massachusetts, therefore, was not the \u201chome state\u201d on the date of the filing of the complaint for modification. An alternate basis for \u201chome state\u201d jurisdiction presupposes the absence of the children from the Commonwealth and is not here pertinent. See \u00a7 2(a)(1)(ii) of the MCCJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Massachusetts in this case lacked \u201chome state\u201d jurisdiction unless one were to view the proceeding as having commenced with the original divorce action, of which the complaint for modification was but a continuation. Neither the statutory language, reason, nor cases decided under the UCCJA<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> support the single continuous proceeding approach. The statute speaks of \u201cjurisdiction to make a custody determination by initial <em>or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>modification judgment\u201d (emphasis supplied). Use of the disjunctive signals a legislative intention to treat modification proceedings as distinct from initial ones. Reason favors treating modification proceedings as separate and fresh ones because, if it were otherwise, jurisdiction would lodge perpetually with the State where the initial custody order had been made, potentially long after that State had any relevant contact with the child. Jurisdictions with occasion to consider the question have regarded \u201cthe date of the commencement of the proceeding\u201d in modification cases as the time when the request for modification was filed. <em>Barden </em>v. <em>Blau, </em>712 P.2d 481, 484-485 (Colo. 1986). <em>In re Custody of Dunn, </em>701 P.2d 158, 160-161 (Colo. Ct. App. 1985). See also <em>Kioukis </em>v. <em>Kioukis, </em>185 Conn. 249, 257 (1981); State <em>ex rel. Cooper v. Hamilton, </em>688 S.W.2d 821, 823-824 (Tenn. 1985); <em>In re Thorenson, </em>46 Wash. App. 493, 500 n.6 (1987). Cf. <em>Bak </em>v. <em>Bak, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 614-615 n.7 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Indeed, it is not unusual for a court which exercised original jurisdiction to lose \u201chome state\u201d jurisdiction. See, <em>e.g., Barden </em>v. <em>Blau, </em>712 P.2d at 484-486; <em>In re Custody of Dunn, </em>701 P.2d at 160-161; <em>Kioukis </em>v. <em>Kioukis, </em>185 Conn. at 256-257; <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Wagner, </em>482 So.2d 780, 781-782 (La. Ct. App. 1986); <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>369 N.W.2d 581, 583 (Minn. Ct. App. 1985); <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>653 S.W.2d 732, 735-736 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1983). Massachusetts, unlike States more faithful to the UCCJA, does not explicitly reserve jurisdiction under a continuing jurisdiction or a \u201cbest interest\u201d provision. Compare <em>Enslein </em>v. <em>Enslein, </em>112 A.D.2d 973 (N.Y. 1985); <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>Downs, </em>107 Misc.2d 852 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1981); <em>State ex rel. Cooper </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>688 S.W.2d 821 (Tenn. 1985). Cf. G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 <em>3(h), </em>inserted by St. 1987, c. 100, which appears to be directed to child support orders and their modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">b. <em>Emergency jurisdiction. </em>Unable to found jurisdiction on a \u201chome state\u201d basis, a default basis,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or necessity basis,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>the judge was remitted to considering the \u201cemergency\u201d jurisdiction provided for in \u00a7 2(a)(3) of the MCCJA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There was evidence before the Massachusetts judge from which he could have found that the children were at risk of abuse with their mother in Colorado. Demonstrably, the judge was impressed by that evidence because he communicated his concern to the Colorado judge, recommended to her that the father be given custody, and entered a temporary order granting custody of the girls to the father. As we have previously remarked, under the Massachusetts act, a temporary order was all that the judge had authority to make, unless the Colorado judge expressly declined jurisdiction in favor of Massachusetts. Whether declination of jurisdiction was ever broached to or by the Colorado judge does not appear from the record.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>The Probate Court judge was right in concluding that he was without jurisdiction under \u00a7 2 of the MCCJA to hear the custody matter generally.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He properly limited the proceedings to measures designed to effectuate Colorado\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction, yet to keep the children in their father\u2019s care until the Colorado court might order otherwise. Unlike <em>Tazziz </em>v. <em>Tazziz, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 809, the judge had no discretion to exercise under \u00a7 7 of the MCCJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">3. <em>Hearing incident to removal of children to Colorado. </em>By St. 1987, c. 52, there was added to G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 11, the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">\u201c[N]o child shall be ordered or compelled to appear or attend such proceeding in another state when, after a hearing a judge makes a finding that there is probable cause to believe that such child may be placed in jeopardy or exposed to risk of mental or physical harm by such return to said other state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Counsel for the father pressed \u2014 with ready witnesses and an attempted offer of proof \u2014 for an evidentiary hearing on whether the children were likely to suffer one or more of the harms enumerated in G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 11(b), second par. The judge refused to hear witnesses and proceeded solely on the basis of affidavits. We do not think that in this context a paper hearing only is enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">What the elements of a hearing are, we have had occasion to observe, will vary with the nature of the proceeding. <em>Milton Commons Associates </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Milton, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 111, 114 (1982). See Friendly, Some Kind of Hearing, 123 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1267, 1270 (1975). At the least, a proceeding where no one is allowed to argue or present evidence cannot constitute a \u201chearing.\u201d <em>Milton Commons Associates </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Milton, supra </em>at 114-115.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Whether the children would suffer significant mental or physical harm from a trip to Colorado presented discrete issues of fact, sharply disputed, and subject to witness credibility. On what basis, for example, had a family therapist formed the opinion that requiring the children to go to Colorado would be disastrous? Without testimony and findings by the trial judge and left only with uncontroverted affidavits, even if read with a skeptical eye, a reviewing court is left with the impression of children overwhelmed by fear of their mother and, by extension, of Colorado, where they suffered abuse. If the judge, from testimony at other points in the proceeding, had been led to find that the picture painted in the affidavits was overdrawn, such a finding would be entitled to deference. The norm, we think, should be that, if a parent in a custody proceeding asserts that a child will be exposed to risk of mental or physical harm if required to go to another State, and the assertion is supported by affidavits, the judge, on proper and timely request, should conduct a hearing and make findings (written or dictated into the record) in accordance with G. L. c. 209B, \u00a7 11(6), second par. Compare <em>Carabetta Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schena, 25 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 389, 391 (1988), in which we remarked that in Massachusetts, contrary to Federal practice, the taking of live testimony is not the norm on applications for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>In this case the parties exacerbated the judge\u2019s task, difficult in the best of circumstances, by clinging to extreme positions and, in the case of the father, threatening contumacious conduct. The purpose of the MCCJA and the UCCJA is to discourage dragging children into the courts of whatever State they may happen to be in at a particular moment and to discourage competition among the States. Certainly an objective of the acts is to discourage child snatching by competing parents. Unfortunately, the children here suffered something as frightful \u2014 being spirited off by public officials. That was provoked by a parent, who, apparently, was overborne by sincere and strong feelings, who may not have been well advised by counsel, and who refused to recognize the jurisdictional limitations upon the Probate Court judge and that the judge was making an effort to use his limited powers to protect the children. The judge should, as we have said, have held an evidentiary hearing on the question of mental or physical harm to the children from being required to appear in Colorado.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We have observed that the issues on appeal are moot.
