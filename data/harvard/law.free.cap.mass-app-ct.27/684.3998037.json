In <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Peairs, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 372 (1987), we affirmed a judgment of a Probate Court holding Charlotte Hubbard bound by the terms of a consolidated settlement that she had agreed to the evening of December 4, 1984. Following that decision, the other parties to the settlement filed a motion for costs and attorney\u2019s fees to be assessed against Hubbard under the provisions of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 6F and 6G, or, alternatively, under G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 45. The judge\u2019s order on the motion was framed in the language of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F; he found that \u201call or substantially all of the claims raised by Charlotte in connection with the proceedings in the Probate Court and the Appeals Court regarding the enforceability of that compromise agreement were wholly insubstantial, frivolous, and not advanced in good faith,\u201d and he assessed counsel fees, costs, and expenses against Hubbard of $91,605.11 for the proceedings in the Probate Court and $62,845.40 for those in connection with the appeal. Hubbard appealed this order under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G, to a single justice of this court, who affirmed the order. The case is before us on Hubbard\u2019s appeal from the order of the single justice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">1. <em>The award for counsel fees and expenses at trial. </em>A criterion for an award under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, is that \u201call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>or substantially all\u201d of the claims or defenses are frivolous. Such was not the case here. The trial judge ruled in Hubbard\u2019s favor on one of her principal claims, namely, that she was not bound by the terms of the agreement as read into the court record on December 5, 1984 (referred to in <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Peairs, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. at 376 n.5, as \u201cthe Kehoe statement\u201d), or by the written agreement circulated on December 7. In effect, the judge sustained Hubbard\u2019s claim that her local attorney was not authorized to agree on her behalf to the terms added after December 4 and that those terms were of sufficient substance to be unenforceable without her authorization. In view of that ruling, it cannot be said that Hubbard\u2019s position in the Probate Court was \u201cwholly insubstantial\u201d or \u201cfrivolous.\u201d Compare <em>Strand </em>v. <em>Herrick &amp; Smith, </em>396 Mass. 783, 791-792 (1986). It was thus incorrect to award damages under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">2. <em>The award for appellate fees and expenses. </em>The more difficult question is whether Hubbard was justified in appealing after the judge had excised the additional terms from the written agreement and the Kehoe statement and entered judgment in accordance with the terms he found Hubbard had agreed to on the night of December 4. Hubbard claimed many errors, some of which were plainly without merit. Hubbard had, nevertheless, a viable claim that it was error for the judge to enforce as a binding agreement the terms that Hubbard viewed as her negotiating position on the night of December 4. Her position \u2014 not unreasonable \u2014 was that her offer of settlement that night was not accepted as such by the other parties and that the Kehoe statement, containing the December 4 terms but also terms to which she was unwilling to agree, was in effect a counteroffer to which her attorney was not authorized to give assent. At that point, in her view, she was privileged to walk away from the terms that she had been willing to accept on December 4, as no agreement had been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">That was not an untenable position on appeal. It did not conflict with the facts as found by the judge. If its essentially contract-based approach was not regarded as pivotal to the appeal, it was doubtless because, after termination of the trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>the question whether to uphold the settlement in some respects transcended the interests of the parties to it. Midtrial settlements are frequently hammered out without the precision and attention to detail that should characterize professionally written contracts, and terms ancillary to the principal points of agreement may be dealt with roughly or not at all. But when the parties advise the judge that they have reached a settlement and that the trial, with its inevitable commitment of public resources, may be aborted, the parties must realize that the court cannot allow the settlement to be set aside for insubstantial reasons but may itself fashion reasonable adjustments to carry out the parties\u2019 main purposes at the time when they thought they had reached agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Thus, the approach of the court in <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Peairs </em>was not strictly contractual in its orientation. Rather, the decision characterized the trial judge\u2019s deletions of terms contained in the Kehoe statement as having been done \u201cout of considerations of fairness to [Hubbard], to insure that she should not in any event be held to points to which she had not in truth agreed.\u201d 24 Mass. App. Ct. at 377. The decision reasoned that her attorney\u2019s \u201cauthority on December 5 certainly extended to the terms that [Hubbard] had agreed to ..., which terms appeared in the judge\u2019s order\u201d and that \u201c[t]he net result was that [Hubbard] received treatment of which she could hardly complain . . . .\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The essence of the decision in <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Peairs </em>was recognition of a proposition not clearly articulated in the decisional law<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that, after trial has been cut short or averted by the parties \u2019 announcement of settlement, followed by disagreement as to its terms, the judge has discretion to compel adherence to terms representing the substantial points of agreement, avoiding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>thereby a second commitment of the court\u2019s scarce trial resources. The decision in <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Peairs </em>did not characterize Hubbard\u2019s appeal as frivolous, and in our view it was not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The meritoriousness of Hubbard\u2019s appeal from the judgment has been discussed primarily to guide the trial judge in the event that he should be asked to reconsider the motion under G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 45. In the past the practice seems to have been for the appellate court itself to determine motions for appellate costs and counsel fees. See, e.g., <em>Goodwin Bros. Leasing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Nousis, </em>373 Mass. 169, 177 (1977); <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Savitsky, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 792, 798 (1980); <em>Leventhal </em>v. <em>American Discount Corp., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 959, 960 (1981); <em>Miaskiewicz </em>v. <em>LeTourneau, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 880, 882 (1981). The general rule is that appellate costs, except under the automatic provisions of Mass.R.A.P. 26(a), 365 Mass. 873 (1974), as amended, 378 Mass 925 (1979), are awardable only as ordered by the appellate court. <em>Morochnick </em>v. <em>Quigley, </em>394 Mass. 651, 652-653 (1985). The appellate court may, of course, make a determination that the appeal meets the criteria of 6F and order counsel fees to be determined in the trial court. See, e.g., <em>Westwood Lodge Corp. </em>v. <em>A-Copy Inc., 25 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 1107 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The order of the single justice is reversed, and a new order is to be entered reversing the order of the Probate Court awarding counsel fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\"> The appellees seem to assume the case is before us as well on a direct appeal from the order of the probate judge, and they ask us to affirm the order on the alternate basis, G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 45. Assuming the appeal filed in the Probate Court can serve both to bring a \u00a7 6F basis for the award before a single justice and a \u00a7 45 basis before a panel, we think that in this case the probate judge was acting under \u00a7 6F and that he omitted treating the motion under \u00a7 45, presumably because it was not necessary. If, as a result of the decision in this appeal, the appellees wish to press again their motion in its alternative aspect under the criteria applicable to awards under \u00a7 45, they may do so; but, in considering such a motion, the probate judge should take into account the view expressed in this opinion concerning the justifiability of Hubbard\u2019s position both in the Probate Court and in the appeal to this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b713-7\"> The court\u2019s decision could be said, however, to be foreshadowed in a general way by such cases as <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>148 Mass. 348 (1889), <em>Somerville </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven </em>&amp; <em>Hartford R.R., </em>285 Mass. 539, 543 (1934), <em>Dalton </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co., </em>328 Mass. 595, 599 (1952), and <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Hiscock, </em>344 Mass. 691, 693-694 (1962). Those cases emphasize the significance of the trial court\u2019s reliance on the parties\u2019 announcement that they have settled the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
