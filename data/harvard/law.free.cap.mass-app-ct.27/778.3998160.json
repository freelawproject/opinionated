Concluding that the claim was time barred by the three-year statute of limitations applicable to tort actions, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A, the judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The sole question raised by the appeal from the ensuing judgment is whether G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 19, is subject to the four-year limitation period extended to actions arising out of \u201cviolations of any law intended for the protection of consumers.\u201d G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A, as appearing in St. 1983, c. 636, \u00a7 29. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">By its express language, c. 260, \u00a7 5A, does not restrict itself to causes of action arising out of violations of only those laws therein specified.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rules of statutory construction lead us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>conclude, however, that the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d which precedes the specification, limits the applicability of \u00a7 5A to those <em>types </em>of statutes therein particularized. As stated in an analogous case, <em>Haas </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>377 Mass. 591, 595 (1979): \u201cTraditional methods of statutory construction reinforce our conclusion. \u2018A general term in a statute or ordinance takes meaning from the setting in which it is employed. The literal meaning of a general term in an enactment must be limited so as not to include matters that, although within the letter of the enactment, do not fairly come within its spirit and intent. \u2019 <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Building Comm\u2019r of Melrose, </em>315 Mass. 291, 295 (1943). Accord, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>368 Mass. 58, 67-71 (1975); <em>Koller </em>v. <em>Duggan, </em>346 Mass. 270, 273 (1963). \u2018The problem is to determine what particulars that were not mentioned are sufficiently like those that were, in ways that are germane to the subject and purpose of the act, to be made subject to the act\u2019s provisions by force of the general reference. \u2019 2A C. Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.18, at 110 (4th ed. 1973).\u201d We look to determine whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claims arising out of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 19, have the \u201csame characteristics,\u201d <em>Haas </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>377 Mass. at 596, as those laws specified in \u00a7 5A, that is, \u201claw[s] intended for the protection of consumers.\u201d G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">\u201cConsumer law, in a sense, becomes little more than the modem trend towards creating a more equitable balance for the consumer in the marketplace.\u201d Alperin &amp; Chase, Consumer Rights and Remedies \u00a7 1, at 2 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCotis, </em>366 Mass. 234, 238 (1974). As can be seen from the consumer legislation listed in \u00a7 5A, those laws seek to remedy the imbalance which exists primarily because of a lack of parity in bargaining power between the consumer and the provider of consumer goods or services.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>These statutes reflect a legislative attempt to achieve parity between the consumer and the provider of goods and services by requiring that certain disclosures be made to consumers so that they can make informed purchasing decisions and by prohibiting certain acts or conduct which, even if not tortious, exacerbate or exploit consumer bargaining disadvantages. The harm sought to be prevented by these statutes is, primarily, economic harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">There are many statutes that prohibit certain conduct or impose obligations. It does not follow, however, that these many laws are swept within the ambit of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A, simply by reason of the fact that the claim is made by a purchaser of goods or services. If that were so, the applicable limitation period would turn on who was bringing the claim rather than the nature of the claim. Such would be the case with G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 19, which gives a cause of action not only to a tenant but also to \u201cany person rightfully on said premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Although some of the purposes of consumer legislation might be incidentally or indirectly furthered by G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 19, that law does not have the protection of consumers as its intended and primary goal. As discussed in <em>Young </em>v. <em>Garwacki, </em>380 Mass. 162, 164-166 &amp; n.3, 170-171 (1980), the statute reforms the common law by establishing a standard of care owed by landlords in repairing their premises irrespective of the status of the injured person (tenant, licensee, invitee). See also <em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. </em>v. <em>Yanofsky, </em>380 Mass. 326, 330-331 (1980). Its obvious purpose is to protect all persons against the risk of physical injury. See <em>Young </em>v. <em>Garwacki, </em>380 Mass. at 167, quoting from <em>Mounsey </em>v. <em>Ellard, </em>363 Mass. 693, 707 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Notwithstanding the fact that the plaintiffs were tenants, purchasers of residential space, when they sustained their in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>juries, their claims do not arise out of a violation of a \u201claw intended for the protection of consumers.\u201d G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A. Their action is, therefore, time-barred under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b804-16\"> This statute, inserted by St. 1972, c. 665, reads, in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-17\">\u201cA landlord or lessor of any real estate except an owner-occupied two- or three-family dwelling shall, within a reasonable time following receipt of a written notice from a tenant forwarded by registered or certified mail of an unsafe condition, not caused by the tenant, his invitee, or any one occupying through or under the tenant, exercise reasonable care to correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>the unsafe condition described in said notice except that such notice need not be given for unsafe conditions in that portion of the premises not under control of the tenant.
