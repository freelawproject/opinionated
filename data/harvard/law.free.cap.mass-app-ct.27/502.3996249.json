The sole issue raised by the wife\u2019s appeal is whether the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which amended 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(e)(2) (Supp. IV 1986) of the Internal Revenue Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> precludes a State judge from allocating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>dependency exemptions for children of divorced or separated parents. The judgment entered by the probate judge in this case allocated six of the couple\u2019s exemptions to the husband, the noncustodial parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Section 152(e)(1) and (2) set out in relevant part in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provide, omitting the details, that the custodial parent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>is generally entitled to the dependency exemption. If, however, a noncustodial parent appends to his or her tax return a written declaration of the custodial parent that the latter will not claim the child as a dependent, the noncustodial parent may take the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Under prior law, State judges were considered to have power to allocate the dependency exemptions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The purpose of the 1984 amendment was not to limit the authority of State judges; rather, as indicated in note 2, <em>supra, </em>the aim of the amendment was to resolve disputes between parents without the involvement of the Internal Revenue Service. Under the amended statute, the Service no longer needs to determine the amount of support furnished by each parent. It is only concerned with which parent is the custodial one and whether that parent has signed a declaration that he or she will not claim the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The majority of courts which have ruled on the question have held that the amendment to \u00a7 152(e)(2) does not prevent State courts from allocating dependency exemptions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>with this view and hold that the probate judge could properly allocate six exemptions to the husband. Since \u00a7 152(e)(2)(A) requires a written declaration by the custodial parent before the noncustodial parent may take the exemption, the judge should also order the wife to execute the declaration for one or more years. See Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.52-4T (1984).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The matter is remanded to the Probate Court to modify the judgment by the addition of an appropriate order directing the wife to execute the required declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-14\"> P. L. No. 98-369, Div. A, Title IV, \u00a7 423 (a), 98 Stat. 799.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-15\"> Prior to the 1984 amendment, former \u00a7 152(e)(2) provided different exceptions to the general rule that the parent with custody of a child is deemed to have furnished over half the child\u2019s support, that is, can claim a dependency exemption. The former law was that a noncustodial parent was entitled to the exemption if the decree of divorce (or written agreement) provided that such parent was so entitled <em>and </em>provided such parent furnished at least $600 support in the calendar year. Alternatively, if the parent without custody provided $1,200 support or more in the calendar year, and the parent with custody did not establish that he or she furnished more support, then the parent without custody could claim the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-16\">The House Committee on Ways and Means in recommending the amendment to \u00a7 152(e)(2) noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>\u201cThe present rules governing the allocations of the dependency exemption are often subjective and present difficult problems of proof and substantiation. The Internal Revenue Service becomes involved in many disputes between parents who both claim the dependency exemption based on providing support over the applicable thresholds. The cost to the parties and the Government to resolve these disputes is relatively high and the Government generally has little tax revenue at stake in the outcome. The committee wishes to provide more certainty by allowing the custodial spouse the exemption unless that spouse waives his or her right to claim the exemption. Thus, dependency disputes between parents will be resolved without the involvement of the Internal Revenue Service.\u201d H.R. Rep.
