The motion was heard and denied with findings, ruling, and order. The defendant stood trial, jury waived, and was convicted of the offenses. He appeals, claiming error in the refusal to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-14\">Evidence at the pretrial hearing consisted of the testimony of Officer Daniel O\u2019Connor, a member of the vice squad of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Worcester police department. The defendant did not cross-examine or offer evidence on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The facts found, supplemented by details from the transcript of the hearing on the motion, were these. About 9:00 a.m., October 7, 1985, a sunny morning, O\u2019Connor and Officer Paul Ryan, also of the vice squad, both in plainclothes, were driving on patrol in an unmarked car on New Vista Lane in the Great Brook Valley area of Worcester. At that date the particular location, centering at 1-7 New Vista Lane, near an intersection with Constitution Avenue, was known to the police as \u201cthe point,\u201d that is, a specific place of high drug activity, where cocaine and heroin could readily be obtained at any hour of the day or night. The point had been at the New Vista location for three or four months; its location would change from time to time, in part to thwart or slow arrests by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">O\u2019Connor, the driver, spotted at his right the defendant and two other men standing on the sidewalk at the point. The defendant was facing the car as it approached. At a distance estimated as about twenty yards from the defendant, O\u2019Connor saw him holding a plastic baggie in his hand at chest level. The baggie was in O\u2019Connor\u2019s clear view, but at that distance he could not see its contents through the plastic. O\u2019Connor and the defendant made \u201ceye contact.\u201d The defendant, then, in one movement, commencing to turn his back, plunged the baggie inside the front of his pants. O\u2019Connor pulled up the car next to the men. He left the car, grabbed the defendant, and reached into the defendant\u2019s pants and drew the baggie from the crotch area. It contained a number of packets evidently of drugs (and later confirmed as such): ten silver packets of cocaine, four yellows of cocaine, seven grays of heroin, and one rainbow of heroin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">O\u2019Connor, an experienced narcotics officer, as was Ryan, recognized the baggie at a distance as a type regularly used to contain and carry smaller packets of cocaine and heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>The judge found that O\u2019Connor and Ryan, on the basis of their observations as experienced narcotics officers, had \u201cmentally recorded information which was sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the defendant Rivera was at that time committing a crime. At the very least, that crime being possession of a controlled substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">We agree that the arrest and search were based on probable cause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the motion to suppress failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Each of four elements in the present case tended to prove that the defendant was currently committing a crime: (1) the defendant was in possession of what appeared to be evidence of a crime, a baggie reasonably identified as a type of container regularly used in illicit drug transactions; (2) the defendant reacted with behavior reasonably interpreted to be evasive or furtive; (3) the encounter was in a place of high incidence of drug traffic; (4) experienced investigators on the scene evaluated the event as indicating present criminal conduct on the part of the accused. It may be assumed that no one of these elements, standing alone, would suffice to establish probable cause for arrest and search.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, it is settled by numerous decisions that a concurrence of the first and second factors \u2014 identification of the baggie in the person\u2019s possession and evasive reaction by him \u2014 readily cumulate to provide probable cause. The inference is measurably strengthened when the site of the episode is a notorious drug market, and is further enhanced by the opinion on the whole matter of experienced officers responsible for the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>A sampling of the decisions referred to appears in 2 LaFave, Search &amp; Seizure \u00a7 3.6(d), at 58-62 (2d ed. 1987), where the author writes: \u201cAs the Supreme Court concluded in <em>[Sibron] </em>v. <em>New York, </em>[392 U.S. 40, 66-67 (1968)], \u2018deliberately furtive actions ... at the approach of strangers or law officers are strong indicia of mens rea, and when coupled with specific knowledge on the part of the officer relating the suspect to the evidence of crime, they are proper factors to be considered in the decision to make an arrest. \u2019 Thus, if the police see a person in possession of a highly suspicious object or some object which is not identifiable but which because of other circumstances is reasonably suspected to be contraband, and then observe that person make an apparent attempt to conceal that object from police view, probable cause is then present.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Characteristic situations cited by LaFave are those where an officer sees a manila envelope or a hand-rolled cigarette symptomatic of a transaction in, or possession of, drugs, and the suspect, alerted to the near possibility of detection, attempts to discard or conceal the evidence. See <em>Price </em>v. <em>United States, </em>429 A.2d 514, 516-517 (D.C. 1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruffing, </em>127 N.H. 370, 371 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>129 N.H. 165, 170 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>15 Or. App. 76, 79-80 (1973); <em>Hollis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 874, 876-877 (1976). The <em>Price </em>case is an example of the court\u2019s remarking also upon the place of the arrest and the experience of the arresting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Although we speak of \u201celements\u201d or features of the cases, it is to be understood that no two cases are precisely alike; each has its singular aspects. In our jurisdiction, no decided case squares exactly with the facts of the present case, but the trend of decisions is evident, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>376 Mass. 349, 350-351, 353-355 (1978), where suppression was refused, may be taken to represent them all. There officers in an unmarked car through binoculars observed a parked car near Blackstone Park in Boston, an area of heavy drug traffic. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>The occupant \u2014 the defendant \u2014 left the car and showed a man who approached a yellow packet believed to resemble the type of a \u201cdime\u201d bag of heroin. As the officers started up their vehicle with a screech of tires, the defendant threw the yellow packet into the car and both men fled into the park. The packet, retrieved, in fact contained the drug. The defendant was apprehended but the other man was not found. Here are facts similar on principle to those at bar. We note that in <em>Ortiz </em>the approaching man was the defendant\u2019s brother, known to the police as having a record of prior drug arrests; but we suggest that the result should have been the same if that factor were absent. (In <em>Ortiz </em>there was a question whether the circumstances were \u201cexigent\u201d thus dispensing with the need for a warrant. No such doubt arises here.) See also, on varying facts, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Battle, </em>365 Mass. 472 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brillante, </em>399 Mass. 152 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blatz, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 603 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McShan, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 921 (1983). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>365 Mass. 59 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wooden, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 417, 418-422 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Skea, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 685 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In our view the Commonwealth sustained its burden to show that the officers acted on probable cause, that is, a \u201crequirement . . . satisfied by showing facts which would warrant a man of reasonable caution in believing that certain action is appropriate.\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>District Court of Hampshire, </em>384 Mass. 736, 744 (1981). The officers must have entertained rationally \u201cmore than a suspicion of criminal involvement, something definite and substantial, but not a prima facie case of the commission of a crime, let alone a case beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bond, </em>375 Mass. 201, 210 (1978). The defendant tries, vainly, to demand satisfaction of a much more rigorous standard here. After all, he says, conceivably the concealment of the baggie was an innocent act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>rather is that the experienced officers in the circumstances of the case could reasonably have concluded with a \u201cpractical, nontechnical\u201d probability <em>(Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U. S. 160, 176 [1949]) that the gesture was an attempt at evasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-8\"> Testimony at the later trial indicated retail prices as follows: ten dollars for a silver packet, twenty-five dollars for yellow, thirty dollars for gray, and thirty dollars (apparently) for rainbow.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b69-7\"> The requirements of probable cause for arrest may be taken to equate here with those for search, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tarver, </em>369 Mass. 302, 307 (1975), and it is not important whether the arrest is supposed to have occurred just before, immediately after, or concurrently with the search. See <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 111 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>365 Mass. 59, 65 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brillante, </em>399 Mass. 152, 154 n.5 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b69-8\"> In the present case the container was capable of use for a lawful as well as an unlawful purpose; where a container appears to have but one use, and that an unlawful one, its identification, standing alone, may be enough to justify seizure. Note the tied-off, deflated balloon in <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 742-743 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b70-6\"> Decisions to like effect are assembled in Annot., 45 A.L.R. 3d 581 (1972 &amp; Supp. 1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b71-6\"> The defendant seems to be contending that a person\u2019s reaction to the approach of someone in plainclothes, rather than in uniform, cannot be interpreted as evasive and is necessarily of minimal probative value. Surely .no such generalization can be supported; all turns on the particulars of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>case in its milieu. Here the defendant\u2019s instant move to his pants could count materially toward probable cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
