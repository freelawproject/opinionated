Part of this development, to be known as Watertower Plaza (the plaza), lies within an industrial zone under the pre-1987 city zoning ordinance. It is best described by the illustration on the next page depicting a much simplified schematic plan of the development sought by MP for the plaza. This schematic plan is based on more complicated plans in the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">In 1987, when MP submitted plans under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 81P, 81R, 81S, and 81U, to the Leominster planning board (the board), a citizen\u2019s petition for a complete revision of the city\u2019s zoning ordinance was being considered by the Leominster city council. The then existing 1985 zoning ordinance allowed commercial structures in an industrial zone. The proposed 1987 zoning ordinance would have excluded such commercial structures from industrial zones.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">At the arguments all counsel appeared to treat as crucial the question whether the city council had adopted a new zoning ordinance before August 7, 1987. On that day MP filed (under the subdivision control law, G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 81K to 81GG, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>inserted by St. 1953, c. 674, \u00a7 7) its preliminary development plan with the board. Counsel for the city stated in oral argument before us that, if the new 1987 ordinance (which prohibited a commercial use in an industrial zone) took effect <em>after </em>MP filed its preliminary plan, MP \u201cwould have the right [under the former ordinance] to go ahead with a commercial development on the locus.\u201d He contended, however, that, if the new 1987 ordinance took effect <em>before </em>MP filed with the board its preliminary plan, he would expect agreement from MP that, as matter of law, the project could not be approved by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>This litigation was instituted by MP in a complaint constituting both (1) an appeal from the board\u2019s decision denying approval of the development of the plaza, and (2) a request for declaratory relief declaring the rights of the parties on significant issues. It was considered at length by a Land Court judge after MP filed a motion for summary judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The judge in his final decision of June 14, 1989, concluded that there were \u201cno genuine issues of material fact\u201d and that MP was entitled to judgment. He ruled the 1987 amendment of the preexisting city zoning ordinance was adopted by the city council on October 26, 1987, when the council passed the new ordinance to be ordained and that MP\u2019s plan was governed by the city\u2019s 1985 zoning ordinance as in effect prior to the adoption of the revised ordinance. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6; c. 41, \u00a7 8 1P. He ordered that the board\u2019s denial of MP\u2019s plan be annulled and that the city clerk deliver to MP a certificate that a final \u201cdecree\u201d approving MP\u2019s plan had been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The board and the city appealed from the judge\u2019s decision of June 14, 1989. A single justice of this court granted a stay of the Land Court order \u201cpending decision of. .. [this] appeal\u201d but also entered on the same day an order to expedite hearing of the appeal. Th\u00e9 single justice also denied both MP\u2019s requests (a) for a \u201cfurther expedition of the appeal\u201d and (b) for a very substantial surety company bond to protect MP against significant injuries which it might be caused, even if it prevailed on this appeal, should its contractual arrangements with one or more tenants be disrupted by delay incident to the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">1. We first discuss whether MP\u2019s preliminary plan was filed before or after the date when the city council adopted the changed 1987 zoning ordinance. The facts on that issue are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">On March 9, 1987, a petition was received by the city council (no. 43 of 1987) for a complete revision of the city\u2019s 1985 zoning ordinance. The petition was referred by the city council to its legal affairs committee and to the board \u201cfor a recommendation and a hearing.\u201d Hearings were held by the city council in May, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">There is some confusion in the record whether on June 8, 1987, the city council voted (in some general way) to grant the petition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In any event, after June 8, 1987, there were further hearings on the petition (for example, the council minutes of October 19, 1987, refer to a discussion of further amendments of the petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">It was not until a meeting of the city council on October 26, 1987, that (after, indeed, further amendments at that meeting) the 1987 proposed ordinance was \u201cread a second time and passed to be ordained.\u201d The city council by these actions treated the zoning revision (on October 26) as still open to discussion and subject to amendment. The Land Court judge properly held that the 1987 amendments were not adopted until October 26, 1987. (They were signed by the mayor on October 27, 1987.)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 5 (as inserted by St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3), provides in its seventh paragraph, \u201cThe effective date of the adoption or amendment of any zoning ordinance . . . shall be the date on which such adoption or amendment was voted upon by a city council. ...\u201d The city charter in \u00a7 3.9(a) provides, \u201cNo ordinance shall be amended or repealed except by another ordinance adopted by the city council\u201d or by referendum under the charter. No referendum was involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>We conclude that the procedures called for by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 5, and actually used in 1987, were sufficient (under the council procedures then in effect in Leominster) to leave the earlier 1985 zoning ordinance in effect until the new ordinance was \u201cordained.\u201d See <em>Nevins </em>v. <em>City Council of Springfield, </em>227 Mass. 538, 543-545 (1917). See also <em>Mansfield </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>271 Mass. 515, 518-521 (1930); <em>Kubik </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>353 Mass. 514, 516 (1968, passage of a zoning amendment after a veto by the mayor when a second [post-veto] \u201cvote to adopt was the only effective such vote,\u201d cited with approval <em>in LaBranche </em>v. <em>A.J. Lane &amp; Co., </em>404 Mass. 725, 731 [1989]). Compare <em>Durand </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Pub. Bldgs. of Fall River, </em>354 Mass. 74, 75 (1968); <em>Trumper </em>v. <em>Quincy, </em>358 Mass. 311, 312 (1970), where the city council voted only once on a proposed zoning change, but the vote was ineffective because of failure to comply with \u00a7 7 of the former Zoning Enabling Act which was superseded by St. 1975, c. 808. In view of our decision, MP\u2019s definitive plan is to be evaluated on the basis of the 1985 city zoning ordinance (still operative on August 7, 1987). See G. L. 40A, \u00a7 6, fifth par., as amended by St. 1982, c. 185.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">2. Despite the city\u2019s and the board\u2019s concessions at the arguments, they contend in their brief that in various respects MP\u2019s plans were in conflict with the city\u2019s 1972 subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>regulations. We consider in the following paragraphs the principal contentions thus made.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">3. The city and board first'contend that the board\u2019s subdivision regulations preclude board approval of Watertower Place as a part of MP\u2019s definitive.plan for Watertower Plaza.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">We interpret the board\u2019s 1972 regulations as requiring MP (even for a commercial-retail development) to comply (in an industrial zone) with the regulations applicable to such a zone under the 1985 zoning ordinance (see part one of this opinion). It does not seem to be disputed that the 1985 zoning ordinance permitted commercial and retail uses in an industrial zone.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There,is, however, some ambiguity in pertinent subdivision regulations because of the language of \u00a7\u00a7 4.0.0.5 and 4.0.0.6 of the regulations (dealing with \u201cdead-end streets\u201d) when read with \u00a7 4.14.4 with respect to \u201clooping streets.\u201d The aggregate of these provisions<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> seems to us to be an effort by regulations to permit the general type of \u201cturnaround\u201d authorized by G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81Q. So viewed, the regulations make it unnecessary to determine whether Watertower Place is a \u201cdead-end street,\u201d a matter on which the Massachusetts cases are not completely consistent. See, e.g., <em>Sparks </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Westborough, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>2 Mass. App. Ct. 745, 748 (1974), which referred to <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>348 Mass. 652, 653-654 (1965). See also <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Hingham, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 435, 450, 452 (1979).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The Land Court judge found that the turnaround easement \u201cact[s] in effect as a looping street serving a shopping center parking lot.\u201d So considered, it seems adequately to deal with the city\u2019s and the board\u2019s contention that Watertower Place \u201cdoes not lose its character as a dead-end street merely because it may be physically possible to travel beyond its [southern] terminus.\u201d On the facts shown by this record, a driver entering Watertower Place from Hamilton Street would have two options. The driver could (a) go back through Watertower Place to Hamilton Street or (b) cross the parking lot to the west and depart through the existing curb cut to North Main Street. The Land Court judge correctly ruled in effect that each course was permissible under the existing subdivision regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">4. The city and the board dispute in some degree whether MP\u2019s definitive plan presents any unresolved health questions. G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, as amended by St. 1978, c. 422, \u00a7 1, provides in part: \u201cWhen a definitive plan of a subdivision is submitted to the planning board, as provided in section eighty-one O, a copy thereof shall also be filed with the board of health. . . . Such health board . . . shall, within forty-five days after the plan is so filed, report to the planning board in writing, approval or disapproval of said plan. . . . Failure of such board ... to report shall be deemed approval by such board. ...\u201d MP filed their definitive plan with the board of health. The board of health did not hold any hearing, or respond to the planning board, concerning MP\u2019s definitive plan within the forty-five day statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Because of this nonaction, the board of health is deemed to have approved the definitive plan. G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U. \u201cA planning board has no discretion to disapprove a subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>plan which has been approved by the board of health and is in conformance with the reasonable rules and regulations of the planning board.\u201d <em>Patelle </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Woburn, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 951 (1978). See also <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Framingham, </em>353 Mass. 141, 144 (1967); G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81M.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The board of health after the expiration of the forty-five day period mentioned in c. 41, \u00a7 81U, on March 22, 1988, did write to the planning board enclosing a copy of a letter to MP dated March 10, 1988, from the State Department of Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE) calling to MP\u2019s attention its possible liability under G. L. c. 21E (the hazardous material act). The Leominster board of health recommended that the plaza subdivision be disapproved until the receipt of DEQE\u2019s orders. No board regulations have been called to our attention which require absence of hazardous waste or expressly deal with the subject of hazardous waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">It appears that any hazardous waste problem was a preexisting one and is not directly related to MP\u2019s proposed development. We perceive in the statutes already cited no basis for concluding that a planning board has authority to disapprove a definitive plan because of an already existing hazardous waste problem. See the discussion in <em>Daley Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Randolph, </em>340 Mass. 149, 153 (1959), reviewing the legislative history of the subdivision control law. See also <em>Pieper </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Southborough, </em>340 Mass. 157, 163-164 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">On the authority of the cases just cited, the matter of hazardous waste would not be proper for consideration for the planning board under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81M. Instead, on this record, it appears to be the responsibility of DEQE under G. L. c. 21E.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">5. The board\u2019s letter of April 8, 1988, denying approval of MP\u2019s definitive plan, made only general and inconclusive suggestions for amendment of the plan on grounds of traffic concerns. Essentially, the board\u2019s letter merely criticizes in imprecise terms the traffic impact analysis submitted to the board by MP. There were no definite suggestions for amendment of the plan as in <em>Mac-Rich Realty Constr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number><em>of Southborough, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 79, 86 (1976). See and compare <em>North Landers Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Falmouth, </em>382 Mass. 432, 444-446 (1981). In no way does the letter denying approval point to particular board regulations which the board contends MP\u2019s plan to have violated. See <em>Canter </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Westborough, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 306, 307-310 (1976). As already stated, no counter-affidavits (on the motion for summary judgment) were filed by the city or the board to show violation of regulations by MP.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">6. We regard this case as coming within the principles (permitting summary judgment) set out in the careful opinion of Mr. Justice Quirico in <em>Framingham Clinic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Framingham, </em>382 Mass. 283, 298-299 (1981). That case recognizes that important limitations on the powers of planning boards exist. Compare the limitations upon the flexibility of zoning provisions discussed in <em>SCIT, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Braintree, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 101, 106-111 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">We, on the present record and contentions, \u201cperceive no legitimate purpose to be served by further trial proceedings,\u201d see the <em>Framingham Clinic </em>case at 299, and affirm the judgment of the Land Court, except that, as was provided in the trial judge\u2019s order in the <em>Framingham </em>case, a paragraph shall be added to the Land Court\u2019s order and judgment, reading: \u201c5. In view of the significant errors of law committed by the Board which have caused delay to the plaintiff (with the consequent serious risk of loss by the plaintiff [MP] of tenants contemplated by the definitive plan), the Land Court reserves jurisdiction in the matter so that it may expedite determination of any further issues which may arise in carrying out this order and judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">The judgment is affirmed as modified in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b839-11\"> The complete project encompasses several lots, of which only two will be within the plaza portion of the area, but substantially all (if not all) the issues in this litigation arise with respect to the plaza portion of the general area. The plaza portion contains an existing building on Hamilton Street proposed to be converted into a department store. So far as appears, no change is contemplated in the use of an existing office building on North Main Street. New construction would include a supermarket to be built west of Watertower Place, shown on the schematic plan as a two-way method of access from Hamilton Street to the large parking area lying southwest of the proposed department store.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b842-10\"> In September, 1988, a purported amendment to the minutes of the meeting of June 8, 1987, inserted the following notation: \u201cThe PETITION [no. 43 of 1987] was GRANTED as amended. VT. unan.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b843-6\"> The pertinent portion of the fifth paragraph of c. 40A, \u00a7 6, read as follows on August 7, 1987:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-7\">\u201cIf a definitive plan, or a preliminary plan followed within seven months by a definitive plan, is submitted to a planning board for approval under the subdivision control law, and written notice of such submission has been given to the city . . . clerk before the effective date of [the] ordinance . . ., the land shown on such plan shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the zoning ordinance ... in effect at the time of the first such submission while such plan or plans are being processed under the subdivision control law, and, if such definitive plan or an amendment thereof is finally approved, for eight years from the date of the endorsement of such approval . . . [with an exception here not relevant].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">As the record shows that the definitive plan was filed by MP on January 19, 1988, and all appropriate notices were given to the city clerk, there was complete compliance with the quoted provision of c. 40A, \u00a7 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b844-7\"> Some of these contentions are dealt with in. the affidavit of Thomas J.
