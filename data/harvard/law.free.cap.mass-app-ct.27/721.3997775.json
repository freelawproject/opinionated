(Hebrew National), transferees of some of M&amp;S\u2019s inventory, seeking payment of any underlying debt of M&amp;S on account of alleged violations of the bulk transfer provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7\u00a7 6-101 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-16\">A partial summary judgment was entered determining that M&amp;S was liable for a breach of the lease. After a jury trial in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>the Superior Court, a final judgment entered assessing damages (in a stipulated amount) and counsel fees against M&amp;S flowing from the breach and imposing liability on Morrison &amp; Schiff and Hebrew National for the amount of the stipulated damages only. The defendants have appealed; M&amp;S argues that there were genuine issues of fact relating to waiver or modification of the lease; Morrison &amp; Schiff and Hebrew National contend that there-was error of law in the application of the bulk transfer law.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">1. We \u2018consider first the issue of the alleged violation of the bulk transfer law. It is unnecessary to state in any detail the transactions between M&amp;S and Morrison &amp; Schiff and Hebrew National, except to say that M&amp;S sold to these defendants in bulk somewhere between twenty-three and twenty-six percent of its inventory of meat and meat products. In answer to special questions, the jury said that this transfer was of a \u201cmajor part\u201d of M&amp;S\u2019s inventory on hand at the time and assigned a value to the inventory transferred.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code, as enacted in Massachusetts, provides: \u201cA \u2018bulk transfer\u2019 is any transfer in bulk and not in the ordinary course of the transferor\u2019s business of a <em>major part </em>of the materials, supplies, merchandise or other inventory ... of an enterprise subject to this Article\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 6-102(1). There is no question that M&amp;S was a covered enterprise (see \u00a7 6-102[3]), that notice to its creditors was not given in accordance with Article 6 (see \u00a7 6-106), that the sale to Morrison &amp; Schiff and Hebrew National was not in the ordinary course of M&amp;S\u2019s business, or that, if the transaction constituted a bulk transfer, the transferees are liable to the plaintiff as creditor of M&amp;S. See \u00a7 6-105. The narrow question for decision, one which has not hitherto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>been considered by our appellate courts, is what meaning is to be given to the words \u201cmajor part,\u201d as used in \u00a7 6-102(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The defendants moved for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that the words \u201cmajor part\u201d meant, as matter of law, more than fifty percent of the value of current inventory. The motions were denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, the defendants\u2019 request that the jury be so instructed was denied. Instead, the judge instructed the jury that, \u201cin determining whether a major part of inventory was sold, or not, . . . size alone under the law is not determinative, it is not determinative one way or the other in and of itself. But obviously the amount, the size of the inventory that was sold and transferred by M&amp;S ... to these other two corporations is some evidence for you to consider. It is evidence for you to consider as to your determination on whether or not a major part was involved. . . . [S]o you have to go back to the evidence and say, . . . how much of the inventory was sold and does it then amount, in your minds, in the context of this transaction, to a major part of the particular inventory that M&amp;S . . . had on hand. ...\u201d The jury were thus given no meaningful guidance on the standard they were to apply. Under these instructions they were undoubtedly prompted to the application of a substantial part test. This, by any examination of the law, was the wrong guide.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>We begin our analysis by a comparison of the relevant language of the former bulk sales law of Massachusetts with the version adopted in Article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code in 1958 and unchanged thereafter. See St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1. The old law applied to \u201c[t]he sale in bulk of <em>any part or the whole </em>of a stock of merchandise.\u201d St. 1903, c. 415, \u00a7 1. Article 6, on the other hand, adopted two quantitative tests with respect to bulk transfers. The first, in connection with transfers of inventory, made the bulk sale provisions applicable where a \u201cmajor part\u201d is involved. \u00a7 6-102(1). The second, relating to transfers of equipment (which do not come within the reach of Article 6 at all unless made in conjunction with a bulk transfer of inventory, see note 3, supra) calls for application of the law in the case of a transfer of a \u201csubstantial part.\u201d \u00a7 6-102(2). There can be no serious question that the use of \u201cmajor part\u201d effected a change in the required minimum quantum of inventory transfer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the words \u201cmajor part\u201d and \u201csubstantial part,\u201d used side by side in \u00a7 6-102(1) and (2), should be considered to carry different and ordinary meanings. See <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co., </em>392 Mass. 876, 880 (1984); <em>Rein </em>v. <em>Marshfield, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 519, 522 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The general purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code are embodied in G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 1-102(2). They include: \u201c(a) to simplify, clarify and modernize the law governing commercial transactions\u201d and \u201c(c) to make uniform the law among the various jurisdictions.\u201d Among the specific purposes of Article 6 of the Code is \u201cto simplify and make uniform the bulk sales laws of the states that adopt this Act.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 6-101, Uniform Commercial Code comment 1. We turn, therefore, to decisions in other jurisdictions. See <em>Canter </em>v. <em>Schlager, </em>358 Mass. 789, 792-793 (1971). Most courts which have considered the meaning of \u201cmajor part\u201d have concluded that a transfer of more than fifty percent of the value of inventory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>must be made in order for the bulk transfer provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code to come into play. See <em>Martin Marietta Corp. </em>v. <em>New Jersey Natl. Bank, </em>653 F.2d 779, 782 (3d Cir. 1981); <em>In re Albany Brick Co., </em>12 UCC Rep. Serv. 165, 166 (U.S. Dist. Ct. M.D. Ga. 1972); <em>Wikelund Wholesale Co. </em>v. <em>Tile World Factory Tile Warehouse, </em>57 Ill. App. 3d 269, 271-272 (1978). See also <em>Stone\u2019s Pharmacy </em>v. <em>Pharmacy Accounting Management, </em>812 F.2d 1063, 1067 &amp; n.2 (8th Cir. 1987)(although the court found it unnecessary to decide the meaning of \u201cmajor part,\u201d it noted that other jurisdictions that have adopted the \u201cmajor part\u201d language have construed it to mean more than fifty percent); <em>In re Shirts \u201cN\u201d Slax, Inc., 4 </em>UCC Rep. Serv. 873, 874 (U.S. Dist. Ct. E.D. Pa. 1967) (where respondent in a case brought under Article 6 had purchased only one-third of debtor\u2019s inventory, his claim to that property was substantial rather than merely colorable for purposes of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s summary jurisdiction); <em>Froehle &amp; Roth </em>v. <em>Smith Enterprises, Inc., </em>27 Ohio App. 3d 359, 361 (1986) (although the court did not directly adopt the over fifty percent rule, it did \u201capply\u201d the <em>In re Albany Brick, supra, </em>analysis to the facts and specifically referred to its interpretation of \u201cmajor part\u201d as meaning more than fifty percent); <em>Bergen, Johnson &amp; Olson </em>v. <em>Verco Mfg. Co., </em>690 S.W.2d 115, 118 (Tex. Ct. App. 1985)(summary judgment reversed for failure to show transfer of a \u201cmajor part,\u201d with the court noting that other jurisdictions have interpreted \u201cmajor part\u201d to mean over fifty percent). Compare <em>Moskowitz </em>v. <em>Michaels, </em>29 Colo. App. 44, 46-47 (1970)(purchase of only forty-nine percent of debtor\u2019s inventory is not a \u201cmeritorious defense\u201d to a claim based on failure to comply with Article 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Professor Hawkland gives the following overview. \u201cPreCode bulk transfer statutes universally contained quantitative limitations exempting transactions from the statutes unless a certain amount of described property had been conveyed. While these pre-Code laws differed to a considerable extent in the expression of their quantitative limitations, all were stated in general language, suchas \u2018substantialpart,\u2019 \u2018majorpart,\u2019 \u2018large part,\u2019 or simply \u2018in bulk.\u2019 Article 6 follows this approach, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>using the phrases \u2018major part\u2019 and \u2018in bulk\u2019 as the quantitative limitations on transfers of inventory, and \u2018substantial part\u2019 as the quantitative limitation on the transfers of equipment. . . . The term \u2018major part\u2019 is not defined, but it probably means that more than 50% of the inventory must be transferred before a transaction comes within the scope of Article 6. This conclusion is based on the dictionary meaning of the word \u2018major\u2019 and the interpretation of this word by the states where it appeared in their pre-Code bulk transfer statutes. Major has the same root meaning as majority, and thus the dictionary definition of the word is an amount that is more than half of the total amount of a given group. Moreover, states which used the words \u2018major part\u2019 as the quantitative limitation in their preCode bulk transfer laws gave this dictionary meaning to the term. As a result, it has been generally assumed that the words \u2018major part\u2019 found in subsection 6-102(1) mean \u2018more than fifty percent of the inventory,\u2019 and most courts have so held\u201d (footnote omitted). 6 Hawkland, Uniform Commercial Code Series \u00a7 6-102:07 (1984).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Most commentators have endorsed the fifty percent rule where the words \u201cmajor part\u201d are used. Batten, Article 6: Bulk Transfers, 18 Wake Forest L. Rev. 339, 344 (1982); 3A Duesenberg &amp; King, Sales and Bulk Transfers Under the U.C.C. \u00a7 15:02(1) (1988); Hawkland, The Trouble with Article 6 of the U.C.C.: Some Thoughts About Section 6-102, 81 Comm. L.J. 83, 86 (1976). The rule has been generally accepted and understood by the commercial community. See 6 Hawkland, Uniform Commercial Code Series \u00a7\u00a7 6-102:07 &amp; 102:09 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>We are persuaded by the consistency and acceptance of interpretation. We also have in mind the desirability of uniformity of application of the Uniform Commercial Code and of a bright line, commercially certain and accepted (even if somewhat arbitrary), test. Therefore, we now hold, with the weight of authority elsewhere, that the words \u201cmajor part\u201d in G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 6-102(1), mean, as matter of law, more than fifty percent of the property transferred, measured by value.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The judgment against Morrison and Schiff and Hebrew National is reversed, and a new judgment is to be entered for them. There is no merit to the plaintiff\u2019s argument that there must be a new trial because the jury could have disbelieved the existence of $125,000 worth of inventory sold to regular customers. The jury\u2019s valuation of the inventory which they found transferred, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>belies that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">2. M&amp;S argues that, through the deposition testimony of its president, it raised genuine issues of material fact as to waiver and modification so as to preclude the entry of the partial summary judgment determining breach of the lease. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). The best that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>can be said about the deposition testimony is that it contains bare assertions and conclusions regarding the president\u2019s understandings, beliefs and assumptions. That is not enough to withstand a well pleaded motion for summary judgment. A response \u201cmust set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(e), 365 Mass. 825 (1974). See <em>Community Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 555 (1976); <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Erwin, </em>395 Mass. 715, 721 (1985); <em>Cullen Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Property Ins. Underwriting Assn., </em>399 Mass. 886, 889-892 (1987); <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Piccicuto, 25 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 910, 912 (1987). Compare <em>Capitol Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Pre-Schools, Inc., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 907 (1980). There was no error in the entry of partial summary judgment against M&amp;S.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed as to Morrison &amp; Schiff, Inc., and Hebrew National Kosher Foods, Inc. A new judgment is to enter for those defendants.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed as to M&amp;S Liquidating Corporation.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\"> The value given by the jury was obviously arrived at by their impermissibly adding to a figure representing twenty-three percent of M&amp;S\u2019s inventory value an amount attributable to sales commissions paid to Hebrew National in connection with the sale of $125,000 worth of inventory (not found to have been transferred out of the ordinary course of M&amp;S\u2019s business) to M&amp;S\u2019s regular customers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b749-6\"> The jury also found that M&amp;S had transferred a substantial part of its equipment to Morrison &amp; Schiff and Hebrew National. Such a transfer is not subject to Article 6 unless combined with a bulk transfer of inventory. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 6-102(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s arguments that the numerous sales of product inventory to M&amp;S\u2019s regular customers should be considered as a single sale to Morrison &amp; Schiff and Hebrew National or that the purchase by these defendants of a substantial part of M&amp;S\u2019s assets with the knowledge that M&amp;S was going out of business brings the transaction within the bulk transfer law were, from a fair reading of the record before us, not adequately raised in the Superior Court, and we do not consider them. See <em>Bernard </em>v. <em>Cameron &amp; Colby Co., </em>397 Mass. 320, 323 (1986); <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Bedford, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 374, 379 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b749-10\"> The court took no action on the defendants\u2019 pretrial motion for a ruling to this effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b750-6\"> The plaintiff seizes on a general statement in the Massachusetts Code Comment to G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 6-101, Mass. Gen. Laws. Ann. at 157 (West 1958), that, with exceptions not here material, Article 6 \u201cis substantially in accord with prior statutory and case law.\u201d The semantical changes with which we deal make that comment unpersuasive in context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b752-5\"> \u201cOnce a bulk transfer of inventory has been made, a bulk transfer of equipment can be found if that transfer is of a \u2018substantial part of the equipment\u2019 of an enterprise falling within the scope of Article 6. Unlike the words \u2018major part\u2019 that impose the principal quantitative limitation on bulk transfers of inventory, \u2018substantial part\u2019 has no clear meaning based on the dictionary sense of the phrase or its common law antecedents. Consequently, while the commercial community and the courts have generally regarded major part to mean more than 50% of the inventory, no such consensus exists as to the meaning of substanial part of the equipment. Generally speaking, however, it is correct to say that the word \u2018substantial\u2019 means something less in terms of quantity than \u2018major. \u2019 <em>\" Id. </em>at \u00a7 6-102:09.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\"> We do not rehearse the ongoing debate about the necessity or desirability of Article 6 in the present credit economy. Article 6 may have been poorly drafted and the protections which it purports to afford illusory. The onerous burdens and risks which it imposes in the light of what some believe are minimum benefits have caused reexamination of fundamental principles. Committees of the Commercial Law League of America, the American Bar Association\u2019s section on corporations, banking and business law and the Uniform Law Commissioners have each proposed reconsideration of Article 6. The Uniform Law Commissioners have suggested repeal or revision, in the latter case including an explicit definition of a bulk sale, to conform with decisional law and common commercial understanding, to mean one of more than half the seller\u2019s assets measured by value. See the discussion in Baker, Bulk Transfers Act \u2014 Patch, Bury, or Renovate? 38 Bus. Law 1771 (1983); Harris, The Article 6 Drafting Committee\u2019s New Approach to Asset Acquisitions, 42 Bus.
