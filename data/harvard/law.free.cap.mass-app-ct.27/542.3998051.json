In those complaints, the plaintiff, an inmate at M.C.I., Cedar Junction who is acting pro se, made numerous allegations centering on what he alleged was unlawful punishment imposed on him in connection with two \u201cvery minor\u201d infractions. The punishment on each occasion involved overnight lock-up of the plaintiff in his cell. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">The background facts are as follows. The first incident occurred on June 6, 1985, when the plaintiff and another inmate were placed in overnight lock-up for \u201chorseplaying.\u201d The plaintiff was confined to his cell at 3:30 that afternoon until sometime the next morning. Inmates are normally confined to their cells at 10:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">The second incident, which was the subject of the plaintiff\u2019s supplemental complaint, occurred on November 12, 1985. On that date, the plaintiff was stopped and questioned about \u201cbeing out of place\u201d because he was in another cellblock without permission. He was told by a senior correctional officer that a report would be written on the incident. The plaintiff claimed that he had gone to the other cellblock to obtain cigarettes. The shift commander subsequently placed the plaintiff on \u201cawaiting action status\u201d and confined him tc his cell early around 5:00 or 6:00 p.m. The plaintiff was released about 12:00 noon the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">The plaintiff admits both incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">1. <em>The plaintiffs allegations. </em>In connection with the \u201chorse-playing\u201d incident, the plaintiff\u2019s original complaint alleges that (1) \u201chorseplay\u201d is not conduct punishable under any prison regulation; (2) overnight lock-up was an impermissible sanction under the regulations; and (3) the lock-up was imposed in retaliation for his earlier complaint about the use of the prison\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>public address system. The complaint also alleges that the shift commander and correctional officer who are named as defendants violated the plaintiff\u2019s due process rights in violation of the State Civil Rights Act, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I, and that the Commissioner of Correction and the superintendent of M.C.I., Cedar Junction, \u201cwere so negligent and careless in their duty to monitor the actions of their subordinate personnel\u201d that they also violated the plaintiff\u2019s civil rights under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In connection with the incident of \u201cbeing out of place,\u201d the plaintiffs supplemental complaint alleges that his placement on \u201cawaiting action status\u201d constituted unlawful \u201csummary punishment\u201d which improperly deprived him of 3.5 hours of pay for prison work, free time, the use of the law library and use of the telephone to call his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">As to both incidents, the plaintiff\u2019s complaints sought a declaratory judgment stating that \u201cthe defendants\u2019 acts, policies, and practices\u201d violated his right to due process and various other Federal and State constitutional and statutory provisions. The complaints also requested compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">2. <em>Applicable regulations. </em>Before examining the plaintiff\u2019s claims, we outline the regulations which governed the discipline of inmates in 1985, when the incidents occurred.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under these regulations, inmate infractions were classified as \u201cvery minor,\u201d \u201cminor\u201d or \u201cmajor.\u201d Depending on the type of infraction, correctional officials could resort to informal or formal disciplinary action. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.08 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">As to \u201cvery minor\u201d infractions, correctional officials had discretion to \u201cissue a warning and handle the matter informally,\u201d if they \u201creasonably believe[d]\u201d that formal disciplinary action was unnecessary., 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.08(1) (1978). The record contains a note dated April 2, 1980, which may have circulated among some of the prison personnel and which read, \u201cWhen an employee reasonably believes that formal disciplinary action for an incident is not necessary he/she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>may issue a warning or lock the inmate in overnight status. This is handling the incident informally.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The regulations did not define \u201cvery minor,\u201d \u201cminor\u201d or \u201cmajor\u201d infractions. However, they contained a \u201cCode of Disciplinary Offenses\u201d which specifically identified thirty-one acts as bases for punishment. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.22 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The regulations further provided that a correctional official could decide that \u201cinformal handling\u201d of an offense was inappropriate. In th\u00e1t case, the correctional official was required to prepare and file a disciplinary report with the shift commander before the completion of the official\u2019s tour of duty. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.08(2) (1978). After prompt review of that report, the shift commander could either dismiss the report, forward it to the disciplinary officer for disciplinary action, or handle the matter informally by treating it as a \u201cvery minor\u201d incident. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.08(3)(a), (b), (c) (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">With regard to matters referred to him, the disciplinary officer, after an investigation, could dismiss the report, take no immediate action, or proceed with formal disciplinary action. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.09(1), (a), (b), (c) (1978). If formal disciplinary action was chosen, the disciplinary officer had to designate the offense as either a \u201cminor or major matter\u201d with reference to certain enumerated standards. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.09(2) and (3)(a)-(d) (1978). Once an incident was designated as a \u201cminor or major matter,\u201d formal procedures were required. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 430.10 and 430.11 (1978). Penalties for these matters can be severe. Finally, adjudications of guilt by the disciplinary board in connection with such incidents could be appealed to the superintendent. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.18(1) (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The regulations also permitted an inmate to be placed in detention on \u201cawaiting action status.\u201d This status is preliminary to one of four other events: (1) a disciplinary hearing, (2) an investigation of a possible disciplinary offense, (3) a change in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>the status of the inmate\u2019s custody, or (4) isolation when the inmate\u2019s presence in the general population poses a serious threat. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.19(1) (1978). An inmate held in detention on \u201cawaiting action status\u201d had his confinement reviewed weekly. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.19(2) (1978). See <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. 425, 429-430 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">3. <em>Due process concerns. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s principal argument, which underlies all his other contentions, is that the regulatory scheme outlined above for the handling of \u201cvery minor\u201d incidents violates an inmate\u2019s rights to procedural due process because it makes the correctional officer judge and jury. We deal with this argument first.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539 (1974), the due process rights of inmates in connection with the administration of prison discipline was discussed at length. In that case, the Court concluded that certain elements of procedural due process must be afforded to inmates when the punishment for an infraction committed in prison alters either the inmate\u2019s term of confinement (for example, by the forfeiture or the withholding of good time credits) or represents a major change in the conditions of his confinement. 418 U.S. at 571-572 n.19. However, the Court noted that the procedures prescribed in the decision to satisfy procedural due process requirements would not necessarily apply to the imposition of other sanctions which did not affect the term or nature of the inmate\u2019s confinement. <em>Ibid. </em>Before due process rights are triggered, it must appear that the sanction imposed on the inmate interferes with some protected liberty interest. Put another way, a sanction which does not work a significant deprivation of an inmate\u2019s rights may be imposed summarily for a very minor infraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">On two separate occasions, the plaintiff was locked in his cell a few hours earlier than usual for incidents he has admitted. He was released at or before 12:00 noon the next day. Although the plaintiff apparently lost time from work, and missed some free time during which he could have used the prison library or transacted personal business, the sanction of the overnight lock-up which was imposed on each occasion was within per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>missible constitutional limits. The sanction did not affect the plaintiff\u2019s term of confinement or make a major change in his condition of confinement. See <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>625 F.2d 750, 750-751 (6th Cir. 1980) (three days of \u201ctop lock\u201d isolation imposed on the plaintiff as a penalty for failure to stop playing cards when he was told to do so did not raise a constitutional issue even though it involved the plaintiff\u2019s separation from the prison population and the cessation of normal privileges); <em>Greene </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. Safety &amp; Correctional Serv., </em>68 Md. App. 147, 157 (1986) (maximum punishment of confinement of the inmate to his cell for the balance of the work shift or no more than eight hours was not a \u201csubstantial deprivation\" and invaded no liberty interest). We can identify no other liberty interest that might be involved in the case as a result of the short deprivation of access to other parts of the prison imposed on the plaintiff. Cf. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Fair, </em>846 F.2d 811, 815-817 (1st Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Further, there is nothing in the regulations themselves which created a liberty interest in the sense of prescribing a mandatory procedure which was not followed. Contrast <em>Maldonado Santiago </em>v. <em>Velazquez Garcia, </em>821 F.2d 822, 827 (1st Cir. 1987). The regulations imparted to correctional officials reasonable discretion to decide whether a particular infraction should be considered as \u201cvery minor\u201d and consequently handled informally or whether it should be considered more serious and handled in a manner which required compliance with a prescribed formal process. By handling an infraction informally, correctional officials had available a sanction which could not exceed an overnight lock-up.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The division of infractions into \u201cvery minor,\u201d \u201cminor\u201d and \u201cmajor,\u201d and how they were handled, permitted flexibility as to an appropriate sanction based on the gravity of the infraction. The limitation on the sanction that could be imposed for a \u201cvery minor\u201d infraction ensured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>that the inmate would not be subjected to any deprivation inconsistent with the normal limits of his custody. We conclude that the plan for the handling of \u201cvery minor\u201d infractions fell within the \u201cwide-ranging deference\u201d which courts must accord to prison administrators in the \u201cadoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.\u201d <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 547 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">4. <em>Remaining contentions. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s other arguments do not require extended discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">(a) Although \u201chorseplaying\u201d is not specifically enumerated in 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.22 (1978) as a disciplinary offense, we believe it is encompassed within \u201c[cjonduct which disrupts or interferes with the security or orderly running of the institution,\u201d which is set forth as a specific offense at \u00a7 430.22(8). By definition, \u201chorseplay\u201d usually involves rough and disorderly conduct which can very easily escalate into a fight or other major type of disruption. The plaintiff admits to engaging in \u201chorseplay.\u201d We conclude that the correctional official who saw the incident could have treated it as a \u201cvery minor\u201d infraction which warranted overnight lock-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">(b) The second incident involved the plaintiff \u201cbeing out of place,\u201d which is a specifically designated infraction. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.22(4) (1978). The plaintiff admits the incident. We see no basis to find that his confinement to his cell and placement on \u201cawaiting action status\u201d violated any regulation. That status was invoked so that a prompt investigation could be conducted to ascertain whether the plaintiff\u2019s presence in another cellblock was for a purpose other than obtaining cigarettes. 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.19(1) (1978). A possibly serious matter of prison security was involved. The plaintiff was released by 12:00 noon the next day, and the matter ended. Had he not been released, compliance with 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430:19(2) (1978) would have been necessary. The prison authorities were warranted in their action, and the disposition of the incident was in compliance with the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">(c) There is nothing in the record to indicate that, in dealing with either incident, the correctional officials acted arbitrarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>or in a vindictive manner. Therefore, as applied, the regulations impinged on no protected right of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">(d) It follows from what has been said thus far that nothing has been shown to require further proceedings against any of the defendants in connection with the plaintiff\u2019s claims under the State Civil Rights Act, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">(e) As is often the case in pro se litigation, the record contains a morass of papers, many of them lacking any definite relevance to the claims. In 1985, at the time the complaints were brought, the practice of the Attorney General representing correctional officials was to respond to an action by an inmate under G. L. c. 231A by filing a document called an \u201cOpposition To Petition For Declaratory Relief,\u201d rather than a responsive pleading in conformance with the Rules of Civil Procedure. See <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 399 (1988) (criticizing this practice). Based upon the \u201cOpposition\u201d and other papers on file, it was clear that the defendants actively contested the case. The judge\u2019s refusal to default the defendants for not responding to the complaints sooner than they did, or in a clearer manner, was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b570-9\"> These regulations are contained in 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 430.07 through 430.23 (1978), which were promulgated pursuant to the authority contained in G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 <em>1(b), (i) </em>and <em>(q), </em>and G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 33.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\"> The record does not disclose anything about the source of this notice. The defendant makes an essentially unfocused argument that the notice had no authorized basis. In the view we take of the case nothing of substance turns on the validity of the notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b573-6\"> We do not agree with the plaintiff that correctional officials are limited to a warning in dealing with \u201cvery minor\u201d incidents. A reasonable reading of the regulations satisfies us that an overnight lock-up could be imposed when it was determined that a particular incident should be dealt with in an informal manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
