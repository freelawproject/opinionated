The concession is well taken. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>403 Mass. 489, 493 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>The defendant was convicted under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, as appearing in St. 1980, c. 409, of \u201cderiv[ing] support or maintenance . . . from the earnings or proceeds of [a person\u2019s] prostitution,\u201d knowing the person to be a prostitute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She claims that as the statute is directed against pimping, her conduct did not fall within its ambit, and that she was, therefore, entitled to a required finding of not guilty. After examining the statute and reviewing the record, we agree with the defendant and order that judgment be entered for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 7, set forth in the appendix, is meant to deal with the \u201cpimp or purveyor,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and makes the crime a felony. It sets a much more severe penalty than does either G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, or G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53A, also set forth in the appendix, under which prostitution, a misdemeanor, may be punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">We look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. The defendant and a woman whom we shall call Dorothy (a fictitious name) were living together with two other women, Laura and Beth (also fictitious names), in Laura\u2019s apartment. Dorothy, as the defendant knew, was a prostitute using her earnings to support a cocaine habit. The defendant had a car and often drove Dorothy to various places. During October, 1988 and much of November, Dorothy usually hitched a ride from other persons to the street where she worked in downtown Brockton. Sometimes, she asked the defendant to drive her downtown and, during that period, the defendant did so about two or three times a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Usually, the defendant dropped Dorothy off and left, but a few times, at Dorothy\u2019s request, she returned and picked her up. On a few occasions, Dorothy asked the defendant to stay and wait for her in the car. Some other prostitutes had threatened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Dorothy\u2019s life and she was afraid. She thought that, in the event of an attack, the defendant could either come to her aid or drive her away.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">During the last week of November and the first few days of December (both women were arrested on December 3, 1988), Dorothy asked the defendant to wait in her car every night. At this time, Dorothy was making between two and three hundred dollars a night from about five to ten \u201cdates.\u201d After each date she returned to the car and put the money in the glove compartment so that it would not be lost if she were attacked or arrested. Dorothy testified that the money was her own and not the defendant\u2019s, and that the defendant had \u201cnothing to do with [her] prostitution business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Dorothy gave the defendant five or ten dollars \u201cevery once in a while\u201d as gas money and may have once given her twenty dollars. There was no arrangement to give the defendant money and most of Dorothy\u2019s money went to support her cocaine habit, which cost her two hundred dollars a day. Dorothy sometimes gave the defendant some cocaine, but that \u201creally wasn\u2019t her drug.\u201d There was no testimony that the defendant was a drug addict or had a habit to support.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">On December 1, 1988, Officer McClaren of the Brockton police saw the defendant waiting in her car while two other women were \u201cworking\u201d the street comer. While he watched, a male subject would stop, one of the two women would go to the defendant\u2019s car, have a conversation and then get into the [male\u2019s] motor vehicle, \u201cleave for approximately five to ten minutes\u201d and then return to the defendant\u2019s car where they would converse with her. On December 3, he saw Dorothy first converse with the defendant and then enter a car, where she engaged in sexual acts with a male subject. After arresting both Dorothy and the male, the officer went to the defendant in her car. She stated she was there to use the telephone, although the officer testified that there is no phone in that parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">The Commonwealth urges that, since the defendant derived a financial benefit from prostitution,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> her activities fell within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>the pimping statute. She aided and abetted Dorothy by driving her to and from work and waiting for her while she plied her trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">These activities, however, do not constitute the actions of a \u201cpimp\u201d as the term is ordinarily used. In Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1033 (5th ed. 1979), \u201cpimp\u201d is defined as \u201c[o]ne who obtains customers (\u2018tricks\u2019) for a whore or prostitute.\u201d Similar definitions are found in standard dictionaries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cWhile the title to an act cannot control the provisions of the statute, the title may be used for the purpose of ascertaining its proper limitations.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>388 Mass. 115, 120 (1983). In the context of its purpose, to punish the \u201cpimp or purveyor,\u201d whose activities were considered by the Legislature more egregious than prostitution, we think that the furnishing of transportation and waiting in exchange for occasional gas money and drugs by a friend (male or female) does not come within the prohibition of \u201cderiv[ing] support or maintenance in whole or in part from the earnings of [a person\u2019s] prostitution.\u201d The defendant\u2019s activities are not what is commonly viewed as pimping.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Moreover, if G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, were construed to cover any financial benefit, as the Commonwealth suggests, questions of due process might be implicated: the statute may \u201cfail[ ] to provide a reasonable opportunity for a person of ordinary intelligence to know what is prohibited . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jasmin, </em>396 Mass. 653, 655 (1986). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Love, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 541, 545 (1988). The literal language of the statute would cover persons who sold food and clothing to a prostitute and would also cover the acceptance by the mother of a prostitute of a gift from her daughter. Here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>the defendant at most could be viewed as aiding and abetting Dorothy\u2019s activities, and perhaps could also be charged as a joint venturer with Dorothy, but she did not, we conclude, engage in pimping.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">We decline to adopt the literal construction (\u201cfinancial benefit\u201d) urged by the Commonwealth. See <em>Lexington </em>v. <em>Bedford, </em>378 Mass. 562, 570 (1979) (\u201ca literal construction of statutory language will not be adopted when such a construction will lead to an absurd and unreasonable conclusion\u201d). Courts elsewhere, albeit in construing somewhat different statutory language, support by implication the result we have reached. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>51 Mont. 390, 393 (1915); <em>People </em>v. <em>Fegelli, </em>163 A.D. 576, 579 (N.Y. 1914). Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lund, </em>75 Utah 559, 563-564 (1930); <em>State </em>v. <em>Columbus, </em>74 Wash. 290, 297 (1913); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>88 Wash. 210, 212 (1915).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The judgment is reversed, and the finding is set aside.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lightfoot, </em>391 Mass. 718, 721 (1984). As put by Judge Learned Hand, the task of statutory interpretation is \u201cthe proliferation of purpose.\u201d Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum.L.Rev. 527, 529 (1947).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b811-9\"> The Commonwealth argues that Dorothy supplied the defendant with drugs as well as occasional gas money.
