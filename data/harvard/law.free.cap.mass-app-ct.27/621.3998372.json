More than a year later, the plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking, among other things, declaratory relief and alleging constitutional violations by the board. The board moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the complaint was not timely filed. Their motion was allowed, and the plaintiffs appeal from the ensuing judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The thrust of the board\u2019s argument is that, contrary to the required procedure set forth in 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.25 (1986),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the complaint was not brought within thirty days of February 5, 1987, the date of the decision of the board. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, point to 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.09 (1986),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as indicating that the regulations do not prescribe a specific method or time period for judicial review. According to the plaintiffs, the gist of their complaint is that the board discriminated against them in rejecting their permit application,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> while granting the applications of other permit seekers similarly situated; therefore, the entire action should be governed by the three-year statute of limitations for civil rights claims. We affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">We summarize, occasionally quoting, the allegations of the complaint. In October, 1981, Buff, the owner of the parcel, applied for a permit for a proposed sewage disposal system. The board\u2019s regulations (which were stricter than the provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>of the State Environmental Code) required a minimum distance of 200 feet between any sewage facility and a domestic well. Although Buff\u2019s proposed system was only 110 feet from an on-site well and 192 feet from an off-site well, the board waived its 200-foot requirement and granted Buff a disposal works construction permit. Buff, however, delayed development of his parcel, and the permit lapsed in October, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Approximately three years later, Buff entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Rosenfeld. In August, 1986, Rosenfeld applied for a disposal permit showing the facility located in the same area as Buff\u2019s prior application. The distance between the proposed facility and the on-site well was approximately 102 feet and the distance from the off-site well was approximately 175 feet. In support of his application, Rosenfeld submitted to the board a report from a firm of environmental scientists stating that the proposed system met all the requirements of the State Environmental Code and that the system would not have an adverse effect on the environment. The board, \u201cdespite the absence of any basis to support denial,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on February 5, 1987, denied the application on the purported ground that Rosenfeld had failed to satisfy the requirements for a waiver of the 200-foot separation requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Based on the foregoing allegations, the plaintiffs, in count I of their complaint, sought a declaration that the board\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence and that they are entitled both to a waiver from the 200-foot separation requirement and a disposal works permit. In counts II and III, they sought relief in the nature of certiorari on the ground of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>\u201ca substantial error of law, apparent on the record.\u201d After alleging that an abutter and, \u201cupon information and belief, other property owners in the Town of Chilmark have obtained successive renewals of... permits after submitting information equivalent to or less than that provided by Rosenfeld,\u201d they sought, in count IV, damages from the individual members of the board because their \u201cintentional, arbitrary, and capricious refusal to grant Rosenfeld a . . . permit constitutes a violation of both plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process rights as protected by the Massachusetts and United States Constitutions and by G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I.\u201d Referring to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982), they asserted in count V that the refusal of a permit constituted a violation of the plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process rights under the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">1. <em>Claim for declaratory relief. </em>\u201cWhen a direct and distinct path of review is available,\u201d it is not appropriate to grant declaratory relief in the absence of special circumstances, particularly where the action seeks to circumvent the time period prescribed for a direct appeal. <em>New England Milk Dealers Assn., Inc., </em>v. <em>Department of Food &amp; Agriculture, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 705, 709 (1986). <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Burlington, </em>347 Mass. 320, 326 (1964). <em>School Comm. of Franklin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Educ., </em>395 Mass. 800, 807-808 (1985). The board says 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 15.25 (1986) is such a \u201cdirect and distinct\u201d path of review. The plaintiffs deny its applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">We turn to 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 11.00 et seq. (1986) and to \u00a7\u00a7 15.00 et seq. (1986). As authorized by G. L. c. 21A, \u00a7 13, these regulations were issued by the Department of Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE) as the \u201cState Environmental Code\u201d (Code). The first part (\u00a7\u00a7 11.00 et seq.), appearing under the heading \u201cGeneral Application and Administration Environmental Code, Title 1,\u201d sets no substantive standards. Among other things it permits local health authorities to adopt regulations \u201ccontaining requirements stricter than those contained\u201d in the Code (\u00a7 11.02), provides for methods of inspection and enforcement, for hearings, for appeals, and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>variances.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Title 1 also includes an appeal provision, \u00a7 11.09 set forth in note 3, <em>supra. </em>Sections 12.00-14.00 are reserved for future promulgation.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Sections 15.00 et seq. are entitled \u201cMinimum Requirements for the Subsurface Disposal of Sanitary Sewage State Environmental Code, Title 5.\u201d Part I of Title 5 lists, under the heading \u201cPart 1: Substantive Provisions,\u201d numerous requirements for septic tanks, leaching fields etc. and, in its preamble, recognizes that specific local conditions may require more stringent regulation to protect the public health and the environment. Under the heading \u201cPart II Enforcement,\u201d the first section is entitled \u201c\u00a7 15.20 Variance,\u201d and the section permits the board of health to vary any of the provisions of Title 5.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 15.22, subtitled \u201cGeneral Enforcement,\u201d states that the provisions of Title 1 shall govern the enforcement of Title 5 as supplemented by the regulations which follow. Among those is \u00a7 15.25, set out in note 2, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that \u00a7 15.25 applies only to appeals from orders punishing violations of Title 5, and does not apply to appeals from grants or denials of variances under that Title, we construe the provision to apply to any appeal under Title 5. The variance provisions of Title 5, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>we view as encompassing the board\u2019s regulations, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>are an integral portion of the enforcement provisions of Title 5. Even the placement of \u00a7 15.20 as the first section within the enforcement part of the Title refutes the plaintiffs\u2019 assertions. Accordingly, we hold that an appeal from the denial or the grant of a variance from the provisions of Title 5 is governed by the thirty-day limitation period of \u00a7 15.25. Since \u201ca direct and distinct path of review\u201d is available, declaratory relief is not. <em>New England Milk Dealers </em>Assn., <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Food &amp; Agriculture, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. at 709. No special circumstances appearing, the dismissal of count I was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">2. <em>Action in the nature of certiorari. </em>Dismissal of counts II and III was correct because an action in the nature of certiorari lies only where there is no other available remedy. See <em>Garden Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>District Court of Somerville, </em>336 Mass. 432, 434 (1957). In any event, the counts are time barred by G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, as amended by St. 1986, c. 95, which requires that an action in the nature of certiorari \u201cbe commenced within sixty days next after the proceeding complained of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">3. <em>Claims of constitutional violations. </em>Assuming, without deciding, that a three-year statute of limitations applies to these claims,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> there was no error in their dismissal as the allegations do not support a claim for relief under the State or Federal, civil rights acts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">To establish a claim under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, a plaintiff must allege and prove both that the \u201c \u2018exercise or enjoyment of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the United States, or of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the commonwealth, has been interfered with, or attempted to be interfered with,\u2019 G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I (inserted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>St. 1979, c. 801, \u00a7 1), and... that the interference or attempted interference was by \u2018threats, intimidation or coercion.\u2019 G. L. c. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H, 11I\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Appleton </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>397 Mass. 812, 817 (1986). Since the complaint fails to allege any conduct by anyone that could be considered a \u201cthreat, intimidation or coercion,\u201d it fails to state a claim under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The plaintiffs, not having identified a Federal constitutional right of which they have been deprived, have not alleged violations of their substantive due process rights sufficient to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982). To assert such a right or interest, \u201ca necessary prerequisite to a fourteenth amendment due process claim,\u201d <em>Cote </em>v. <em>Seaman, </em>625 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1989), the plaintiffs must show that they have a \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement\u201d to the variance they seek. Cf. <em>Roslindale Motor Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>405 Mass. 79, 82 (1989). The greater the discretion given to a governmental body in issuing the permit, variance, or license, the \u201cless likely it is that citizens have a property interest in obtaining\u201d it. <em>Id. </em>at 83. See <em>RRI Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Southampton, </em>870 F.2d 911, 915 (2d Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Under \u00a7 15.20 of the Code, the board may grant a variance from the board\u2019s regulations, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>when, \u201cin its opinion (1) the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice; and (2) the applicant has proved that the same degree of environmental protection required under this Title can be achieved without strict application of the particular provision.\u201d The Code thus gives broad discretion to the board based on the strong public interest in protecting health and the environment. When viewed in light of the degree of discretion lodged in the board, the facts alleged in the complaint do not set forth a \u201cproperty\u201d interest. See <em>Cote </em>v. <em>Seaman, </em>625 F.2d at 2 (no \u201cproperty\u201d interest in approval by planning board of the plaintiffs\u2019 plans).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Even if, contrary to the scheme of the Code, a property interest under State law were asserted, the denial of the variance because of \u201carbitrary misapplication of state law\u201d by the board does not allege the denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 procedural or sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>stantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. See <em>Creative Environments, Inc. </em>v. <em>Estabrook, </em>680 F.2d 822, 829, 831-832 &amp; n.9 (1st Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 989 (1982) (planning board permit); <em>Chiplin Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>712 F.2d 1524, 1527 (1st Cir. 1983) (building permit). See also <em>Weimer </em>v. <em>Amen, </em>870 F.2d 1400, 1405-1406 (8th Cir. 1989). \u201cThe existence of an adequate state remedy to redress property damage inflicted by state officers avoids the conclusion that there has been any constitutional deprivation of property without due process of law within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Parratt </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 542 (1981), quoting with approval <em>Bonner </em>v. <em>Coughlin, </em>517 F.2d 1311, 1319 (7th Cir. 1975), (Stevens, J.), modified en banc, 545 F.2d 565 (1976), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 932 (1978). This is not a case where it is alleged that the State procedures themselves are fundamentally flawed or \u201cwhere the defendant\u2019s] alleged conduct is so egregious that \u2018it \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d [as in <em>Miga </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>398 Mass. 343, 352-354 (1986)].\u2019\u201d <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Marlborough Div. of the Dist. Court Dept., </em>395 Mass. 117, 130-131 (1985). \u201c[T]he ordinary state administrative proceeding involving land use or zoning does not present [a violation of a Federal constitutional right], regardless of how disappointed the license or privilege seeker may feel at being . . . turned down.\u201d <em>Creative Environments, Inc. </em>v. <em>Estabrook, </em>680 F.2d at 832 n.9. <em>Chiplin Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>712 F.2d at 1527, 1528. <em>Raskiewicz </em>v. <em>New Boston, </em>754 F.2d 38, 44 n.4 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 845 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Thus, the alleged \u201cintentional, arbitrary and capricious refusal to grant Rosenfeld a disposal permit\u201d does not implicate the Federal Constitution and does not provide a basis for a \u00a7 1983 action. See <em>Creative Environments, Inc. </em>v. <em>Estabrook, </em>680 F.2d at 831, 833. The claim remains \u201cunsupported by an allegation of the deprivation of a specific constitutional right\u201d and \u201csimply raises a matter of local concern,\u201d a matter fully reviewable under State law. <em>Chiplin Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>712 F.2d at 1527-1528. Compare <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>878 F.2d 523, 529-530 (1st Cir. 1989). The additional allegation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>that others similarly situated obtained permits is not, without more, a denial of the equal protection of the laws. Allegations of clear and intentional discrimination are required. See <em>Snowden </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>321 U.S. 1, 8 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">In sum, the dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim for relief was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b648-7\"> Section 15.25 provides: \u201cAny person aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Health or Department of Environmental Quality Engineering may seek relief therefrom within 30 days in any court of competent jurisdiction as provided by the laws of this Commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b648-8\"> Section 11.09 provides: \u201cAny person aggrieved by the final decision of the board of health with respect to the denial of plan approval, the denial of [szc] revocation or failure to renew a license, or with respect to any order issued under the provisions of this Code may seek relief therefrom in any court of competent jurisdiction, as provided by the laws of this Commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b648-9\"> The permit application was filed by Rosenfeld.

Because it would make no sense to allow a board of health power to vary the application of the Code, but not the application of its own regulations, or to apply a different limitation period for appeals from denials or grants of variances from the Code and for appeals from denials or grants of variances from the stricter local rules, we read the authority given to the board of health in \u00a7 15.20 to vary the application of the \u201cprovisions of this Title\u201d to include authority to give variances from the requirements imposed by its own local regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b651-9\"> Section 15.23 provides for the issuance of orders of compliance if examination reveals a failure to comply with Title 5.
