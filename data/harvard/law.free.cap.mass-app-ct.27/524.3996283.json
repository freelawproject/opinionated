The sole issue in this case is the construction of a tax escalation clause, Section 6 in a standard form commercial lease. We are asked to examine the so-called rent adjustment provision, which is set out in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and to focus specifically on the phrase \u201cin any one year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>The plaintiffs (the lessees here) leased for a ten-year period, commencing February 1, 1982, certain space in premises at 167 Newbury Street in Boston from the lessors, two of whom are now deceased. On October 28, 1982, the plaintiffs entered into a second lease for additional space in the same premises. The second lease contains a rent adjustment clause based upon a certain percentage of any increase in the real estate taxes levied against the premises. The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint sought a declaratory judgment that the effect of the clause was that the plaintiffs shall pay a maximum of $500 per year as their share of any real estate tax increase. Both parties moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Summary judgment is appropriate when there is \u201cno genuine issue of material fact.\u201d Mass.R.Civ.P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974). The interpretation of the terms of an unambiguous lease is a question of law to be decided by the court. <em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. </em>v. <em>Yanofsky, </em>380 Mass. 326, 334 (1980). The Superior Court judge concluded that the language in the clause was unambiguous and ruled that as matter of law \u201c[S]ection 6 of the lease is declared to mean that [the] plaintiffs shall pay a maximum of $500.00 per year non-cumulative as the lessee\u2019s share of any real estate tax increases.\u201d The judge\u2019s interpretation of the clause is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The defendants contend that the judge erred by giving no effect to the words \u201cin any one year\u201d when she interpreted Section 6 to mean that the increase was noncumulative. They cite, as do the plaintiffs, <em>Duane Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 899 (1979), as the controlling case on this issue. In <em>Duane, </em>the court construed the word \u201cannually\u201d in another tax escalation clause to mean that the tax increase was not cumulative. The court in dicta suggested that if a cumulative increase were intended in a clause such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>as Section 6 then the parties would have to provide some language such as \u201csaid increase shall not exceed $500 in any one year over the last preceding year.\u201d In so doing the court referred to two New York cases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The defendants contend that the clause at issue in this case and the one in the <em>Oceantown </em>case, cited in <em>Duane Realty, </em>are, as the Superior Court judge noted, similar. See <em>Duane Realty Corp., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. at 900. A close reading of the <em>Oceantown </em>case, however, reveals that the decision there that the increase was cumulative turned on the construction of the term \u201csuccessive year,\u201d not on the term \u201cin any one year.\u201d <em>Oceantown Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., supra </em>at 503-504. Cf. <em>Westbury Post Ave. Associates </em>v. <em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., </em>46 App. Div. 2d 860 (1974), aff\u2019d, 38 N.Y.2d 890 (1976) (\u201cprevious year\u201d). A clause containing language basing the increase on the prior year\u2019s tax rate may be construed so as to operate cumulatively. See, e.g., <em>Oceantown Realty Corp., supra </em>at504. <em>Contrast Duane Realty Corp., supra. </em>However, where, as here, the clause fixes a base year tax \u2014 fiscal year 1981 \u2014 and tacks on a maximum annual liability of $500 in any one year, the additional rent is noncumulative. See and contrast <em>Oceantown Realty Corp., supra. </em>The judge correctly ruled that as matter of law the clause was not cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Deciding as we do, we find it unnecessary to credit or rely upon deposition testimony that two of the lessors, both now deceased, billed and accepted payments of $500 per year under the tax clause for the two years immediately preceding this dispute. Likewise, we see no need to comment on the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the original parties to the lease intended that the amount to be paid each year was not to exceed $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b550-16\"> Section 6 of the lease provides: \u201cThe LESSEE shall pay to the LESSOR as additional rent <em>50% </em>per cent [szc] of any increase in real estate taxes levied against the land and building, of which the leased premises are a part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>over those incurred or levied during the calender year ending <em>fiscal yr. 1981. </em>This increase shall be prorated should this lease terminate before the end of the calender year. The LESSEE shall make payments within thirty (30) days of written notice from the LESSOR that such operating expenses, or increased taxes, are payable by the LESSOR. <em>However, said increase shall not exceed $500. in any one year during the term of this lease.\u201d </em>The typewritten language inserted by the parties to the lease is emphasized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\"><em> Oceantown Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac.
