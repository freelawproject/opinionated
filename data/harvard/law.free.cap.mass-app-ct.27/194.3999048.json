We think he does have that right and we affirm, therefore, a Superior Court judgment which, among other things, declared that the plaintiff, Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna), has a present obligation to arbitrate the defendant\u2019s demand for underinsurance benefits, notwithstanding the pendency of a claim against an individual allegedly liable for the injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Kevin Faris, a minor child of the defendant, suffered bodily injuries while he was a passenger in a rented car driven by his father, James Faris. Another car, operated by Linda Moniz, collided with the rented car. A tort action was brought on Kevin\u2019s behalf against both his father, James Faris, and Linda Moniz. With Aetna\u2019s written consent, settlement was reached with Linda Moniz for $10,000, the full amount of her insurance coverage. Coverage was also provided from the policy covering the rental car in the maximum amounts available for bodily injury, $10,000 for liability and $10,000 for underinsurance. Thus, a pool in the amount of $30,000 is now available to cover Kevin\u2019s injuries. The case alleging liability on the part of James Faris is still open. James Faris owns a car and has an Aetna policy providing coverage in the amount of $100,000 for liability and $100,000 for underinsurance. As a member of James Faris\u2019 household, Kevin may claim underinsurance benefits under the Aetna policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Aetna offered $10,000 to compensate Kevin for his injuries. This offer was refused, and a demand was made on Kevin\u2019s behalf for arbitration. Aetna refused to arbitrate and brought this action seeking both a preliminary injunction and a declaration that the demand for arbitration, prior to the exhaustion of all claims for liability insurance proceeds, was premature.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The Aetna policy provided underinsurance benefits consistent with the requirements of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>stated: \u201cSometimes an owner or operator of an auto legally responsible for an accident is . . . underinsured. . . . We will pay only if the injured person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of the . . . underinsured . . . auto. . . . We consider an auto to be underinsured if the insurance, bonds or self-insurance covering the auto or operator is not sufficient to pay for the damage sustained by the injured person.\u201d The policy went on to provide: \u201cThe determination as to whether an injured person is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or operator of a responsible auto will be by agreement between us and the injured person. The amount of the damages, if any, will be determined in the same way. Arbitration will be used if no agreement can be reached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A8f\">The arbitration clause in Aetna\u2019s policy, on its face, applies to the dispute in its current phase. Aetna and the defendant do not agree as to James Faris\u2019 liability nor to the amount of Kevin\u2019s damages. There is nothing in the underinsurance statute or the policy terms expressly requiring exhaustion of claims against alleged tortfeasors prior to arbitration. To the contrary, the liability and damage issues involved in claims for uninsured motorist benefits, which for these purposes are analogous, are routinely decided by arbitration. See <em>Employers\u2019 Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Garney, </em>348 Mass. 627, 631-632 (1965); <em>McGovern </em>v. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co., </em>359 Mass. 443, 445 (1971); <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Poirier, </em>371 Mass. 257, 261 (1976). See also G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 111D. Where parties agree to have their disputes resolved through arbitration \u2014 generally a procedure providing the advantages of speed, convenience, and low cost and guaranteeing neutrality \u2014 the policy considerations for enforcing the agreement are strong. Certainly an arbitrator, with the power under G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 7, to subpoena witnesses and documents, would be competent to resolve the factual issues involved in the claim for underinsurance benefits under the Aetna policy: whether James Faris was negligent and, if so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>whether that negligence was a proximate cause of the accident; and the extent of Kevin\u2019s bodily injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Aetna contends that, notwithstanding the absence of an express exhaustion requirement in the underinsurance statute and their insurance policy, the scheme of both implicitly requires that claims against alleged tortfeasors be resolved before the parties resort to arbitration. Underinsurance benefits, Aetna argues, are due under the statute and their policy only if the tortfeasors\u2019 policies are insufficient in limits of liability to satisfy the damages. It follows, they say, that the liability and damage issues must be resolved before it can be known whether the claimant has the right to any underinsurance benefits. The parties agreed in the policy, however, that an arbitrator could decide the questions of liability and damages. To the extent that the arbitration might precede in time an inconsistent judicial resolution of a tort claim, the insurer is either protected by its subrogation rights in the policy and the statute (G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L [4]) or the result is but an inevitable consequence of the selection of a procedure that has numerous advantages to all parties. Were we to adopt Aetna\u2019s interpretation, the potential advantages flowing from the presence of the arbitration clause \u2014 speed, efficiency, and cost \u2014 would be entirely thwarted. We assume that in requiring underinsurance coverage, the Legislature was concerned with protecting victims of automobile accidents not only against the possibility of \u201ccatastrophic financial loss\u201d <em>(Cardin </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. of America, </em>394 Mass. 450, 454 [1985]), but also from the possibility of unreasonably delayed insurance settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Although the rule that arbitration may be demanded before exhaustion of all potential liability claims is not uniform, and although governing statutes and policy provisions vary from State to State, there is support elsewhere for the rule we adopt. See, e.g., <em>Detroit Auto. Inter-Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Spafford, </em>62 Mich. App. 365, 368 (1975); <em>Dunshee </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>303 Minn. 473, 484 (1975); <em>Mendelson </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., </em>285 Ore. 269, 272 (1979).
