The case is before us on a statement of agreed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-15\">The plaintiff, a fifty-five year old navy veteran, had worked for twenty-four years in various Massachusetts public schools as a teacher, guidance counselor, psychologist, and adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>trator of special education.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On September 7, 1982, he had been appointed by the school committee of Chelsea for a one-year term to the position of administrator of special education for the Chelsea school department. On April 7, 1983, and again on April 12, 1984, the plaintiff was reappointed to this position for one-year terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">On March 8, 1985, the plaintiff, up for his fourth consecutive one-year term (and thus tenure status),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> received an evaluation by the school superintendent stating that the plaintiff was not being recommended for reappointment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The evaluation was shown to and signed by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">\u201cOfficial notice\u201d advising the plaintiff of the superintendent\u2019s recommendation of nonreappointment and that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cfinal day of employment in the Chelsea School System would be the last day of the 1984/1985 School year\u201d was sent by certified mail to the plaintiff\u2019s residence on April 10, 1985.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A copy of the letter also was delivered to the plaintiff\u2019s school office the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>The plaintiff last worked as the administrator of special education on June 26, 1985.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The parties agree that the plaintiff did not voluntarily resign, retire, or leave his position as administrator of special education and neither the superintendent nor the school committee sent or filed with the Teachers\u2019 Retirement Board any written notice containing a fair summary of facts about the action taken with respect to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">A Superior Court judge rendered judgment for the defendants concluding that the \u201cnonrenewal\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s appointment did not constitute a \u201cremoval or discharge\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2), as appearing in St. 1982, c. 630, \u00a7 21, nor a deprivation of any constitutionally protected liberty or property interest. The judge also found that the superintendent\u2019s March 8, 1985, written evaluation was sufficient notice to the plaintiff under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, particularly in light of the superintendent\u2019s attempts to give the plaintiff further notice prior to the April 15, 1985, deadline prescribed by that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">1. Pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2), a \u201cveteran [who] has completed ten or more years of creditable service\u201d or a member of the contributory retirement system \u201cwho has completed twenty or more years of creditable service\u201d is entitled to a \u201cwritten notice . . . containing a fair summary of the facts\u201d as well as a hearing<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> if such person was \u201cremov[ed] or dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>charge[d].\u201d As no such notice was given to the plaintiff, the dispositive issue is whether the plaintiff was \u201cremoved or discharged\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 16 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Section 16 (2) is a provision found within G. L. c. 32 \u2014 a chapter \u201cestablishing] a single contributory retirement law for public employees.\u201d St. 1945, c. 658. The chapter \u201crepresents an attempt to collect most of the statutes regulating a large number and variety of separate and distinct contributory and noncontributory retirement and pension systems for public employees.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Brockton </em>v. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>393 Mass. 256, 261 (1984), quoting from <em>Bianchi </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Somerville, </em>359 Mass. 642, 647 (1971). In addition to the requirement of notice and a fair summary of the facts, \u00a7 16 (2) empowers the retirement board to reinstate a \u201cremove[d] or discharge[d]\u201d member if such removal or discharge was not \u201cjustified.\u201d See <em>Campana </em>v. <em>Board of Directors of the Mass. Housing Fin. Agency, </em>399 Mass. 492, 493 (1987).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The plaintiff argues that the Legislature must have intended the terms \u201cremoval\u201d and \u201cdischarge\u201d in \u00a7 16 (2) to have separate and distinct meanings as it would otherwise have been superfluous to use both terms.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Noting that the term \u201cdischarge\u201d is defined in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1 (note 9, <em>supra), </em>as a \u201cpermanent, involuntary separation . . . , from . . . employment,\u201d the plaintiff argues that the term \u201cremoval,\u201d albeit similarly indicating a separation or severance from employment, encompasses a much broader range of actions and should be understood as \u201cany form of involuntary ousting from an employed position, or any nontemporary termination of employment and earnings. \u201d As such, he contends that the elimination of payment, the failure to offer reassignment or mention any recall or re-em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>ployment possibilities, and the appointment of a replacement all had \u201cthe formal legal effect\u201d of a \u201cremoval\u201d thereby entitling him to the notice required by \u00a7 16 (2). Contrast <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>397 Mass. 255 (1986). We disagree. The words \u201cremoval\u201d and \u201cdischarge\u201d connote the termination of employment of a person who has a continuing right to it, not the failure to rehire someone who has to be renominated and reappointed every year.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s position suffers in light of the annual renewal or nonrenewal aspect of his nontenured employment. Initially, it should be noted that the plaintiff was first \u201cappointed\u201d to the position of administrator of special education for a one-year (school) term. As a nontenured administrator (contrast G. L. c. 42A) under a yearly contract, the plaintiff was subject to annual evaluation and \u201creelection\u201d or \u201cre-appointment\u201d (or non-reelection or nonreappointment) by means of a recommendation of the superintendent and the affirmative vote of the school committee. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 38. What happened was not a firing or dismissal midway through the plaintiff\u2019s term but rather a choice for a future term undertaken by the school superintendent as part of his yearly appraisal of nontenured personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Further support for the proposition that the plaintiff was not \u201cremove[d] or discharge^]\u201d can be found in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10, as amended through St. 1984, c. 473, \u00a7 1, and in an earlier version of \u00a7 16 (2) itself. Specifically, in \u00a7 10, which governs the right of a contributory retirement system member to a \u201csuperannuation retirement allowance,\u201d the terms \u201cremoved or discharged,\u201d \u201cfails of nomination or reelection,\u201d or \u201cfails of reappointment\u201d are all set forth as distinct terms. See Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12 at 88 (1974) (section 10 of c. 32 applies to all members of the State employee\u2019s retirement system who \u201cfail of reappointment\u201d and not merely to individuals failing of reappointment by the Governor). Fundamental to statutory construction is the principle that \u201cwhere the Legislature has employed specific language in one paragraph but not in another, the language should not be implied where it is not present.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Brockton, </em>393 Mass. at 263, quoting from <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 616 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Similarly, a previous amendment to \u00a7 16 (2) \u2014 St. 1949, c. 746, \u00a7 2 \u2014 added the words \u201cof failure of reappointment\u201d following each appearance of the words \u201cremoval or discharge.\" <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 16 (2) was subsequently amended, deleting the new language and the provision now contains only \u201cremoval or discharge.\u201d See St. 1951, c. 784, \u00a7 2. The amendment evinces an awareness that there is a difference between a \u201cremoval or discharge\u201d and \u201cfailure of reappointment.\u201d We thus conclude that a person in the circumstances of the plaintiff is not entitled to the notice and hearing requirements of \u00a7 16(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">2. The plaintiff also argues that he has a Federal constitutionally protected property interest in \u201ccontinued, effective employment\u201d which flows from the procedural requirements of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (2). Specifically, he claims that he has a protected \u201cproperty\u201d interest in notice and a fair factual summary filed with the Teachers\u2019 Retirement Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The short answer parallels the discussion above. The plaintiff can prevail on his constitutional claim only if he has a \u201cproperty\u201d right in his employment. \u201cTo have a property interest in a benefit, a person . . . must . . . have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\u201d <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972). Cf. <em>Roslindale Motor Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>405 Mass. 79, 82 (1989). While it is, of course, true that a person cannot, without due process, be deprived of a \u201cproperty\u201d right, due process \u201cis a safeguard of the security of interests that a person has already acquired in specific benefits.\u201d <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges </em>v. <em>Roth, supra </em>at 576. See <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254 (1970). However, \u201c[property interests are not created by the Constitution, \u2018they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>ent source such as state law . . <em>Cleveland Bd. of Education </em>v. <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 538 (1985), quoting from <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges </em>v. <em>Roth, supra </em>at 577. If the plaintiff was not \u201cremove[d] or discharge[d]\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16, he would have no constitutionally protected property interest in his employment as an administrator of special education. The plaintiff lacks statutory tenure and protection under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42A, as the administrator of special education because he had not served in that position for the requisite number of consecutive years. As a nontenured administrator with a one year employment contract, the plaintiff has no right to continued employment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 578. Contrast <em>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. </em>v. <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. at 538-539. Accordingly, as the plaintiff has no legitimate claim of entitlement to continued employment, the severance of his employment relationship \u201cdoes not constitute a deprivation of a property interest, and thus no claim can be made that property has been taken without due process.\u201d <em>Martin </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Natick, </em>395 Mass. 461, 465 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">3. The plaintiff\u2019s final claim is that he is entitled to tenure under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, because he never <em>received </em>timely notice (by April 15) and he was up for his fourth consecutive year in that position. See, e.g., <em>School Comm. of West Springfield </em>v. <em>Korbut, </em>373 Mass. 788, 797 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Assuming that the plaintiff is a \u201cteacher\u201d for purposes of the statute, we hold that the notice requirements imposed upon the defendants by \u00a7 41 were met. The superintendent\u2019s written evaluation was received and signed by the plaintiff well before the April 15 deadline. That evaluation clearly informed the plaintiff (in writing) that the superintendent was not recommending him for reappointment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See and compare <em>Bonar </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number><em>Boston, </em>369 Mass. 579, 583-584 (1976). Moreover, the agreed facts reveal that a certain measure of avoidance was practiced by the plaintiff. See <em>Conte </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Methuen, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 600, 603-605 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b849-7\"> Between 1962 and 1985, the plaintiff was a contributing member of the State teachers\u2019 retirement system and had accumulated twenty-four years of \u201ccreditable service\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16, as appearing in St. 1982, c. 630, \u00a7 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b849-8\"> Four consecutive appointments to the same school administrative position are required to receive tenure status.

In addition, the plaintiff would have received a salary increase.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b849-9\"> Without the recommendation of the school superintendent, the school committee had no authority to employ the plaintiff. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 38. The plaintiff had been recommended for reelection or reappointment in 1983 by the then acting superintendent, and again in 1984 by Herlihy. Neither of these recommendations was particularly positive about the plaintiff\u2019s performance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b849-10\"> The superintendent asked the plaintiff to come to his office on April 9, 1985, at which time he intended officially to \u201cnotify\u201d the plaintiff of his nonreappointment. The plaintiff, however, was unable to meet with the superintendent that day due to an engagement he had with his son. The plaintiff subsequently went on vacation on April 10 and did not return to the school until April 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">Notice of the certified letter was twice delivered to the plaintiff\u2019s postal box. The first delivery occurred on April 12, 1985, when the defendant was not home. The second delivery occurred on April 19, 1985, at which time the plaintiff declined to accept it. The plaintiff did not \u201cdiscover\u201d the letter until he returned to the school on April 22. The plaintiff had asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>his secretary to inform the superintendent\u2019s office that he was taking three owed vacation days on April 10, 11, and 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b850-9\"> The school committee, upon the recommendation of the superintendent, approved and appointed a successor for the position on June 27, 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b850-10\"> The hearing would take place before the Teachers\u2019 Retirement Board. G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 16. See 807 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 2:00 &amp; 4:00 (1987). It has been held that, unlike G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43A, which authorizes the Superior Court to hear appeals by tenured teachers who have been dismissed, the review undertaken by the board is not de nova. See <em>School Comm. of Brockton </em>v. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>393 Mass. 256, 262-263 (1984). A subsequent right of review is available in the District Court. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">The relationship of \u00a7 16 (2) to the general provisions governing teacher and school personnel demotions and dismissals under G. L. c. 71 is \u201cconfusing and somewhat conflicting.\u201d <em>Haskell </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Framingham, </em>17 Mass.
