The Appellate Division dismissed the report, and the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The only questions arise out of denial of the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings. The report stated, \u201cAt the trial there was evidence which warranted the following findings of fact which I expressly make.\u201d The judge then set forth the facts as to how the plaintiff left his automobile, which contained in its locked rear compartment several hundred small aluminum castings, two sheets of aluminum, a radio, and a spare tire, tube, and rim, at the defendant\u2019s garage. The report proceeded: \u201cI find that the plaintiff intended to, and did, entrust his car and its contents to the custody of the defendant, and the defendant, knowing that the car contained personal property of value, accepted custody of both the car and its contents as a bailee for hire. I find that the plaintiff did not rely solely on the lock of the rear compartment to protect his property. He relied also on the care and protection of the defendant and its employees, and the defendant knew it. I find that the plaintiff\u2019s car was broken into, and the personal property stolen, through negligence on the part of the defendant\u2019s employees.\u201d These findings must stand for two reasons. (1) Notwithstanding the statement, \u201cThis report contains all the evidence material to the decision of the questions reported,\u201d no evidence is in fact reported. See <em>Frankina </em>v. <em>Salpietro, </em>269 Mass. 292, 295. (2) The report states that the findings were warranted by the evidence. The defendant\u2019s requests numbered 5, 6, and 7 depended upon evidence, and, accordingly, their denial shows no error. The same is true of request numbered 1, which was in effect a request for a finding, contrary to what the judge actually found, that there was no contract of bail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>ment as to the stolen articles. The defendant, as bailee for hire of the automobile and its contents, was bound to exercise due care in order to return them to the owner in as good condition as received. <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>Ernst, </em>284 Mass. 341, 344. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>B. A. Gardeito, Inc. </em>306 Mass. 212, 216. <em>Sandler </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Station Co. </em>307 Mass. 470. The findings bring not merely the automobile but all the stolen articles within the contract of bailment, and were not limited, as in <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Murch, </em>253 Mass. 467, to a bailment of the automobile and equipment. <em>D. A. Schulte, Inc. </em>v. <em>North Terminal Garage Co. </em>291 Mass. 251, and other cases the defendant cites, where the findings were otherwise, are clearly distinguishable. The defendant\u2019s requests numbered 2, 3, and 4, seeking rulings based on statements inconsistent with the duty owed as bailee for hire of the personal property, were rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
