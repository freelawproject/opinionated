She was taken to a hospital where she remained until July 24, 1942, when she was taken to a Boston hospital where she died on August 14, 1942. The record of the first hospital showed that the employee\u2019s condition was diagnosed as \u201cCerebral hemorrhage (traumatic in origin),\u201d and the record of the second hospital gave the diagnosis as \u201cIntracranial hemorrhage probably from aneurysm or weak walled blood vessel with right hemplegia [sic], following head injury.\u201d The death certificate stated the cause of death as \u201cPneumonia developed during hospitalization following cerebral lesion with symptoms following an accidental fall.\u201d A witness who saw the employee fall testified that the employee slipped on a spot of water or oil. There was evidence that one of the nurses at the hospital removed a patch of oil from the employee\u2019s right leg. The Industrial Accident Board adopted the findings of the single member and found that the employee\u2019s death was due to a cerebral hemorrhage caused by slipping and falling, striking her head on a truck and suffering a physical injury which arose out of and in the course of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The principal contention of the insurer is that the employee\u2019s fall did not result from a hazard of the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">The employee was acting in the course of her employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>in going to the wash room for a pail of water. <em>Sundine\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 1. <em>Von Ette\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 56. <em>Hughes\u2019s Case, </em>274 Mass. 540. <em>Nagle\u2019s Case, </em>310 Mass. 193. The risk of falling against one of the trucks which flanked either side of the passageway was a risk that would be encountered by every employee whose duties brought her within the zone of this special danger. She would not have been exposed to this danger except for her employment, and the risk that she might accidentally fall against the truck was a hazard inherent in her employment. <em>Dow\u2019s Case, </em>231 Mass. 348. <em>Hallett\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass. 49. <em>Sullivan\u2019s Case, </em>241 Mass. 9. <em>Cusick\u2019s Case, </em>260 Mass. 421. <em>Holmes\u2019s Case, </em>267 Mass. 307. <em>Nagle\u2019s Case, </em>310 Mass. 193. The fact that the board found, as it properly could upon the evidence, that she slipped upon the floor and in falling struck the truck only makes more clear the causal connection between the injury and the employment, <em>Bagley\u2019s Case, </em>256 Mass. 593; <em>Sullivan\u2019s Case, </em>265 Mass. 463, and distinguishes the case from <em>Cinmino\u2019s Case, </em>251 Mass. 158, and <em>Rozek\u2019s Case, </em>294 Mass. 205, upon which the insurer relies. These cases rest upon the principle that the fall of a workman upon a floor, which is not caused by the condition of the floor but is caused solely by his physical or mental condition which was not brought about by the strain of his employment, has not resulted in a compensable injury. <em>Lander </em>v. <em>British United Shoe Machinery Co. Ltd. </em>26 B. W. C. C. 411. <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Turner Construction Co. </em>224 N. Y. 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The next contention of the insurer is that there was not sufficient evidence that the employee\u2019s fall produced a cerebral hemorrhage. The insurer offered no medical testimony. The employee\u2019s physician testified that in his opinion the fall caused a rupture of a blood vessel in the brain. He also testified that in the absence of an autopsy and with a history of weakened blood vessels his opinion would rest upon speculation and surmise, but it could be found that by speculation and surmise he meant that, after getting a history of an accident and making every possible examination of a patient who was unable to talk, he studied the facts and formulated an opinion. A reasoned conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>derived from observed facts by one having special scientific knowledge cannot as matter of law be said not to rise any higher than a guess or speculation. <em>Walker\u2019s Case, </em>243 Mass. 224. <em>Blanchard\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 413. Apart from the medical testimony, the hospital records and the death certificate amply warranted a finding that death from a cerebral hemorrhage followed a head injury. These records could be fairly construed as doing more than stating the sequence of events. They could be reasonably understood to mean that the hemorrhage was caused by the head injury. If one was told that death followed an accident he would ordinarily understand that death was caused by the accident. At least a trier of fact could properly come to that conclusion. <em>Dunbar </em>v. <em>Ferrera Bros. Inc. </em>306 Mass. 90, 94. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Street Railway, </em>183 S. W. 1129, 1132. Moreover, the statement on the death certificate that the cause of death was a cerebral lesion \u201cfollowing an accidental fall\u201d was prima facie evidence of the facts., recorded and the insurer was not entitled to have the words just quoted struck out. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 46, \u00a7 19. <em>Shamlian </em>v. <em>Equitable Accident Co. </em>226 Mass. 67. <em>Silva </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. </em>252 Mass. 328. <em>Wolf\u2019s Case, </em>285 Mass. 181. <em>Dow </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>297 Mass. 34. <em>Walcott </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>308 Mass. 413. <em>Lydon </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>309 Mass. 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The diagnosis appearing in the hospital record that the employee was suffering from a \u201cCerebral hemorrhage (traumatic in origin) \u201d was a description of her physical condition and a part of the medical history of the case. It defined the nature and type of the hemorrhage. It was properly admitted in evidence. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>234 Mass. 480. <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Fitchburg &amp; Leominster Street Railway, </em>236 Mass. 526. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Beacon Oil Co. 271 </em>Mass. 27. There was, however, error in admitting that portion of one of the hospital records to the effect that the patient's husband had stated that she slipped upon a greasy floor. <em>Inangelo </em>v. <em>Petterson, </em>236 Mass. 439. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co. </em>278 Mass. 101, 110, 111. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dawn, </em>302 Mass. 255, 261. But in view of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>testimony of the eyewitness that the employee slipped upon a spot of water or oil and of the nurse that she removed an oil stain from the employee\u2019s leg shortly after she was admitted to the hospital, the diagnosis of the employee\u2019s condition as stated in the record of the first hospital, the description of her condition as contained in the record of the second hospital and the cause of death set forth in the death certificate, the error in the admission of evidence is too unsubstantial to constitute an adequate ground for the reversal of the final decree. <em>Pigeon\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 51, 55. <em>Beckles\u2019s Case, </em>230 Mass. 272, 274. <em>Sciola\u2019s Case, </em>236 Mass. 407, 413. <em>Fernald\u2019s Case, </em>240 Mass. 567. <em>Indrisano\u2019s Case, </em>307 Mass. 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">This is not a case where costs should be allowed under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 14. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 11, as amended by St. 1939, c. 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
