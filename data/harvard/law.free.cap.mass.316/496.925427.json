A demurrer to the bill of complaint was overruled. The case was then heard on a statement of agreed facts. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs had not become members of . the contributory retirement system, ruled that there was no need for an injunction on the authority of <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Retirement Board of the County of Middlesex, </em>312 Mass. 115, 120, and entered a decree ordering the removal of the plaintiffs\u2019 names and providing for the payment of the deductions with interest. The defendants appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">At the \u2022 outset we- are confronted by a challenge to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, a question not discussed in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Retirement Board of the County of Middlesex, </em>312 Mass. 115, and <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Retirement Board of Lawrence, </em>315 Mass. 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The bill of complaint alleges that the plaintiffs are regular police officers of the city of Gloucester; that all of them had previously been reserve police officers, and had been appointed as such prior to June 30, 1937; that at the time of their appointment as members of the police department \u201cthe original statutory retirement system\u201d to be found in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 56-60, inclusive, 83-85, inclusive, and 89, had been accepted by the city and was in force and applied to \u201cany member of the police department,\u201d including the plaintiffs; that when \u201cthe revised retirement act,\u201d to be found in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 26-31H, inclusive, as appearing in St. 1936, c. 318, \u00a7 1, took effect on July 1, 1937, the plaintiffs were reserve police officers; that since July 1, 1937, the plaintiffs have been appointed permanent police officers; that at the expiration of ninety days from his permanent appointment each was advised by his superiors and by the defendants, the members of the retirement board, that he came within the provisions of the \u201crevised retirement act\u201d and would be forced to contribute; that thereafter the plaintiffs have paid five per cent of \u201ctheir weekly salary\u201d under protest, contending that they were already covered by \u201cthe original retirement law\u201d and therefore expressly were excluded from the new act; that the defendants in October, 1942, gave the plaintiffs a hearing at which they were represented by counsel and, relying upon St. 1938, c. 326, protested against the contributions they were forced to make; and that the defendants voted not to refund any deductions which had been made from the plaintiffs\u2019 salaries and voted to continue making deductions as before. The relief prayed for included an injunction against further deductions, the removal of the names of the plaintiffs as members of the retirement system, and the refunding of sums previously deducted with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\">One ground of demurrer was that G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 26-31H, as so appearing, which established contributory retirement systems for municipalities accepting the same, conferred \u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction upon the local retirement board and \u201cthe contributory retirement appeal board.\u201d The defendants contend that the Legislature intended a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>uniform procedure requiring appeals to the appeal board within a limited time before invoking the aid of the courts by writ of certiorari or other appropriate remedy, and that the plaintiffs had no option to ignore the appeal board, to wait six months after a decision by the local retirement board, and then to institute proceedings in equity in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\">The plaintiffs, on the one hand, rely upon \u00a7 38 of said c. 32, as amended by St. 1937, c. 336, \u00a7 21, which reads, \u201cThe superior court shall have jurisdiction in equity, upon petition of the commissioner of insurance or any interested party, to compel the observance and to restrain the violation of any provision of sections one to thirty-one I, inclusive, and of the rules and regulations established thereunder.\u201d The defendants, on the other hand, rely upon G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 32, \u00a7 37C, paragraph 7, as appearing in St. 1938, c. 439, \u00a7 2, which provides: \u201cThere is hereby established a board composed of the director of the division of accounts or an assistant in said division to be designated in writing from time to time by the commissioner of corporations and taxation, the commissioner of insurance or an assistant to be designated in writing from time to time by said commissioner, and an assistant attorney general to be designated from time to time by the attorney general, said board being hereinafter called the appeal board. On matters not subject to review as hereinbefore provided, any person aggrieved by any order, decision or finding of a retirement board, or by the failure of such board to act, may within ten days after such order, decision or finding, or within ten days after the expiration of one month following the date of a written request to such board for such an order, decision or finding in case no action was taken by such .board thereon within one month, appeal to the appeal board by filing with the board a claim in writing. The appeal board shall, after due notice, give a hearing in not less than ten nor more than sixty days following the filing of any such claim of appeal. The appeal board shall pass upon the appeal, and its decision shall be final and binding upon the board of retirement involved and upon all other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>parties in interest, and shall be complied with by such board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\">The statute must be construed as a whole, giving effect to all its provisions so far as possible. \u201cIt is a familiar canon of statutory interpretation that every word of a legislative enactment is to be given force and effect so far as reasonably practicable. No part is to be treated as immaterial or superfluous unless no other rational course is open.\u201d <em>Commissioners of Public Works </em>v. <em>Cities Service Oil Co. </em>308 Mass. 349, 360, and cases cited. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Board, </em>304 Mass. 601, 605. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>312 Mass. 154, 161. In \u00a7 37C as appearing in \u00a7 2 of St. 1938, c. 439, a legislative intent is shown to establish a comprehensive procedure applicable to all members of contributory retirement systems of the Commonwealth, of counties, and of cities and towns, including public school teachers. Except as to matters subject to review in the District Court as provided in said \u00a7 37C, paragraphs 1, 2, and 4, such members must follow the procedure established in \u00a7 37C, paragraph 7. When the paragraph of \u00a7 37C [afterwards denominated as (7)3 first became effective May 26, 1938 (see St. 1938, c. 360, \u00a7 10A), \u00a7 38 was already in effect. Section 38 had always applied to the other retirement systems contained in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 32. See St. 1910, c. 619, \u00a7 10 (cities and towns); St. 1911, c. 532, \u00a7 10 (Commonwealth); St. 1911, c. 634, \u00a7 10 (counties); St. 1913, c. 832, \u00a7 14 (public school teachers). Section 38 was also contained in the original form of the statute establishing municipal contributory retirement systems, and as to cities like Gloucester, which accepted the revised act at the first opportunity, became effective July 1, 1937. See St. 1937, c. 336, \u00a7 21. Some range of effectiveness must exist for \u00a7 38. \u201cA statute is not, to be deemed to repeal or supersede a prior statute in whole or in part in the absence of express words to that effect or of clear implication.\u201d <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Price, </em>273 Mass. 303, 309. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bloomberg, </em>302 Mass. 349, 352. Except as to those who were members of a retirement system existing under c. 32, we think that the remedy under \u00a7 38 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>was still open. The bill of complaint in substance alleges that the-plaintiffs were not members of the contributory retirement system of the city of Gloucester. It follows that the demurrer was rightly overruled as to these plaintiffs. Compare <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Treasurer of Malden, </em>309 Mass. 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\">The statement of agreed facts showed the following: The city duly accepted, effective July 1, 1937, St. 1936, c. 318. The provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 147, \u00a7\u00a7 11-13, establishing a reserve police force, are in effect in the city by virtue of the acceptance of a corresponding provision of an earlier statute, St. 1896, c. 314. The plaintiffs were all reserve police officers prior to July 1, 1937, and all became regular police officers at various dates between December 15, 1937, and March 5, 1942. Before any of the plaintiffs were appointed reserve police officers G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 56-60, 83-85, and 89, were in effect in the city, and, as amended, have so continued. None of the plaintiffs has applied for membership in the contributory retirement system, or waived the benefits of any other pension system. See \u00a7 27 (1) (c) of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 32, as appearing in St. 1936, c. 318, \u00a7 1. The local retirement board, as the plaintiffs severally became regular police officers, ruled that they became members of this system, and \u201cunder verbal protest\" five per cent deductions \u201cwere made and are still being made from their weekly compensation without their consent.\" In June, 1938, the plaintiff Hinckley protested to the defendants. On September 11, 1942, counsel for the plaintiffs protested in writing and requested a hearing before the defendants. Such hearing was held on October 16, 1942, and the defendants voted not to refund any sums to the plaintiffs, and to continue making deductions. Without appealing to the appeal board, the present bill in equity was brought on April 9, 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">The judge ruled that the plaintiffs did not become members of the contributory retirement system; that G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 32, \u00a7 83, as amended by St. 1936, c. 439, \u00a7 2, under certain conditions placing \u201cupon a pension roll any member of the police department,\" included both permanent and reserve police officers; and that the plaintiffs were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>\"covered by any other pension or retirement law\u201d under said \u00a7 27 (1) (c), which reads, \"An employee who is covered by any other pension or retirement law of the commonwealth, including any special law accepted by and applicable to employees of the city or town on the date when the system becomes operative therein, shall become a member of the system only if he shall then or thereafter make written application to join the system, and shall therein waive and renounce all benefits of all other pension or retirement systems supported wholly by the city or town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\">The decree entered by the judge was correct. The plaintiffs, as reserve police officers whose employment began prior to July 1, 1937, were within the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 56-60, 83-85, by reason of St. 1938, c. 326, which was in terms retroactive. <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Retirement Board of Lawrence, </em>315 Mass. 492, 493-494. They were thus \"covered by any other pension or retirement law\u201d within the language of said \u00a7 27 (1) (c), and, since they did not make written application to join the contributory retirement system and waive and renounce the benefits of the pension system of which they were already members, it necessarily followed that they did not become members of the new contributory retirement system. <em>Litchfield </em>v. <em>Retirement Board of the County of Middlesex, </em>303 Mass. 473, 475. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Retirement Board of the County of Middlesex, </em>312 Mass. 115, 118. <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Retirement Board of Lawrence, supra, </em>at page 494. In the case last cited the plaintiffs all signed applications for membership in the contributory retirement system, and made no protest for four years. In the case at bar none of the plaintiffs signed such applications, and protest was seasonably made.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The plaintiffs were not barred by laches. \u201cIn general, mere delay not extending beyond the period allowed by the statute and not rendering relief unconscionable, does not amount to laches. <em>Calkins </em>v. <em>Wire Hardware Co. </em>267 Mass. 52, 69.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Lyndonville Creamery Association, </em>284 Mass. 396, 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
