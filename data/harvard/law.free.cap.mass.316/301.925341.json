A demurrer to the \u201cdeclaration\u201d was overruled, and the defendant claimed a report to the Appellate Division. After a hearing on the merits, there was a finding for the plaintiff, and the defendant claimed a second report. The Appellate Division dismissed both reports. The defendant appealed to this court only from the order relative to the demurrer. Consequently the only question is whether the alleged defects in the \u201cdeclaration\u201d deprive the plaintiff of the foundation for a judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">We are mystified by the \u201cdeclaration\u201d printed in the record on appeal. Before the practice acts, the declaration in all common law actions was written in the writ and physically formed part of it. The defendant was to appear on the return day to answer to the plaintiff in a certain kind of \u201cplea\u201d or action, and at that point in the writ the declaration began with the words \u201cfor that.\u201d <em>Ilsley </em>v. <em>Stubbs, </em>5 Mass. 280, 285. <em>Brigham </em>v. <em>Este, 2 </em>Pick. 420. <em>Keenan </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>9 Allen, 257. <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>197 Mass. 128. <em>Whiting </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>228 Mass. 429, 430. <em>Sweeny </em>v. <em>Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp. </em>307 Mass. 165. Illustrations may be found in <em>Story </em>v. <em>Odin, </em>12 Mass. 157; <em>Rider </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>13 Mass. 284; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Hingham &amp; Quincy Bridge &amp; Turnpike Corp. </em>4 Pick. 341; and <em>Hemmenway </em>v. <em>Hickes, </em>4 Pick. 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">This was true in replevin, and remains true to this day in that form of action. The form of the writ of replevin now in use is substantially the same as that established by St. 1789, c. 26, \u00a7 4. For many years that form was required by statutory provision. Rev. Sts. (1836) c. 113, \u00a7 28. Gen. Sts. (1860) c. 143, \u00a7 11. Pub. Sts. (1882) c. 184, \u00a7 11. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>Poyen </em>v. <em>McNeill, </em>10 Met. 291, 293. <em>Pomeroy </em>v. <em>Trimper, </em>8 Allen, 398, 401. When that provision was omitted from R. L. (1902) as superfluous, the practice continued unchanged. There is no declaration in replevin except that contained in the writ itself. See <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>7 Cush. 530, 532; <em>Judson </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>8 Cush. 556; <em>Litchman </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>116 Mass. 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\">If the \u201cdeclaration\u201d printed in the record was a part of the writ, which seems unlikely, it was in an unnecessarily elaborate form. If it was a separate document, additional to a writ in proper form, it was surplusage. But even if it be treated as the effective statement of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the demurrer was rightly overruled. The \u201cdeclaration\u201d stated that the furniture replevied was sold by the plaintiff to the defendant under four conditional bills of sale. The demurrer was general to the entire \u201cdeclaration,\u201d and assigned as the ground of demurrer the illegality of three only of the four conditional bills of sale. A general demurrer to a declaration must be overruled unless it wholly destroys the right of recovery alleged. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Castles, </em>11 Cush. 348. <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>15 Gray, 184. <em>Vitagraph, Inc. </em>v. <em>Park Theatre Co. of Boston, </em>249 Mass. 25, 31. <em>Fahy </em>v. <em>Melrose Free Press Inc. </em>298 Mass. 267, 269. Here a part of the plaintiff\u2019s claim was not met by the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
