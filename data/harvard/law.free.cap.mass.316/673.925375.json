See <em>Dolbeare </em>v. <em>Bowser, </em>254 Mass. 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">This brings us to the question whether by virtue of the provisions of \u00a7 20, hereinbefore set forth, \u00a7 45 applies in a case, such as the present, where the inability of a ward under conservatorship to care for his own property arises solely from advanced age and the ward is of sound mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 201, \u00a7 16, provides for the appointment of a conservator of the property of a person if by reason of advanced age or mental weakness he is unable to care therefor. Section 17 provides that where, as in the present case, the person for whose property the conservator is to be appointed is himself the petitioner or assents in writing to the petition no notice shall be required except to the United States veterans\u2019 bureau or its successor if such person is entitled to any benefit payable by the bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">When first enacted by St. 1898, c. 527, the statute authorizing the appointment of conservators related solely to persons incapacitated to care for their property by reason of advanced age, but by \u00a7 2 of that statute it was provided that \u201call provisions of law relating to the management, sale or mortgage of the property of insane persons shall apply to such conservators.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Statute 1915, c. 23, broadened these terms of St. 1898, c. 527 (see R. L. c. 145, \u00a7 41; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>221 Mass. 315), and provided in \u00a7 1, \u201cConservators appointed under the provisions of section forty of chapter one hundred and forty-five of the Revised Laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>and acts in amendment thereof or in addition thereto shall have the powers, and perform the duties, except as to the custody of the person, of guardians of insane persons. All provisions of law relating to the jurisdiction of the probate court over the estates of persons under guardianship as insane persons shall be applicable to the estates of persons under conservatorship.\u201d The statute has continued substantially in that form to the present. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 201, \u00a7 20. It applies to cases where the conservatorship is based upon physical inability to care for one\u2019s property as well as to those based upon inability to do so because of mental weakness. It follows that the provisions of \u00a7 45 relative to the waiver of wills apply in the present case notwithstanding that the respondent was of sound mind when he filed the waiver in question, and that the conservator was appointed upon the respondent\u2019s petition. <em>Foss </em>v. <em>Twenty-Five Associates of Roxbury, Inc. </em>239 Mass. 295, 297-298. If the conservatorship of the property of the respondent at the time he filed the waiver was not necessary because of improvement in his physical condition, he had a remedy by applying for the discharge of the conservator. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 201, \u00a7 18, as amended by St. 1934, c. 204, \u00a7 2. No such action having been taken by him, the only valid method by which a waiver of the will in question could have been executed was that required to be pursued by \u00a7 45. No proceedings were taken thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b724-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Rs/\u00eda ajoi-uf\u00f3 \u00edtvM\u00edbbs <em>ni nn </em>i o;\u00bb:; JA JaafiiLuyoxs <em>\u00a1\u00e9 </em>k\u00f3b <em>hm</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><em>\u25a0odi a\u00fa </em>\u00a1\u00bfti <em>iqa\u00a1fA3 </em>teuiHii&gt; sAi r\u00fa-iRv^ bn* ,:.-n'9V\u00edv&gt;q sxi? 9v,\u00fc\u00a1\u00ed \u00cd1A -5-io-n'sq <em>hi\u00fc\u00ed\u00f3\u00ed\u00fa </em>lo \u00ed5\u00bb\";Lbt,f.ug b: pM.^'isq \u00fcj\u00ed\u00ed lo ybolatio</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b722-9\"> The provision for the appointment of conservators of the property of persons unable to care therefor by reason of mental weakness was added by an amendment enacted by St. 1901, c. 125.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
