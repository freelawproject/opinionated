The last four accounts brought the accounting up to May 31, 1942. The judge heard all twelve accounts upon the auditor\u2019s report and \u201cmuch\u201d evidence, \u201csome being a repetition of that heard by the auditor.\u201d The judge, on the same day on which the claim of appeal was filed, made a \u201creport of material facts,\u201d in which he said, \u201cExcept as stated herein the court finds the facts to be the facts stated by the auditor whose report.is made a part hereof.\u201d The judge discussed the charging of the accountants for use and occupation of a house by Everett P. Turner, and came to the conclusion, contrary to that of the auditor, that the accountants should not be charged therefor. In no other respect was the auditor\u2019s report affected. The report concluded as follows: \u201cAs to the ninth to twelfth accounts inclusive, not referred to the auditor, the court finds that, except as to the items disallowed, the expenditures charged in Schedule B were made by the accountants, were reasonably incurred and were properly paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">There is nothing in the record to show that the \u201creport of material facts\u201d was required by the appellant under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 215, \u00a7 11 (see c. 214, \u00a7 23), or was other than ' voluntary. The question arises, whether the report is to be deemed a complete statement of all the material facts upon which the judge based his decrees, just like a compulsory report under the statute <em>(Sidlow </em>v. <em>Gosselin, </em>310 Mass. 395, 397; <em>Hinckley </em>v. <em>Barnstable, </em>311 Mass. 600, 602; <em>Matter of Loeb, </em>315 Mass. 191, 195), or merely a report of part of the facts in partial explanation of the decrees, without precluding the ordinary assumption that the decrees imported a finding of all facts, not expressly negatived, necessary to support them. <em>Birnbaum </em>v. <em>Pamoukis, </em>301 Mass. 559. <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Berkeley Realty Corp. </em>311 Mass. 148, 151. <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Great American Indemnity Co., ante, </em>155. <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>314 Mass. 282, 284.

She continued to live there until her death in 1931. Both she and her husband took great pride in the maintenance at great expense of their gardens and grounds as a \u201cshow place.\u201d After 1907 she did not improve the house or make more than the most necessary repairs, but she kept up the gardens and grounds and employed three men largely for that purpose. The property has a frontage of five hundred sixty-three feet on Pleasant Street, and an area of one hundred two thousand two hundred sixty-seven square feet. A rocky ledge sixty feet deep covers the back of the property, reducing the usable part to a strip one hundred feet deep along the street. Even in that strip the surface soil is very shallow, and there are many outcroppings of the underlying ledge. No house could be built there without blasting for the cellar and for drains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>aln\u00dc S6\"W\u00dce&lt;? bonriB'ctioW^tipKe property is^sitbafeddSnain eX6W\u00e9if#\".BBigbbOrl6ods*ptihB\u00cd|)'\u00e1ll\u00a7r 8 b$ da|:geadihgl\u00e9)\u20achi#hy -dw'\u00e9\u00ed\u00edi'ngsq ^bnifig4\u00e9guMi\u00f3n\u00bf&lt;\u00edreqB.irg singlo fkmily\u00fc'dvieMs bigs-Set haofet^ohtj^bdo-'Oteetidrbta\u00a1: thobsteetqoniik \u00e1tob\u00e1t fe\u00e1M \u00e1ixt^ife\u00e9tswid\u00e9 .liOAerbis\u00bb 'the-istreBt \u2022 iil a S\u00e9c&amp;MesB\u00e9\u00e1ci^\u00c9 Ibl\u00f3f-lOssdl\u00edM\u00c9^O&amp;thotisandvic^ar\u00e9/f\u00f3e^bbtiglifcblfbioslSOT -t\u00f3^affgfd 8jivi\u00f3w,bf SpySbnd &amp;bm-itMods\u00edge\u00aedo\u2018t&lt;dndv:t\u00f3effi'Ehe In\u00edildingsiaTPl\u00fccated\u00ed \u00bfSEtigotho\u00ae thO^ictetitntedbfilieiii'diriBi Bl\u00e9\u00e1SbstMB'bMhb te'St\u00e1\u00edtrixbE?) j.^,i\u00a1, El -&lt;m&amp;3.1iic <em>uw\u00fc</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">q/\u00bfOB\u00bbtte'labgBxl\u00f3t'\u00ael\u00aeead:^&lt;deSbribedd\u00c9Ea&lt;l0.sge^blG^fa'ghibn@d \u2022wo'bdgh-hWsbt with -\u00ed\u00e1!f\u00bfh- piazzas-' hndcrt^dlveit\u00f3glDst'addBd k'\u00f3d\u00c9i\u2019sP'lDuilt'\u00ed\u00c9lxb\u00fat' 18\u201dS0\u2019i iti-l-the. -stylo'fbiS;4haP^BM\u00a9dS^'CBHi \u00e1bbrs'Kw\u00e9ro^oi Soft\u2019- \u00edpl\u00f1\u00e9&gt;! \u2022 and-?

The tenant insisted that the signs of several brokers with whom the property had been listed for sale be taken down. The brokers had obtained no offer for the property, and personal efforts by the executors obtained none. The tenant died, and the tenancy ended on October 31, 1934. Again the house became unoccupied.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">After the collapse of the real estate market in the summer of 1932, it would have been impossible to sell the property for any purpose or at any price until 1935, when the market improved slightly. In 1936 the market became active for vacant land adapted for low priced houses, which the property in question was not. In 1937 the market again \u201cdropped out of sight\u201d until the latter part of 1938 when it improved for land adapted for low priced houses. In 1938 the property could not have been sold for more than $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The auditor came to the conclusion, approved by the judge, that there was no negligence in the failure to sell the property. The auditor filed his last report on July 29, 1941, and the judge filed his report of material facts on April 30, 1943. No evidence is reported, and all we know of the real estate market is found in the auditor\u2019s report. It does not appear that any of the persons interested ever pressed the executors to make a sale. On various occasions the testatrix had expressed to all her children her desire that the property be \u201ckept up\u201d as it had been during her life until sold, and that, if possible, it be sold \u201cto some one who would appreciate it.\u201d <em>Brigham </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>185 Mass. 27, 38. None of the children then or later ever expressed any disagreement with that desire.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">No doubt the power given to the executors to postpone the sale of the real estate \u201cso long as they may think proper\u201d had to be \u201cexercised with that soundness of judgment which follows from a due appreciation of trust responsibility.\u201d <em>Corkery </em>v. <em>Dorsey, </em>223 Mass. 97, 101. <em>Boyden </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>285 Mass. 176, 179. <em>Cronan </em>v. <em>Cronan, </em>286 Mass. 497, 500, 501. <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>299 Mass. 390, 397. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number><em>Berry </em>v. <em>Kyes, </em>304 Mass. 56, 59. <em>Damon </em>v. <em>Damon, </em>312 Mass. 268, 272. But putting ourselves in the position of the executors it is hard to select a time when we can say that the executors were negligent in failing to sell. There was always the hope that some institution that could use the buildings would buy the property as a whole. To any other buyer the buildings apparently were worthless. Without the buildings the property would consist of very inferior building lots, though in a good neighborhood. On the whole we cannot say that the judge was wrong in declining to charge the executors with liability for their failure to sell the real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">2. After the house had been vacant since October 31, 1934, Everett P. Turner, the \u201cmanaging executor,\u201d moved into the house with his family in August, 1935, renovations having been made. He paid no rent. The auditor found as follows: \u201cI do not find that the renovations were made with the specific purpose of providing Everett with a home; but because the executors thought they would sufficiently enhance the chances of selling the house to justify the expenditure.\u201d He found further: \u201cAll the children knew that the renovations were to be made and that Everett was to live there till the place was sold, and they knew this program had been put into effect. There is no evidence that Herbert or Marguerite knew how much was to be spent or whether Everett paid rent, or, if so, how much. Neither showed any interest or made any inquiries, suggestions, or complaints.\u201d No effort was made thereafter to rent the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The judge found that no express or implied obligation on the part of Everett to pay rent was established. He found that no tenant could have been discovered who would have paid rent, that if Everett had not occupied the house it would have deteriorated rapidly, and that his occupation was a benefit to the estate. The judge charged against the executors some items of expense that were for the personal benefit of Everett in making the house more conveniently habitable by him. But we think the judge was right in not charging the executors for the use and occupation by Everett. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Sil. tThednstatrixibecame'lhdiiPrentitb .tile inside condition M t1\u00edg\u00edl60\u00aeepandd\u00aetinkw&lt;b8deidpt\u00edrdr-\u00ed?rhe&amp;p\"\u00f3hsMlIty'.\u00ed.&lt;3f\u00ed\u00e1 Skife 4@oaav\u00e1n\u00e9titiit\u00edOfl\u00edi\u00fcepg\u00f1d!ed np&lt;fa.Weepitig8th\u00e9ehOT\u00aeea&amp; sateHe eti&amp;ditioiU-'i ^hite.rths^isiusewpasH'et fbce:ae teikrtMt Bad Mnfeg Mep^ if\u00edtiep\u00editin \u00edWBerfi thedtenant\u00ed didd 9'thwJexeeu?

That is shown by their expenditure of $5,958.04 for plainly unnecessary and improper items that the court below disallowed, besides other items that were allowed below and are still in controversy. From the beginning their expenditures were lavish and wasteful. In the winter of 1934 and the spring of 1935 extensive renovations were made in the house in anticipation of occupancy by Everett. For the most part, such renovations were made improvidently. As to many of their acts, the executors can escape liability only because of the consent of their brother Herbert, whose estate the appellant represents.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Herbert was in Arlington from April until October, 1931, and apparently again in the summer of 1933. He must have seen in a general way that the grounds were being kept up as they were in the lifetime of the testatrix, and that the same men were being employed without reduction in their number. He with the other children agreed in 1931 that the property should be \u201ckept up \u201d until sold. None of them ever expressed any change of mind. Herbert knew that renovations were planned in 1934 and 1935 and that Everett was to move in when they were completed. He never asked the details or the- probable cost. Apparently he neither asked nor received any accounting. He showed no interest, and made no inquiries, suggestions or complaints. To the extent that he consented to acts of the executors, he could not complain of them if he were living, and neither can the appellant, who stands in his shoes. <em>Lannin </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>256 Mass. 78, 82. <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>186 Mass. 14, 19. <em>Ashley </em>v. <em>Winkley, </em>209 Mass. 509, 529. <em>Malden Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>291 Mass. 273, 283.

Scott, Trusts (1939) \u00a7 216.2. But Marguerite did not appeal, and this court has no duty or right to give her directly relief that she could have obtained by appealing. <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>313 Mass. 232, 234. Herbert\u2019s representative is the only appellant, and the decrees can be revised only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>so far as they infringe his rights. <em>Braga </em>v. <em>Braga, </em>314 Mass. 666, 673. But since Marguerite is entitled to an equal share in the trust estate with Herbert and his representative, she will benefit indirectly from the disallowance of expenditures that may result from our decision on this appeal. See <em>Little </em>v. <em>Little, </em>161 Mass. 188, 203; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>188 Mass. 186; <em>Merchants Discount Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Street Corp. </em>300 Mass. 167, 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">There is difficulty in separating the allowable expenses from those that should be disallowed. There is further difficulty in separating the expenditures to which Herbert consented from those to which his consent did not extend. But deciding the questions of fact as best we can on the record, it seems to us that the expenditures allowed by the court below up to October 31, 1934, when the house ceased to be rented, were covered by Herbert\u2019s consent. Coming to the renovations of 1934-1935, the finding of the auditor that the expenditures therefor, with certain exceptions, were proper credits to the accountants, was expressly based solely upon subsidiary findings. Therefore the proper inferences from those subsidiary findings are open to our decision. We think the removal of bookcases and the laying of hard wood floors, at an expense of $371.65, should be disallowed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We think the installation of modern bathrooms and the modernization of the plumbing, at an expense of $533.89, should be disallowed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The item of $428.84 for renovating the water system in the stable or garage<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> should be disallowed. Although the town authorities required the work, if the garage were to have water, there was no good reason for water in a practically unused building. Any consent of Herbert of course expired at his death. Thereafter the executors paid for labor in caring for the property sums exceeding the sum of $400 a year, which sum we consider reasonable for the occasional labor required.
