The case was tried before a judge and a jury. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. But upon leave reserved the judge ordered the entry of a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-14\">There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-15\">There was evidence that the plaintiff was a tenant at will \u2014 and had been for about three years \u2014 and occupied with his family the second floor of the premises, access to which was by a stairway. The defendant admitted ownership and control of the stairway. There was also evidence that the plaintiff, while descending the stairway, caught his heel on a nail on the fourth step from the bottom of the stairway. The nail protruded about an inch and a half above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>the step. It was about ten inches from the side of the stairway.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">' There was no evidence that the defendant knew of the protruding nail. And the evidence did not warrant a finding that the nail had protruded for so long a time that the defendant in the exercise of reasonable care should have known of the existence of the protruding nail and remedied the defect. See <em>Leslie </em>v. <em>Glazer, </em>273 Mass. 221, 223. There was no evidence of an appearance, indicative of age, of the nail that caused the plaintiff\u2019s fall. <em>Blake </em>v. <em>John F. Johnston Co. </em>213 Mass. 143, 144. The only evidence that could be thought to have any bearing upon the length of time that this nail had protruded above the step was the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s son who lived with his father and used-this stairway.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">This son testified that about a month or two before the accident he saw nails sticking up above the fourth step and above other steps, two or three above the fourth step, and seven or eight in all. The nails stuck up distances, variously stated, of \u201chalf an inch,\u201d \u201cquarter of an inch,\u201d \u201cabout a quarter to an eighth of an inch.\u201d This son also testified that:he \u201ckept on using the stairs,\u201d but \u201ccouldn\u2019t recall noticing them [[the nails] sticking up from the steps after he first observed them a month or two before his father\u2019s accident.\u201d The nail that caused the plaintiff to fall was not identified as one of the nails that the plaintiff\u2019s son saw protruding from the fourth step a month or two before the accident. There was no evidence that the condition' of the fourth step was the same at the time of the accident to the plaintiff as at the time its condition was observed by his son. In this respect the case differs from the case of <em>Loudon </em>v. <em>Beaulieu, </em>277 Mass. 33, relied on by the plaintiff. For aught that appears in the evidence the protruding nail that caused the plaintiff to fall may have been protruding only a short time before the accident. Evidence that some nails were protruding from the step a month or two before the accident did not warrant the inference that the protruding nail that caused the plaintiff to fall had been protruding during that period, or for so long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>a time that the defendant should have known about it. The condition of the fourth step observed by the plaintiff\u2019s son may have been corrected long before the accident occurred. There was no evidence or ground for inference that it was not so corrected, or that the condition observed by the plaintiff\u2019s son continued until the time of the accident. A landlord cannot be held hable for an injury resulting from a protruding nail on a step of a stairway merely because a month or two before the injury there were protruding nails on that step, no one of which is shown to have been the same nail. The condition of a step in this particular might readily change in that period. The testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s son did not warrant a finding that the condition of the step that caused the plaintiff to fall had existed for so long a time that the defendant ought to have known about it. The evidence did not warrant a finding that any negligence of the defendant contributed to cause the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
