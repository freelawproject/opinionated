L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 155, \u00a7 9. That section (since amended in respects not now material by St. 1943, c. 295) provided in part that a corporation organized under general laws should not assume the name of another corporation previously established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>under the laws of the Commonwealth, or of a corporation carrying on business in the Commonwealth, or <em>\u201ca </em>name so similar thereto as to be likely to be mistaken for it,\u201d except with the written consent of the existing corporation. The statute conferred jurisdiction upon the Supreme Judicial Court and the Superior Court to enjoin the new corporation from doing business under a name assumed in violation of the section, even though a certificate of incorporation had been issued to it. After the incorporation of the plaintiff as \u201cFirst National Stores Inc.\u201d the defendant, which was originally incorporated as \u201cSan Clemente Company,\u201d assumed, with the approval of the commissioner of corporations and taxation, the name \u201cFirst National Liquor Company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-3\">We accept the statement of the plaintiff both in the bill and in its brief that this proceeding is under, the statute, although some allegations of the bill and some of the evidence might be thought to extend slightly beyond the limits of a proceeding solely under the statute. Compare <em>Staples Coal Co. </em>v. <em>City Fuel Co., ante, </em>503. Under the statute the question to be decided is whether the name \u201cFirst National Liquor Company\u201d is so similar to the name \u201cFirst National Stores Inc.\u201d as to be likely to be mistaken for it by \u201ca person of average intelligence.\u201d <em>John L. Whiting-J. J. Adams Co. </em>v. <em>Adams-White Brush Co. </em>260 Mass. 137, 141. <em>National Shoe Corp. </em>v. <em>National Shoe Manuf. Co. Inc. </em>302 Mass. 449, 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Evidence received' at the hearing added but little to that supplied by a mere comparison of the two names. It appeared that the defendant had a store on Hanover Street in Boston, and that it sold liquors and no foods; and that the plaintiff maintained one of its eighteen hundred fifty stores on Salem Street about a block from the defendant\u2019s store and sold no liquors in this Commonwealth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It seems to have been assumed at the hearing that the plaintiff dealt in foods, an assumption in which we think we are justified in joining. So far as appears the only article sold in both the plaintiff\u2019s Salem Street store and the defendant\u2019s store was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>ginger ale, and it did not appear that there was competition between the stores. There was evidence of similarity in some respects and of difference in other respects between the signs upon the two stores bearing their respective owners\u2019 names, but this relates to the manner of dressing the store fronts and not to the similarity of the names themselves. In its aspect most favorable to the plaintiff the case turns upon the degree of similarity of the two names as applied respectively to a retail food business and to a retail liquor business in the same area, but not in competition with each other, and upon the likelihood of the name of the owner of the liquor business being mistaken for the name of the owner of the food business.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\">The trial judge decided the question of fact in favor of the plaintiff. Nothing turns, however, upon conflicting testimony or upon the credit to be given to opposing witnesses. We are in as good a position to decide the issue as was the trial judge. <em>Newburyport Society for the Relief of Aged Women </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>287 Mass. 530, 532-533. <em>Veazie </em>v. <em>Staples, </em>309 Mass. 123, 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">The only similarity between the two names is found in the identity of the first two out of the four words respectively comprising each name. The last two words are wholly different. The words \u201cFirst National\u201d belong to a well known type- of rather grandiloquent and often presumptuous epithets frequently used at the beginning of corporate and business names. Other words of the same type coming readily to mind are \u201cInternational,\u201d \u201cAmerican,\u201d \"Federal,\u201d \u201cMetropolitan,\u201d \u201cCapital,\u201d \u201cCounty,\u201d \u201cCity,\u201d and so forth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Place names such as \u201cBoston\u201d or \u201cConnecticut Valley\u201d are similarly used. We do not believe that these epithets are taken very seriously by the public. It is generally understood that the same expression is employed, often with little justification, by many persons and corporations, and that its use in different places and especially in different lines of business does not indicate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>identity of proprietorship. For example, few people of intelligence would be likely to mistake the name \u201cBoston Liquor Company\u201d for the name \u201cBoston Stores Inc.\u201d We are not convinced that it is otherwise when the common epithet is \u201cNational\u201d or \u201cFirst National.\u201d Moreover, the word \u201cLiquor\u201d in the name of the defendant points to a special kind of business in which the plaintiff was not here engaged, and the word \u201cStores\u201d in the name of the plaintiff suggests a group of stores, which the defendant did not have. If material in a proceeding of this kind, there is nothing to show that the words \u201cFirst National\u201d had acquired in the liquor business a secondary meaning designating the plaintiff. It does not seem to us that the situation is altered by any association in the public mind between the food business and the liquor business as now carried on.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\">The decided cases depend upon special considerations in each case and are not particularly helpful. In <em>International Trust Co. </em>v. <em>International Loan &amp; Trust Co. </em>153 Mass. 271, it was held that the defendant\u2019s name was \u201cso nearly identical with the plaintiff\u2019s that it would mislead\u201d (page 276), but that if the words \u201cof Kansas City\u201d were added, it would not (page 277). In <em>Burns </em>v. <em>William J. Burns International Detective Agency, Inc. </em>235 Mass. 553, it was held that the similarity between the names \u201cBurns Detective Bureau\u201d and \u201cWilliam J. Burns International Detective Agency, Inc.\u201d did not call for injunctive relief. In <em>Hub Dress Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Rottenberg, </em>237 Mass. 281, it was held that the use by the defendants of the name \u201cHub Novelty Dress Company\u201d was not unfair to the plaintiff, where both were engaged in the manufacture of dresses but were not competitors. In <em>Libby, McNeill &amp; Libby </em>v. <em>Libby, </em>241 Mass. 239, it was held that the defendant\u2019s use of the name \u201cLibby &amp; Libby Co. of Massachusetts\u201d was not likely to mislead where, although both the plaintiff and the defendant were engaged in branches of the meat business, they came only slightly into conflict in the market. In <em>John L. Whiting-J. J. Adams Co. </em>v. <em>Adams-White Brush Co. </em>260 Mass. 137, where both corporations manufactured brushes, this court said, at page 141, \u201cThere is in fact no such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>identity or likeness in the two names as to deceive one of ordinary prudence or to justify the interference of a court of equity.\u201d In <em>Highland Dye Works, Inc. </em>v. <em>Anteblian, </em>270 Mass. 209, it was held that an exception would not lie to the master\u2019s finding that \u201cHighland Dye House\u201d was not likely to be confused with \u201cHighland Dye Works\u201d by persons of ordinary intelligence (page 212), but other elements entered into the decision of the case. In <em>National Shoe Corp. </em>v. <em>National Shoe Manuf. Co. Inc. </em>302 Mass. 449, where the factories of the respective parties were located in different cities and did not make shoes of the same character and price, we refused to disturb an implied finding \u201cto the effect that a person of average intelligence would not be misled or readily confused.\u201d Page 452. See <em>C. H. Batchelder &amp; Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>220 Mass. 42; <em>Canadian Club Beverage Co. </em>v. <em>Canadian Club Corp. </em>268 Mass. 561; <em>Tent, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>269 Mass. 211; <em>Economy Food Products Co. </em>v. <em>Economy Grocery Stores Corp. </em>281 Mass. 57; <em>Women\u2019s Mutual Benefit Society, St. Mary of Carmen </em>v. <em>Catholic Society Feminine of Maria, S. S. of Monte Carmelo, </em>304 Mass. 349; and <em>China Clipper Restaurant, Inc. </em>v. <em>Yue Joe, </em>312 Mass. 540. We have examined decisions in other jurisdictions cited by the plaintiff. Many are collected in 66 Am. L. R. 971 and in 115 Am. L. R. 1241. It may be that their general trend is more favorable to the plaintiff than that of our own cases; but they are not decisive on the question of fact here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\">We conclude that the corporate name of the defendant is not \u201cso similar to that of the plaintiff as to be likely to be mistaken for it,\u201d within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 155, \u00a7 9, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">There is before us an appeal from an interlocutory decree overruling the defendant\u2019s demurrer to the bill. This appeal has become unimportant, since we have dealt with the case broadly on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">\n<em>Appeal from interlocutory decree dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">\n<em>Final decree reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">\n<em>Decree to be entered dismissing the bill with costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-5\"> The plaintiff sold beer in Connecticut and beer and wine in Vermont.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-5\"> Business corporations, banks, and insurance companies are forbidden to take \u201cCommonwealth,\u201d \u201cState,\u201d and \u201cUnited States\u201d as part of their corporate names by G.
