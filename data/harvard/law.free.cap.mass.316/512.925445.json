G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 213, \u00a7 1D, inserted by St. 1943, c. 374, \u00a7 4. The judgment upon the petition for a writ of certiorari quashed the proceedings and the decision therein of the State ballot law commission ordering that the name of \u201csaid Francis E. Kelly\u201d should \u201cnot appear upon the official ballot as a candidate for the office of Attorney General under the political designation of Democratic.\u201d The judgment upon the petition for a writ of mandamus was that such a writ should issue commanding the Secretary of the Commonwealth to print or cause to be printed the name of Francis E. Kelly upon the official ballot. The details of these judgments need not be recited.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The question decisive of both cases is whether the State ballot law commission had jurisdiction to render the decision rendered by it in view of the provision added by St. 1943, c. 334, \u00a7 12, to G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 26, relating to objections to nomination papers of candidates to be voted for at the State primaries: \u201cNo such objection shall be considered by the boards provided for in section twelve, unless there is filed with such board a certificate of enrolment issued by the board of registrars of voters, or the clerk of the same, where the person filing the objections resides, stating that he is an enrolled voter of the party whose nomination is sought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Objections to nomination papers of said Kelly were duly filed by Francis D. Harrigan with the Secretary of the Commonwealth and were by him transmitted to the State ballot law commission. Thereafter said Harrigan filed with the State ballot law commission a document for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>complying with the requirement of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7 26, as amended by St. 1943, c. 334, \u00a7 12, of a \u201ccertificate of enrolment.\u201d This document purported to be a certificate that it appeared from the records of the office of the board of election commissioners of the city of Boston that the name of said Harrigan \u201cis borne upon the Voting List of Ward 15 Precinct 4 City of Boston, for the year 1944.\u201d Such a document obviously was not a \u201ccertificate of enrolment\u201d that the said Harrigan was \u201can enrolled voter of the party whose nomination is sought,\u201d within the meaning of the governing statutory provision. The statutes contain express provisions relating to party enrolment. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 53, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, as amended by St. 1943, c. 334, \u00a7\u00a7 14-15. A person whose name is \u201cborne upon the Voting List\u201d is not necessarily \u201can enrolled voter\u201d of any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\">The defect in the document as a \u201ccertificate of enrolment\u201d was not cured by the statement at the top thereof \u201cEnrolled Democrat Frank A. Sughrue Elect. Dept.\u201d There is no separate certification of this fact, and the document as a whole cannot properly be read as certifying this fact. The words quoted are not incorporated in the body of the document to which alone the words of certification apply. And we think that the words cannot be read into the body of the document as a certification that said Harrigan was an \u201cEnrolled Democrat.\u201d For aught that appears upon the face of the document, the words \u201cEnrolled Democrat\u201d constitute merely a memorandum. See <em>Merrell </em>v. <em>Tice, </em>104 U. S. 557, 561. Although these words are followed by the words \u201cFrank A. Sughrue Elect. Dept.,\u201d they are not clearly authenticated as descriptive of a fact appearing on the records of the board of election commissioners, such an authentication being the purpose of the required certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">It is unnecessary to determine whether the document filed with the State ballot law commission was defective in any other respect as a \u201ccertificate of enrolment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">In the absence of a \u201ccertificate of enrolment\u201d in conformity with the statutory requirement, the State ballot law commission had no jurisdiction to consider the objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>tions of Francis D. Harrigan to the nomination papers of Francis E. Kelly. The language of the statute is clearly mandatory, prohibiting consideration of objections in the absence of a \u201ccertificate of enrolment.\u201d We cannot read into the statutory provision any exception on the ground of the probable purpose of the Legislature in enacting it. The statutory prohibition is stated in clear language and must be regarded as expressing the legislative intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The decision here rendered upon the petition for a writ of certiorari is decisive upon the petition for a writ of mandamus. The final judgment entered on each of these petitions must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
