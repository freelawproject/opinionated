Initiative Petition 40, if adopted, would amend ORS 677.097, which now requires a physician or podiatric physician and surgeon to disclose certain information to a patient to obtain the patient\u2019s informed consent to a procedure or treatment. The amendment, if adopted, would require a \u201chealth care provider\u201d to make additional disclosures and fulfill new procedural duties if the patient is \u201c[a]ny woman seeking an abortion * *</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Appendix A to this opinion sets out the text of Initiative Petition 40. For that proposed measure, the Attorney General certified the following ballot title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">\u201cREQUIRES MEDICAL PROVIDERS MAKE SPECIFIED STATEMENTS TO PATIENTS BEFORE ABORTIONS, REPORT COMPLIANCE; REQUIRES INFORMATION PUBLICATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">\u201cRESULT OF TES\u2019 VOTE: Tes\u2019 vote requires medical provider to: provide specified statements to patient 24 hours before abortion, report compliance; requires state to publish specified information about abortions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-10\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote retains current law requiring medical provider to obtain patient\u2019s informed consent to abortion after explanation of risks and alternatives; retains current statistical reporting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-11\">\u201cSUMMARY: Current law requires physician to: obtain patient\u2019s informed consent for abortion by explaining in general terms the procedure, risks, alternative treatments/procedures; provide more information on request. Measure requires medical provider to have conversation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>with patient at least 24 hours before abortion about abortion risks, gestational age of fetus, medical risks of pregnancy. Requires provider, before abortion, to: make specified statements about medical benefits, child support; receive patient\u2019s written certification indicating statements were made. Expands current reporting requirements to include whether and how statements were made to patient. Requires state to print and place on website specified materials containing: specified information about abortion, services available for pregnancy, childbirth, care of children; showing visual representations of fetuses. Provides no funding for additional state duties. Other provisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">We have examined the contentions of petitioner Wyant regarding the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title and conclude that none is well taken. An opinion explaining in detail the basis for that conclusion would not benefit the parties, the bar, or the public. However, for the reasons explained below, some of the arguments that the <em>Nichols </em>petitioners advance are well taken and require a modification of the ballot title that the Attorney General has prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">OREGON\u2019S LAW OF INFORMED CONSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">A brief discussion of the law of Oregon regarding \u201cinformed consent\u201d is necessary for a proper understanding of the dispute presented here. As a general matter, the phrase \u201cinformed consent\u201d refers to a physician\u2019s duty to inform a patient of the health risks involved in a proposed medical procedure and the availability of feasible alternative procedures. This court held in <em>Mayor v. Dowsett, </em>240 Or 196, 233, 400 P2d 234 (1965), that a physician\u2019s failure to obtain a patient\u2019s consent before performing an operation \u201cwould * * * be a violation of the established standard of care and actionable as malpractice.\u201d <em>In Mayor, </em>the court remanded the case for a jury trial on the question of informed consent, because the evidence was sufficient to create a factual question whether the defendant doctor had informed the plaintiff before surgery of known dangers from a spinal anesthetic. <em>Id. </em>at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">In <em>Getchell v. Mansfield, </em>260 Or 174, 180-83, 489 P2d 953 (1971), the court clarified that the physician\u2019s responsibility to warn of risks extends only to material risks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>with serious consequences, not to all possible risks. Additionally, the court required the introduction of expert testimony to establish the materiality of the risk in question, but relieved plaintiffs of any obligation to introduce expert testimony that it is the custom of physicians in the locality to give warnings in similar cases. <em>Id. </em>at 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">In 1977, the legislature enacted ORS 677.097 to specify the steps that a physician must take to obtain the informed consent of a patient to a medical procedure or method of treatment. Or Laws 1977, ch 657, \u00a7 1. The enactment of ORS 677.097 \u201ccodified the essence of the <em>Getchell </em>decision * * * with some modification.\u201d <em>Tiedemann v. Radiation Therapy Consultants, </em>299 Or 238, 247, 701 P2d 440 (1985). ORS 677.097 currently provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">\u201c(1) In order to obtain the informed consent of a patient, a physician or podiatric physician and surgeon shall explain the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">\u201c(a) In general terms the procedure or treatment to be undertaken;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">\u201c(b) That there may be alternative procedures or methods of treatment, if any; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">\u201c(c) That there are risks, if any, to the procedure or treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">\u201c(2) After giving the explanation specified in subsection (1) of this section, the physician or podiatric physician and surgeon shall ask the patient if the patient wants a more detailed explanation. If the patient requests further explanation, the physician or podiatric physician and surgeon shall disclose in substantial detail the procedure, the viable alternatives and the material risks unless to do so would be materially detrimental to the patient. In determining that further explanation would be materially detrimental the physician or podiatric physician and surgeon shall give due consideration to the standards of practice of reasonable medical or podiatric practitioners in the same or a similar community under the same or similar circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">Failure to comply with the foregoing statutory requirements can serve as a factual predicate for an action for malpractice. <em>See Arena v. Gingrich, </em>305 Or 1, 7, 748 P2d 547 (1988) (court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>remanded for trial negligence claim that physician violated ORS 677.097 by failing to obtain patient\u2019s informed consent to surgery).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">PROPOSED CHANGES TO ORS 677.097</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The proposed measure in this case would make several additions to ORS 677.097. Among other additions, subsection (3) A of the proposed measure would require a \u201chealth care provider\u201d or a \u201creferring health care provider\u201d to give an expanded notification to a female who seeks one particular medical procedure: an abortion. The expanded notification obligation would have both substantive and procedural components, which we outline below.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The proposed measure would require notification not only of the medical risks of the procedure, as under current law, but also of the probable gestational age of the unborn child and the medical risks to the female of carrying the unborn child to term. Subsection (3) A(2) of the proposed measure also would require a health care provider to provide the required information \u201cin a conversation with the female in which the female may ask questions [,] \u201d and would prohibit providing the information through a recording. The proposed measure would require that the notification precede, by at least 24 hours, the performance of the abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Subsection (3) B of the proposed measure also would impose an additional notification obligation on \u201c[a] health care provider who is to perform an abortion, a referring health care provider, an agent of the health care provider who is to perform the abortion or an agent of the referring health care provider.\u201d That subsection would require notice to the female that medical assistance benefits may be available for prenatal, childbirth, and neonatal care; that the father may be required to assist in the support of the child despite any offer to pay for the abortion; that the female has the right to certain information provided by the Department of Human Services; that the State of Oregon provides that information, that the information includes a description of an unborn child, and that it is available in print form and on a state-maintained Internet website; and that the party providing the notice will deliver the information from the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>of Oregon either in person 24 hours before the abortion or by certified mail 72 hours before the abortion. The party providing the notice described in that paragraph must do so either in person or by telephone 24 hours before the performance of the abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">The proposed measure would require the female to certify in writing that she has received the information that the health care provider must provide under the proposal. It also would require the health care provider or that party\u2019s agent to receive a copy of the female\u2019s written certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The proposed measure would require the Department of Human Services to print materials that, among other things, would inform a female about services that are available to her; the \u201cprobable anatomical and physiological characteristics of an unborn child at two-week gestational increments [;]\u201d and abortion procedures commonly employed, the medical risks commonly associated with those procedures, the possible detrimental physiological effects of an abortion, and the medical risks of carrying a child to term. The proposed measure would require the State of Oregon\u2019s materials to include other information and would require the state to provide that information on a website, the resolution of which is \u201cnot less than 72 dots per inch,\u201d to print the information in 10-point type in multiple languages, and to update the information annually. The proposed measure also specifies the content of the required notification that it would require a health care provider to deliver, if possible, when a medical emergency compels termination of a pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">For purposes of addressing this ballot title dispute, three aspects of the additions to ORS 677.097 described in the proposed measure are significant. First, the proposed changes would alter current Oregon law that now requires physicians who provide abortion services to make specific disclosures to the physician\u2019s patients that explain (1) in general terms the procedure or treatment to be undertaken; (2) possible alternative procedures or methods of treatment, if any; and (3) the risks, if any, from the procedure or treatment. Under current law, the physician must ask the patient if she wants a more detailed explanation. If she does, then the physician must make additional detailed disclosures about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>those three matters unless to do so would be materially detrimental to the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Second, in general, the proposed measure would obligate a health care provider, who is to perform an abortion, to notify the female patient of an additional quantum of medical facts and opinions and a variety of data about the abortion procedure and other matters. The notification would be required to occur within the timelines and by the methods of communication that the proposed measure specifies. The proposed measure declares that, except in the case of a medical emergency, for which the proposed measure requires a separate notification to the pregnant female, \u201cconsent to an abortion is voluntary and informed only if, at least 24 hours before the abortion, the female receives by telephone or in person the information required by this section pursuant to the process and in the manner set forth\u201d in the proposed measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Third, the proposed measure does not disturb the civil liability of a health care provider who conducts a medical procedure without the patient\u2019s informed consent. The proposed measure, if adopted, would render a pregnant woman\u2019s consent to a nonemergency abortion to be involuntary and uninformed unless the health care provider who performs the abortion, a referring health care provider, or their agent gives a notice to the woman that complies in every respect with all the substantive and procedural requirements for such a notice that the proposed measure identifies. In legal terms, any failure of compliance by a health care provider with every substantive and procedural notice requirement that the proposed initiative describes would expose the health care provider, under Oregon law, to potential civil liability for medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">THE CAPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">ORS 250.035(2)(a) requires a ballot title for a state measure to include a 15-word caption \u201cthat reasonably identifies the subject matter of the state measure.\u201d This court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>\u201cBecause the caption is the cornerstone for the other portions of the ballot title, the caption must identify the subject matter of the proposed measure \u2018in terms that will not confuse or mislead potential petition signers and voters.\u2019 <em>Mabon v. Myers, </em>332 Or 633, 637, 33 P3d 988 (2001).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><em>Kain v. Myers, </em>333 Or 497, 502, 41 P3d 1076 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The <em>Nichols </em>petitioners argue that an accurate caption must identify the proposed measure as a \u201cprohibition\u201d on abortion unless the medical provider complies with the new notification requirements regarding abortion that the proposed measure would add to the informed consent statute. As a description of the proposed measure\u2019s subject matter, petitioners\u2019 point is debatable. On the one hand, the proposed measure plainly contemplates a complete cessation of non-emergency abortion services to pregnant women during at least the 24-hour period following the required notification. Any physician who provided an abortion before expiration of the 24-hour waiting period following notification would face potential civil liability for malpractice due to the lack of informed consent. In a practical sense, and especially considering the perspective of the pregnant woman, those aspects of the proposed measure would operate to prohibit access to abortion services at least until the notification period expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">On the other hand, the proposed measure, by amending the informed consent statute, heightens the physician\u2019s risk of civil liability for noncompliance with the statute without imposing a specific prohibition on the act of performing an abortion itself. Because the proposed measure would affect a female\u2019s informed consent to abortion \u2014 a civil law concept \u2014 questions exist about whether a female either may waive the statute or covenant to refrain from seeking its protection. We do not address those questions except to note that the proposed measure lacks any words of prohibition that might preclude a female\u2019s attempt to sidestep the additional notification requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The foregoing indicates that it is not essential that the caption identify the proposed measure as a \u201cprohibition\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>on abortion to state accurately the proposed measure\u2019s subject matter. We conclude that, under our substantial compliance standard of review, the Attorney General\u2019s caption does not fall short of statutory requirements for that reason.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The <em>Nichols </em>petitioners next argue that the Attorney General\u2019s caption falls short of statutory requirements because it fails to disclose that the proposed measure creates no medical emergency exception to the notice requirements when the life or health of the mother are at risk. Subsection (3) E of the proposed measure creates a special notification requirement that applies if compliance is \u201cpossible\u201d in cases of medical emergency but otherwise does not modify a provider\u2019s authority in cases of medical emergency. Thus, as the Attorney General points out, the proposed measure leaves in place whatever the law might be regarding a provider\u2019s duty to comply with notice requirements or to take other actions regarding a medical emergency. That feature of the proposed measure, although important as a general matter, concerns what the proposed measure fails to create, not what it would create. Particularly in light of the word limitation that governs the caption, we cannot conclude that the Attorney General\u2019s caption falls short of statutory requirements for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u201cYES\u201d AND \u201cNO\u201d VOTE RESULT STATEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">ORS 250.035(2)(b) and (c) require \u201csimple and understandable\u201d statements of not more than 25 words that describe the result if the voters approve the proposed measure and if they reject it. The <em>Nichols </em>petitioners challenge the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d vote result statements. They contend that the \u201cyes\u201d vote result statement must mention that the proposed measure would \u201cprohibit abortions until after specified statements are made and after a waiting period.\u201d For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d vote result statement is not deficient for the reason that the <em>Nichols </em>petitioners urge.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>The <em>Nichols </em>petitioners also assert that the \u201cno\u201d vote result statement is insufficient because it fails to disclose that \u201ccurrent state law provides for a limited medical emergency exception.\u201d The Attorney General responds that, at present, ORS 677.097 contains no medical exception provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The <em>Nichols </em>petitioners argue that, under <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, </em>505 US 833, 879-80, 112 S Ct 2791, 120 L Ed 2d 674 (1992), the absence of a medical emergency exception \u201cmay render a statute such as this unconstitutional.\u201d We conclude, however, that petitioners\u2019 argument falls short of demonstrating that the Attorney General has erred, under our \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d standard, in failing to recite, in the \u201cno\u201d vote result statement, that current state law provides a medical emergency exception. The state law sources that petitioners cite are less than clear on that question. Moreover, <em>Casey </em>sustained a statutory definition of medical emergency against a constitutional attack. It is difficult to extrapolate from that holding that federal constitutional law compels Oregon to recognize a medical emergency exception as a matter of state law. Finally, even if <em>Casey </em>forbids states from restricting abortions under a medical emergency, as the <em>Nichols </em>petitioners advocate, the Attorney General properly may conclude that that proposition offers no point of contrast between the proposed measure and current law and, thus, the \u201cno\u201d vote result statement need not mention it.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The Attorney General\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d vote result statements do not fall short of statutory requirements for the reasons that the <em>Nichols </em>petitioners advocate.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The summary is a \u201cconcise and impartial statement of not more than 125 words summarizing the state measure and its major effect.\u201d ORS 250.035(2)(d). The purpose of the summary \u201cis to help voters understand what will happen if the measure is approved, and * * * [it] should * * * be worded so that voters will understand the breadth of its impact.\u201d <em>Fred Meyer, Inc. v. Roberts, </em>308 Or 169, 175, 777 P2d 406 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>For the reasons expressed above, we reject the <em>Nichols </em>petitioners\u2019 argument that the summary must tell voters that the proposed measure \u201cwould prohibit abortions in the absence of specified statements and a waiting period, even in the case of a medical emergency.\u201d Nevertheless, for other reasons that the <em>Nichols </em>petitioners assert, the Attorney General\u2019s summary is not accurate and requires modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The Attorney General\u2019s summary purports to state current Oregon law as follows: \u201cCurrent law requires physician to: obtain patient\u2019s informed consent for abortion by explaining in general terms the procedure, risks, alternative treatments/procedures; provide more information on request.\u201d ORS 677.097(2) provides, in part, that \u201c[a]fter giving the explanation specified in subsection (1) of this section, the physician or podiatric physician and surgeon <em>shall ask the patient if the patient wants a more detailed explanation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The Attorney General\u2019s summary contains an error regarding current Oregon law. The phrase \u201cin general terms\u201d is part of ORS 677.097(l)(a), but does not appear in subsections (b) or (c). The Attorney General\u2019s summary indicates that the physician must explain \u201cin general terms\u201d each of the three items of medical information that ORS 677.097(1) sets out. However, the physician has an additional statutory duty to ask the patient if the patient wants a more detailed explanation than the one delivered under ORS 677.097(1). The Attorney General\u2019s summary fails to disclose that duty. The Attorney General\u2019s failure to refer in the summary to the physician\u2019s responsibility to ask the' patient whether she desires a more detailed explanation incorrectly indicates to a reader that the patient now receives an explanation in general terms and nothing more, unless she happens to request more information. The Attorney General must modify the summary to address that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The Attorney General\u2019s summary indicates that the proposed measure would require the physician to deliver certain information in a \u201cconversation\u201d with the patient. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>summary then describes other information that the physician must convey but fails to disclose that the proposed measure would authorize delivery of that information by means other than a conversation, such as by a tape recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">The Attorney General asserts that petitioners resist any reference to a \u201cconversation\u201d in the summary. Additionally, the Attorney General acknowledges that the proposed measure authorizes the physician to deliver some statements through a tape recording under certain circumstances but that the Attorney General\u2019s summary accurately reflects both provisions (i.e., those relating to notice by conversation and by tape recording).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The Attorney General\u2019s arguments are wrong on both counts. The reference in the summary to notification by conversation for some components of the physician\u2019s information, coupled with silence about permissible methods of communication regarding other information, creates the incorrect inference that the proposed measure either would require the physician to deliver the entire notification in a conversation with the patient or would say nothing about other required and authorized methods of communication. If the Attorney General has determined that the method of communication is a necessary part of the summary, then the summary must refer to the authorized methods of communication in a way that accurately reflects the proposed measure\u2019s text. The Attorney General must modify the summary to address those errors. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Ballot title referred to the Attorney General for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Be It Enacted by the People of the State of Oregon:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">OR8 677.097 is hereby amended by supplementing the law on informed consent of patient by adding section (3):</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">(3) Any woman seeking an abortion shall be given information regarding the health risks associated with the procedure and oertain other information prior to obtaining an abortion.
