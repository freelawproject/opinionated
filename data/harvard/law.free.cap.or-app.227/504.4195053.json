Hall, </em>225 Or App 63, 200 P3d 164 (2008). In that decision, we accepted the state\u2019s concession that, under the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Ice, </em>343 Or 248, 170 P3d 1049 (2007), the trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences based on facts found by the court rather than by a jury. Since then, however, the United States Supreme Court has reversed the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s decision, <em>Oregon v. Ice, </em>555 US_, 129 S Ct 711, 172 L Ed 2d 517 (2009), holding that the constitutional right to a jury trial does not apply to decisions to impose consecutive sentences. In light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision, we agree that the trial court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion withdrawn; affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
