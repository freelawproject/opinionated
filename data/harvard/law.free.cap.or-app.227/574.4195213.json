Defendant\u2019s amended answer alleged an affirmative defense of settlement and compromise and three counterclaims under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC section 1692 (the Act). The matter went to the jury, which determined that the parties had entered into a prior settlement agreement and further determined that, in failing to carry out the terms of the settlement agreement and in pursuing litigation subsequent to settlement, plaintiff had \u25a0engaged in conduct that constituted a violation of the Act. The trial court\u2019s judgment awarded plaintiff $4,159.57, the amount of the prior settlement. It also awarded defendant statutory damages of $1,000 under the Act, together with costs and disbursements and attorney fees. Plaintiff appeals, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s allowance of testimony to prove the settlement agreement, to the court\u2019s allowing defendant\u2019s motion to file a second amended answer, to the court\u2019s failure to strike defendant\u2019s affirmative defense of compromise and settlement, and to its failure to dismiss two of defendant\u2019s counterclaims under the Act at the conclusion of the trial. Defendant filed a cross-assignment of error, contending that the trial court erred in dismissing one of her counterclaims under the Act. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The relevant facts are largely undisputed. We state them in the light most favorable to defendant, who prevailed before the jury on her affirmative defense and counterclaims. <em>Parrott v. Carr Chevrolet, Inc., </em>331 Or 537, 542, 17 P3d 473 (2001). Defendant guaranteed Armani\u2019s student loan of $4,000 from US Bank. Armani defaulted, and US Bank referred the debt to plaintiff for collection and assigned to it any rights to collect the unpaid principal amount of the debt. On March 11, 2004, plaintiff sent defendant a letter demanding payment of the debt. Defendant discussed the debt with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>plaintiffs general manager, Taylor. Taylor told defendant that she would be sued if she did not honor the guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Defendant retained an attorney, Soofi. On April 9, 2004, Soofi contacted Taylor and offered to settle defendant\u2019s obligation by payment of the principal amount of the debt. Taylor told Soofi that, in view of their negotiations, he would not initiate a lawsuit. He then obtained US Bank\u2019s authorization to accept payment of the principal amount owed in full settlement of the debt. The bank confirmed that agreement in writing by an April 15, 2005, letter to Taylor: \u201cUS Bank agrees to accept [Armani\u2019s] offer to pay the principal balance of her * * * student loan. We will waive all accrued interest and consider this loan paid in full upon receipt of the principal payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Taylor testified that he and Soofi reached a settlement on April 15, 2004. Defendant agreed to pay the principal amount of the debt, $3,990.47, and plaintiffs \u201ccourt costs\u201d of $169. On April 26, Soofi and Taylor agreed to a payment schedule requiring defendant to pay the debt in two installments, a payment of $2,000 on May 31 and the balance of the obligation on June 30. As a condition of payment, Taylor agreed to send Soofi a letter confirming the settlement and providing any information that plaintiff had concerning Armani\u2019s location.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Soofi received defendant\u2019s $2,000 installment payment on May 14, and deposited it in a client trust account pending receipt of Taylor\u2019s letter. Soofi called Taylor on May 14 and again on June 4 and June 13, to remind him of his obligation to provide written corroboration of settlement and the debtor\u2019s whereabouts, so that she could forward defendant\u2019s payment. On May 14, Soofi reached Taylor, and he apologized for the delay and agreed to provide the letter. On June 4, Soofi left a message for Taylor. On June 13, she talked to Taylor again, and he agreed to provide the letter and to extend the first payment due date to June 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Soofi left for a two-week vacation on June 18, and instructed her secretary to look for Taylor\u2019s letter and to send a check to Taylor for the first installment when she received it. Unbeknownst to Soofi or Taylor, defendant\u2019s debt was already in the litigation pipeline. The matter had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>referred by plaintiff to its attorney, who had already filed the complaint in this proceeding on April 14, 2004. Defendant was served with the complaint and summons in late June. When Soofi returned from her vacation, she had a telephone message from defendant describing the complaint and expressing concern that the matter was not settled. Soofi called defendant and explained that the service of the complaint was probably a mistake. She wrote a letter to plaintiffs attorney on July 9, reiterating the terms of the settlement agreement, enclosing defendant\u2019s first payment, and asking that the complaint be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Plaintiff disputed that the matter had been settled and continued to pursue this litigation. Plaintiff told Soofi that, once the complaint had been filed, there would be no settling the matter. Defendant filed an answer, asserting several affirmative defenses, including compromise and settlement, and three counterclaims under the Act. The trial court submitted two of the counterclaims to the jury, and the jury found for defendant, determining that the parties had reached a settlement of the underlying debt, and that the settlement included a requirement that plaintiff send Soofi a letter providing contact information for Armani before defendant was required to pay. The jury further found that defendant had complied with the terms of the settlement and that plaintiffs conduct subsequent to the settlement involved false, deceptive, or misleading representations in connection with the debt, the natural consequence of which was to harass, oppress, or abuse defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">On appeal, plaintiff assigns error to the trial court\u2019s consideration of oral testimony concerning the terms of the alleged settlement agreement and to the court\u2019s failure to strike defendant\u2019s affirmative defense of compromise and settlement, on the ground that any settlement reached by the parties was void and unenforceable under the statute of frauds. As plaintiff correctly notes, the underlying guaranty was subject to the statute of frauds as an agreement to answer for the debt of another, ORS 41.580(1)(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In plaintiffs view, the settlement agreement also was subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>statute of frauds, as a <em>modification </em>of the guaranty. <em>Wash. Squ. v. First Lady Beauty Salons, </em>290 Or 753, 761, 625 P2d 1311 (1981) (explaining that an agreement governed by the statute of frauds likewise may be modified only by a written agreement if the agreement as modified would also be within the statute of frauds). Plaintiff contends that the settlement agreement modified the original guaranty by adding a new term \u2014 that payment was conditioned on defendant\u2019s receipt of a letter concerning Armani\u2019s whereabouts. Further, plaintiff contends, even if the settlement constituted a new and separate agreement from the original guaranty, it was still an agreement to pay the debt of another, and therefore subject to the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Defendant contends that the settlement agreement was not a modification of the guaranty; rather, it was a separate agreement to settle defendant\u2019s obligation to plaintiff that was not an agreement to pay the debt of another and that was not independently subject to the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">We agree with defendant that the settlement agreement was not a modification of the guaranty. Defendant never disputed her obligation under the guaranty or that she owed the debt. The parties point to no provision of the guaranty that was changed by the parties\u2019 arrangement concerning the manner of the guaranty\u2019s payment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant did not take on a new obligation or modify an obligation to pay Armani\u2019s debt. The settlement was directed to the satisfaction of a previously existing obligation that was undisputed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Contrary to plaintiffs contention, we conclude that the settlement agreement itself was not a guaranty or an agreement to answer for the debt of another \u2014 it was purely a settlement of defendant\u2019s undisputed obligation to plaintiff under the terms of the guaranty. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in concluding that it was not subject to the statute of frauds and in admitting and considering oral testimony of the agreement\u2019s terms.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">In its second assignment of error, plaintiff asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing defendant to file a second amended answer and counterclaims and in failing to strike the counterclaims. Plaintiff does not direct any argument to the question of any abuse of the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in allowing the filing of the second amended answer. ORCP 23 A (leave of court to amend pleading \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires\u201d). Instead, plaintiff argues only about the legal sufficiency of the counterclaims. Therefore, we limit our discussion to those issues. Plaintiffs third and fourth assignments of error raise similar challenges to the legal sufficiency of the allegations of violations of the Act. Accordingly, we address those assignments together.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is intended as a \u201cremedial statute aimed at curbing what Congress considered to be an industry-wide pattern of and propensity towards abusing debtors.\u201d <em>Clark v. Capital Credit &amp; Collections Services, Inc., </em>460 F3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir 2006). The Act provides for a right of action and strict liability for certain unlawful debt collection practices that are false, deceptive, misleading, unfair, or harassing. The Act provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>for actual damages for the debt collector\u2019s failure to comply with the Act, 15 USC section 1692k(a)(1), and statutory damages of $1,000 per proceeding, per defendant, 15 USC section 1692k(a)(2)(A). The standard for whether there has been a violation of the Act is an objective one, viewing the facts from the perspective of the \u201cleast sophisticated debtor.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>460 F3d at 1171. The Act describes the types of conduct that constitute violations. Section 1692d provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\">\u201cA debt collector may not engage in any conduct the natural consequence of which is to harass, oppress, or abuse any person in connection with the collection of a debt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Section 1692e provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">\u201cA debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading misrepresentation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Section 1692f provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">\u201cA debt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">In each subsection, the Act provides a nonexclusive list of examples of conduct that violates that particular provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">The gist of defendant\u2019s case was that, in repudiating the settlement agreement and continuing to pursue a collection of the debt through litigation and in excess of the amount of the settlement, plaintiff violated sections 1692d and 1692e of the Act. Defendant also contended that plaintiffs conduct was unfair and unconscionable within the meaning of section 1692f. Defendant\u2019s second amended answer asserted three violations of the Act:</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">(1) In her first counterclaim, defendant alleged that, by refusing to comply with its obligations under the settlement agreement and continuing to pursue the litigation after settlement had been reached, plaintiff \u201cengaged in conduct, the natural consequence of which, is to harass, oppress or abuse [defendant] in connection with the collection of a debt,\u201d in violation of 15 USC section 1692d.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">(2) In her second counterclaim, defendant alleged that, by representing that the dispute had been settled, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>plaintiff would provide the required letter, and that defendant did not need to make the first payment toward the settlement agreement until plaintiff had provided the letter, and nonetheless serving defendant with the complaint and continuing the litigation, plaintiff \u201cattempted to collect a debt from defendant * * * by use of false, deceptive or misleading representations,\u201d in violation of 15 USC section 1692e.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">(3) Defendant\u2019s third counterclaim alleged that plaintiffs conduct as alleged in the first counterclaim constituted the use of unfair or unconscionable means to collect a debt, in violation of 15 USC section 1692f.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">After both parties had submitted their evidence, plaintiff moved to strike each of the counterclaims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiff contended that any communications made by plaintiff to defendant\u2019s attorney do not fall within the Act as a matter of law. Plaintiff also argued that, in the absence of an agreement by plaintiff that it would not pursue litigation on the guaranty, a continuation of the litigation was not, as a matter of law, a violation of the Act. The trial court granted plaintiffs motion with respect to the third counterclaim, which alleged a violation of 15 USC section 1692f, because it did not believe that the evidence would support a finding that plaintiff had acted through unfair or unconscionable means. The court allowed the first and second counterclaims to go the jury. By special verdict, the jury found that plaintiff had engaged in conduct that constitutes violations of 15 USC sections 1692d and e.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">On appeal, plaintiff continues to raise an assortment of legal challenges to the trial court\u2019s decision to submit the two counterclaims to the jury. We confine our examination to the legal bases for the motion for directed verdicts that were presented to the trial court. ORAP 5.45(1). Those legal bases were that representations made to defendant\u2019s attorney were not actionable under 15 USC section 1692e and that filing and maintaining a lawsuit were insufficient to create liability under either 15 USC section 1692d or section 1692e. We review the trial court\u2019s determinations on the motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>directed verdicts for errors of law. <em>Mauri v. Smith, </em>324 Or 476, 479, 929 P2d 307 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Plaintiff first contends that, the purpose of the Act being the protection of unsophisticated and vulnerable consumers, representations or collection efforts made to the consumer\u2019s attorney do not provide the basis for a claim under the Act. Several federal courts have weighed in on that issue, and there appears to be a split among the circuits. In <em>Guerrero v. RJM Acquisitions, LLC, </em>499 F3d 926, 936 (9th Cir 2007), a panel of the Ninth Circuit held, with one judge dissenting, that, when a debtor is represented by an attorney and a \u201cfalse, deceptive, or misleading representation\u201d is directed only to the debtor\u2019s attorney, but not to the debtor, the communication is not actionable under section 1692e. Under that logic, communications made by plaintiff to Soofi would not be actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In <em>Sayyed v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, </em>485 F3d 226, 232 (4th Cir 2007), the Fourth Circuit held that a communication to the debtor\u2019s counsel, regarding a debt collection lawsuit in which counsel was representing the debtor, were within the scope of the Act. And in <em>Evory v. RJM Acquisitions Funding LLC, </em>505 F3d 769, 773 (7th Cir 2007), the Seventh Circuit held that liability attaches under sections 1692d, 1692e, and 1692f of the Act for false, misleading, or deceptive representations or other abusive, deceptive, or unconscionable acts against a debtor\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">We conclude that <em>Sayyed </em>and <em>Evory </em>are better reasoned and that a \u201cfalse, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt\u201d under section 1692e of the Act includes communications by the debt collector to the debtor\u2019s attorney. Section 1692e includes examples of conduct that violate the section, including various acts of \u201ccommunication.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Act defines \u201ccommunication\u201d broadly as \u201cthe conveying of information regarding a debt <em>directly or indirectly to any person </em>through any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>medium.\u201d 15 USC \u00a7 1692a(2) (emphasis added). A \u201crepresentation\u201d under section 1692e, then, could include specific \u201ccommunications\u201d that can be \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d made to the debtor. The other conduct that is specifically and generically defined as actionable representations under section 1692e would have that same characteristic \u2014 of being a direct or indirect communication to the debtor. There is no reason to construe the section to cover only certain indirect communications and not others. The text of section 1692e plainly proscribes <em>\u201cany </em>false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Similarly, a \u201cdebt collector\u201d under the Act is \u201cany person who * * * regularly collects or attempts to collect, <em>directly or indirectly, </em>debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due.\u201d 15 USC \u00a7 1692a(6) (emphasis added). We construe \u201crepresentation\u201d under section 1692e to include direct or indirect communications to the debtor and indirect communications to include communications to the debtor through the debtor\u2019s attorney.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Our conclusion is supported by the result reached by the Supreme Court in <em>Heintz v. Jenkins, </em>514 US 291, 293, 115 S Ct 1489, 131 L Ed 2d 395 (1995), a case involving a claim under the Act for communications between the creditor\u2019s attorney and the debtor\u2019s attorney. The Court held that the Act encompasses communications between lawyers in the context of litigation. Although the issue on review in that case was whether the creditor\u2019s lawyer was a \u201cdebt collector,\u201d the claim under the Act was based on a communication with the debtor\u2019s attorney. The Court\u2019s holding implicitly suggested that communications with the debtor\u2019s attorney are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>subject to the Act. Thus, whether plaintiffs communications with defendant\u2019s attorney in this case constituted a violation of the Act was a question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Plaintiff contends, further, that the continuation of litigation after the parties reached a settlement is not, as a matter of law, a violation of the Act, because plaintiff never expressly agreed to discontinue the <em>litigation </em>\u2014 i.e., never \u201cmisrepresented\u201d that it would discontinue litigation. That is particularly so, plaintiff asserts, in light of the fact that there was a dispute as to the terms of the settlement agreement and whether a letter from Taylor as to Armani\u2019s location was a prerequisite to payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Heintz </em>disposes of plaintiffs contention. In <em>Heintz, </em>a debtor sued a lawyer and his law firm under the Act because of a false statement by the lawyer to the debtor\u2019s counsel about the amount allegedly owed. The Court held that conduct engaged in through litigation can constitute a violation of the Act and that the Act \u201capplies to litigating activities of lawyers.\u201d 514 US at 294. The Court rested its conclusion on the definition of \u201cdebt collector\u201d at section 1692a(6), as including those who \u201cregularly collecft] or attemp[t] to collect, directly or indirectly, [consumer] debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.\u201d The Court\u2019s reasoning undercuts plaintiffs claim that there should be an immunity from liability under the Act for litigation actions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Defendant\u2019s core assertion was that, after the parties had settled, it was improper under the Act for plaintiff to continue to take a position in the litigation and make representations that were inconsistent with what the jury ultimately determined to be the terms of settlement. Generally, whether a debt collector\u2019s conduct has violated the Act is a question of fact for the jury, unless no reasonable jury could find a violation. <em>Turner v. J.V.D.B. &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>330 F3d 991, 998 (7th Cir 2003) (question of violation of section 1692e was for jury, but violation of section 1692f was decided by court as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>matter of law). We cannot conclude as a matter of law that the taking of a position in litigation that is inconsistent with the terms of a settlement agreement can never be a violation of the Act. The text of the Act itself does not preclude a claim on that theory. Plaintiffs argument to the contrary, although couched in terms of statutory construction, is really a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. To whatever extent plaintiff preserved those factual assertions, we determine, based on our review of the record, that the evidence was sufficient to permit defendant\u2019s claims to be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"AMC\">In her cross-assignment of error, defendant asserts that the trial court erred in striking her counterclaim under 15 USC section 1692f, contending that there is evidence from which the jury could have found that plaintiffs conduct in attempting to collect interest and attorney fees after the parties had settled their dispute was \u201cunfair or unconscionable.\u201d Defendant\u2019s contention should have been raised by way of a cross-appeal because, if successful, it would require a reversal of the judgment and remand for trial of the claim under 15 USC section 1692f. ORAP 5.57.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Samuel v. </em>King, 186 Or App 684, 690-91, 64 P3d 1206, <em>rev den, </em>335 Or.443 (2003) (holding that a respondent\u2019s assignment of error that would yield relief different from that awarded by trial court judgment was not properly before appellate court unless raised by cross-appeal); <em>Ricciardi v. Frink, </em>133 Or App 436, 447, 891 P2d 1336, <em>rev den, </em>321 Or 268 (1995) (where the respondent\u2019s contention would, if successful, require modification of the judgment, yielding \u201crelief the trial court expressly denied, [the respondent] was obliged to file a cross-appeal\u201d).

That requirement, however, does not apply if no party to the agreement is a financial institution, consumer finance company, or mortgage banker. ORS 41.580(1)(h)(A).
