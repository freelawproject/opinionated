In particular, husband asserts that the court erred in (1) entering a supplemental judgment incorporating wife\u2019s proposed plan for refinancing the parties\u2019 real property (the Butte Falls property or the property) to pay husband his share of the equity in the Butte Falls property; (2) valuing the Butte Falls property at $296,520 and awarding it to wife, rather than ordering it sold and the net proceeds equitably divided; and (3) ordering husband to pay wife maintenance spousal support and in reducing that support obligation to a \u201clump sum present value.\u201d On <em>de novo </em>review, ORS 19.415(3), we affirm in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">We begin with an overview of the facts, but supplement those facts in more detail as necessary in the context of the relevant assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Husband and wife met in 1975 and lived together in Poway, California, until July 1978. Wife worked in a retail clothing store and husband was a part-time brand inspector. In 1978, wife moved to Oregon with husband\u2019s mother. Husband remained in California to help develop ranch property that he had received from his family in 1975 (the Poway property). Wife took care of husband\u2019s mother and earned money selling firewood from the property in Oregon where they were living. Husband visited and occasionally sent wife money.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">In July 1982, a month before the birth of their second child, the parties married. They signed a prenuptial agreement expressing their intent to retain their respective separate property rights in the property they each owned at the time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The agreement also stated that either spouse could make additional gifts to the other and that such gifts would become the separate property of the receiving spouse. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>their marriage, husband continued to live in California and work on developing the Poway property. The parties eventually had a total of six children together, two of whom were minors (ages 11 and 16) at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">In 1987, wife moved to the Butte Falls property with the children and her mother-in-law. The Butte Falls property, which consisted of five separate tax lots totaling approximately 117 acres, was purchased for $100,000 cash and titled solely in wife\u2019s name. According to wife, the money to purchase the property came from refinancing the Poway property. Husband testified that he had the Butte Falls property titled in wife\u2019s name alone because he wanted to protect it from attachment by his creditors; wife testified that it was put in her name \u201cin case anything happened to him, that the kids and I would have some place to live.\u201d Wife and the parties\u2019 two minor children were living on the Butte Falls property at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">From 1987 until 1995, when wife started working as a school bus driver, wife sold firewood from the Butte Falls property for income. Wife then worked part time as a school bus driver from 1995 until 2003. She accumulated a small retirement (PERS) account during that employment. In 2002, she obtained her real estate license and, in 2003, began working as a commission-based real estate agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Meanwhile, during much of this time, husband was still living in California and working on developing the Poway property. In 1990, he entered into a partnership in connection with that property; his partner apparently loaned the partnership over $2 million to pay off debt on the Poway property. In 1992, husband\u2019s partner filed suit against both husband and wife, and the partnership was dissolved. Kauffman, the attorney who represented husband and wife in that litigation, eventually obtained separate judgments against each of them for unpaid legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">In late 1996, after losing the last of the Poway property, husband moved to Oregon and lived with the family on the Butte Falls property. He worked as a school bus driver and also sold cars for a period. In 2002, he, too, obtained a real estate license, and he began selling real estate that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>II. TRIAL COURT PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Wife filed a petition for dissolution in December 2002. In October 2004, after Kauffman obtained a judgment lien on the Butte Falls property and began foreclosure proceedings, wife filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under 11USC section 362 (chapter 13).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That action was pending in federal bankruptcy court when the trial began on October 28, 2005; some documents related to it were admitted into evidence as wife\u2019s exhibit 7. The parties\u2019 assets at the time of trial consisted of the Butte Falls property (subject to various encumbrances); an array of vehicles, farm equipment, and other personal property; and wife\u2019s PERS account (which contained a balance of less than $8,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In her trial memorandum and at trial, wife argued that the Butte Falls property was a gift and, thus, under the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement, should be awarded to her as her separate property. Husband\u2019s position was that the Butte Falls property was a marital asset; he proposed that it be sold and the proceeds be divided between them in accordance with a plan that he submitted with his trial memorandum. At trial, he expressed concern that, if he were awarded an equalizing money judgment instead, that judgment could be discharged in wife\u2019s bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">After wife and husband had each presented their case, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Has the Bankruptcy Court put a value on the Butte Falls property? Has anyone put a value on the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>\u201c[Wife\u2019s counsel]: \u2014[N]o recent appraisal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: I would think if you wanted to hold on to it, you\u2019d want me to know what it\u2019s worth, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">\u201c[Wife\u2019s counsel]: Well, only if it was totally going to her. But obviously if it\u2019s going to \u2014 the reality of it, Your Honor, is that * * * she recognizes that the Court determines it to be a marital asset. The only choice is to sell it, I think with the way things are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">\u201c[Husband\u2019s counsel]: And in all fairness to Counsel, there is some value assigned to it. It\u2019s in the bankruptcy documents, which have been admitted into evidence and including of which should be \u2014 or maybe it isn\u2019t. But there was a value assigned by Petitioner in her bankruptcy concerning this asset. And it should be in the bankruptcy documents they have submitted. And if I can find it I will notify you where it\u2019s located.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">After some further discussion, the court noted that a schedule included with those documents, which had been admitted as wife\u2019s exhibit 7, indicated that the value of the Butte Falls property was \u201calmost $300,000.\u201d Wife agreed that \u201c[t]hat would be the right number,\u201d but added, \u201c[tjhat is a very, very, very low estimate\u201d as to the Butte Falls property\u2019s value as of a year before trial. Husband did not object to the court\u2019s use of that estimate, nor did he request to offer his own evidence on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">At the end of trial, the court told the parties that it planned to set out a proposed judgment in a letter opinion and give the parties \u201ca chance to respond if I\u2019ve missed something or if something is clearly contrary to what evidence you gave me, just so we start to hone it in a little bit better,\u201d before entering final judgment. As relevant to this appeal, the court\u2019s subsequent letter opinion ordered husband to pay wife spousal support in the amount of $1,000 per month for 60 months, rejected wife\u2019s argument that the Butte Falls property was a gift, and determined the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-11\">\u201cThe Butte Falls property is valued at $296,520. There was insufficient evidence at trial to establish exactly what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>encumbrances exist against this property. One or both of the Kauffman judgments may be encumbrances; the 1988 Federal tax bill may be an encumbrance; and there was reference made to borrowing money against the property. [Wife] will be allowed to keep possession of the property if she can present a viable plan for selling off enough of this property to satisfy the following obligations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\">\u201c1. Pay off all encumbrances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">\u201c2. Pay to respondent a sum equal to the following: $148,260 (1/2 of the value of the property), minus one half of all encumbrances. From the remaining balance, $60,000 would be deducted which represents the spousal support obligation as set forth above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The court specifically invited the parties to respond to that proposed decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Husband responded by letter, noting the court\u2019s apparent adoption of wife\u2019s valuation of the Butte Falls property contained in exhibit 7 \u201cwithout consideration of her subsequent bankruptcy filing * * * on August 25,2005,\u201d in which \u201c[wife] represented to the court that she claimed ownership of \u2018five separate parcels of real property comprising 117 acres located in Jackson County, Oregon which [wife] value[d] at approximately $1,000,000.\u2019 \u201d Husband maintained his position that, \u201c[b]ecause there was no appraisal of this property,\u201d \u201cthe most equitable disposition of this property is its sale and an equal division\u201d of the proceeds. Husband further objected to the court\u2019s award of spousal support to wife without making findings, as well as to the method of payment. Wife also responded to the court\u2019s proposed decision with a list of questions and comments. After reviewing the parties\u2019 submissions, the court issued a second letter opinion, clarifying some points and articulating additional findings in support of the court\u2019s award of maintenance spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">On October 17, 2006, the court entered a general judgment \u2014 drafted by husband\u2019s attorney \u2014 adopting its findings from the earlier letters and awarding the Butte Falls property to wife, if, within 15 days, she presented a \u201cviable plan\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for selling or refinancing the property to pay off the encumbrances and to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>\u201c[p]ay to [husband] a sum equal to: $148,260 (1/2 of the value of the property), minus one half of all encumbrances. From the remaining balance $60,000 would be deducted which represents the spousal support obligation as set forth in paragraph 5, reduced to $54,000 which the court determined as the present value of that support, further reduced by any payment of support made up to and before the time [husband\u2019s] interest is paid off and increased by any spousal support arrearage, including interest at the legal rate on unpaid installments. Any child support arrearage or other judgments owed to [wife] by [husband] shall be paid from these proceeds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">If wife failed to timely present a viable plan, the judgment provided that the property was to be sold and the proceeds divided according to the court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In accordance with the general judgment,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> wife submitted a plan proposing to finance a 10-acre portion of the Butte Falls property and use the proceeds to satisfy her obligation to husband and pay off the various debts and encumbrances on the property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">At a hearing on the proposal, husband, appearing without his attorney, expressed concern about the viability of the loan: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a loan for $350,000 on a piece of property that\u2019s valued at $300,000. It seems a little bit suspect.\u201d At a second hearing on October 30, 2006, husband\u2019s counsel argued that wife\u2019s plan was not viable because (1) her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>bankruptcy petition had since been dismissed and foreclosure was proceeding against the Butte Falls Property; and (2) \u201c[t]hat\u2019s in addition to the fact that she\u2019s been able to obtain financing on less than a tenth of the property for [sums] substantially in excess of what the Court determined to be the value.\u201d After considering husband\u2019s objections, the court entered a supplemental judgment, ordering implementation of wife\u2019s proposed plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AvN\">A. <em>First Assignment of Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In his first assignment of error, husband argues that the trial court lacked statutory authority to enter the supplemental judgment incorporating wife\u2019s plan to refinance the property. According to husband, once the judgment was entered, the court \u201chad the statutory authority to enforce its terms, but could not modify it by means of a supplemental judgment.\u201d Wife responds that the error was not preserved; on the merits, she argues that the supplemental judgment merely implemented or enforced the general judgment and thus was not an impermissible modification of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">We agree with wife that husband did not preserve his claim of error. Husband asserts, without elaboration, that the error is preserved because, at the October 30 hearing, he objected to wife\u2019s plan for refinancing and asked the court to order a sale of the property. Husband\u2019s statement of the record is correct \u2014 throughout the proceedings before the trial court, including at the October 30 hearing, husband asserted that the Butte Falls property should be sold. However, at that hearing, husband objected only to the <em>substance </em>of wife\u2019s proposed plan. At no time did he object to the court\u2019s intention \u2014 as reflected in the court\u2019s letter opinion and in the general judgment \u2014 to approve the plan for final division of the property at a future time.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">In short, merely arguing against the substance of wife\u2019s refinancing plan was insufficient to alert the court to the alleged deficiency that husband now raises on appeal\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>that is, that the court lacked statutory authority to implement that plan by way of supplemental judgment. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claimed error was preserved in the lower courtlf); <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000) (to preserve a claim of error, \u201ca party must provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">B. <em>Second Assignment of Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Next, husband asserts that the trial court erred in undervaluing the Butte Falls property and awarding it to wife, rather than adopting husband\u2019s proposal that it be sold. Quoting <em>Stevenson and Stevenson, </em>168 Or App 673, 680, 7 P3d 648 (2000), he contends that, because \u201cthe trial court \u2018was not provided with adequate information to assign a specific value\u2019 \u201d to the Butte Falls property and was unsure of which of the parties\u2019 debts were liens against the Butte Falls property, the only equitable solution was to order that that property be sold. In response, wife argues, first, that husband\u2019s claim of error is unpreserved; on the merits, wife asserts that, under the circumstances, the trial court properly valued the property and made a \u201cjust and equitable\u201d division of the property by awarding it to wife and requiring wife to pay husband for his interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">We begin with preservation. The precise value of the property was not an issue that either party focused on at trial \u2014 husband, because he maintained all along that the property should be sold; wife, because it was her position that the property was her separate property and, if the court determined otherwise, \u201c[t]he only choice is to sell it[.]\u201d Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>at trial, both parties were operating under the assumption that, if the property was determined to be marital property, the property would be sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">It was not until the court issued its first letter opinion that the court indicated that it intended instead to award the property to wife with an offsetting payment to husband and to base that award on the $296,520 valuation included in wife\u2019s exhibit 7. It was at that point \u2014 in response to an explicit invitation from the court to comment on its ruling before final judgment was rendered \u2014 that husband objected. Specifically, husband challenged the court\u2019s use of the $296,520 figure and asserted that, without better information as to the property\u2019s value, the most equitable disposition was to sell the property and divide the proceeds, the precise argument he now makes on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">We conclude, under the circumstances of the case, that husband\u2019s actions were adequate to preserve his argument for appeal. First, given the way the issues were framed below, husband objected to the court\u2019s use of the valuation of the property contained in wife\u2019s exhibit at the first point in the proceedings at which he could fairly have expected that valuation was an issue. More significantly, the trial court had an opportunity to consider husband\u2019s argument and correct its error if warranted. <em>See Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 222, 191 P3d 637 (2008) (preservation rules \u201cserve[ ] the salutary purpose of permitting the trial court to avoid making an error or to correct an error already made\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Turning to the merits, we first note that the success of husband\u2019s argument necessarily depends on his assertion that it was error for the court to use the $296,520 assessment of the property\u2019s value. Husband does not explain, however, how any evidence before the trial court persuasively contradicts the valuation on which the trial court relied, nor does our own examination of the record lead to that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Husband references a subsequent bankruptcy filing in which wife allegedly valued the property significantly higher than the estimate used by the court. Husband also made that assertion in his response to the trial court\u2019s letter opinion; however, he did not move to reopen the record to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>include evidence of that filing or ask the court to take judicial notice of it. In short, the evidence that husband refers to is not in the record before us and, therefore, we do not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Husband also points to evidence that wife was able to obtain a loan for $352,000 secured by the property. Husband provides no detailed argument as to why this necessarily renders the trial court\u2019s valuation invalid except to surmise that \u201c[i]t is hard to imagine that a lender would loan [w]ife $352,000 on property worth $296,520.\u201d Without more, that evidence is insufficient to convince us that the trial court made a mistake. <em>Briggs and Briggs, </em>49 Or App 569, 571-72, 619 P2d 1353 (1980), <em>rev den, </em>290 Or 491 (1981) (\u201c \u2018The role of the appellate court [on <em>de novo </em>review] is not to substitute its preferences for that of the lower court * * * unless our preference is motivated with sufficient conviction to proclaim that the trial court made a mistake.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>McCoy and McCoy, </em>28 Or App 919, 926, 562 P2d 207 (1977))); <em>see also Gardner and Gardner, </em>212 Or App 148, 156, 157 P3d 320 (2007) (\u201cThis court repeatedly has stated that it will not micro-manage trial court decisions that disentangle the economic affairs of divorcing spouses, unless we can meaningfully improve on such decisions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In sum, although the evidence in the record regarding the property\u2019s valuation is admittedly scant, it nonetheless supports the trial court\u2019s determination of the issue. Husband chose not to present his own evidence of valuation at trial, nor did he make any attempt to reopen the record for that purpose after the court issued its letter opinion clearly expressing its intent to rely on the valuation contained in wife\u2019s exhibit. Instead, he remained steadfast in his position that the only option was to order a sale of the property and let the market determine its value. As a result, the only evidence before the court was wife\u2019s valuation. In the absence of any countervailing evidence, we agree with the trial court\u2019s decision to accept that valuation. As in Stevenson,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c[t]here is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>ample authority for what was done here, namely, to make the best possible estimate of the value of husband\u2019s interest given the quality of the evidence.\u201d 168 Or App at 680. We decline to disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\">C. <em>Third Assignment of Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">In husband\u2019s final assignment of error, he asserts that the court erred in (1) ordering husband to pay maintenance spousal support to wife and (2) reducing that support obligation to a \u201clump sum present value.\u201d We begin with husband\u2019s first contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The trial court determined that wife was entitled to maintenance spousal support of $1,000 per month for five years, after finding that husband\u2019s current gross income is $4,800 per month and wife\u2019s current gross income is $1,700 per month. The court made the following additional findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">\u201cThe parties have lived in a marriage or marriage like relationship since 1975, more than 30 years. [Wife] is 53 years old, [husband] will soon be 57 years old. The evidence at trial established that husband, during the entire period of the relationship between the parties, had a significantly greater income earning capacity than did wife. Evidence further established that wife raised the parties\u2019 children, with very little assistance from husband.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Husband does not dispute the trial court\u2019s findings as to the parties\u2019 relative incomes, but contends that an award of support is not \u201cjust and equitable\u201d under the circumstances of this case. The gist of husband\u2019s argument, as we understand it, is that because wife had four years prior to trial to establish her real estate career \u2014 the same amount of time as husband \u2014 \u201cthere is no reason to believe that her earning capacity does not equal that of [hjusband.\u201d Husband also notes that wife maintained a low standard of living during the marriage and that, although wife was primarily responsible for rearing the parties\u2019 children, only two were left at home at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Wife responds that the award is just and equitable because, due to her responsibility for caring for the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>and the property and dealing with the bankruptcy and dissolution, she has been unable to do the marketing necessary to establish herself as a real estate agent while husband, because he did not have those responsibilities, was able to devote himself full time to the real estate business. Wife also argues that the award is equitable because, using the incomes attributed to the parties by the court and considering the spousal support and child support ordered by the court, husband will still be left \u201cwith more income for a single person than [w]ife has for herself and two children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Under ORS 107.105(l)(d), the court is empowered to award spousal support in an amount and for a duration that is \u201cjust and equitable for one party to contribute to the other[.]\u201d In determining the amount and duration of maintenance spousal support, the court is to consider a number of enumerated factors, including the duration of the marriage, the age and health of the parties, the standard of living established during the marriage, the relative income and earning capacity of the parties, a party\u2019s employment skills and work experience, the financial needs and resources of the parties, custodial and child support responsibilities, and other factors the court deems just and equitable. ORS 107.105(1)(d)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">No single factor is dispositive. <em>Arand and Arand, </em>182 Or App 368, 374, 49 P3d 799 (2002). But, as the Supreme Court has explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">\u201ceconomic self-sufficiency of each spouse is to be the objective of a spousal support order pursuant to the statute. Thus, a spousal support order must recognize the effect of the marriage upon the capability of a spouse for economic self-sufficiency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-8\"><em>Lemke and Lemke, </em>289 Or 145, 148, 611 P2d 295 (1980). In setting the amount and duration of support, we keep in mind \u201cthe goal of ending the support-dependency relationship within a reasonable time if that can be accomplished without injustice or undue hardship.\u201d <em>Taylor and Taylor, </em>136 Or App 416, 419, 902 P2d 120 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">We first examine the relative income and earning capacity of the parties. As noted, in 2002, both husband and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>wife obtained real estate licenses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Husband began selling real estate that year and testified to an average gross monthly income, based on commissions, of $4,251.31. Wife, on the other hand, has been employed full time as a real estate agent only since April 2003. She testified that she works 30 to 40 hours per week, also on a commission basis, and that her gross income from real estate averages $1,000 month. She testified that she has been unable to fully devote herself to selling real estate because of the dissolution and bankruptcy litigation, maintaining the Butte Falls property, and taking care of the parties\u2019 children. She estimated that it would take her approximately five years to become established in the real estate business, indicating that, by that time, her youngest child would be 16 and would require less of her time.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Husband did not offer any evidence to controvert that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\">We turn to the other statutory factors. This is a long-term marriage. Wife devoted her time and labor during the past 25 years to raising the parties\u2019 six children, with little direct involvement by husband; she also took care of the parties\u2019 real property. As a result, with the exception of some limited part-time work, she was out of the workforce during that time. <em>See Taylor, </em>136 Or App at 419 (the extent to which a party\u2019s relative earning capacity is affected by an extended absence from the workforce for family considerations is a relevant consideration in determining spousal support). She now has the opportunity to reach the earning capacity of husband and become financially independent, but, given her other responsibilities \u2014 responsibilities that ultimately bene-fitted the marriage \u2014 she needs time to achieve that status. Moreover, at least for the next several years, wife will continue to have responsibility for being the primary caretaker of the parties\u2019 two minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Husband points to wife\u2019s statement that she had a \u201cpathetically low\u201d standard of living during the parties\u2019 marriage. Although husband does not elaborate, to the extent we understand him to be arguing that an award of support is thus not appropriate because wife can maintain that standard of living without support, we reject that position. <em>See Smith and Smith, </em>168 Or App 349, 354, 7 P3d 559 (2000) (stating that the primary objective of spousal support in a long-term marriage \u201cis to provide a not-overly disproportionate standard of living to that achieved during the marriage when the supported spouse cannot do so on his or her own\u201d). First, although a spousal support order must take into account the lifestyle enjoyed by the parties during the marriage, it is also based on circumstances existing at the time of dissolution. <em>Cullen and Cullen, </em>223 Or App 183, 190, 194 P3d 866 (2008). Here, the court found that \u2014 at the time of dissolution \u2014 husband\u2019s income was $4,800 per month while wife\u2019s was significantly lower, at $1,700.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Moreover, one of the reasons that wife had such a low standard of living during the marriage is that she largely stayed out of the workforce in order to care for the parties\u2019 children; the marriage thus negatively affected her \u201ccapability * * * for economic self-sufficiency.\u201d <em>Lemke, </em>289 Or at 148. Given those circumstances, and considering the parties\u2019 respective expenses, we find that the amount and duration of support ordered by the court is reasonable. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s award of spousal support in this case was \u201cjust and equitable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The question remains whether the trial court erred, as husband contends, in reducing husband\u2019s spousal support obligation to its lump sum present value. Wife concedes error. However, we do not agree with the parties\u2019 understanding of the law and, accordingly, do not accept the concession. <em>See State v. Bea, </em>318 Or 220, 224, 864 P2d 854 (1993) (holding that the Supreme Court need not accept party\u2019s concession concerning legal conclusion); <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Cowens, </em>143 Or App 68, 71, 922 P2d 1258, <em>rev den, </em>324 Or 395 (1996) (declining to accept state\u2019s concession of legal error); <em>see also Stull v. Hoke, </em>326 Or 72, 77, 948 P2d 722 (1997) (\u201cIn construing a statute, this court is responsible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>identifying the correct interpretation, whether or not asserted by the parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Under ORS 107.105(l)(d), a dissolution judgment may provide \u201c[f]or spousal support, an amount of money for a period of time as may be just and equitable for one party to contribute to the other, <em>in gross or in installments or both.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In this case, two provisions of the general judgment are relevant to the trial court\u2019s award of spousal support. Paragraph 5 awarded wife maintenance spousal support of $1,000 per month for a period of five years, or 60 payments, and provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">\u201cAfter [husband\u2019s] payment of the 60th payment, or upon payment of the present value of the support upon [wife\u2019s] completion of her \u2018viable plan\u2019 under paragraph 6, spousal support automatically terminates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Paragraph 6, in turn, first required wife, upon presentation of a viable plan for the Butte Falls property, to pay husband a sum equal to one-half the value of the property (less one-half of the encumbrances), and further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">\u201cFrom the remaining balance, $60,000 would be deducted which represents the spousal support obligation as set forth in paragraph 5, reduced to $54,000 which the court determined as the present value of that support * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">In supplemental briefing, husband argues that the court thus ordered both a monthly support award <em>and </em>a lump sum payment of support, a result not authorized by ORS 107.105(l)(d). Similarly, wife contends that the statute does not allow the type of \u201chybrid\u201d the court imposed \u2014 that is, an award of monthly installments converted to a lump sum if wife can \u201cpay off\u2019 husband. Wife argues that \u201cthe statute does not provide authority for the court to award installment payments on the one hand, but require them to be paid by a deduction from a party\u2019s share of property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Under the methodology outlined in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-11, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), the text of a statute is the starting point for its interpretation and presents the best evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent. If the text in context is unambiguous, our inquiry is over. <em>Id. </em>In examining the text of a statute, \u201cwords of common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>usage typically should be given their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">ORS 107.105(l)(d) authorizes the court to award spousal support \u201cin gross or in installments or both.\u201d \u201cGross\u201d is pertinently defined as \u201can overall total exclusive of deductions.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1002 (unabridged ed 2002); <em>see also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>798 (8th ed 2004) (defining \u201cin gross\u201d as \u201c[undivided; still in one large mass\u201d). \u201cInstallment\u201d means \u201cone of the portions into which a sum of money or a debt is divided for payment at set and usu. regular intervals.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The judgment in this case provided alternative awards, <em>both </em>of which fall within the plain meaning of the terms of the statute: (1) set payments ($1,000), payable at regular intervals (monthly for five years), <em>i.e., </em>an award \u201cin installments\u201d; and (2) an amount ($54,000), representing the \u201coverall total\u201d of the required installment payments (albeit reduced to its present value), <em>i.e., </em>an \u201cin gross\u201d award. We fail to see \u2014 and the parties do not explain \u2014 how the court\u2019s decision to provide one as an <em>alternative </em>to the other in the event that a stated contingency \u2014 that is, wife\u2019s plan to refinance the property and pay husband his share of it \u2014 does not materialize, runs afoul of the statute <em>where both methods are expressly authorized </em>by the terms of the statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The parties refer to the court\u2019s inability to modify an \u201cin gross\u201d award in the event of changed circumstances, as well as the potential negative tax implications of such an award, as reason for this court to find that the trial court erred. That, however, is an argument for the legislature.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>The fact that a ruling may be disadvantageous, or that both parties would prefer a different result, is not a basis for reversing a trial court\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>ORS 174.010 (\u201cIn the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is, in terms or in substance, contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted[.]\u201d). Here, the meaning of the statute is clear from its text. The trial court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-9\"> Husband\u2019s separate real property included the Poway property; wife\u2019s included a duplex in Medford.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b518-8\"> Wife\u2019s bankruptcy attorney testified that, although wife\u2019s filing triggered the automatic stay provisions of the federal bankruptcy code and stayed the forced sale of the Butte Palls property, the bankruptcy court subsequently granted modified relief from that automatic stay \u201crecognizing [the state court\u2019s] authority to determine the property matter especially regarding [wife\u2019s] ownership of [the Butte Palls property], so that [wife] could have [ownership] determined by State law[.]\u201d Wife then filed a proposed plan in connection with her bankruptcy petition whereby, once her ownership of the property was determined through the dissolution action, she would sell one parcel of the property to pay off Kauffman\u2019s judgment and her other creditors. When she failed to obtain an ownership determination within the time specified in the plan, she filed an adversary proceeding against husband to \u201csell the property free and clear.\u201d That proceeding was apparently pending in bankruptcy court when the trial in this case began.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b520-9\"> A \u201cviable plan,\u201d according to the judgment, could include a provision for selling a portion of the property, borrowing against the property to pay off husband\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>interest, or both. The plan was also required to include a list of encumbrances against the property and a proposal for how they were to be handled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b521-9\"> The judgment also awarded wife legal custody of the parties\u2019 two minor children, ordered husband to pay child support for those children and a third child attending college, and divided wife\u2019s PERS account and the parties\u2019 personal property roughly equally.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b521-10\"> Based on the court\u2019s earlier letter opinions, wife anticipated the court\u2019s ruling and actually submitted her proposed plan before the general judgment was entered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b521-11\"> Wife stated in her proposed plan that she had been \u201ccredit approved\u201d to finance a 10.4-acre portion of the Butte Falls property. As attachments, she included a letter from her lender and a preliminary title report. The letter from the lender stated simply that wife \u201chas been credit approved for financing on <em>the </em>property located at 8990 Butte Falls Highway.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The preliminary title report indicates that the loan was for $352,000 and that the title insurance covered all five tax lots included in the Butte Falls property. Thus, it is not clear from the record whether wife\u2019s loan was secured by a portion, or all, of the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b522-8\"> Indeed, husband\u2019s attorney drafted the general judgment, which clearly anticipates future court approval of the plan for the final division of the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\"> In any event, husband\u2019s claim would fail on the merits. He points to <em>Thomas and Thomas, </em>160 Or App 365, 369, 981 P2d 382 (1999), for the proposition that the property division provisions of a judgment are not modifiable. Although we do not disagree with that proposition as far as it goes, husband presents no reasoning as to why the supplemental judgment that the court entered here constitutes such a modification. The supplemental judgment does not change or alter the substantive provisions of the property division ordered in the general judgment; rather, it incorporates a plan to <em>implement </em>one of the alternatives ordered in that division. That, in our view, does not represent a modification of the property division.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b525-6\"> In <em>Stevenson, </em>the husband challenged a dissolution judgment on the basis that the trial court failed to assign a gross value to the wife\u2019s enhanced earning capacity. We affirmed, reasoning that, because the trial court awarded the husband the long half of the parties\u2019 assets by a margin that took into account the trial court\u2019s <em>best estimate </em>of the value of the husband\u2019s contribution to the wife\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>enhanced earnings, the court discharged its responsibility to determine an equitable value of that asset. 168 Or App at 680-81.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b528-4\"> Neither party reported any significant income from 1982 through 1997, with the exception of 1992, when husband\u2019s income (for Social Security purposes) was reported to be $35,700. From 1997 through 2002, both parties worked at relatively low-wage jobs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b528-5\"> She also testified that she has fibromyalgia but that, with treatment, it does not prevent her from doing real estate work or from doing the physical work necessary to take care of the Butte Falls property. Thus, we do not consider wife\u2019s health a significant factor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\"> Although not precisely on point, case law interpreting an earlier version of the statute, which authorized an award for maintenance \u201cin gross or in instalments [sic],\u201d Oregon Code, title VI, ch IX, \u00a7 6-914 (1930), lends support for our conclusion here. <em>See, e.g., Fuller v. Fuller, </em>175 Or 136, 143, 151 P2d 979 (1944) (interpreting statute as permissive, rather than exclusive, and upholding award that included both). <em>Miles v. Miles, </em>185 Or 230, 202 P2d 485 (1949), is not to the contrary, nor does it support wife\u2019s argument that \u201cin gross\u201d spousal support is precluded if an installment award would be adequate. Rather, in <em>Miles, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cinstallment-alimony\u201d without the addition of \u201calimony in gross\u201d was all that could be reasonably imposed on the defendant <em>under the specific circumstances of the case, i.e., </em>where the defendant could not pay the \u201cin gross\u201d amount and imposition of it would likely take all of the defendant\u2019s property. 185 Or at 237.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b531-8\"> We express no opinion as to the correctness of the parties\u2019 assessment of the consequences of an \u201cin gross\u201d award.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
