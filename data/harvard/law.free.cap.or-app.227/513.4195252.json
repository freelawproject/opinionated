J.</author>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Defendant was convicted of first-degree assault, ORS 163.185, unauthorized use of a vehicle, ORS 164.135, and first-degree theft, ORS 164.055. On appeal, he argues that the court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on the first-degree theft charge on the ground that the state presented insufficient evidence that the gun involved in the crime was an operable firearm. Defendant also argues that the trial court erred in sentencing him as a repeat property offender, pursuant to ORS 137.717, because the state failed to establish that he had committed the requisite predicate property offense. As explained below, we reject defendant\u2019s first argument but agree with his second. Accordingly, we affirm defendant\u2019s convictions but remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Because the jury found defendant guilty, we state the facts pertinent to defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Gibson, </em>338 Or 560, 562, 113 P3d 423, <em>cert den, </em>546 US 1044 (2005). Defendant went with several other individuals to the residence of Miller, the victim, who had not previously met defendant. Defendant offered to sell Miller a car, and Miller went with defendant to defendant\u2019s trailer. Miller intended to sell methamphetamine to defendant, gave defendant some methamphetamine, then left the trailer at defendant\u2019s request to check to see if any police officers were nearby. Before returning to the trailer, Miller moved a handgun that he carried in his date book into his waistband because he was afraid that defendant might steal his drugs. Miller had bought the handgun, which he identified at trial as <em>\u201ca .25 </em>automatic,\u201d the day before and had put ammunition into it. After Miller returned to the trailer, defendant struck him on the head with a metal object and fractured his skull. Defendant told Miller to give him the gun or defendant would hit him again. Miller gave defendant the gun. Defendant demanded that Miller give him his money, and Miller complied. Defendant then dropped Miller off at a restaurant, after which Miller was taken to the hospital for treatment of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Defendant was charged with first-degree theft under ORS 164.055, as follows: \u201cThe defendant, on or about February 4, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>2006, in Josephine County, Oregon, did unlawfully and intentionally commit theft of a handgun, a firearm, the property of another.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the close of the evidence at trial, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the theft charge, arguing that the state had failed to prove that the gun was a \u201cfirearm\u201d for purposes of ORS 164.055. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, and defendant was convicted of the theft offense, as well as the remaining offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on the theft charge. In particular, he argues that the state failed to prove that the theft was of a \u201cfirearm\u201d as that term is defined in ORS 166.210(3): \u201c \u2018Firearm\u2019 means a weapon, by whatever name known, which is designed to expel a projectile by the action of powder and which is readily capable of use as a weapon.\u201d Defendant argues that this case is comparable to <em>State v. Boone, </em>213 Or App 242, 160 P3d 994, <em>modified on recons, </em>215 Or App 428, 169 P3d 1274 (2007), in which we reversed convictions for theft of firearms. In that case, we reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\u201c[t]he state adduced no evidence about the guns, beyond the facts that they were stolen and kept in the gun safe that was taken from the storage unit. There was no evidence of how many guns were taken, what types of guns they were, and whether they were operable or readily capable of use as a weapon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 250. Defendant suggests that, because no testimony was presented that the gun had been test-fired or examined to determine its operability, the state failed to prove that it was operable or readily capable of use as a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>The state responds that it was not required to adduce evidence that the gun had been test-fired. Rather, the state asserts, it could present circumstantial evidence that the gun was operable or readily capable of use as a weapon. The state relies on cases such as <em>State v. Perry, </em>165 Or App 342, 996 P2d 995 (2000), <em>aff'd, </em>336 Or 49, 77 P3d 313 (2003), and <em>State v. Wise, </em>150 Or App 449, 946 P2d 363 (1997), and argues that such circumstantial evidence was sufficient in the present case to withstand a motion for judgment of acquittal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">In <em>Perry, </em>the defendant was carrying a concealed 9 mm handgun while at work in a store. The owner of the store had another gun near the cash register, but that gun was not operable. 165 Or App at 344. Although an officer testified that he performed a \u201cfunction check\u201d on the gun when he seized it, he did not explain what a \u201cfunction check\u201d entailed. He did not test-fire it, and the gun itself was not introduced into evidence at trial. On appeal, we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that there was insufficient evidence that the gun was operable or readily capable of use as a weapon to create a question for the trier of fact. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">\u201cHere, defendant was cited for unlawful possession of a firearm after the function check was performed. He knew that the gun provided by owner did not work and was surprised to learn that a license is needed to carry a concealed handgun at work. Finally, <em>the circumstances of defendant\u2019s employment and [the] manner in which he carried the gun are consistent with an intent to protect himself and owner\u2019s property. </em>These facts, taken together, permit a trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer found the handgun in working condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 345 (emphasis added). In <em>Wise, </em>the defendant was charged with theft of two weapons, identified by the victim as a .50-caliber muzzle loader and a 1942 German Mauser 8 mm hunting rifle. 150 Or App at 451. The victim testified in detail about how he had modified the muzzle loader for use as a hunting rifle and also described the Mauser as a hunting rifle with a scope on it. He further indicated that \u201che had taken defendant out shooting approximately six months before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>theft.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452. We concluded that that evidence was sufficient to create a jury question as to whether the guns were operable or readily capable of use as weapons. <em>Id. </em>at 452-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">In this case, there was evidence that Miller had purchased the gun with the intent of using it for personal protection. <em>See State v. Bennett, </em>79 Or App 267, 719 P2d 38, <em>rev den, </em>301 Or 667 (1986) (evidence that the defendant had purchased gun and ammunition from gun shop was sufficient circumstantial evidence that the gun met the definition of firearm). Moreover, Miller\u2019s testimony indicated that he was familiar with firearms. He loaded the gun and carried it on his hip, because he feared being robbed. Miller also identified what type of weapon it was and what type of ammunition it used. Moreover, the gun itself was admitted into evidence, and defendant does not suggest that anything about the gun, or the testimony about the gun, called into question its oper-ability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In these circumstances, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence that the gun met the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d to defeat a motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Defendant also argues that the court erred in sentencing him as a repeat property offender pursuant to ORS 137.717. In particular, the court imposed 13-month prison terms on defendant\u2019s convictions for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and first-degree theft, based on the prosecutor\u2019s representation that defendant had a prior conviction for \u201cRobbery with a Weapon in Nevada in 2001.\u201d Defendant argued that the state had not demonstrated that the Nevada conviction was for an offense that was comparable to those specified in ORS 137.717. The prosecutor responded that it was apparent from the title of the Nevada statute \u2014 Robbery with a Weapon \u2014 that the offense was comparable. Defense counsel responded that defendant had advised him that \u201cit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>was a robbery\u201d but that \u201c[t]here was not an enhancement held in \u2014 with a weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">On appeal, defendant asserts, and the state agrees, that the state failed to prove that the Nevada conviction was a \u201ccomparable offense\u201d for purposes of ORS 137.717(4)(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ORS 137.717(6) requires that the previous conviction \u201cmust be proven pursuant to ORS 137.079.\u201d ORS 137.079, in turn, concerns how the state is to prepare a presentence report and how a defendant may object to its contents. The state concedes that no evidence was adduced in the present case to satisfy its obligations under ORS 137.717 and ORS 137.079 to establish defendant\u2019s criminal history. On review of the record, we conclude that the state\u2019s concession is well taken, and we accept it. The trial court erred in imposing repeat property offender sentences pursuant to ORS 137.717 on defendant\u2019s convictions for unauthorized use of a vehicle and first-degree theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-7\"> ORS 164.055 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of theft in the first degree if, by other than extortion, the person commits theft as defined in ORS 164.015 and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-10\">\u201c(d) The subject of the theft is a firearm or explosive!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">ORS 164.015, in turn, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-12\"><em>\u201cA </em>person commits theft when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate property to the person or to a third person, the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-13\">\u201c(1) Takes, appropriates, obtains or withholds such property from an owner thereof!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b558-6\"> In that respect, this case is quite different from <em>State v. Briney, </em>345 Or 505, 200 P3d 550 (2008). In <em>Briney, </em>the question presented was whether a gun, which undisputably had a broken firing pin at the time the defendant possessed it, was nonetheless \u201creadily capable of use as a weapon.\u201d The state argued that the gun was \u201creadily\u201d capable of use as a weapon because, even though a replacement firing pin could not be purchased locally, it would have been possible for the defendant to order one over the Internet and have it shipped by overnight shipping. <em>Id. </em>at 508. The court rejected the state\u2019s argument, concluding that \u201cthe legislature intended that the firearm either be operational or promptly able to be made so\u201d at the time of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 516.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b559-6\"> ORS 137.717 requires mandatory minimum sentences for certain property offenses if the offender had previous convictions for specific property offenses. ORS 137.717(4)(b) defines previous convictions as including comparable offenses from other states or from federal court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
