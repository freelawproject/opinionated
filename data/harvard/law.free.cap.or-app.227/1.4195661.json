J.</author>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">This case is before us on remand from the Supreme Court, which vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Day, </em>201 Or App 215, 116 P3d 952 (2005) <em>(Day I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Day, </em>345 Or 315, 195 P3d 62 (2008). In Day <em>I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed a departure sentence based on judicial findings. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Day I </em>was proper. Accordingly, we again remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">Defendant was convicted of second-degree assault with a firearm and felon in possession of a firearm. The trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 100 months\u2019 imprisonment on the second-degree assault conviction. The court gave the following reasons for its decision to impose a departure sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-6\">\u201cI find it\u2019s appropriate to do a durational departure on the case based upon his criminal history and some other elements which I\u2019ll recite in just a moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-8\">\u201cThe basis for the departure is that I find that the manner in which the firearm was used was deliberately cruel. I find that his persistent involvement in unrelated type criminal activities has been long and persistent. And I find that that\u2019s a basis for an aggravation and an upward departure. I find that his long, continuous involvement in the drug culture from which this criminal activity arose is another basis. And I find that the fact that he was on probation or parole at the time of the occurrence of this crime is a further basis for a departure sentence. * * * [T]he fact that his criminal history exceeds that for which the guidelines accommodate, it\u2019s just a further basis for the durational departure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b24-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>In this case, the trial court did not explicitly state that it was relying on the departure factors it found either singly or in combination, and therefore we assume that the court did not consider each factor to be independently sufficient to support a departure. <em>State v. Wilson, 111 </em>Or App 147, 826 P2d 1010 (1992). Thus, remand for resentencing may be warranted if any one of the factors relied on by the trial court is subject to legitimate debate. <em>See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (setting out \u201clegitimate debate\u201d standard for exercise of discretion to review unpreserved challenges to departure sentences based on judicial findings of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">Because it is dispositive, we examine only the trial court\u2019s reliance on the \u201cdeliberate cruelty\u201d of defendant\u2019s crime. The evidence at trial and sentencing showed that defendant and the victim were engaged in an argument over their mutual efforts to obtain methamphetamine when defendant swung a motorcycle helmet at the victim. The victim picked up an ax and advanced toward defendant. Defendant shot the victim in the face; the victim was transported to the hospital and was released later that day. On this record, we cannot conclude that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have found that defendant acted with deliberate cruelty. The \u201cdeliberate cruelty\u201d of an act is one of the more subjective departure sentencing factors and, where, as here, a jury reasonably could conclude otherwise, we cannot say that there is no \u201clegitimate debate\u201d that the jury would have found this departure factor. <em>Cf. Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (finding no legitimate debate where \u201cno reasonable fact-finder\u201d could conclude other than that the victim suffered a permanent injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">We exercise our discretion to correct the error in this case for two reasons: First, as discussed, there is a legitimate debate whether the jury would have found one of the departure factors relied on by the trial court. Second, the gravity of the error in this case is not trivial. <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6. Imposition of the departure sentence in this case increased defendant\u2019s incarceration term by 30 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
