J.</author>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">This case is before us on remand from the Supreme Court, which vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Wilson, </em>201 Or App 212, 116 P3d 953 (2005) <em>(Wilson I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Wilson, </em>345 Or 316, 195 P3d 64 (2008). In <em>Wilson I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed departure sentences based on judicial findings. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Wilson I </em>was erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\"> Defendant was convicted of second-degree kidnapping and several other offenses after he stole a car in which the victim, a 17-month-old infant, was sleeping, and defendant subsequently engaged the police in a high-speed car chase. The trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on the kidnapping charge. The court gave the following reasons for its decision to impose a departure sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">\u201c[I]t\u2019s my job to sort of put things in perspective in terms of tempering\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">\u201c* * * \u2014 what you did versus \u2014 you know \u2014 other people who are charged similarly and get sentences. And this kidnapping charge \u2014 I have to say the part I thought was the most \u2014 and of course I didn\u2019t watch him get taken away, but the scariest part for me was the high-speed chase down Front Street with the baby in the back. You know, frankly, I don\u2019t care if somebody in a high-speed chase kills himself. You could kill [the victim]. And so you didn\u2019t. Thank God you didn\u2019t. But that was really an aggravating circumstance regarding the kidnapping charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\">\u201cThe legislature, on a straight kidnapping without aggravators, says * * * 70 months is appropriate. * * * But I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>do think durational departure is appropriate because of the fact that you were on parole. Just like I said, the degree of harm. And [defendant\u2019s mother] talking about the victim\u2019s family \u2014 I\u2019m talking about the victim himself in terms of what happened while he was in your care. And so I think those two things equally deserve an upward departure. So I am going to sentence you to 120 months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">In this case, the trial court did not explicitly state that it was relying on the departure factors it found either singly or in combination, and therefore we assume that the court did not consider each factor to be independently sufficient to support a departure. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>111 Or App 147, 826 P2d 1010 (1992). Thus, remand for resentencing may be warranted if one of the factors relied on by the trial court is subject to legitimate debate. <em>See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (setting out \u201clegitimate debate\u201d standard for exercise of discretion to review unpreserved challenges to departure sentences based on judicial findings of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">With regard to the first departure factor, defendant\u2019s post-prison supervision status, as we explained in <em>State v. Allen, </em>198 Or App 392, 396, 108 P3d 651, <em>adh\u2019d to as clarified on recons, </em>202 Or App 565, 123 P3d 331 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 46 (2006), an upward departure sentence based on a defendant\u2019s supervisory status \u201crequires further inferences about the malevolent quality of the offender and the failure of his [supervisory] status to serve as an effective deterrent.\u201d On this record, we readily conclude that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have drawn the inferences of malevolence and failure to be deterred required by <em>Allen-, </em>for the same reason, we also conclude that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have found that the harm inflicted by defendant in this case was aggravated.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In this case, the victim was 17 months old at the time of the crime and was strapped into his car seat in the rear of his mother\u2019s car as she stood beside the car. Defendant pushed her to the ground, got into the vehicle, and drove away. Later that evening defendant was driving the same car, with the victim still in his car seat, toward Salem when he was observed by the police. Defendant led officers on a chase through downtown Salem at speeds exceeding 90 miles per hour. Eventually, officers were able to disable the car by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>ramming it. Defendant jumped out, escaped on foot, and was finally captured after he broke into a residence, accosted the occupant, and fought with several Salem police officers and a canine unit. Although the victim was physically unharmed, the uncontroverted evidence of the car chase persuades us that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have found the departure factors that the trial court relied on. Accordingly, we decline to exercise our discretion to review the assigned error.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
