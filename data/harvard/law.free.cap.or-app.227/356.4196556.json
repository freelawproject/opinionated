Rambo, </em>209 Or App 598, 149 P3d 172 (2006) <em>(Rambo I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Rambo, </em>345 Or 316, 195 P3d 63 (2008). In <em>Rambo I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed a departure sentence based on judicial findings that defendant was persistently involved in similar offenses. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Rambo I </em>was erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree robbery, two counts of second-degree assault, felon in possession of a firearm, and possession of a controlled substance. The court imposed a dispositional departure sentence of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment on the felon in possession of a firearm conviction, explaining that it was defendant\u2019s \u201cfourth conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm since 1991.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">On this record, we readily conclude that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have found defendant to have been persistently involved in similar offenses. <em>See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (setting out \u201clegitimate debate\u201d standard for exercise of discretion to review unpreserved challenges to departure sentences based on judicial findings of fact). As we explained in <em>State v. Williams, </em>225 Or App 325, 328-29, 201 P3d 267 (2009), under <em>State v. Bray, </em>342 Or 711, 724, 160 P3d 983 (2007), there is no legitimate debate that a jury would have found a defendant to have been persistently involved in similar offenses where the number and frequency of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions compels the inference that his or her criminal behavior has been \u201cpersistent.\u201d As the trial court observed, defendant\u2019s current conviction for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>felon in possession of a firearm was his fourth conviction for that offense in 13 years. That evidence was uncontroverted and, in our view, overwhelming. Accordingly, we decline to exercise our discretion to review the assigned error.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
