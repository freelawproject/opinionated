The trial court found that, when A was six months old, mother shook him and caused serious injury. Based on that incident, a psychological evaluation, and other circumstances, the court held that mother was unfit by reason of extreme conduct, ORS 419B.502, and by reason of conduct or conditions seriously detrimental to A, ORS 419B.504, and that terminating mother\u2019s parental rights was in A\u2019s best interest, ORS 419B.500. On <em>de novo </em>review, ORS 419A.200(6)(b), we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion regarding extreme conduct; we therefore do not consider unfitness by reason of conduct or conditions. We also conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying mother\u2019s pretrial motion for a continuance and her subsequent motion to keep the record open for additional evidence. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">A was born on October 27, 2006. At the time, mother was 19 years old and living in Albany with her mother, Robison; her three-year-old sister, for whom she frequently provided childcare; and her boyfriend, McCready.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When A was one month old, mother discovered a bruise on his chest and took him to the pediatrician. The next day, prompted by an anonymous report to Albany police that A had been abused, a Department of Human Services (DHS) investigator met with mother, and Dr. Chervenak examined A at a child abuse victim assessment center. Chervenak concluded that A\u2019s bruise was \u201cconsistent with abuse.\u201d She told mother her findings, including the fact that A\u2019s bruise \u201ccouldn\u2019t have been done accidentally.\u201d (She later testified that the bruising was consistent with someone \u201cgrabbling] the skin and squeezing] as hard as they could.\u201d) DHS ultimately concluded, consistently with McCready\u2019s admission that he had \u201cpicked [A] up the wrong way,\u201d that McCready was responsible for the injury. At trial, mother testified that A\u2019s injury was \u201csolely an accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Mother, McCready, and DHS agreed on a safety plan, effective through June 18, 2007, prohibiting McCready from having contact with A. Because mother agreed to honor the safety plan, DHS did not file a jurisdictional petition at that time, and A remained in mother\u2019s care. Mother and McCready subsequently ended their relationship, and DHS closed its case regarding McCready in early March 2007 after he had relocated to a different county.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">In March 2007, mother and A (then five months old) moved to Vancouver, Washington, into the apartment of mother\u2019s new boyfriend, Guzman, where Guzman lived with his two cousins, Jamie and Roland, and Jamie\u2019s two young children. Roland testified that, although mother was \u201cgood at taking care of [A] from time to time,\u201d she would consume alcohol to the point of intoxication \u201c[ajbout every other night\u201d and, when \u201cdrinking and * * * really not in the mood for [A],\u201d would leave A \u201cwith [Jamie] and take off with [Guzman].\u201d Both Jamie and Roland testified that mother often became so \u201cfrustrated\u201d with A that she would need to leave the room. While mother was living with Guzman, mother\u2019s father and stepmother, the Criders, cared for A most weekends.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">On Monday morning, April 23,2007, mother went to the park with Jamie, Roland, and the children. Mother and A returned to the apartment around noon. Jamie, Roland, and Jamie\u2019s children returned to the apartment one hour later, A was napping. Later that afternoon, Jamie observed A in an infant exerciser \u201cslumped over,\u201d \u201cjust hanging there,\u201d and \u201cjust not doing anything really\u201d; because A was \u201cusually pretty active,\u201d this behavior concerned her.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">That evening, mother left A in Guzman\u2019s care and drove into town with a friend, Tefotiller. While mother and Tefotiller were stopped at a traffic light, Guzman\u2019s mother, Ramona, with whom mother did not get along, opened mother\u2019s passenger-side door and assaulted her. Concerned that Ramona might attempt to harm A, mother telephoned Guzman and instructed him to leave A at Tefotiller\u2019s residence, where a babysitter, Troupe, was caring for Tefotiller\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>The Criders agreed to pick up A at Tefotiller\u2019s apartment and met mother there. They observed that A was unusually quiet; Mrs. Crider noted that he was \u201calmost lethargic,\u201d \u201cwasn\u2019t moving very much,\u201d and was like a \u201crag doll.\u201d Mother explained that he had recently received immunizations and that his unusual behavior was a side effect. The Criders returned to their residence in Oregon City with A; mother stayed at the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">A slept \u201ca little bit longer than normal\u201d on Tuesday morning. The Criders left him with a state certified childcare provider that day from approximately 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. The provider \u201cexpressed] concerns about how [A] was acting.\u201d A slept through the night and had to be awakened on Wednesday morning, which was also unusual behavior for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">On Wednesday, April 25, the Criders again left A with the care provider. That afternoon, the provider called 9-1-1 and reported that A was \u201climp and unresponsive.\u201d He was taken by ambulance to Legacy Emanuel Hospital in Portland, where it was determined that he had suffered an acute subdural hematoma caused by trauma. Dr. Lindsay, the director of the hospital\u2019s pediatric intensive care unit, later testified that \u201cacute means * * * recent \u2014 the choices are acute or chronic \u2014 and [A\u2019s injury] was an acute one.\u201d However, he was unable to specify the precise date when A\u2019s injury had occurred; he testified that, although some \u201cpeople are pretty good at aging [such injuries], * * * [he is] not one of th[ose] people.\u201d A was admitted to the hospital\u2019s pediatric intensive care unit. Mother put McCready on A\u2019s hospital visitation list.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">That evening, Oregon City Police Detective Young interviewed mother at the hospital to investigate possible child abuse. Young testified that mother \u201ctold [him] right off the bat\u201d that Troupe was responsible for A\u2019s injury. Mother also told Young that A had appeared \u201cslightly floppy\u201d on Monday night, but that she had assumed that he was tired.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">On Thursday morning, April 26, mother met with a social worker, Johns, of CARES Northwest. Johns found that it was difficult to get information from mother because she was \u201cso tangential.\u201d Also that morning, Dr. Skinner, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>CARES pediatrician, examined A; she also found it difficult \u201cto get a clear history\u201d from mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Skinner determined that A had suffered multiple-layer retinal hemorrhages and a subdural hematoma, which she described as \u201cserious\u201d and \u201clife threatening\u201d injuries consistent with \u201csignificant trauma\u201d and \u201cshaking.\u201d She also determined that A\u2019s multiple-layer, as opposed to single-layer, retinal hemorrhages indicated \u201cmore significant trauma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">A was released from the hospital into mother\u2019s care on Friday afternoon, April 27. That evening, mother voluntarily met with Vancouver City Police Detective Holladay of the Arthur D. Curtis Children\u2019s Justice Center, a child advocacy unit, and Detective Young, who had interviewed mother at the hospital. Mother initially denied any involvement in A\u2019s injuries and blamed Troupe. When confronted with inconsistencies in her statements, however, she stated that she had \u201cnot [been] truthful with the doctors at the hospital and that some other things * * * had happened to [A].\u201d Mother then offered three explanations for A\u2019s injuries. First, she stated that, on Monday afternoon, A had \u201cflung himself backwards in her arm and bumped the back of his head against an open door.\u201d Mother next stated that, while she was consoling A after he had bumped his head on the door, A had \u201cbumped his head into the wooden arm on the side of the couch.\u201d Finally, mother stated that, after A had bumped his head on the couch, a small but \u201cheavy bottomed\u201d glass had \u201cslipped out of her hands * * * from a distance of about 12 inches * * * [and] bumped [A] on the head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Having been informed by Holladay that it was \u201chighly unlikely\u2019 that any of those events could have caused A\u2019s injury, mother began to sob and said that, after those events had occurred, she had placed A into the baby exerciser and, ten minutes later, because he would not stop crying, had \u201cpicked [A] up roughly out of the exerciser and shook him hard a couple of times.\u201d Mother demonstrated how she had done so by holding her purse out in front of her and shaking it \u201cback and forth.\u201d She stated that A stopped crying \u201cimmediately\u2019 afterwards and that he fell asleep for most of the afternoon. Mother stated that she felt \u201chorrible\u201d about shaking A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>and \u201creally shitty\u201d about blaming Troupe. She insisted that she had \u201csnapped momentarily,\u201d that her actions were not intentional, and that she \u201cwould do whatever it took to make things right.\u201d She also said that, although she \u201cknew that she was * * * responsible [for A\u2019s injuries] right after the doctors told her that [those injuries were] from shaking,\u201d she had lied because she was \u201cscared\u201d and because the Criders were present. At the conclusion of the interview, mother signed a written statement consistent with her statements to Holladay and Young. In that statement, she wrote that she was \u201cstressed and stretched to the top\u201d and that she had \u201cunintentionally [and] out of frustration shook [A] in a rough front to back jerking-motion, only for a few seconds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Three days later, mother participated in a family decision meeting with the Department of Social and Health Services in Vancouver and a representative of Washington Child Protective Services. A was taken into protective custody at that time and placed in a foster home for medically fragile children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">On May 1, at mother\u2019s request, Holladay spoke with mother a second time. Mother told Holladay that \u201cshe felt like [he] had bullied her * * * into giving what she considered a confession\u201d and that her written statement \u201cwas not the truth.\u201d She demanded that Holladay reinterview her and administer a polygraph. Holladay arranged for Detective Buckner of the Clark County Sheriffs Office to administer the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">One week later, Buckner met with mother and administered the polygraph. Although the results of the exam are not in the record because they are inadmissible, the record discloses that Buckner went over her statement \u201cparagraph by paragraph\u201d to \u201cgive her an opportunity to tell [him] what she agreed or disagreed with.\u201d Mother indicated that the paragraph in which she had stated that she had shaken A was not true; she insisted to Buckner that she had never done so. After the polygraph, mother began to cry and told Buckner that \u201cshe had shaken [A], but not * * * that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>hard,\u201d again demonstrating with her hands. She said that she had \u201cbeen up most of the night wdth [A], he was teething, he had just gotten over a cold, he\u2019d been crying, [and] she was frustrated with him, [so] she picked him up out of the exerciser\u201d and \u201cshook him, over her head.\u201d Mother stated that she was \u201csorry for what had happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">After meeting with Buckner, mother contacted Holladay. She \u201capologized * * * for making statements that [he] had bullied her,\u201d informed him that she \u201cwas accepting responsibility] for her actions,\u201d and stated that she \u201cjust wanted to know what was going to happen next.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">On June 1, DHS filed a dependency petition alleging that A was at risk of harm because mother had (1) \u201cinflicted significant and potentially life threatening injury to [A],\u201d (2) \u201cfailed to seek appropriate medical attention for [A] and failed to fulfill her obligation as his parent and primary care provider,\u201d and (3) \u201cexhibited behaviors that pose a grave and imminent threat\u201d to A\u2019s safety. On October 8, DHS held a settlement conference. At that conference, mother signed an admission that she was \u201cnot a placement resource\u201d for A \u201cbecause of [the] pending criminal charges.\u201d Based on that admission, the court issued a judgment asserting jurisdiction over A. As part of the judgment, mother agreed to participate in a psychological evaluation. The court also issued a judgment of dependency disposition that called for proceeding with a plan for adoption, which mother did not contest. On October 15, DHS filed a petition to terminate mother\u2019s parental rights to A.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Mother participated in a psychological evaluation on December 12, 2007, wdth licensed clinical psychologist Sorenson. He expressed concern about mother\u2019s inability to evaluate potential dangers or risks to A, particularly in light of her quickness \u201cto discount concerns that were raised,\u201d as demonstrated by, among other things, her statement that A\u2019s bruise inflicted by McCready had been \u201cvery small\u201d and accidental and her statement that A\u2019s subdural hematoma was a \u201cvery small\u201d and \u201cvery mild\u201d injury that \u201cshould not be a cause of serious concern.\u201d Sorenson testified that he was \u201c[significantly concerned about her ability to evaluate the danger that might be present from other people\u201d because she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u201cwould be disinclined to believe that somebody presented a serious concern and more apt to expect that things would be fine, even if there\u2019s evidence of reasons for concern or doubts.\u201d On the positive side, Sorenson noted that mother had been \u201csupporting herself without marked difficulty since moving out of her mother\u2019s home,\u201d \u201crelayed remarkably detailed and appropriate parenting strategies,\u201d and had \u201ca basic level of parenting knowledge expected of first time parents.\u201d He also stated that mother\u2019s \u201cdefensiveness may be nothing more than a result of her current legal problems\u201d- \u2014 always a concern when a parent is evaluated as part of a termination proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Sorenson concluded that, should mother be found responsible for A\u2019s injuries, the danger that A will again be physically abused is \u201csubstantial\u201d given mother\u2019s inability \u201cto identify potential concerns and problems\u201d and the likelihood that she will again \u201cfind herself* * * in a situation where she might be frustrated, angry, or whatever had led [her to] shake or react aggressively with [A].\u201d He further concluded that, should mother be found responsible for A\u2019s injuries, \u201cprognosis for change is poor\u201d due to mother\u2019s unwillingness \u201cto accept any need to modify her own behavior\u201d and the likelihood that such unwillingness would \u201cdisrupt intervention and protective efforts.\u201d Sorenson recommended that mother engage in individual counseling. He testified that, should mother be found responsible for A\u2019s injuries, and assuming, in such circumstances, that she accepts responsibility, mother would need to \u201cactively engage\u201d in counseling for a minimum of six months, identifying potential stressors and the circumstances that led her to shake A, before it would be appropriate to consider A\u2019s transition back into the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">By April, mother had not yet begun individual counseling as recommended in Sorenson\u2019s December 31, 2007, report. Although her DHS caseworker, Erickson, discussed Sorenson\u2019s counseling recommendation with mother in January 2008, informed mother that a referral was not needed, and contacted mother several times thereafter to inquire whether she had begun counseling, mother testified at trial in April that she had just recently scheduled her first counseling session.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Mother did, however, \u201cfaithful[ly]\u201d attend scheduled weekly visits with A. During those visits, she was \u201cappropriate\u201d with him, provided \u201cguidance and direction\u201d consistent with his age, brought food, \u201cengage[d] with [A],\u201d showed \u201clove and affection,\u201d and regularly brought A appropriate clothing of \u201cgood quality\u201d and other appropriate gifts. A was \u201chappy to see\u201d mother and \u201cgreet[ed] her with a hug and smiles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">At the time of trial, mother was living in an apartment in Albany with a roommate; several witnesses, including Erickson, testified that mother\u2019s apartment was very clean and appropriate for A. Mother was employed full time as a claims representative, earning $9.90 per hour, and had health insurance through that position. She faced criminal prosecution in Washington, where the shaking of A was alleged to have occurred; that trial was scheduled for June 2008. Whether that trial occurred and, if so, its outcome, are not in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Although A\u2019s foster parent was unwilling to adopt him, both the Criders and Robison (mother\u2019s mother) wished to be considered as adoptive placements; DHS, however, had not yet designated an adoptive home. Since A\u2019s medical foster care placement, he has had one brain scan and has not required any other specialized medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The termination proceeding occurred from April 28 to April 30, 2008, approximately one year after A was removed from mother\u2019s care. Erickson testified that adoption was in A\u2019s best interest \u201c[d]ue to the safety risk if he were [to be] placed with his mother.\u201d A\u2019s attorney, in contrast, opposed termination of mother\u2019s parental rights on the basis that A was not in a permanent placement and in order to \u201cgive [mother] an opportunity to see if counseling can address the issues, and see if she can change, and then revisit this issue six months down the road.\u201d As noted above, the court ultimately terminated mother\u2019s parental rights to A based on ORS 419B.502 (\u201cextreme conduct,\u201d set out below) and ORS 419B.504 (condition or conduct detrimental to child, unlikely to change). Because we agree that the state proved its case under ORS 419B.502, we do not discuss the court\u2019s findings or conclusions regarding ORS 419B.504 except to note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>several of the allegations in the state\u2019s petition relevant to that statute were quite clearly not proved.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">With respect to ORS 419B.502, the state\u2019s petition alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">\u201cThe mother is unfit under ORS 419B.502 by reason of the following extreme conduct toward a child:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">\u201c(a) Abuse or neglect by the parent of a child resulting in serious physical injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">ORS 419B.502 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">\u201cThe rights of the parent or parents may be terminated as provided in ORS 419B.500 if the court finds that the parent or parents are unfit by reason of a single or recurrent incident of extreme conduct toward any child. In such case, no efforts need to be made by available social agencies to help the parent adjust the conduct in order to make it possible for the child or ward to safely return home within a reasonable amount of time. In determining extreme conduct, the court shall consider the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">\u201c(3) Abuse or neglect by the parent of any child resulting in death or serious physical injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">The Supreme Court has stated that, unlike ORS 419B.504, ORS 419B.502 \u201cprovide[s] a procedure for terminating parental rights based upon past conduct, even when the parent might be a \u2018fit\u2019 parent at the time of the termination proceeding\u201d and \u201ceven if the court determines that the conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>will not recur.\u201d <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Rardin, </em>340 Or 436, 448-49, 134 P3d 940 (2006). \u201c[I]f the requisites of ORS 419B.502 are satisfied, the court must then determine whether termination is in the best interest of the child[ ].\u201d <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Keeton, </em>205 Or App 570, 584, 135 P3d 378 (2006) (citing ORS 419B.500).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Mother argues that, \u201c[w]ithout some evidence as to the timing of the injury, there was not clear and convincing evidence that mother caused serious injury by shaking [A],\u201d because \u201cmany different adults other than mother cared for [A] in the three days prior to his admission to the hospital with a subdural hematoma.\u201d Mother also contends that she admitted to only \u201ca few seconds of back and forth movement\u201d and \u201crepeatedly denied any forceful shaking of [A] of the kind that the medical experts testified would be required to cause [A\u2019s] injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">We conclude that the record establishes, by clear and convincing evidence, that mother shook A, causing A serious physical injury, and that such conduct constitutes \u201cextreme conduct\u201d for purposes of ORS 419B.502. <em>See State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Smith, </em>338 Or 58, 79, 106 P3d 627 (2005) (under \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard, court must find that the evidence establishes that the truth of the facts asserted is \u201chighly probable\u201d). Mother twice admitted to police and to Jamie that she had shaken A on April 23, 2007, and Jamie testified that A began behaving strangely and appeared lethargic that afternoon \u2014 before he was in the care of the Criders or Troupe. Mother admitted to police that that she had shaken A <em>\u201chard </em>a couple of times\u201d and \u201cin a <em>rough </em>front to back jerking-motion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Moreover, mother offers no alternative explanation for A\u2019s injuries. Combined with the expert testimony presented at trial that A\u2019s injuries were consistent with shaking, that evidence is sufficient to establish a high probability that mother\u2019s shaking of A caused A\u2019s injuries. Furthermore, on appeal, mother does not dispute that those injuries, which Skinner testified were \u201cserious\u201d and \u201clife threatening,\u201d constitute \u201cserious physical injury.\u201d We thus conclude that the trial court did not err in finding that mother had engaged in an incident of extreme conduct toward A under ORS 419B.502(3), thereby rendering her unfit.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>The question remains whether termination of mother\u2019s parental rights is in A\u2019s \u201cbest interest.\u201d ORS 419B.500. Mother argues that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\">\u201cthere is no clear and convincing evidence that it was in the best interest of [A] to terminate mother\u2019s rights when the evidence was that [A] was not in an adoptive home, mother had demonstrated many good child care skills, mother was young, and mother had not engaged nor could she fully engage in counseling pending resolution of her criminal case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Without disparaging mother\u2019s positive qualities, we nonetheless disagree. Given mother\u2019s denial of responsibility for A\u2019s injuries, her failure to seek prompt medical care for A, her unwillingness to accept the need to modify her behavior, her inclusion of a known abuser on the list of people who could visit A in the hospital, her inability to cope with stressful situations, her failure to promptly engage in counseling, her minimization of A\u2019s \u201clife threatening\u201d injuries as \u201cmild,\u201d \u201csmall,\u201d and \u201cnot * * * a cause of serious concern,\u201d and the fact that three of mother\u2019s relatives wish to adopt A, we conclude that A\u2019s best interest will be served if he is freed for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In a second assignment of error, mother asserts that the trial court should have allowed mother\u2019s pretrial motion for a continuance and motion at trial to keep the record open to allow mother time to obtain additional testimony relating to the timing of A\u2019s injuries. The following facts are relevant to that assignment. Before trial, mother filed a motion for a continuance on the ground that she had recently located an osteopath, Dr. Jollo, who could provide expert testimony regarding when A\u2019s injuries occurred. In an affidavit in support of that motion, mother stated that Jollo would be out of the country during the scheduled trial dates and that \u201ccontinuing [the] matter to allow for an opportunity for Doctor Jollo to review all the medical records and testify at trial is necessary for [mother] to receive a constitutionally adequate defense.\u201d DHS objected to the motion and offered to depose Jollo before the trial. The trial court denied mother\u2019s motion for a continuance. Jollo was never deposed, nor did mother request that such a deposition occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number> After each side had presented its evidence at the termination trial, mother moved to keep the record open to allow Jollo to submit testimony. The following colloquy transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: * * * [Wjhat\u2019s he going to testify to? M= * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201c[MOTHER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: * * * [T]o a certain extent it\u2019s hard to know exactly what he would testify to. He has reviewed part of the record, part of the medical evidence. There was some other medical evidence he wanted to have gathered that hasn\u2019t been gathered yet, because I didn\u2019t know it was relevant before I talked to him. But he can testify based upon he\u2019d give timing of when he believed the injury occurred. So he can testify to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: And you believe that that testimony would be substantially inconsistent with the testimony the Court\u2019s already heard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">\u201c[MOTHER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Well I don\u2019t think * * * any of the doctors testified as to the timing. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. And is the timing \u2014 could the timing issue essentially rule Mother out as the cause of the injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">\u201c[MOTHER\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Yes, Your Honor. Assuming all the other documentation as he reviews it would back that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">In response to DHS\u2019s objection that it had. offered to depose Jollo before the termination trial, mother\u2019s attorney responded that Jollo \u201cwasn\u2019t available to be deposed because he wasn\u2019t prepared at that point in time.\u201d The court ultimately denied mother\u2019s motion, stating that mother had failed to demonstrate that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-12\">\u201c[Jollo] has any experience, training, or specialization in the areas that would bear on this case. He\u2019s not a pediatrician, he\u2019s not worked in an emergency, so it really does seem pretty thin that he\u2019s going to have an opinion which is going to be so significant that it would outweigh all of the medical testimony we\u2019ve heard now from all the experts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-13\">\u201c* * * I will not hold the record open for a highly skeptical witness, basically. It\u2019s highly skeptical that he\u2019s gonna be significant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>We review the trial court\u2019s denial of mother\u2019s motions for a continuance and to keep the record open for an abuse of discretion. <em>See State ex rel SOSCF v. Thomas, </em>170 Or App 383, 385, 391-92, 12 P3d 537 (2000) (reviewing party\u2019s request at trial to continue trial because party was not prepared to proceed for an abuse of discretion); <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Mohamed, </em>53 Or App 407, 411, 632 P2d 31 (1981) (\u201cGenerally, it is within the sound discretion of the trial judge to grant a continuance in termination proceedings.\u201d). Those rulings will not be overturned without a showing of both an abuse of discretion and prejudice to the moving party as a result of the court\u2019s denial. <em>State v. Beaty, </em>127 Or App 448, 456, 873 P2d 385, <em>rev den, </em>319 Or 406 (1994). A court abuses its discretion when its decision is not within the range of legally permissible choices, <em>State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 312, 4 P3d 1261 (2000), or exceeds the bounds of reason, <em>Ramsey v. Thompson, </em>162 Or App 139, 144-45, 986 P2d 54 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 589 (2000). Here, mother\u2019s counsel stated that it was \u201chard to know exactly what [Jollo] would testify to,\u201d that Jollo had reviewed only \u201cpart of the medical evidence,\u201d and that the substance of Jollo\u2019s testimony turned on his review of \u201call the other documentation.\u201d Under those circumstances, it is impossible to determine whether mother suffered prejudice as a result of the trial court\u2019s decision, and we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in denying mother\u2019s motions on the basis that the value of Jollo\u2019s testimony was highly speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-6\"> Although A\u2019s birth certificate listed McCready as A\u2019s father, subsequent DNA testing revealed that McCready was not A\u2019s biological father.

Rather, the evidence shows that mother was employed full time, maintained a clean and appropriate home for A, and possessed adequate parenting skills and knowledge of appropriate parenting strategies. Furthermore, although Sorenson noted in his evaluation that mother was suffering from mild anxiety and depression and displayed below-average cognitive functioning, resulting in \u201csomewhat slowed learning and communication skills,\u201d he also stated that mother\u2019s anxiety and depression \u201cappear[ ] largely a result of the events leading to Child Welfare intervention\u201d and \u201care not believed to have contributed to the problem events at issue (e.g., leading to poor judgment on her part)\u201d; and that mother\u2019s \u201c[below-average cognitive] functioning * * * would not likely limit her ability to parent children.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
