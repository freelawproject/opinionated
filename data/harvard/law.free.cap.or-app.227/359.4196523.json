On appeal, defendant challenges only his conviction on Count 1, arguing that the trial court should have granted his motion to suppress evidence that was obtained when police inventoried the contents of his car. Specifically, defendant contends that the search of his backpack, which police found in the trunk of his car, violated his rights under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, because the Newport Police Department\u2019s inventory policy was not properly limited in scope. The state concedes that the inventory policy at issue, which permits an officer to open <em>all </em>closed containers, is too broad to satisfy Oregon constitutional requirements. <em>See, e.g., State v. Eldridge, </em>207 Or App 337, 341, 142 P3d 82 (2006). For that reason, the state concedes that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and that the conviction on the first count in the indictment must be reversed and remanded. We agree and accept the concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Conviction on Count 1 reversed and remanded; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-6\"> We note that the indictment in this case charged defendant with possession of heroin rather than methamphetamine and that the parties have treated the judgment as though it includes a conviction for possession of a controlled substance, ORS 475.840. The judgment, however, reflects that defendant was convicted of possession of methamphetamine \u2014 apparently a scrivener\u2019s error. Given our reversal and subsequent remand, we do not detain ourselves with that discrepancy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
