J.</author>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">This case is before us on remand from the Supreme Court, which vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Russell, </em>200 Or App 725, 117 P3d 301 (2005) <em>(Russell I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Russell, </em>345 Or 316, 195 P3d 63 (2008). In <em>Russell I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed a departure sentence based on judicial findings. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Russell I </em>was proper. Accordingly, we again remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Defendant was convicted of first-degree burglary, and the trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 68 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court identified defendant\u2019s persistent involvement in similar offenses and the fact that he was on probation at the time he committed his current offense as departure factors, and specified that either would have been sufficient to support its decision to impose a departure sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">On this record, we cannot conclude that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have found either of the departure factors identified by the trial court because the record reveals nothing about defendant\u2019s criminal history. <em>See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (setting out \u201clegitimate debate\u201d standard for exercise of discretion to review unpreserved challenges to departure sentences based on judicial findings of fact). The only representation of defendant\u2019s criminal history that the prosecutor made at sentencing was that \u201cdefendant has a lot of recent criminal history. He just seems to keep going and going. I don\u2019t know what the answers are to turn him around.\u201d As we explained in <em>State v. Williams, </em>225 Or App 325, 328-29, 201 P3d 267 (2009), under <em>State v. Bray, </em>342 Or 711, 724, 160 P3d 983 (2007), there is no legitimate debate that a jury would have found a defendant to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>persistently involved in similar offenses where the number and frequency of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions compels the inference that his or her criminal behavior has been \u201cpersistent.\u201d Because the record in this case does not disclose the number, the date, or the nature of defendant\u2019s \u201crecent criminal history,\u201d or if that criminal history produced any convictions, we cannot say that the jury necessarily would have drawn the inference of persistence required by <em>Bray.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">With regard to the second departure factor, although defense counsel conceded at sentencing that defendant was on probation at the time he committed his current offense, as we explained in <em>State v. Allen, </em>198 Or App 392, 396, 108 P3d 651, <em>adh\u2019d to as clarified on recons, </em>202 Or App 565, 123 P3d 331 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 46 (2006), an upward departure sentence based on a defendant\u2019s supervisory status \u201crequires further inferences about the malevolent quality of the offender and the failure of his [supervisory] status to serve as an effective deterrent,\u201d inferences which must be based on evidence of the defendant\u2019s individual characteristics adduced at trial or sentencing. The record in this case is devoid of such evidence. It follows that we cannot conclude that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have found the departure factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We exercise our discretion to correct the trial court\u2019s error in this case for two reasons. First, as discussed, there is a legitimate debate regarding whether a jury would have found either of the departure factors the court relied on. Second, the gravity of the error in this case is not trivial. <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6. Imposition of the departure sentence increased defendant\u2019s term of incarceration by 38 months. Accordingly, we remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
