He appeals, seeking a reversal of his conviction. He contends that the raft in which he was floating was not a boat within the meaning of the statute and that, even if it was a boat, there was not sufficient evidence to show that he operated it or was in actual physical control of it, as required by the statute. We review defendant\u2019s statutory construction contention for errors of law. <em>State v. Thompson, </em>328 Or 248, 256, 971 P2d 879, <em>cert den, </em>527 US 1042 (1999). In reviewing his sufficiency of the evidence contention, we consider whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, the factfinder could have found that each element of the crime was established beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Hall, </em>327 Or 568, 570, 966 P2d 208 (1998). We reject both of defendant\u2019s contentions and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The facts are simple and not in dispute. Only one witness was called at trial, Clackamas County Deputy Sheriff Wurpes. He testified that, at about 8:00 p.m. on September 8, 2005, he received a call that described a boater in distress on the Clackamas River. Wurpes went to a driveway on Simple Road, near the Clackamas River, where he made contact with defendant. Defendant was wet and near a partially deflated raft. Defendant told Wurpes that he was wet because he had been in the river and had tried to travel to Carver Park from a place up stream. Defendant and the state stipulated at trial that defendant was under the influence of an intoxicant when he was on the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Wurpes testified that defendant\u2019s raft was approximately five feet in length when inflated and was oblong with sides and a bottom. It was designed for one or two people. It had neither a rope around the edge nor oar locks. There were no oars or paddles present when Wurpes made contact with defendant. Wurpes described the watercraft as a raft, as opposed to \u201can inner tube or air mattress or anything else,\u201d and testified that it could be used to go from one point to another point on the river. He further testified that the raft could be steered with paddles or oars or by hands or feet. A raft is usually launched by dragging or pushing it into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>river or off a trailer. Wurpes guessed that the raft\u2019s value was $25. The raft was placed in a plastic bag after it was fully deflated at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Wurpes testified that the Clackamas River between Carver Park, defendant\u2019s intended destination, and the nearest park upstream, is fairly fast moving, with bends and curves, including some sharp 90-degree turns. In September, the river is shallow in some places and a raft that is not steered in some fashion will, in all likelihood, run into a wall or the shore or become stuck on a gravel bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">We first address defendant\u2019s contention that his raft was not a boat, within the meaning of ORS 830.325(1). That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">\u201cNo person under the influence of an intoxicating liquor or controlled substance shall operate, propel or be in actual physical control of any boat on any waters of this state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">For purposes of ORS 830.325, \u201cboat,\u201d \u201coperate,\u201d and \u201cwaters of this state\u201d are defined in ORS 830.005 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">\u201cAs used in this chapter, unless the context requires otherwise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-10\">\u201c(2) \u2018Boat\u2019 means every description of watercraft, including a seaplane on the water and not in flight, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on the water, but does not include boathouses, floating homes, air mattresses, beach and water toys or single inner tubes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-12\">\u201c(8) \u2018Operate\u2019 means to navigate or otherwise use a boat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-14\">\u201c(13) \u2018Waters of this state\u2019 means all waters within the territorial limits of this state * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-15\">Defendant makes three arguments in his first assignment of error, in which he contends that his raft was not a \u201cboat,\u201d as defined in ORS 830.005(2). First, he proposes that the court establish a bright-line definition that will clearly distinguish between a \u201cboat\u201d and a \u201cwater toy\u201d or \u201cair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>mattress.\u201d Second, he contends that, under Oregon law, ORS 830.705, certain \u201cboats\u201d are required to have licenses and registration numbers, and because the Oregon Marine Board does not require registration for the type of raft that defendant used, it was not a \u201cboat.\u201d Third, he argues that the raft was not a boat because it was not a \u201cmeans of transportation,\u201d as it had no \u201csteering and no propulsion.\u201d The state counters that the bright-line test advocated by defendant would add language to ORS 830.005(2), that the raft did not need a registration number to be a boat, and that the raft was \u201ccapable of being used as a means of transportation,\u201d even if defendant did not use it for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Defendant\u2019s arguments present a question of statutory construction. In construing a statute, the court must determine the legislature\u2019s intent, and it does that by first considering the text of the statute in its context, which is the best evidence of intent. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). The court may, at the first level, consider rules of construction in reading the text, such as not inserting or omitting language in the statute and giving common words of usage their ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>at 611. The context of the statute includes other provisions of the same statute and related statutes. In considering the context of the statute, rules of construction may be employed. For example, the use of the same word or phrase throughout the statute demonstrates that the word has the same meaning throughout the statute. <em>Id. </em>If the first level of analysis does not allow the court to determine the meaning of the statute, the court then moves to the legislative history. If looking at the legislative history does not resolve the issue, the court then turns to maxims of statutory construction. <em>Id. </em>at 611-12. We conclude that the intent of the legislature with respect to whether defendant\u2019s raft was a boat can be determined at the first level of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Our starting point is the statutory definition of \u201cboat,\u201d which is \u201cevery description of watercraft * * * used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on the water.\u201d ORS 830.005(2). \u201cWatercraft\u201d is not defined in the statute; however, the term is not ambiguous. <em>See Smith v. State Farm Insurance, </em>144 Or App 442, 448, 927 P2d 111 (1996). The dictionary definition of \u201cwatercraft\u201d is a \u201cship, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>boat b : equipment for water transport: vessels.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2582 (unabridged ed 2002). The word \u201cevery\u201d is defined as \u201cbeing each individual or part of a class or group whether definite or indefinite in number without exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. \u201cEvery\u201d means \u201call.\u201d <em>See Rash v. McKinstry Co., </em>331 Or 665, 672, 20 P3d 197 (2001) (plain and unambiguous meaning of the word \u201call\u201d is \u201cevery\u201d). Thus, it is clear that, in defining \u201cboat,\u201d the statute expressed a broadly inclusive meaning. <em>See Smith, </em>144 Or App at 447. The definition encompasses every form of watercraft that is capable of being used for water transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">However, the statute also excludes certain things: \u201cboathouses, floating homes, air mattresses, beach and water toys [and] single inner tubes\u201d are not \u201cboats.\u201d ORS 830.005(2). Inflatable rafts are not among those things explicitly excluded.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant concedes that his raft is not a \u201csingle inner tube,\u201d and it is obvious that it is not a \u201cboathouse\u201d or a \u201cfloating home.\u201d He contends, however, that his raft was more like an air mattress or a water toy than a boat. The terms \u201cair mattress\u201d and \u201cwater toy\u201d are not defined in ORS chapter 830. We therefore turn to the dictionary for assistance. One definition of \u201cmattress\u201d is \u201can inflatable airtight sack adapted to serve as a mattress when inflated and to collapse into a small space (as for packing) when not in use.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1394. Based on the officer\u2019s description, defendant\u2019s raft clearly was not an air mattress, as it is commonly understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">A \u201ctoy\u201d is \u201csomething designed for amusement or diversion rather than practical use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2419. Defendant contends that his raft would commonly be recognized as and is indistinguishable from a \u201ctoy.\u201d He identifies what he considers to be a problem in the statute\u2019s failure to adequately distinguish between inflatable watercraft that are boats and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>those that are \u201ctoys.\u201d He proposes a bright-line solution by drawing a clear distinction between \u201cboats\u201d and \u201ctoys\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">\u201cBoats have at least one rigid, non-inflatable portion and a steering or propulsion method. Water toys are completely inflatable, have no rigid structures, and have no method of propulsion or steering.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Defendant contends that, under his proposed definition, his raft was a \u201ctoy,\u201d because it was fully inflatable and lacked a rigid structure, steering, or propulsion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The difficulty with defendant\u2019s proposed solution is that the legislature has not chosen to define a \u201cboat\u201d as suggested by defendant; if the court were to do so, it would violate ORS 174.010, which mandates that, \u201c[i]n the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is, in terms or in substance, contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Defendant\u2019s proposal would require exactly what ORS 174.010 prohibits, and is more properly directed to the legislature. In any event, Wurpes\u2019s testimony that defendant\u2019s raft had some practical use \u2014 it was \u201cthe sort of thing that you could use to get from Point A in the river to Point B down river\u201d \u2014 supports the trial court\u2019s implicit determination that the raft was not a toy.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Defendant further asserts that his raft was not a boat because, without a method of steering or propulsion, it could not be \u201ca means of transportation\u201d as required by ORS 830.005(2). \u201cTransportation\u201d is defined as a \u201cmeans of conveyance or travel from one place to another,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 2430, and to \u201cconvey\u201d means \u201cto bear from one place to another : carry, transport,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 499. From those definitions, defendant contends that a means of transportation implicitly must be capable of deliberate direction from one place to another. He argues that, because a person cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>deliberately go from one place to another in a raft that has no method of steering, a raft is not <em>\u201ca </em>means of transportation.\u201d ORS 830.005(2). Once again, the legislature\u2019s definition of \u201cboat\u201d does not include defendant\u2019s suggested requirement. Putting that issue aside, however, the statute states only that the watercraft must be \u201ccapable of being used as a means of transportation.\u201d ORS 830.005(2). The evidence at trial supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s raft was \u201ccapable of being used as a means of transportation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Defendant argues that his raft was not a boat because it did not have a registration number, as required by ORS 830.770. That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">\u201c(1) No person shall operate a boat on the waters of this state * * * unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">\u201c(a) The owner of the boat holds a valid, effective certificate of number issued in the owner\u2019s name as owner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">\u201c(A) By this state ***[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">With one minor exception not relevant here, ORS 830.700(1) defines \u201cboat\u201d for purposes of ORS 830.770 in the same manner as ORS 830.005(2). ORS 830.705(1)(e) states that \u201c[t]his section and ORS * * * 830.770 * * * do not apply to: * * * [a] boat belonging to a class of boats which has been exempted from the provisions of this section and ORS * * * 830.770 * * * by the State Marine Board.\u201d Defendant argues that, because there is no evidence that the State Marine Board has applied registration requirements to inflatable rafts like his, the State Marine Board must have determined that they are not boats.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">The state points out that not all \u201cboats\u201d are subject to registration. ORS 830.705(2) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-10\">\u201cThis section and ORS * * * 830.770 * * * do apply to all boats other than boats described in subsection (1) of this section which are propelled by machinery, whether or not the machinery is the principal source of propulsion and to sailboats which are 12 feet or more in length.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">It is clear that the registration requirement of ORS 830.770 is mandatory only for boats that are propelled by \u201cmachinery,\u201d sailboats at least 12 feet in length, and other boats in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>class that the State Marine Board has determined should be registered. The fact that the State Marine Board has not acted to require registration of inflatable rafts like defendant\u2019s does not indicate that defendant\u2019s raft is not a \u201cboat\u201d for purposes of ORS 830.325.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error is that, even if his raft is a boat, there is no evidence that he was operating it. To \u201c Tojperate\u2019 means to navigate or otherwise use a boat.\u201d ORS 830.005(8). The crux of defendant\u2019s argument is that sitting in a raft while it drifts down a river is not operating it. He contends that the state\u2019s evidence, including reasonable inferences, only demonstrated that defendant drifted down the river in his raft. The state counters that the evidence and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from it demonstrate that defendant operated or had \u201cactual physical control\u201d of the raft.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">We have not previously discussed the terms \u201coperate\u201d or \u201cactual physical control\u201d in the context of operation of a boat, and we need not do so in this case. The definition of \u201coperate\u201d is \u201cto navigate or <em>otherwise use a boat.\u201d </em>ORS 830.005(8) (emphasis added). Defendant assumes that to \u201cnavigate\u201d a boat or be in \u201cactual physical control\u201d of it necessarily requires a purpose, <em>i.e., </em>physically controlling a boat with the purpose of going from one place to another. Even assuming that defendant is correct that the evidence fails to show that he was successfully navigating his raft, there is no question that he was \u201cotherwise\u201d using the raft. \u201cOtherwise\u201d means \u201cin a different way or manner\u201d and \u201cuse\u201d means \u201cthe act or practice of using something.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1598, 2523. Consciously trying to use his raft to travel to Carver Park from a point up stream is \u201cotherwise us[ing]\u201d the raft. The trial court did not err in concluding that defendant operated his raft.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-6\"> If the legislature had wanted to expand the scope of the specific list of things that are not boats, it could have used text similar to ORS 830.365(1), which provides that \u201c[n]o person shall ride or manipulate any water skis, surfboard or <em>similar device </em>in a reckless or negligent manner so as to endanger any person or property.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It did not do so. <em>See Royal Aloha Partners v. Real Estate </em>Div., 59 Or App 564, 568, 651 P2d 1350 (1982) (inclusion of language in one statute and not another usually indicates intent to exclude related matters not mentioned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b664-7\"> Defendant attached appendices to his brief including five copies of photographs depicting different types of small watercraft. He asks the court to consider the photographs regarding his argument that the raft he was in is the same as an \u201cair mattress\u201d or \u201cwater toy.\u201d We will not consider the photographs submitted, because they were not in the record before the trial court. <em>In re Harris, </em>334 Or 353, 357, 49 P3d 778 (2002) (material regarding addictions generally and concerning the accused\u2019s addiction in particular that were not presented to trial panel stricken from appellate record because \u201caccused had ample opportunity to present the material contained in the briefs to the trial panel but failed to do so in a timely manner\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
