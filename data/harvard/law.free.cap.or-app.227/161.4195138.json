Tatarinov, </em>202 Or App 217, 120 P3d 1253 (2005) <em>(Tatarinov I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008). <em>State v. Tatarinov, </em>345 Or 316, 195 P3d 64 (2008). In <em>Tatarinov I, </em>we remanded for resentencing because the court had imposed upward departure sentences on two of defendant\u2019s convictions for identity theft, based on judicial fact-finding, in violation of his jury trial rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution as set forth in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004). That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). The issue on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007), we properly exercised our <em>Ailes </em>discretion. As explained below, we conclude that we should not exercise our discretion to correct the error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">In these two consolidated cases, defendant was convicted of, among other crimes, six counts of identity theft. ORS 165.800. On two of the convictions, the trial court imposed upward departure sentences of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment. One of the departure sentences was based on the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant had been persistently involved in similar activity; the other departure sentence was based on the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant was on release at the time of that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">In determining, on remand, whether to exercise our <em>Ailes </em>discretion, we are guided by numerous considerations, including \u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; [and] the ends of justice in the particular case.\u201d <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6. The \u201cinterests of the parties\u201d factor includes whether the state has \u201ca significant interest in avoiding a second, unnecessary sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513. Where we are able to conclude that there would be \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d that a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>would find the facts necessary to support the enhanced sentence, the defendant has no significant interest in resentenc-ing, whereas the state does have a significant interest in avoiding an unnecessary resentencing. <em>Id. </em>If there is \u201cno legitimate debate\u201d concerning the factual predicate for a sentence, the state\u2019s interest in avoiding unnecessary proceedings outweighs a defendant\u2019s interest in correcting the error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Here, a lengthy description of the facts would not benefit the bench, the bar, or the public. With respect to \u201cpersistent involvement,\u201d suffice it to say that the record indicates that defendant had extensive, ongoing involvement in activities related to identity theft and forgery, <em>cf. State v. Tarkington, </em>226 Or App 145, 203 P3d 230 (2009) (same), as well as a conviction for forgery and two convictions for identity theft on which he was awaiting sentencing when he committed the present offenses. We thus conclude that, had a jury been asked to make a finding as to whether defendant had been persistently involved in criminal activity similar to the present crimes, it would have done so. With respect to the \u201con release\u201d departure factor, the prosecutor represented to the court, and defendant did not dispute, that the crime at issue was committed while defendant was on release awaiting sentencing in the other case. On appeal, defendant does not suggest that the factual basis for this departure factor is lacking; he merely argues that he is entitled to have a jury finding on the question. Under circumstances such as these, we elect not to remand for sentencing in order to have a factual determination made by a jury concerning a fact that, if there had been any legitimate debate as to its existence, would have been contested in the sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
