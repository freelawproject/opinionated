J.</author>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Plaintiff appeals in this personal injury case following a jury verdict in favor of defendant. He contends that the trial court erred when it denied him the opportunity to reply to defendant\u2019s closing argument at the end of the trial pursuant to ORCP 58 B(6). Because we conclude that the error claimed by plaintiff was not preserved below and should not be reviewed as plain error, ORAP 5.45, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">At the end of the jury trial, plaintiff and defendant presented closing arguments to the jury. Immediately thereafter, the court began to instruct the jury. At that point in time, the following exchange occurred between plaintiffs counsel and the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Thank you. Members of the jury, at this time we will give you jury instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: Rebuttal, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Approach</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">\u201c(whispered) You don\u2019t get any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">(Pause)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-11\">\u201c[PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL]: (whispered) Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-12\">\u201c(Pause)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-13\">\u201c(whispered) Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-14\">\u201c(Pause)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-15\">\u201c(Unintelligible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: (whispered) I can certainly do that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-17\">At the conclusion of the foregoing exchange, the court proceeded to instruct the jury. After deliberating, the jury returned a verdict for defendant, finding that he did not negligently cause damage to plaintiff. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-18\">On appeal, plaintiff argues that \u201c[t]he trial court erred in denying plaintiff the opportunity to reply to defendant\u2019s closing argument in the absence of a record statement of \u2018good cause\u2019 to depart from the requirements of ORCP 58 B(6).\u201d Defendant responds that plaintiff did not preserve his claim of error in the trial court as required by ORAP 5.45(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>but rather acquiesced to the court\u2019s ruling. Plaintiff counters that, although he made no formal objection to the court\u2019s ruling, the exchange between court and counsel was the functional equivalent of an objection. We agree with defendant\u2019s argument for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Two rules of law potentially inform the outcome of this appeal. ORCP 58 B(6) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\u201cWhen the evidence is concluded, unless the case is submitted by both sides to the jury without argument, the plaintiff shall commence and conclude the argument to the jury. The plaintiff may waive the opening argument, and if the defendant then argues the case to the jury, the plaintiff shall have the right to reply to the argument of the defendant, but not otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Pursuant to ORAP 5.45(1), \u201c[n]o matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claimed error was preserved in the lower court * * *.\u201d <em>See also Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 380, 823 P2d 956 (1991) (providing that, in general, an issue must have been preserved before the trial court for the appellate court to consider it on appeal). To preserve a claim of error for appeal, a party must provide the trial court with a specific enough explanation of his position \u201cto ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000). The purpose of this requirement is \u201c \u2018to advance goals such as ensuring that the positions of the parties are presented clearly to the initial tribunal and that parties are not taken by surprise, misled, or denied an opportunity to meet an argument.\u2019 \u201d <em>Northwest Natural Gas Co. v. Chase Gardens, Inc., </em>328 Or 487, 500, 982 P2d 1117 (1999) <em>(quoting Davis v. O\u2019Brien, </em>320 Or 729, 737, 891 P2d 1307 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Thus, before we can determine whether plaintiff was entitled to rebuttal argument under ORCP 58 B(6), we must first decide whether the issue framed on appeal by plaintiff was preserved under ORAP 5.45. The threshold issue is whether plaintiffs counsel\u2019s statements to the trial court were clear enough to afford the court the opportunity to identify its alleged error and correct the error immediately, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>appropriate. Plaintiffs counsel merely requested rebuttal argument. The court responded, \u201cYou don\u2019t get any.\u201d The response constituted a denial of plaintiffs request for rebuttal argument. In turn, however, counsel failed to draw the court\u2019s attention to the provisions of ORCP 58 B(6), and explain his interpretation of the rule, or otherwise disagree with the court\u2019s ruling. Rather, he responded, \u201cOkay.\u201d Counsel\u2019s response could be reasonably understood to mean either that he agreed with the court\u2019s ruling or that, in the words of plaintiff, \u201cit signaled acknowledgement and obedience to the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Our reasoning in <em>State v. Taylor, </em>198 Or App 460, 108 P3d 682, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 66 (2005), informs the resolution of the issue in this case. In that case, relating to the imposition of consecutive sentences, the defendant had argued to the trial court at sentencing that it was \u201coutside the court\u2019s authority\u201d to impose such sentences where the \u201caggravating factors were not pled in the indictment\u201d and that, \u201c[g]ranted, [defendant] did not go to a trial by jury, but had he, the jury should be the one to decide any aggravating factors that affect his sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465 (emphasis and boldface omitted). After the trial court imposed consecutive sentences, the defendant appealed, arguing that his constitutional right to a trial by jury had been violated when the court imposed the sentences. We determined that trial counsel\u2019s arguments to the trial court had failed to alert the court to the defendant\u2019s position. In light of the manner of counsel\u2019s argument, we concluded that \u201cthe sentencing court, hearing defense counsel\u2019s statement, could have been expected to understand that defendant was <em>not </em>contending that he had a right to a jury determination of consecutive sentencing factors[,]\u201d and, therefore, his argument on appeal was not properly preserved. <em>Id. </em>at 468 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Although it involves different factual circumstances from those presented in this case, <em>Taylor </em>underscores the need under ORAP 5.45 for parties to object with sufficient clarity to allow the trial court to understand that an objection is being made on the particular ground subsequently advanced on appeal. Plaintiffs statements to the court were insufficient to inform the court that plaintiff objected to the ruling. Rather, the court could have properly understood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>from plaintiffs response that he was no longer contending that he had a right to rebuttal argument, was withdrawing his request, and agreed with the court\u2019s ruling, even if plaintiff did not intend that message.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Alternatively, plaintiff contends that the court\u2019s denial of rebuttal argument is error apparent on the face of the record that we should exercise our discretion to review under ORAP 5.45.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">For us to consider an unpreserved issue on appeal, the alleged error</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\u201cmust be one \u2018of law\u2019; * * * it must be \u2018apparent,\u2019 i.e., the point must be obvious, not reasonably in dispute; and * * * it must appear \u2018on the face of the record,\u2019 i.e., the reviewing court must not need to go outside the record to identify the error or choose between competing inferences, and the fact constituting the error must be irrefutable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-7\"><em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 381-82. Furthermore, even if all of the above requirements are met, the court must still exercise its discretion to consider the error and articulate the reasons underlying its decision to do so.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">\u201cThis is not a requirement of mere form. A court\u2019s decision to recognize unpreserved or unraised error in this manner should be made with utmost caution. Such an action is contrary to the strong policies requiring preservation and raising of error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 382. In determining whether to exercise discretion and consider an unpreserved error, the court considers such things as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">\u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and whether the policies behind the rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in another way[J\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 382 n 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Assuming, without deciding, that the trial court\u2019s decision was plain error on the face of the record in light of ORCP 58 B(6), it is not an error we choose to exercise our discretion to review under the facts presented here. It is not clear that the error had any effect on the jury\u2019s decision that would warrant a new trial in this case. The parties had the opportunity to present all their evidence to the jury, and both sides were allowed to present closing arguments to the jury. In other words, the parties have already had their day in court. Plaintiff asserts that, had he been able to present rebuttal argument, he would have questioned the eviden-tiary support of a statement made by defense counsel during his closing argument. However, in light of all the evidence presented at trial along with the court\u2019s instructions to the jury that it must base its verdict on the evidence and not on the attorneys\u2019 statements and that it should rely on its own memory of the testimony in the event of a conflict with the attorneys\u2019 characterizations of the evidence, we are not persuaded that the ends of justice would be served by remanding for a new trial in this case. Thus, in light of the circumstances presented in this case, we decline to exercise our discretion and review the alleged error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-12\"> <em>Cf.
