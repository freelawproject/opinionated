That opinion affirms Deschutes County\u2019s conditional approval of a conceptual master plan (CMP) for a destination resort proposed by Thornburgh Resort Company, LLC (Thornburgh). The county\u2019s initial approval of the CMP was appealed to LUBA and remanded for additional findings to better justify satisfaction of an approval standard on required overnight lodging accommodations. <em>Gould v. Deschutes County, </em>54 Or LUBA 205 (2007) <em>(Gould I). </em>Petitioner then sought judicial review in this court to obtain a more extensive remand to the county for further findings on standards pertaining to the location of access roads for the development and mitigation of the development\u2019s effects on wildlife. We concluded that LUBA erred in its review of the county\u2019s determinations on wildlife impacts mitigation, affirmed on Gould\u2019s remaining assignments of error, and remanded the case. <em>Gould v. Deschutes County, </em>216 Or App 150, 171 P3d 1017 (2007) <em>{Gould ID-</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Following that remand, the county approved the CMP with further findings and new conditions of approval. The county imposed a condition that postponed determination of the consistency of the CMP with its wildlife impact mitigation standards until a later public hearing on a fully developed wildlife mitigation plan. Petitioner appealed the remand decision to LUBA, and LUBA affirmed the county\u2019s decision. <em>Gould v. Deschutes County, </em>57 Or LUBA 403 (2008). On review, petitioner makes four assignments of error, all of which challenge LUBA\u2019s determinations as to the legal sufficiency of the county\u2019s condition and findings postponing review of application of the wildlife mitigation standards. We conclude that LUBA did not err in upholding the county\u2019s conditional approval and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Our earlier opinion frames the dispute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">\u201cThornburgh applied to Deschutes County for approval of a conceptual master plan for a destination resort. The resort, to be located on about 1,970 acres of land west of the City of Redmond, is proposed to contain 1,425 dwelling units, including 425 units for overnight accommodations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>and a 50-room hotel. The resort plans also include three golf courses, two clubhouses, a community center, shops, and meeting and dining facilities. The resort property is bordered on three sides by land owned by the Bureau of Land Management. The land is zoned for exclusive farm use, but designated \u2018destination resort\u2019 in an overlay zone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\">\u201cState and local law contain special standards for approving destination resort developments. ORS 197.435 to 197.467; OAR 660-015-0000(8) (Statewide Planning Goal 8 (Recreational Needs)); Deschutes County Code (DCC) Chapter 18.113. The county\u2019s development code requires a three-step approval process for a destination resort. The first step is consideration and approval of a \u2018conceptual master plan\u2019 (CMP). DCC 18.113.040(A). The code sets out a number of detailed requirements for an application for a CMP, DCC 18.113.050, as well as extensive approval standards for the plan, DCC 18.113.060 and 18.113.070. An applicant for a CMP must submit evidence of compliance with those requirements at a public hearing. Any approval must be based on the record created at that hearing. DCC 18.113.040(A). Once the CMP is approved, it becomes the standard for staff evaluation of a \u2018final master plan,\u2019 the second step in the process. Any \u2018substantial change\u2019 in the CMP must be reviewed and approved using the same process as the original plan approval. DCC 18.113.080. The third approval step for a destination resort is allowance of components or phases of the resort through site plan or land division approvals. DCC 18.113.040(C).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">\u201cFollowing review of the proposed CMP by a local hearings officer, the board of county commissioners held hearings and approved the proposed CMP with conditions. The primary issue in this case concerns whether the county\u2019s adopted findings and conditions on the mitigation of the development\u2019s effects on fish and wildlife were sufficient to justify that approval.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">\u201cThe development code requires the CMP application to include a description of the wildlife resources of the site and the effect of the destination resort on those resources, the \u2018methods employed to mitigate adverse impacts on the resources,\u2019 and a \u2018proposed resource protection plan to ensure that important natural features will be protected and maintained.\u2019 DCC 18.113.050(B)(1). The approval criteria include a requirement that the decision-maker \u2018find from substantial evidence in the record\u2019 that \u2018any negative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>impact on fish and wildlife resources will be completely mitigated so that there is no net loss or net degradation of the resource.\u2019 DCC 18.113.070(D).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><em>Gould II, </em>216 Or App at 153-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The original county findings justified approval of the CMP because it was \u201cfeasible\u201d to comply with the wildlife impact mitigation standard in light of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Thornburgh and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The MOU obligated Thornburgh to complete a wildlife mitigation plan, obtain approval of that plan from BLM and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and implement the plan throughout the project. The MOU contained specific mitigation measures that could be undertaken as part of the plan. In the initial review, LUBA concluded that the county\u2019s finding of feasibility of compliance was sufficient to prove that there would be \u201cno net loss or net degradation of the resource\u201d under the future resource protection plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">We held that LUBA\u2019s decision was unlawful in substance under ORS 197.850(9)(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">\u201cLUBA\u2019s opinion and order was unlawful in substance for the reasons that follow. First, the county\u2019s findings were inadequate to establish the necessary and likely content of any wildlife impact mitigation plan. Without knowing the specifics of any required mitigation measures, there can be no effective evaluation of whether the project\u2019s effects on fish and wildlife resources will be \u2018completely mitigated\u2019 as required by DCC 18.113.070(D). ORS 215.416(9) requires that the county\u2019s decision approving the CMP explain \u2018the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>justification for the decision based on the criteria, standards and facts set forth\u2019 in the decision. The county\u2019s decision is inconsistent with ORS 215.416(9) because the decision lacks a sufficient description of the wildlife impact mitigation plan, and justification of that plan based on the standards in DCC 18.113.070(D). Second, that code provision requires that the content of the mitigation plan be based on \u2018substantial evidence in the record,\u2019 not evidence outside the CMP record. In this case, the particulars of the mitigation plan were to be based on a future negotiation, and not a county hearing process. Because LUBA\u2019s opinion and order concluded that the county\u2019s justification was adequate despite those deficiencies, the board\u2019s decision was \u2018unlawful in substance.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><em>Gould II, </em>216 Or App at 159-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Thus, the approval was improper because the mitigation plan was not yet composed and part of the evidentiary record before the county, and therefore the necessary findings about the sufficiency of that plan could not be made. But beyond those deficiencies, we noted that the county used the wrong standard in evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence in the local government record to show consistency with the approval criteria \u2014 whether the evidence showed that compliance with the standards was \u201cfeasible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Instead, under <em>Meyer v. City of Portland, </em>67 Or App 274, 678 P2d 741, <em>rev den, </em>297 Or 82 (1984), the evidentiary record of a land use decision must show that compliance with the approval standards was \u201clikely and reasonably certain,\u201d without regard to any modification as a result of later administrative review. <em>Gould II, </em>216 Or App at 161 (citing <em>Meyer, </em>67 Or App at 280 n 5). We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">\u201cThus, <em>Meyer </em>instructs that a proposed land development plan must be specific and certain enough to support findings that the proposal satisfies the applicable approval criteria. If the nature of the development is uncertain, either by omission or because its composition or design is subject to future study and determination, and that uncertainty precludes a necessary conclusion of consistency with the decisional standards, the application should be denied or made more certain by appropriate conditions of approval. Another option is to postpone the decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>We also noted in <em>Gould II </em>that proof of a mere possibility of compliance, resulting in a finding that attainment of the standard is \u201cfeasible,\u201d could be relevant to justify postponement of the application of the standard to a future process, but not to extinguish the duty to apply the standard based on \u201csubstantial evidence in the record.\u201d We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\">\u201cIn this case, the county\u2019s decision did not postpone a determination that the project complies with DCC 18.113.070(D). The county might have, but did not, postpone determination of compliance with that standard until the final master plan approval step and infuse that process with the same participatory rights as those allowed in the CMP approval hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, the county implicitly concluded (but did not directly find) that the nature of the wildlife impact mitigation plan was sufficiently certain and probable to allow a present determination of consistency with the approval criterion. LUBA found that the findings were \u2018adequate\u2019 to explain compliance with DCC 18.113.070(D).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">\u201cBut the governing ordinance requires a <em>Meyer </em>determination of whether \u2018solutions to certain problems * * * are * * * likely and reasonably certain to succeed\u2019 \u2014 whether the findings and conditions of the conceptual master plan approval adequately support the conclusion that \u2018any negative impact on fish and wildlife resources will be completely mitigated so that there is no net loss or net degradation of the resource\u2019 as required by DCC 18.113.070(D). The adopted findings fail to make that case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">\u201c<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the context of this case, a determination that a wildlife impact mitigation plan is \u2018feasible\u2019 might be appropriate to justify postponement of any evaluation of the application of DCC 18.113.070(D) to the plan. The determination of feasibility, however, is not an adequate substitute for an assessment of whether a specific mitigation plan actually complies with the standard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-7\"><em>Gould II, </em>216 Or App at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">On remand, the county approved the CMP and adopted its prior findings, including the finding that \u201cit is feasible to mitigate completely any negative impact on identified fish and wildlife resources so that there is no net loss or net degradation of the resource.\u201d The county also found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>\u201c[T]he Court of Appeals clearly stated that it is proper for the County to defer the presentation of the wildlife mitigation plan to the final master plan process, as long as a feasibility determination has been made with respect to DCC 18.113.070(D). As noted above, based on evidence in the record, the Board found in the 2006 Decision that compliance with DCC 18.113.070(D) is feasible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-4\">\u201cConsistent with the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, the Board adopts condition No. 26 below, which postpones determination of compliance with DCC 18.113.070(D) until the final master plan approval step and infuses that process with the same participatory rights as those allowed in the CMP approval hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The county imposed the following condition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">\u201cApplicant shall demonstrate compliance with DCC 18.113.070(D) by submitting a wildlife mitigation plan to the County as part of its application for final master plan approval. The County shall consider the wildlife mitigation plan at a public hearing with the same participatory rights as those allowed in the CMP approval hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Petitioner sought review by LUBA of the decision on remand. One of its assignments of error was that the county erred in making a determination of \u201cfeasibility\u201d based on inadequate findings and evidence, so that postponement of the decision was not appropriate. Petitioner argued that the \u201cfeasibility\u201d showing that was necessary to postpone a determination under DCC 18.113.070(D) meant that Thornburgh was required to show that particular wildlife impact mitigation measures were \u201clikely and reasonably certain to succeed\u201d under <em>Meyer </em>and that this court had held that the county earlier failed to make that showing. Thus, petitioner concluded that the postponement was not justified by the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">On review, LUBA determined that a showing that compliance with approval standards is \u201clikely and reasonably certain\u201d is not necessary in order to impose a condition postponing consideration of those standards to a later hearing and that it was sufficient for the county to postpone with the condition that full public participation be preserved. LUBA held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>\u201cFor the reasons explained above, we conclude that neither <em>Gould II </em>nor <em>Paterson </em>support petitioner\u2019s position that the county must first find that it is \u2018feasible,\u2019 within the meaning of the second principle in <em>Meyer </em>[approval of compliance with standards at first stage of development review upon findings that compliance is \u2018feasible,\u2019 meaning \u2018possible, likely and reasonably certain to succeed\u2019], for the destination resort to comply with DCC 18.113.070(D), before it can defer a decision concerning whether the proposed destination resort complies with DCC 18.113.070(D) to a future public process as part of FMP approval. It follows that petitioner\u2019s first assignment of error should be denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><em>Gould, </em>57 Or LUBA at 416. LUBA affirmed the county\u2019s deferral of consideration of the application of DCC 18.113.070(D) to the CMP. Petitioner again seeks review.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In her assignments of error, petitioner complains that the board\u2019s order is unlawful in substance for three reasons. In her first assignment of error, petitioner argues that LUBA erred in sustaining the county\u2019s conditional approval of the CMP because there was not sufficient evidence in the local government record to show compliance with DCC 18.113.070(D). Petitioner claims in her second assignment of error that any conditional approval of the CMP that defers the application of DCC 18.113.070 must be based on a <em>Meyer </em>finding of feasibility and that LUBA erred in failing to require that finding. Finally, petitioner\u2019s third assignment of error asserts that the county\u2019s finding that compliance with DCC 18.113.070 was feasible was not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because determination of the merits of petitioner\u2019s second and third assignments of error helps to frame the analysis of the first assignment of error, we consider them first.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Petitioner first argues that a particular showing of the feasibility of compliance with DCC 18.113.070(D) was necessary in order to postpone consideration of that approval criterion. Petitioner claims that a showing of \u201cfeasibility\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>necessary to justify postponement of a determination of compliance with an approval standard and that \u201cfeasibility\u201d means the justification required by <em>Meyer </em>for determining satisfaction of an approval standard \u2014 that compliance with the standard is \u201clikely and reasonably certain to succeed.\u201d We agree with LUBA that a finding under <em>Meyer </em>(that the local government record shows that compliance with DCC 18.113.070(D) is \u201clikely and reasonably certain to succeed\u201d) is not necessary to postpone consideration of compliance with the approval standard. Rather, such a finding under <em>Meyer </em>would suffice to justify final adjudication of compliance with the approval criterion, as opposed to putting that determination off for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">We agree, however, with petitioner\u2019s contention that a showing of feasible compliance with the wildlife mitigation standard is necessary to justify the county\u2019s decision to postpone consideration of that standard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That showing of \u201cfeasibility,\u201d however, is not the same as the <em>Meyer </em>requirement. <em>Meyer </em>itself highlights the distinction between a determination that an approval criterion is met, and a conclusion that satisfaction of a standard is \u201cfeasible.\u201d In <em>Meyer, </em>LUBA had upheld the subdivision approval because the city found compliance with the subdivision approval standards to be \u201cfeasible.\u201d <em>Meyer, </em>67 Or App at 280 n 5. This court expressly disapproved LUBA\u2019s conclusion that a showing of \u201cfeasible\u201d or possible compliance with standards suffices to justify a local government land use decision. Instead, it is necessary that the evidentiary record show that the approval standards were met, without regard to any modification as a result of later administrative review. We noted in <em>Meyer.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">\u201cFor some reason, LUBA couched its discussion of this question in terms of whether or not the city found the preliminary plan proposed a \u2018feasible\u2019 development project. Petitioners argue that \u2018feasibility\u2019 cannot be the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>standard because nearly any conceivable project may be feasible from an engineering perspective if enough money is committed to it. It is apparent, however, that by \u2018feasibility\u2019 LUBA means more than feasibility from a technical engineering perspective. It means that substantial evidence supports findings that solutions to certain problems (for example, landslide potential) posed by a project are possible, likely and reasonably certain to succeed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Although we agree that a <em>Meyer </em>justification is not necessary to postpone consideration of DCC 18.113.070(D), we do not agree that <em>no </em>justification is necessary. Instead, a finding that compliance with DCC 18.113.070(D) is \u201cfeasible,\u201d in the sense of a possibility of attainment, is necessary in order to justify a decision to forgo denial of the CMP and to approve it with the deferral condition. The county was obliged to justify \u201capproval or denial\u201d of the CMP with a statement of the relevant criteria, the relevant facts and \u201cthe justification for the decision based on the criteria, standards and facts set forth.\u201d ORS 215.416(9); DCC 22.28.010(A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioner and others appeared at the hearing on the CMP and argued that the application should be denied based on the record created at that hearing. ORS 215.416(9) requires that the county explain its decision that the CMP application should not be denied, but instead should be conditionally allowed. That explanation necessarily must rule out denial as the outcome required by the hearing record. Denial of an application, as opposed to postponement of consideration, is required if satisfaction of the approval criteria is not possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>even with additional evidence. Moreover, a necessary justification for a condition of approval of a land use permit is that the condition can be met, that its satisfaction is feasible. For those reasons, a finding of feasibility \u2014 that compliance with the approval criterion is possible \u2014 explains the reason for not denying the application and imposing the condition of approval under ORS 215.416(9) and DCC 22.28.010 and is required by those policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The county made that finding of feasibility in justifying the condition that postponed approval of a wildlife mitigation plan. The county found that \u201cit is feasible to mitigate completely any negative impact on identified fish and wildlife resources so that there is no net loss or net degradation of the resource.\u201d That finding is sufficient to explain the reason under ORS 215.416(9) and DCC 22.28.010(A) why the county did not deny the application and instead approved the application with the postponement condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Petitioner\u2019s third assignment of error is that LUBA erred in affirming the postponement because the necessary feasibility finding was not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Petitioner again argues that the \u201cevidence and findings on remand clearly do not satisfy the <em>Meyer </em>test that solutions \u2018are possible, likely and reasonably certain to succeed\u2019 where the record wasn\u2019t opened and no new findings were made.\u201d We have already addressed the contention that LUBA erred in failing to require a <em>Meyer </em>finding of compliance with DCC 18.113.070(D) in order to justify conditional approval of the CMP. Thus, petitioner\u2019s complaint about lack of substantial evidence to support a <em>Meyer </em>finding is misplaced. If petitioner is arguing that the county\u2019s actual feasibility finding, which <em>is </em>necessary to justify conditional approval, is not supported by substantial evidence, that argument is unpersuasive. That finding was supported by substantial evidence in the record for the reasons stated by LUBA in <em>Gould I. </em>54 Or LUBA at 259-60. Thus, the county\u2019s decision to conditionally approve the CMP, rather than deny the CMP application for failure to satisfy DCC 18.113.070(D), complied with ORS 215.416(9) and DCC 22.28.010.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Petitioner\u2019s first assignment of error is that LUBA\u2019s order was \u201cunlawful in substance because it affirmed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>County readoption of the CMP final land use decision where there was not substantial evidence to determine compliance with the mandatory fish and wildlife approval standards.\u201d As we interpret that assignment of error, it raises the same issues as those that were raised in the second and third assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">LUBA did not err in affirming the county\u2019s decision on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\"> ORS 197.850(9) provides the standard of review used by the Court of Appeals in reviewing a LUBA decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">\u201cThe court may affirm, reverse or remand the order.
