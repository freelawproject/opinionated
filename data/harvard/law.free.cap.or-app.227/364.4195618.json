J.</author>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">This case is before us on remand from the Supreme Court, which vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Pratt, </em>205 Or App 559, 134 P3d 1053 (2005) <em>(Pratt I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d, to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Pratt, </em>345 Or 316, 195 P3d 63 (2008). In <em>Pratt I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed a departure sentence based on judicial findings. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Pratt I </em>was correct. Accordingly, we again remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Defendant was convicted of four counts of robbery in the first degree and one count of assault in the second degree. The trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 144 months\u2019 imprisonment on one of the first-degree robbery counts, 90 months of which were imposed pursuant to ORS 137.700. The court gave the following reasons for its decision to impose a departure sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">\u201c[0]n the Rob I, I am finding grounds to depart. Persistent involvement in behavior that continues to be assaultive, that\u2019s when we see [defendant]. * * * The level of violence is escalating \u2014 of actual damage and injury is escalating. That is of course concerning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">\u201cHe was on supervision at the time this event happened, and not only was he on supervision, but he was on supervision for another robbery. And he\u2019s shown himself so far\u2014 and I\u2019m talking about behavior, not expression of willingness to change \u2014 he has not been receptive to interventions. And I have got to say I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to get any more help from the penitentiary than he had available through the Juvenile Court system, and that hasn\u2019t worked. So there are departure grounds. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: * * * Your Honor, [defendant] mentioned something that I should bring up. When the Court went through the departure factors, would you find that those departure factors, each of them, would be sufficient to support the departure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: I listed the ones I thought about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: You listed four, persistent involvement in assaultive behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: That alone. Escalation of violence, on supervision for attempted robbery and not receptive to treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes, I think they all are.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">In this case, the trial court did not explicitly state that it was relying on the departure factors that it found, either singly or in combination, and therefore we assume that the court did not consider each factor to be independently sufficient to support a departure. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>111 Or App 147, 826 P2d 1010 (1992). Thus, remand for re-sentencing may be warranted if one of the factors relied on by the trial court is subject to legitimate debate. <em>See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (setting out \u201clegitimate debate\u201d standard for exercise of discretion to review unpreserved challenges to departure sentences based on judicial findings of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Because it is dispositive, we examine only the departure factor of defendant\u2019s probation status at the time he committed his current offenses. As we explained in <em>State v. Allen, </em>198 Or App 392, 396,108 P3d 651, <em>adh\u2019d to as clarified on recons, </em>202 Or App 565, 123 P3d 331 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 46 (2006), an upward departure sentence based on a defendant\u2019s supervisory status \u201crequires further inferences about the malevolent quality of the offender and the failure of his [supervisory] status to serve as an effective deterrent.\u201d Here, defendant testified that he had supported himself, while on probation for two prior attempted robberies, by selling marijuana in downtown Portland; defendant also committed his current offenses \u2014 violent robberies \u2014 while on probation. That evidence, while not trivial, is also not so serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>and compelling a record of defendant\u2019s criminality as to convince us that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have drawn the inference that defendant possessed a \u201cmalevolent quality.\u201d <em>Cf. State v. Martina, </em>227 Or App 13, 16, 205 P3d 87 (2009) (finding no legitimate debate that jury would have drawn inference of malevolence where the defendant committed multiple violent assaults and manslaughter while on probation for an assault conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
