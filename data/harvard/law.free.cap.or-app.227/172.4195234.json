Mother raises three assignments of error, one of which is that the judgment did not comply with the requirements of ORS 419B.476(5)(a) and (f), which require a court to make specific findings when it approves a change of that kind in a plan. Because we agree with mother as to that assignment of error, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">We take the facts from the record. D and C, then seven- and four-year-old boys, were removed from their mother\u2019s care on April 23, 2003. On June 19, 2003, the court established dependency jurisdiction over the boys on the basis of mother\u2019s admission that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">\u201c[d]espite numerous interventions by DHS and other community agencies, the mother has been unable and/or unwilling to demonstrate adequate decision-making and/or [judgment] that would protect the child from risk of harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Mother was required to undergo a psychological evaluation and to comply with recommended treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">At the time of the first permanency hearing, on April 15, 2004, the children were living in mother\u2019s home as wards of the court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That arrangement was continued at a permanency hearing held on March 20, 2006. However, on September 6,2007, the children were ordered back into foster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>care, after mother was late picking C up from school, the police were called, and mother was subsequently arrested on an outstanding warrant. Mother was later convicted of fraud and served several months in jail and in a community corrections center. She was released sometime in the spring of2008 and placed on \u201chouse arrest\u201d with an electronic monitoring device; that situation was expected to end in October 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">On May 22, 2008, the Department of Human Services (DHS) asked the court to approve an alternate plan of permanent foster care for the boys. After a hearing on the matter, the court entered a judgment determining that it was <em>not </em>in the best interest of the children for DHS to move to a plan of <em>permanent foster care </em>at that time. It also ordered mother, on her release from custody, to \u201c[mjaintain safe and stable housing as approved by DHS/CWP,\u201d and it continued the matter to July 8, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">At the July 8 hearing \u2014 which resulted in the judgment that is the subject of this appeal \u2014 DHS asked the court to approve a plan of <em>long-term foster care </em>for the children because return to mother was no longer appropriate and the children did not agree to a plan of permanent foster care. According to the caseworker\u2019s \u201cReport and Recommendation,\u201d dated July 2, 2008, mother was living with her current husband, a convicted child sex offender; father (mother\u2019s ex-husband); her brother; her mother; and her mother\u2019s boyfriend. The report noted DHS\u2019s extensive history with the family \u201cattempting to address issues of lack of supervision, threat of harm, and chronic neglect,\u201d and stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">\u201c[t]here is a long history of intergenerational sex abuse and incest in this family. * * * [Mother] continues to want to reintegrate her husband * * * into her children\u2019s lives, despite the risk he poses to her children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">It concluded that mother \u201c[cannot] care for the boys in a healthy and safe manner\u201d and recommended that the plan be changed to long-term foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Mother opposed the change in plan, arguing that it was premature, given the children\u2019s strong attachment to her and her conscientious participation in services.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>argued that DHS had been deficient in its efforts to maintain that attachment, and she objected to DHS shifting to APPLA without following the required procedures, particularly OAR. 413-070-0540, which requires the convening of a team, preferably including the child\u2019s parents, to be involved in the decision-making process, and OAR 413-070-0548(1), which requires a service plan detailing how the child\u2019s attachment to and permanent ties with family members will be maintained. The state responded that, under the applicable Oregon Administrative Rules, parents are not required to be included in the APPLA decision-making process and the service plan need not be developed until after the court has approved the alternate plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">In making its ruling, the trial court first noted the \u201cextensive history\u201d of the cases involving the children, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">\u201cThe [c]ourt is not going to try to catalog everything that is in the files regarding the situation that not only [C] had been in, nor catalog all of the issues with [mother] and [father]. The record speaks for itself in that regard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The court then found,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">\u201cbased on the information before it, both historically and the information that is most recently provided that the agency has made reasonable efforts to return the children to their parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">\u201cThat it is in the best interests of both of these children that the permanent plan of long term foster care return to a parent [sic<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] and another planned living arrangement is approved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">The court also ordered DHS to present to the parents, within 30 days, a written service plan in compliance with the Oregon Administrative Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">The court subsequently issued a written judgment reflecting its oral ruling and providing, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>\u201cThe court having heard from the parties and based thereon it is the finding of the court that Department of Human Services has made reasonable efforts to effect the return of the child to the parents and further efforts to reunify the family would not be likely to succeed within a reasonable time and the plan for the child shall be changed from Return to Parent to Another Planned Living Arrangement (APLA), long-term foster care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The judgment further noted that the court \u201ctakes judicial notice of the court report, and the contents therein, received by the court July 3, 2008.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">On appeal, mother raises three assignments of error: (1) the trial court erred in finding that changing the plan to long-term foster care was in the best interests of the children while mother and the children were continuing to make progress; (2) the judgment does not include the findings required under ORS 419B.476(5)(a) and (f)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (requiring findings) and \u201cthis court should not change the plan on the basis of that Judgment\u201d; and (3) the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the change in plan without first requiring DHS to follow the procedures outlined in the Oregon Administrative Rules for effecting a change to APPLA. <em>See </em>OAR 413-070-0520 to 413-070-0560.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The state responds that the court properly ordered the change because the children had been under the jurisdiction of the court for more than four years; while in mother\u2019s care, they had been subjected to sexual abuse, chronic neglect, and threat of harm; and, despite services, mother continued to maintain an unsafe and unstable household, and failed to recognize the danger to her children created by her association with sex offenders. It further argues that mother\u2019s second assignment is an unpreserved claim that we should decline to review as \u201cplain error\u201d and, with respect to mother\u2019s third assignment, that the court did not abuse its discretion in allowing a change in the permanency plan before the meeting described in OAR 413-070-0540 or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>development of a service plan consistent with OAR 413-070-0548 had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">As explained below, we agree with mother that the judgment failed to comply with the requirements of ORS 419B.476(5)(a) and (f), and, consequently, we reverse and remand to the juvenile court for further proceedings. As a result of that disposition, we need not address mother\u2019s remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">ORS 419B.476(5) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">\u201cThe court shall enter an order within 20 days after the permanency hearing. In addition to any determinations or orders the court may make under subsection (4) of this section, the order shall include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201c(a) The court\u2019s determination required under subsections (2) and (3) of this section, including a brief description of the efforts the department has made with regard to the case plan in effect at the time of the permanency hearing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">\u201c(f) If the court determines that the permanency plan for the ward should be a planned permanent living arrangement, the court\u2019s determination of a compelling reason, that must be documented by the department, why it would not be in the best interests of the ward to be returned home, placed for adoption, placed with a legal guardian or placed with a fit and willing relativef]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">Paragraph (5)(a) thus also implicates subsections (2) and (3) of the statute. Subsection (3) is not pertinent to this case; however, subsection (2) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-11\">\u201cAt a permanency hearing the court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-12\">\u201c(a) If the case plan at the time of the hearing is to reunify the family, determine whether the Department of Human Services has made reasonable efforts * * * to make it possible for the ward to safely return home and whether the parent has made sufficient progress to make it possible for the ward to safely return home. In making its determination, the court shall consider the ward\u2019s health and safety the paramount concerns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u201c(d) Make the findings of fact under ORS 419B.449(2).\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">As always, we first must determine whether mother\u2019s argument was preserved, and, if not, whether it constitutes \u201cerror apparent on the face of the record,\u201d also known as \u201cplain error.\u201d ORAP 5.45(1) (\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claimed error was preserved in the lower court * * *, provided that the appellate court may consider an error of law apparent on the face of the record.\u201d). An error is \u201cplain\u201d if it is one of law, is not reasonably in dispute, and does not require consideration of matters outside the record. <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990). If the alleged error meets those criteria, we then must determine whether it is appropriate for us to exercise our discretion to correct the error. <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In supplemental briefing, mother argues, essentially, that preservation is not required \u201c[w]hen the court makes general comments, but not specific findings, orally, and then fails to make written findings in the Judgment produced within 20 days after the hearing pursuant to ORS 419B.476(5).\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the alternative, mother urges us to exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>our discretion to review the error as plain error. In either event, mother asks that the case be remanded to the juvenile court for further findings \u201cand/or reconsideration of the plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">The state agrees that the court\u2019s failure to make all of the statutorily required findings constitutes plain error under <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. J. N., </em>225 Or App 139, 200 P3d 615 (2009), but argues that we should decline to exercise our discretion to correct the error. In support of that argument, the state points to the following: (1) mother could have requested the required findings after the initial judgment issued or sought to modify the initial judgment under ORS 419B.923(7), but did not do so; (2) by taking judicial notice of the caseworker\u2019s court report, \u201cthe requisite information was included in the judgment, thus obviating the need for this court to correct any error\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe record at the hearing otherwise satisfies the required statutory findings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">We agree with mother that, under these circumstances, preservation is not required. As the Supreme Court recently explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">\u201c[plreservation rules are pragmatic as well as prudential. What is required of a party to adequately present a contention to the trial court can vary depending on the nature of the claim or argument; the touchstone in that regard, ultimately, is procedural fairness to the parties and to the trial court. * * * <em>In some circumstances, the preservation requirement gives way entirely, as when a party has no practical ability to raise an issue. See, e.g., McCarthy v. Oregon Freeze Dry, Inc., </em>327 Or 84, 95 n 6, 957 P2d 1200, <em>modified on recons, </em>327 Or 185, 957 P2d 1200 (1998) (party not required to take action to preserve an issue that first arose when court issued its order).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-7\"><em>Peeples v. Lampert, </em>345 Or 209, 220, 191 P3d 637 (2008) (emphasis added; footnote omitted); <em>see also State v. Gutierrez, </em>170 Or App 91, 94, 11 P3d 690 (2000) (principles underlying preservation requirements not implicated where trial court <em>sua sponte </em>entered a judgment of dismissal with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>prejudice and, hence, \u201cthere [was] no opportunity to bring the alleged error to the court\u2019s attention before it rule[d]\u201d); <em>cf. State v. Hammond, </em>218 Or App 574, 584, 180 P3d 137 (2008) (where statute required findings to be made \u201con the record in open court,\u201d defense counsel had a \u201ccomplete contemporaneous opportunity\u201d to address the trial court\u2019s noncompliance; failure to do so rendered defendant\u2019s claim of error unpreserved).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Here, the statute dictates that the required findings be made \u2014 not at the time of hearing \u2014 but in an order issued within 20 days after the hearing. ORS 419B.476(5). Until that order issued, mother had no way of knowing that the court would enter a judgment that did not comply with the statute. Indeed, it was not unreasonable for mother to assume that the court, in entering the written judgment, would make the findings necessary to support its oral ruling. In other words, mother had \u201cno practical ability to raise [the] issue,\u201d <em>Peeples, </em>345 Or at 220, because the issue did not arise until the court entered the judgment. Because the error in the judgment that mother raises on appeal is not one that she failed to preserve, it is not one that is subject to the constraints of plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Turning to the merits, as framed by mother\u2019s argument, <em>see </em>227 Or App at 178-80, the relevant statutes required the judgment to include the following: (1) the court\u2019s determination as to whether DHS had made reasonable efforts to make it possible for the children to safely return home, ORS 419B.476(5)(a), (2); (2) a brief description of DHS\u2019s efforts with regard to reunification, the case plan in effect at the time of the hearing, ORS 419B.476(5)(a); (3) the court\u2019s determination whether mother had made sufficient progress to make it possible for the children to safely return home, ORS 419B.476(5)(a), (2)(a); and (4) a \u201ccompelling reason<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark> that must be documented by [DHS], why it would not be in the best interests of the [children] to be returned home, placed for adoption, placed with a legal guardian or placed with a fit and willing relative[,]\u201d ORS 419B.476(5)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Here, the judgment fulfilled the first requirement\u2014 the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d determination and, arguably, the third \u2014 lack of sufficient progress on mother\u2019s part. However, it indisputably failed to include a brief description of DHS\u2019s efforts or, most significantly, a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d why it was not in the best interest of the children for them to be returned home or placed in another permanency option, such as adoption, guardianship, or placement with a relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Even the state agrees that the judgment did not include all of the statutorily required findings. In the state\u2019s view, however, the judgment, \u201c[ajlthough not ideal,\u201d nonetheless comports with the statutory requirements because the findings were \u201cincorporated into the order when the court included in the judgment what it \u2018heard from the parties\u2019 as the basis for its findings of reasonable efforts and insufficient progress by mother\u201d and because the court took judicial notice of the court report and its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">We disagree. The fact that the judgment refers to what the court \u201cheard from the parties\u201d and states that the court took judicial notice of the caseworker\u2019s report, establishes, at most, the information on which the court relied in making its decision. It does not, without more, reflect the court\u2019s reasoning or demonstrate the basis for the court\u2019s ultimate decision, much less set forth, as required in this case, a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d why it is in the children\u2019s best interest to move to a permanency plan of long-term foster care.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, it is inadequate to meet the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">By requiring that the court make such findings, the legislature has expressed its intent that the trial court carefully evaluate DHS\u2019s decision to change a permanency plan for a child in order to ensure that the decision is one that is most likely to lead to a positive outcome for the child. That is particularly the case when the recommended change is to APPLA, which is the \u201cleast permanent\u201d and, consequently, \u201cleast preferred\u201d of the permanency plans available for a child in substitute care. OAR 413-070-0528(6) (\u201cAPPLA is the least permanent of all the permanency plans and must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>used only when the other plans have been ruled out.\u201d); OAR 413-070-0528(7) (\u201cWhen APPLA is utilized as a child\u2019s permanency plan, the plan should be regularly reviewed to determine whether a more permanent plan has become appropriate for the child.\u201d); OAR 413-070-0532 (\u201cAPPLA is the least preferred permanency plan for a child.\u201d); OAR 413-070-0536(1) (providing that \u201c[t]he Department may identify APPLA as a permanency plan for a child only if the Department has determined that there is a <em>compelling reason </em>* * * that it would not be in the best interests of the child to be placed on a permanent basis\u201d with a parent, in an adoptive home, in a guardianship, or in a permanent placement with a fit and willing relative (emphasis in original)). Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-9\"> With the exception of the children\u2019s names and case numbers, the judgments at issue \u2014 as well as the underlying plans \u2014 are identical; for convenience only, we generally use the singular number throughout the remainder of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b201-10\"> APPLA is \u201cany permanency plan other than reunification, adoption, guardianship, or permanent placement with a fit and willing relative!,]\u201d OAR 413-070-0520; it is the \u201cleast preferred permanency plan for a child!,]\u201d OAR 413-070-0532. <em>See also </em>ORS 419A.004(18) (defining \u201cplanned permanent living arrangement\u201d as \u201can out-of-home placement other than by adoption, placement with a relative or placement with a legal guardian that is consistent with the case plan and in the best interests of the ward\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b201-11\"> It is unclear from the record when the children were returned to mother\u2019s care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b202-9\"> Father, who is 80 years old and in poor health, also opposed the plan; he is not a party on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b203-11\"> That jumbled phrasing does not appear in the written judgment and is possibly the result of an error in transcription; in any event, it is of no import to our resolution of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b204-7\"> Mother\u2019s assignment of error refers to paragraphs (5)(a) and (d); however, in the body of her argument, she refers to paragraphs (5)(a) and (f). Because this case involves the court\u2019s determination of APPLA as the permanency plan for the children, (f) is the correct paragraph; paragraph (d) applies when the court determines that adoption is the appropriate permanency plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b206-6\"> ORS 419B.449(2), in turn, requires the court to make certain findings at the conclusion of a review hearing; the precise findings required depend on the current status of the child and the nature of the court\u2019s decision. However, mother does not argue that the court erred by failing to make the findings required by ORS 419B.449 at the conclusion of the hearing in this case. Neither does mother argue that the court erred in failing to include the ORS 419B.449 findings in the written judgment. Hence, we do not consider either issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b206-7\"> In her initial brief, mother did not make that argument, but instead urged us to review the court\u2019s failure to make written findings under ORS 419B.476(5) as plain error. In contrast, the state argued that, although the trial court did not make written findings in the judgment \u201con all statutorily[ Required factors,\u201d mother did not request the court to do so at the hearing and \u201cdid not object to the court\u2019s failure to do so\u201d; thus, in the state\u2019s view, the issue was not preserved. The state further argued that, under <em>State v. Bucholz, </em>317 Or 309, 321, 855 P2d 1100 (1993), the court\u2019s failure to enter findings could not be reviewed as plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The day before oral argument in this case, we decided <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. J. N., </em>225 Or App 139, 200 P3d 615 (2009). In <em>J. N., </em>we rejected the state\u2019s position that <em>Bucholz </em>bars our plain error review of a trial court\u2019s failure to make the findings required under ORS 419B.476(2)(d) and ORS 419B.449(2) and (3). 225 Or App at 144-45.
