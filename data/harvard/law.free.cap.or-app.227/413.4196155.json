J.</author>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Defendant petitions for reconsideration of our decision in <em>State v. Parker, </em>225 Or App 610, 202 P3d 205 (2009). There, we remanded the case to the trial court, under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, to address, and render findings, as to whether defendant had the requisite subjective belief under a <em>Holmes </em>\u201ctype (b)\u201d inquiry,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with instruction to reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction should it find that defendant did not have the requisite subjective belief. <em>Parker, </em>225 Or App at 616-17. Because we remanded under the state constitution, we did not address defendant\u2019s federal constitutional claim. <em>Id. </em>at 612 n 2. Defendant contends, in part, that an error in the disposition of the appeal, ORAP 6.25(1)(b), necessitates reconsideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, defendant contends that our direction to the trial court in the final paragraph of the opinion was deficient because, in defendant\u2019s view, we should have instructed the trial court that, even if it finds that defendant \u201cdid not have the requisite subjective belief,\u201d 225 Or App at 617, it cannot reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction without first considering the substance of defendant\u2019s challenge under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. For the reasons set forth below, we modify our former opinion and adhere to our opinion as so modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">In framing our analysis at the beginning of our opinion, we explained that defendant had also raised a federal constitutional challenge, but that we would not reach that contention because our disposition rested on state constitutional grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">\u201cDefendant also contends that he was unlawfully seized under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Because we remand under Article I, section 9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>of the Oregon Constitution, we do not reach defendant\u2019s federal constitutional claims. <em>See MacPherson v. DAS, </em>340 Or 117, 125-26, 130 P3d 308 (2006) (Oregon courts analyze state constitutional challenges before turning to federal constitutional challenges).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">225 Or App at 612 n 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">We then addressed the proper application of Article I, section 9, to the circumstances of defendant\u2019s encounter with the police, applying the analysis of <em>State v. Ashbaugh, </em>225 Or App 16, 23-24, 200 P3d 149 (2008). <em>Parker, </em>225 Or App at 614-16. We concluded that, under a <em>Holmes </em>\u201ctype (b)\u201d formulation, the circumstances of this case satisfied the \u201cobjective\u201d component of that formulation but that a remand was required for the trial court to render a finding as to the \u201csubjective\u201d component, <em>viz., </em>\u201cwhether, before [the officer] elicited defendant\u2019s consent to search, defendant subjectively believed that the officers had significantly restricted his freedom of movement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In the final paragraph of our opinion, we prescribed the scope of remand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">\u201cIf the court finds that the state has proved that defendant did not have the requisite subjective belief, <em>the court should reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction. </em>If the court determines that defendant did subjectively hold that belief, however, the evidence found during the search of defendant\u2019s person must be suppressed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 617 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">The gravamen of defendant\u2019s argument on reconsideration is that our instruction to the trial court was incorrect because we should have directed the trial court that, if it renders a finding adverse to defendant as to the <em>Holmes </em>\u201ctype (b)\u201d subjective component, it cannot reinstate his conviction unless it also considers, and rejects, his Fourth Amendment arguments. Defendant does <em>not </em>contend that <em>we </em>should have reached his Fourth Amendment contentions on appeal before directing a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">Defendant\u2019s position is puzzling. In moving to suppress, defendant did invoke the Fourth Amendment, albeit in cursory fashion (see below) \u2014 and the trial court, in denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>suppression, necessarily rejected defendant\u2019s reliance on the Fourth Amendment. It makes no sense to remand to the trial court with an explicit direction to consider a federal constitutional challenge that it has already rejected. Indeed, such a direction on remand would only make sense, practically from defendant\u2019s perspective, in order to give defendant the opportunity to raise a \u201cnew and improved\u201d Fourth Amendment argument to the trial court \u2014 in effect, to give defendant a \u201csecond bite\u201d at the federal constitutional \u201capple\u201d in the context of a remand necessitated solely by the exigencies of the state constitutional analysis. That we will not do.</p>\n<p id=\"AFl\">What <em>does </em>make sense, prudentially and practically, is for us to now consider defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment challenge, instead of requiring defendant to reiterate that challenge on a second appeal in the event that his conviction is reinstated on remand. Not coincidentally, reaching defendant\u2019s federal constitutional contentions now would comport with our course in <em>Ashbaugh.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In <em>Ashbaugh, </em>as here, we similarly remanded to the trial court for a finding of defendant\u2019s subjective belief under a <em>Holmes </em>\u201ctype (b)\u201d inquiry with instruction to reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction should the trial court find defendant did not have the requisite subjective belief. 225 Or App at 28. In doing so, we did not defer consideration of the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment challenge. Instead, we reached the defendant\u2019s federal constitutional arguments, but determined that the defendant \u201cfail[ed] to present any \u2018thorough and focused constitutional analysis\u2019 \u201d and, thus, \u201cdecline[d] to address her federal claim\u201d \u2014 in effect, rejecting that claim as unreviewable. <em>Id. </em>at 20 n 2 (quoting <em>State v. Thompson, </em>328 Or 248, 254 n 3, 971 P2d 879, <em>cert den, </em>527 US 1042 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">We turn, then, to defendant\u2019s federal constitutional challenge. That challenge, as framed on appeal, was unpre-served. Defendant\u2019s three-sentence Fourth Amendment argument in his written motion to suppress, which was never again raised or argued at the suppression hearing, was so undeveloped that it failed to alert the trial court as to the substance of the contention now being advanced on appeal. <em>See State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000). Accordingly, we decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Reconsideration allowed; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\"> In <em>State v.
