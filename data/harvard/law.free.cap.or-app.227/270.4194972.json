Robertson, </em>203 Or App 18, 125 P3d 20 <em>(Robertson I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Robertson, </em>345 Or 316, 195 P3d 63 (2008). In <em>Robertson I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed a departure sentence based on judicial findings. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Robertson I </em>was erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree rape; three counts of first-degree sexual penetration; one count of first-degree sexual abuse; two counts of first-degree burglary; four counts of menacing; two counts of reckless endangerment; one count of stalking; one count of telephonic harassment; and two counts of attempting to elude police. The trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 144 months\u2019 imprisonment on one of defendant\u2019s first-degree burglary convictions. The court gave the following reasons for its decision to impose the departure sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">\u201c[T]hat [defendant] was on probation under supervision from a court at that very time. That there was actual violence threatened against the individual; that is, [the victim]. That this is persistent involvement in similar activity against her, and its entire purpose was to terrorize her in her own home, which I take to be also independently a reason for a departure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">\u201cIn addition * * * I think any one of the individual factors otherwise that I described would be a sufficient basis to justify departure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Because the trial court stated on the record that each of the departure factors it identified was independently sufficient to support a departure, we need only examine the factor of defendant\u2019s probation status at the time of the offenses. As we explained in <em>State v. Allen, </em>198 Or App 392, 396, 108 P3d 651, <em>adh\u2019d to as clarified on recons, </em>202 Or App 565, 123 P3d 331 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 46 (2006), an upward departure sentence based on a defendant\u2019s supervisory status \u201crequires further inferences about the malevolent quality of the offender and the failure of his [supervisory] status to serve as an effective deterrent.\u201d Here, defendant was on probation for a prior conviction for telephonic harassment of the same victim. The jury convicted defendant of telephonic harassment in this case. Defendant\u2019s repeated harassment of the victim, culminating in his violent intrusion into her home, convinces us that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have drawn the inferences of malevolence and failure to be deterred required by <em>Allen. See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (setting out \u201clegitimate debate\u201d standard for exercise of discretion to review unpreserved challenges to departure sentences based on judicial findings of fact). Accordingly, we decline to exercise our discretion to review the assigned error.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
