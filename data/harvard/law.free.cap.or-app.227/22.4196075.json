J.</author>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">. This case is before us on remand from the Supreme Court, which vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Soto-Nunez, </em>211 Or App 545, 155 P3d 96 (2007) <em>(Soto-Nunez I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Soto-Nunez, </em>345 Or 316, 195 P3d 64 (2008). In <em>Soto-Nunez I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed departure sentences based on judicial findings that defendant was persistently involved in similar offenses. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Soto-Nunez I </em>was erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Defendant was convicted of felony driving under the influence of intoxicants and identity theft. The trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on the DUII conviction. The court also imposed a departure sentence of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment on the identity theft conviction. The court gave the following reasons for its departures:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">\u201cOn the charge of driving under the influence of intoxicants * * * the court is going to impose a departure sentence to the maximum of 60 months with the Corrections Division and that\u2019s based upon persistent involvement in similar activities, which is, basically, the history of eight prior DUII\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">\u201cOn the charge of identity theft, the court is going to depart from the six-month presumptive sentence to 12 months based upon persistent involvement in similar activity. And I\u2019m relying on the charges of giving false information to a police officer, his convictions for that and the information that\u2019s presented by the DA at sentencing, the use of other names, because that does present a threat to those individuals in terms of their possible arrest and use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>their identities in his criminal enterprise, namely the DUITs\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">On this record, we readily conclude that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have drawn the inference that defendant was persistently involved in similar offenses. <em>See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (setting out \u201clegitimate debate\u201d standard for exercise of discretion to review unpre-served challenges to departure sentences based on judicial findings of fact). As we explained in <em>State v. Williams, </em>225 Or App 325, 328-29, 201 P3d 267 (2009), under <em>State v. Bray, </em>342 Or 711, 724, 160 P3d 983 (2007), there is no legitimate debate that a jury would have found a defendant to have been persistently involved in similar offenses where the number and frequency of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions compels the inference that his or her criminal behavior has been \u201cpersistent.\u201d Defendant had eight prior convictions for DUII, all of which he committed within eight years of his sentencing in this case. Both the number and the frequency of defendant\u2019s DUII convictions render it beyond legitimate debate that the jury would have drawn the inference of persistency required by <em>Bray.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The court also imposed a durational departure sentence on defendant\u2019s conviction for identity theft based on persistent involvement in similar offenses, that is, his three prior convictions for giving false information to a police officer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, defendant had three prior convictions for giving false information to a police officer. That offense, although not identical to identity theft, is sufficiently similar that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have found defendant\u2019s three prior convictions to be for a \u201csimilar offense.\u201d <em>See State v. Cornelius, </em>112 Or App 98, 100-01, 827 P2d 937, <em>rev den, </em>314 Or 176 (1992) (setting out methodology for determining similarity of prior convictions). Defendant did not dispute \u2014 in the trial court, on direct appeal, or on remand \u2014 the trial court\u2019s finding that the offenses were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>similar. Likewise, given the number of defendant\u2019s prior convictions, we conclude that there is also no legitimate debate that the jury would have found defendant to have been persistently involved in similar offenses. Accordingly, we decline to exercise our discretion to review the assigned error.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-6\"> To the extent that the trial court also relied on the state\u2019s representation of defendant\u2019s conduct that had not resulted in a conviction, that reliance plays no part in our analysis because, as the Supreme Court made clear in <em>Bray, </em>a finding of persistent involvement in similar offenses is predicated on the existence of two or more <em>prior convictions.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
