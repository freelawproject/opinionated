J.</author>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">The issue in this domestic relations case is the extent to which husband\u2019s beneficial interest in his mother\u2019s revocable trust can be taken into account in dividing the parties\u2019 marital property. The trial court concluded that, because the trust is revocable at the whim of the settlor, husband\u2019s interest in it is entirely speculative and, as a result, not subject to division. Wife appeals, arguing that the court erred in failing to award half of husband\u2019s beneficial interest in the trust to her and in failing to take evidence of the trust\u2019s value and the likelihood that it would, in fact, be revoked. Husband argues that, because of the inherently speculative nature of a beneficial interest in a revocable trust, the trial court did not err in declining to treat it as marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Resolving the parties\u2019 dispute requires us to interpret the controlling statute, ORS 107.105(l)(f), which authorizes the court in a dissolution case to divide the \u201creal or personal property\u201d of the parties. It is an issue of first impression. Nevertheless, it has long been the law of this state that mere expectancies are not \u201cproperty\u201d in the ordinary meaning of the term, and we find in the wording of the statute no intention to depart from that general rule. Because the beneficial interest in a revocable trust is, necessarily, a mere expectancy, we conclude that the trial court did not err. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. Husband and wife were married to each other for 23 years. At the time of trial, both were in their early fifties. Throughout the marriage, husband worked as a farmer and truck driver. At the time of trial, he worked for a rental company, earning approximately $2,500 per month. Wife also worked outside the home throughout the marriage, either part-time or full-time. At the time of trial, she worked half-time as a cook at a retirement center, earning approximately $1,100 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Beginning in 1982, the parties lived in a house that was located on a 100-acre grass seed farm on Oaklea Drive in Junction City and that was owned by husband\u2019s mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>(mother). The parties paid no rent. The house was in bad condition when they moved in, and they both worked on modernizing and reconditioning it. Mother paid for most of the improvements, although wife also contributed to the project with some of the proceeds from the sale of a house that she had lived in before the marriage and with money that she had received from a settlement after an automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Mother lived in a house on a different 100-acre grass seed farm that she owned near High Pass Road, in Junction City. She also owned an adjacent unimproved 100-acre parcel. When the parties married, husband stood to inherit half of mother\u2019s property, including her grass seed farms and the buildings on them. In 1999, after the parties had been married for 17 years, mother altered her estate plan and created a revocable trust. At the time of trial, the trust had not been revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Mother and wife got along well, even up to and after the parties separated; at her deposition, mother testified, \u201cWe have always visited up a storm. I always enjoy her.\u201d Mother gave both parties substantial financial assistance, including $15,000 to wife when wife\u2019s son from a previous marriage had legal trouble. At one point, mother intervened on wife\u2019s behalf to prevent husband from evicting her. At the time of trial, mother was 77 years old and experiencing some obvious symptoms of dementia.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Before trial, wife\u2019s attorney served four subpoenas <em>duces tecum, </em>two each on husband\u2019s mother and husband\u2019s sister, seeking their appearance for deposition and trial, as well as documents relevant to mother\u2019s revocable trust. Mother and the sister moved to quash the subpoenas and for a protective order. The court, apparently concluding that the contents of mother\u2019s revocable trust were <em>per se </em>irrelevant, granted those motions and denied wife\u2019s motion for reconsideration of that decision, although mother and the sister ultimately testified by deposition and at trial, albeit not about the trust. In response to wife\u2019s argument that, at the very least, the existence of the trust could be relevant, the court accepted, without objection, husband\u2019s counsel\u2019s stipulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">\u201cI will stipulate that in the current revocable trust that his mother has, that upon her death, as it presently is worded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>he would share equally with his sister in the proceeds that she left at her death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">During trial, the court denied wife\u2019s second motion to reconsider the order to quash, but \u2014 over husband\u2019s objection\u2014 received from husband\u2019s attorney a sealed copy of the trust document and, before ruling, reviewed it. The court refused to admit any other evidence about the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">At trial, wife argued that she was entitled to a one-half interest in husband\u2019s beneficial interest in mother\u2019s revocable trust. Husband argued that, because of the revocable nature of the trust, his interest in it was entirely speculative and, as a result, not property that is subject to division.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The trial court divided the parties\u2019 personal property, debts, and retirement accounts, which were all of comparable value. There was no real property to divide, as the Oaklea Drive farm on which the parties resided was still owned by mother, and they owned jointly no other real property at the time of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The trial court wrestled with the question whether a beneficial interest in a revocable trust is \u201cproperty\u201d that may be divided in a dissolution case. Ultimately, it issued two letter opinions on the subject, the first answering the question in the affirmative, but the second answering the question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">In its first letter opinion, the trial court summarized its dilemma in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">\u201cThere is a substantial question as to whether and how the Court should value Husband\u2019s interest in [mother\u2019s] trust. On the face of it, the trust is revocable and Husband has not yet received any measurable interest in the properties involved. The actual total value of the assets included in the trust are unknown to the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">The court noted that mother had been present in court and \u201cappeared not to be in the best of health.\u201d The court suggested that mother appears to be suffering from the effects of dementia. Nevertheless, the court concluded, husband could actually predecease his mother and receive nothing under the trust. In the end, the court found that husband\u2019s interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>in the revocable trust \u201cis more real than speculative.\u201d The court then decided to divide the interest as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\">\u201cThis being a long-term marriage with the circumstances as set forth herein, the Court has concluded that the best, and fairest way to deal with husband\u2019s interest in this asset, however it may be defined or valued, is to award Wife a non-interest bearing judgment for one-half of the value of Husband\u2019s portion of the trust, valued as of dissolution but payable as of the date of distribution, whenever made to Husband.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">\u201cTo offset the significant difference in personal property values awarded to Husband, Husband shall * * * pay to Wife the sum of $12,042 as an equalizing judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Both parties petitioned for reconsideration. The court took the petitions under advisement and issued an amended letter opinion, in which the court changed its mind about the nature and divisibility of husband\u2019s interest in mother\u2019s trust:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">\u201cThis case presents a factual situation that, in this court\u2019s view, is very likely to be inequitable and unfair to Wife in the reasonably near future. This Court is obligated, nevertheless, to follow the law as the Court finds it. The Court, albeit reluctantly, has concluded that the case law regarding revocable trusts dictates that the Court should modify its Opinion Letter in several particulars including regarding any eventual trust proceeds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">In the amended letter opinion, the court deleted its conclusion that the fairest way to deal with the case is to award wife a one-half interest in husband\u2019s interest in the trust. The court commented that, although it continued to have concerns about mother\u2019s health, \u201cevidence to prove she is incompetent is very limited.\u201d As a result, the court explained, \u201c[t]his Court must conclude that the Trust at issue is revocable and that Husband\u2019s interest therein is speculative and one not subject to division as a marital asset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">The court noted that its decision not to divide husband\u2019s interest in the trust as property posed a problem as to how \u201cto arrive at a fair, equitable and just result for each of the parties.\u201d To address that problem, the court increased the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>amount of the equalizing judgment, requiring husband to pay wife a total of $30,042, an increase of $18,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Wife appeals, advancing seven assignments of error. In her first assignment, wife contends that the trial court erred in failing to order an expedited pretrial hearing and to provide her with notice and an opportunity to be heard on the motions to quash her subpoenas and further erred in failing to reconsider its order granting the motions. In the remaining assignments, wife contends that the trial court erred in refusing to take evidence concerning the nature and value of mother\u2019s revocable trust and in refusing to award wife a one-half interest in husband\u2019s beneficial interest in that trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Husband responds that wife\u2019s assignments concerning the failure to hold an expedited hearing are not preserved and that the balance of her assignments stand or fall with the determination whether his beneficial interest in a revocable trust is \u201creal or personal property\u201d that is subject to division under ORS 107.105(l)(f). According to husband, such an interest is a mere expectancy, and mere expectancies have never been considered \u201cproperty\u201d under Oregon law. Husband points to the fact that the courts or legislatures in every other jurisdiction in the country that have considered this question have concluded that a beneficiary\u2019s interest in a revocable trust is too speculative to be considered \u201cproperty\u201d that may be divided in a dissolution case.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Wife replies that the notion that unvested, \u201cmere expectancies\u201d are not property is an \u201curban legend\u201d that should not be perpetuated in this case. Wife further points out that, whatever may be the law in other jurisdictions, the fact remains that no Oregon appellate court has yet held that a beneficial interest in a revocable trust cannot be considered property subject to division in a dissolution case.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">A. <em>First assignment: Failure to order expedited hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">In her first assignment of error, wife contends that the trial court erred in failing to issue an order setting an expedited hearing in response to the motions to quash her subpoenas <em>duces tecum. </em>As we have noted, in response to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>subpoenas, mother and husband\u2019s sister moved to quash. They also asked for expedited hearings on their motions. According to wife, under a supplemental local rule, the trial court should have sent a notice to all parties setting the matter for an expedited hearing. Instead, the trial court simply decided the matters, granting the motions to quash. Husband responds that wife did not preserve her contention on appeal that a hearing was required. In any event, husband argues, any error was harmless in light of the fact that wife moved for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s rulings and obtained a full hearing on the very same issues on her motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">We agree that any error in failing to set the matter for an expedited hearing was rendered harmless in light of the fact that it is undisputed that wife received a full and fair hearing on all of the same issues in response to her motion for reconsideration. We reject her first assignment of error without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">B. <em>Remaining assignments: Husband\u2019s beneficial interest in the revocable trust</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In her remaining assignments, wife contends that the trial court erred in failing to allow discovery of, or take evidence concerning, the nature and value of mother\u2019s revocable trust and in failing to award her half of husband\u2019s beneficial interest in it. As wife herself acknowledges, \u201c[a]ll [of those] assignments of error relate to a central issue of whether a revocable living trust may be considered either a marital asset or marital property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">ORS 107.105(l)(f) governs the division of a couple\u2019s property when their marriage is dissolved. Under that statute, the court has authority to provide</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">\u201c[flor the division or other disposition between the parties of the real or personal property, or both, of either or both of the parties as may be just and proper in all the circumstances. * * * There is a rebuttable presumption that both spouses have contributed equally to the acquisition of property during the marriage, whether such property is jointly or separately held.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>In Kunze and Kunze, </em>337 Or 122, 133, 92 P3d 100 (2004), the Oregon Supreme Court acknowledged that, under that statute, a court has authority to divide the \u201creal or personal property\u201d of the parties in a manner that is \u201cjust and proper in all the circumstances.\u201d The parties\u2019 \u201creal or personal property,\u201d the court explained, consists of two subclasses of such property, determined according to when the parties acquired it. First, there is the property that each of the parties acquired <em>before </em>the marriage. <em>Id. </em>Second, there are \u201cmarital assets,\u201d which consist of the property that the parties acquired <em>during </em>the marriage. <em>Id. </em>The presumption of equal contribution applies to that subclass of marital property. <em>Id. </em>The court in <em>Kunze </em>further explained that, after the court makes a preliminary determination of the appropriate division of the marital assets \u2014 either by applying the presumption or by determining that the presumption has been rebutted \u2014 ORS 107.105(l)(f) requires that the court determine what division of all of the marital property, both the marital assets and any property brought into the marriage, is \u201cjust and proper in all the circumstances.\u201d Id. at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Before applying the analysis described in <em>Kunze, </em>however, it first must be determined whether husband\u2019s beneficial interest in mother\u2019s revocable trust is even \u201creal or personal property\u201d that is subject to the authority of the court to divide in a dissolution. That issue was not addressed in <em>Kunze. </em>Nor has it been addressed in any other decision of the appellate courts of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">A \u201crevocable trust\u201d refers generally to trusts that are terminable or revocable at the will of the settlor, at any time and for any reason. <em>See generally </em>Myron Kove and George Taylor Bogert, <em>The Law of Trusts and Trustees </em>\u00a7 1061, 236 (3d ed 2008) (\u201cAlthough the living trust takes effect upon execution, since it is revocable, it may be changed or revoked by the settlor at any time.\u201d). Although they certainly have been around for many years, they became especially popular as \u201cwill substitutes\u201d beginning in the 1970s and 1980s, largely because they have the same practical effect as wills, but do not entail the costs and delays typically associated with probate administration. <em>See generally </em>John H. Langbein, <em>The Nonprobate Revolution and the Future of the Law of Succession, </em>97 Harv L Rev 1108 (1984); Note, <em>The Trust in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>Marital Law: Divisibility of a Beneficiary Spouse\u2019s Interest on Divorce, </em>64 Tex L Rev 1301, 1326 (1986); <em>see also Restatement (Third) of Trusts </em>\u00a7 25 comment a (2003) (\u201c[T]he revocable trust is widely used as a legally accepted substitute for the will as the central document of an estate plant.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Whether a beneficial interest in such a revocable trust is \u201creal or personal property\u201d within the meaning of ORS 107.105(l)(f) is a question of legislative intent, determined by familiar principles of statutory construction. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). We hasten to emphasize that the issue before us is a narrow one: whether such an interest is \u201creal or personal property\u201d <em>within the meaning of the statute, </em>not whether such an interest can be regarded as \u201cproperty\u201d in an abstract sense, or whether it is conceivable that someone could sell the interest on eBay, or whether it can be regarded as property within the meaning of some other, later-enacted statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The statutory authority of the courts set out in ORS 107.105 dates back to the enactment of the state\u2019s no-fault dissolution statute in 1971. Or Laws 1971, ch 280, \u00a7 13. The authority of the courts to divide \u201creal or personal property,\u201d however, has an even earlier provenance. The dissolution statute enacted as part of the first Oregon Revised Statutes in 1953 authorized the courts to \u201cmake such division or other disposition between the parties of the real or personal property * * * as may be just and proper in all the circumstances.\u201d ORS 107.100(4) (1953). That statute, in turn, was based on statutes that date back even earlier. <em>See, e.g., </em>Oregon Code Annotated \u00a7 6-912 (1930) (providing for disposition of \u201creal estate\u201d by divorce decree).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Massee and Massee, </em>328 Or 195, 970 P2d 1203 (1999), addressed the meaning of the term \u201cproperty\u201d as it is used in ORS 107.105(l)(f). At issue in that case was whether appreciation of property during a marriage is itself property within the meaning of that statute. <em>Id. </em>at 197. Answering the question in the affirmative, the court noted that \u201c[t]he word \u2018property\u2019 means something that is or may be owned or possessed, or the exclusive right to possess, use, enjoy, or dispose of a thing.\u201d Id. at 206. The court cited as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>authority for its definition a dictionary definition of the word. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1818 (unabridged ed 1993)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Unfortunately, neither the definition that the court offered in <em>Massee </em>nor the dictionary definition on which the court relied disposes of the matter before us. On one hand, it may be suggested that, in at least a sense, one who holds a beneficial interest in a revocable trust \u201cowns\u201d that interest. On the other hand, because of the absolute revocability of that interest, it cannot be said that one who holds such an interest has \u201cthe <em>exclusive </em>right to possess, use, enjoy, or dispose\u201d of it. (Emphasis added.) To the contrary, by definition of a \u201crevocable trust,\u201d one who holds a beneficial interest in it, to the extent that he or she holds anything, does so subject to the possibility that it may disappear at any time and for any reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Fortunately, although resort to dictionary definitions alone does not resolve the matter, the common-law backdrop against which the statute was enacted fairly clearly does. <em>Weber and Weber, </em>337 Or 55, 67, 91 P3d 706 (2004) (\u201c[T]his court presumes that the legislature enacts statutes in light of existing judicial decisions that have a direct bearing upon those statutes.\u201d); <em>Denton and Denton, </em>326 Or 236, 241, 951 P2d 693 (1998) (\u201c[W]e also consider, at this first level of analysis, the context of the statutory provision at issue, which includes * * * the preexisting common law and the statutory framework within which the law was enacted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The law at the time of enactment of the property division provision of ORS 107.105(l)(f) was well settled to the effect that expectancies (usually referred to as \u201cmere\u201d or \u201cbare\u201d expectancies) do not constitute \u201cproperty.\u201d Indeed, the principle dates back to Blackstone, Coke, and even earlier. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number><em>See generally </em>John A. Borron, Jr., 1 <em>The Law of Future Interests </em>\u00a7 393, 420 (3d ed 2002) (\u201c[TJhroughout the later history of English law, including the times of Coke and of Blackstone, a bare expectancy was regarded as nothing what[so]ever.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Illustrating the point is the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jerman v. Jerman, </em>129 Or 402, 275 P 915 (1929). In that case, the husband\u2019s grandfather executed a will that left certain real property to the husband\u2019s mother and, on her death, to her two sons. <em>Id. </em>at 406. When the husband and wife divorced, the wife claimed an interest in the real property that was the subject of the husband\u2019s grandfather\u2019s will. The trial court agreed and awarded the wife a one-third interest in the property. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court reversed. The court explained that, at the time of the divorce, it could not be determined whether the husband ever would inherit anything. <em>Id. </em>at 408. Under the terms of the will, the court noted, the husband would inherit the property only if he were to outlive both his grandmother and his mother, and, at the time of trial, the husband\u2019s mother was still living. <em>Id. </em>at 407-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In a similar vein is <em>Hanns v. Hanns, </em>246 Or 282, 423 P2d 499 (1967). In that case, a residuary legatee waited until his father died before asserting an interest in property that he contended passed through his father. <em>Id. </em>at 293. Other members of the family who contested that claim asserted a defense of laches, based on the fact that the residuary legatee long was aware of their claim to the property at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 293-94. The Supreme Court rejected the application of laches, explaining that the residuary legatee had \u201cno legally enforceable interest and clearly could not have obtained either legal or equitable protection of a mere expectancy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Although there is no pre-1971 Oregon case on point, it is fairly well settled that the interest created by a revocable trust is an \u201cexpectancy.\u201d By definition, it is an interest that is extinguishable at the whim of the settlor. Given the fact that an interest in a revocable trust amounts to a mere (or bare) expectancy, and given further that Oregon law at the time that ORS 107.105(1)(f) was enacted regarded expectancies as something other than \u201cproperty,\u201d it would seem necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>to follow that \u2014 in the absence of some indication to the contrary in the text, context, or history of the enactment \u2014 the legislature likely understood that the statute would not apply to beneficial interests in revocable trusts. We have found no such contrary indication in either the wording of the statute, contemporaneous statutory context, or legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Wife and the dissent, 227 Or App at 95-96 (Schuman, J., dissenting), insist that there is such a contrary indication in the case law. According to both wife and the dissent, several decisions of this court hold that a <em>contingent </em>interest in a trust is \u201cproperty\u201d within the meaning of ORS 107.105(1)(f), and there is, they argue, no meaningful distinction between a contingent interest in trust assets and a beneficial interest in a revocable trust. At least from the perspective of the beneficiary, they argue, in both cases the interest is held subject to a condition (the stated contingency, on the one hand, and the absolute discretion of the settlor to revoke, on the other) that is beyond the beneficiary\u2019s control. 227 Or App at 96 (Schuman, J., dissenting). Wife and the dissent, however, are mistaken in their reliance on those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">There are, of course, cases that hold that a contingent interest in a trust is property subject to division in a dissolution case. <em>Bentson and Bentson, </em>61 Or App 282, 284-85, 656 P2d 395, <em>rev den, </em>294 Or 613 (1983) (\u2018Whether vested or contingent, husband\u2019s interest in the trust is a marital asset to be considered in the division of marital property.\u201d); <em>von Ofenheim and von Ofenheim, </em>40 Or App 865, 870, 596 P2d 1007, <em>rev den, </em>287 Or 477 (1979) (same); <em>Walker and Walker, </em>27 Or App 693, 695, 557 P2d 36 (1976), <em>rev den </em>(1977) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The problem is that wife and the dissent fail to recognize a critical distinction between a contingent interest in a trust and a beneficial interest in a revocable trust. In the former case, the settlor has divested himself or herself of an actual interest in the property, subject only to a condition that is beyond the settlor\u2019s control. In the latter case, the set-tlor has divested himself or herself of absolutely nothing, leaving the beneficiary with only an expectancy, not a present property interest. From the beneficiary\u2019s perspective, that may seem like a distinction without a difference, as wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>and the dissent assert. But from the settlor\u2019s perspective, it is a distinction with a significant difference. And the Oregon Supreme Court has held that it is the settlor\u2019s perspective that counts. Indeed, in <em>Johnson v. Commercial Bank, </em>284 Or 675, 588 P2d 1096 (1978), the court distinguished a contingent interest in a trust from a beneficial interest in a revocable trust in precisely those terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the settlors, Elmer and Ruth White, transferred all of their assets into a revocable trust, with Elmer retaining the right to revoke at any time. <em>Id. </em>at 677-78. One of the Whites\u2019 creditors, a former employee, brought suit to reach the assets to satisfy her wage claim against them. <em>Id. </em>at 679. The trial court held that the assets could not be reached by the creditor because they had been transferred to the trust. <em>Id. </em>at 677. The Oregon Supreme Court reversed. The court noted that Elmer had retained the right to revoke the trust at any time. By retaining that right to revoke, the court held, Elmer had retained ownership of all of the trust assets, which as a result were subject to the claims of creditors. <em>Id. </em>at 681-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Especially noteworthy for our purposes is the fact that the Whites relied on a Connecticut case in which the set-tlors had conveyed property into a contingent trust. They argued \u2014 as do wife and the dissent in this case \u2014 that the contingent trust in the Connecticut case was no different from the revocable trust in theirs. The Supreme Court gave the argument short shrift:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">\u201cDefendants cite a case where the settlor gave himself a life estate with remainder to specified persons and did not retain the power to revoke. We agree that creditors could not reach the remainder interests under such facts because such conveyances give the remaindermen present vested interest in the property that cannot be defeated by any act of the settlor. Such remainder interests are present gifts that are no more subject to the claims of creditors than are any other gifts. <em>In the case at bar, Elmer did not divest himself of the remainder interests; they were subject to complete defeasance at any time during his life if he chose to exercise his right to revoke.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 682 (footnotes and citations omitted; emphasis added). As a result, the court concluded, \u201chis interest extended to <em>the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number><em>entire trust </em>and so plaintiff, a creditor, can reach the assets transferred by him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). <em>See also In re Schmitt, </em>215 BR 417, 422 (BAP 9th Cir 1997) (citing <em>Johnson </em>as holding that, \u201c[u]nder Oregon law, the beneficiary of a revocable trust does not have a property right\u201d and, \u201cbecause the beneficiaries\u2019 interests were subject to complete defeasance at any time during the settlor\u2019s lifetime if he chose to exercise the right to revoke, the settlor\u2019s interest extended to the entire trust\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The dissent insists that <em>Johnson </em>is of no moment, because it did not purport to construe ORS 107.105(1)(f). 227 Or App at 95 (Schuman, J., dissenting). We have not cited <em>Johnson </em>as a case that construed ORS 107.105(1)(f), however, as it plainly did not do so. We have cited <em>Johnson </em>because the dissent places such heavy reliance on an analogy to judicial treatment of contingent trusts, and <em>Johnson </em>explains why the dissent\u2019s reliance on the analogy is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The dissent also complains that we place undue reliance on the case law holding that an interest under a will is not property. 227 Or App at 97 (Schuman, J., dissenting). According to the dissent, an interest under a will is truly a mere expectancy because it does not take effect until the death of the testator, while trusts create present interests. Merely because a trust creates an interest, however, it does not necessarily follow that the interest is \u201cproperty\u201d within the meaning of ORS 107.105(1)(f). Precisely because of the <em>nature </em>of the beneficial interest that is created by a revocable trust, the will cases are directly on point. The rationale that the courts have employed for declaring the interest to be a mere expectancy and not property \u2014 the inability to determine whether the devisee will, in fact, ever inherit anything, <em>see, e.g., Jerman, </em>129 Or at 407-08 \u2014 is directly applicable to the beneficial interest in a revocable trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Indeed, it is well recognized that, while there may be a formal distinction between an interest under a will and a beneficial interest under a revocable trust, the practical differences are nonexistent. Langbein, <em>The Nonprobate Revolution and the Future of the Law of Succession, </em>97 Harv L Rev at 1113 (\u201cOnly nomenclature distinguishes the remainder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>interest created by [a revocable] trust from the mere expectancy arising under a will. Under either the trust or the will, the interest of the beneficiaries is both revocable and ambulatory.\u201d). Those practical similarities are precisely why revocable trusts are so commonly employed as will substitutes. As the <em>Restatement </em>explains,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\">\u201c[i]ssues of formality and procedure aside, however, the availability of nontestamentary methods of making disposition should not mean that substantive policies applicable to testamentary dispositions have no application. Thus, increasingly, statutes and case law in the various states are coming to recognize, as this Restatement provides, that the rights of the spouses and creditors of testators and of set-tlors of revocable trusts <em>are fundamentally alike, because both the testator and the settlor have retained their complete control over the property that is subject to the will or trust instrument. </em>Similarly, whatever the technicalities of concept and terminology, the interests the revocable-trust beneficiaries will receive on the death of the settlor should, generally at least, receive the same treatment and should be subject to the same rules of construction as the \u2018expectancies\u2019 of devisees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-5\"><em>Restatement (Third) of Trusts </em>\u00a7 25 comment a (2003) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">We note in passing that our conclusion that a beneficial interest in a revocable trust is not \u201cproperty\u201d subject to division in a dissolution case is consistent with the conclusions of every other court that has addressed the matter, save one. <em>See, e.g.,In re Marriage of Balanson, </em>107 P3d 1037 (Colo Ct App 2004), <em>rev den, </em>2005 WL 406503 (Colo 2005); <em>Rubin v. Rubin, </em>204 Conn 224, 527 A2d 1184 (1987); <em>In re Marriage of Centioli, </em>335 Ill App 3d 650, 781 NE2d 611 (App Ct 2002); <em>Lauricella v. Lauricella, </em>409 Mass 211, 565 NE2d 436 (1991); <em>In re Marriage of Beadle, </em>291 Mont 1, 968 P2d 698 (1998). And the one exception, <em>In re Marriage of Gorman, </em>36 P3d 211 (Colo Ct App 2001), was an acknowledged departure from prior law that was promptly overruled by the state legislature. <em>See generally Balanson, </em>107 P3d at 1042-43 (describing changes in Colorado law).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Even assuming, for the sake of the argument, that ORS 107.105(1)(f) is ambiguous on the question whether a beneficial interest in a revocable trust is \u201cproperty\u201d subject to division, the result is the same. We are aware of no legislative history that provides evidence one way or the other about the legislature\u2019s intentions. Under the circumstances, we would be obliged to resolve the ambiguity by resort to a relevant canon of construction. One such canon is the rule that, in the case of persistent ambiguity, we assume that the legislature did not intend for us to adopt a construction that would lead to an absurd or unreasonable result. <em>See, e.g., State v. Bordeaux, </em>220 Or App 165, 175, 185 P3d 524 (2008) (\u201c[W]e assume that the legislature did not intend an unreasonable result.\u201d). The rule seems applicable to the interpretation of the statute at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\">If a beneficial interest in a revocable trust is \u201cproperty\u201d within the meaning of the statute, then we can conceive of no reason why a devisee\u2019s interest under a will would not be treated likewise, contrary to current case law. Or a beneficiary\u2019s interest in a third party\u2019s life insurance policy; the value of an interest in a revocable opportunity to renew season tickets to sporting events; an individual\u2019s potential interest, under the laws of intestate succession, in the estate of even remotely related family members; or any of a number of other potential interests in the property of third parties who are otherwise not parties to a dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Aside from that, there is the matter of valuation. Basic economics suggests that the value of a beneficial interest in a revocable trust or any other expectancy is not the value of the asset itself, but instead the value of the asset multiplied by the <em>risk </em>that the settlor will revoke the beneficiary\u2019s interest in it. That would require the court to put on the witness stand the settlor or any other owner of property in which the parties to a dissolution case may have a potential interest in order to assess the likelihood that they will or will not change their minds as to their plans for the future disposition of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>In short, it is not difficult to imagine the multiple problems that would confront dissolution courts if they were required to assess the nature and value of the parties\u2019 potential interests in a wide variety of properties owned by third parties who are not parties to the dissolution itself. It is difficult to imagine that that is what the legislature intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">We conclude that the trial court was correct in determining that a beneficial interest in a revocable trust is not \u201creal or personal property\u201d within the meaning of ORS 107.105(l)(f). Because of that conclusion, it necessarily follows that the trial court also did not err in failing to receive evidence about the nature and value of husband\u2019s beneficial interest in mother\u2019s revocable trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Wife\u2019s remaining contention is that, if husband\u2019s interest in mother\u2019s revocable trust is not \u201creal or personal property\u201d within the meaning of ORS 107.105(1)(f), it is at least a \u201ccircumstance\u201d that may be taken into account in deciding the just and proper distribution of marital property, and, given the circumstances of this case, the trial court should have awarded her a more sizeable equalizing judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\"> In evaluating the trial court\u2019s determination about what is a just and proper distribution of marital property, we are instructed not to disturb that decision unless we conclude that the court abused its discretion and misapplied applicable statutory and equitable considerations. <em>Kunze, </em>337 Or at 136. We conclude that, even assuming for the sake of argument that husband\u2019s beneficial interest in mother\u2019s revocable trust is a circumstance that the court could fairly consider in evaluating a just and proper distribution of marital property, the court did not abuse its discretion on the facts of this case. Particularly given the revocable nature of mother\u2019s trust, an equalizing judgment of approximately $30,000 does not amount to an abuse of discretion. Indeed, it could be argued that, precisely because of the inherently speculative nature of husband\u2019s interest in the trust, the court should not have awarded that much. But husband has not cross-appealed, and that issue is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-7\"> The definition on which the court relied provides, in relevant part, that \u201cproperty\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">\u201ca: something that is or may be owned or possessed: WEALTH, GOODS; <em>specif </em>: a piece of real estate * * * b: the exclusive right to possess, enjoy, and dispose of a thing: a valuable right or interest primarily a source or element of wealth : OWNERSHIP * * * c : something to which a person has legal title: an estate in tangible assets (as lands, goods, money) or intangible rights (as copyrights, patents) in which or to which a person has a right protected by law * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-9\"><em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1818.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>SCHUMAN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVP\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">This case presents an important issue of first impression: In dividing property in a dissolution of marriage under ORS 107.105(1)(f) (set out below), how should the court treat one party\u2019s beneficial interest in a revocable trust? The trial court first decided that, because husband\u2019s interest in his mother\u2019s revocable trust was \u201cmore real than speculative,\u201d it could be treated as marital property. On reconsideration, the court decided that it could not be treated as marital property, but that the court could take it into consideration in determining a property division that was \u201cjust and proper in all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On appeal, wife argues that the court should have considered husband\u2019s interest to be marital property and allowed evidence of its value and of the likelihood that it would be revoked, while husband, in a cross-assignment of error, argues that the court should not have considered the terms of the trust or even its existence and, consequently, erred in taking it into consideration at all. The majority affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">As a result, wife emerges from this dissolution of the marriage (during which she enjoyed, according to the trial court, a \u201creasonably good standard of living\u201d) with a maximum income from employment of less than $13,000 per year, no housing, and nothing to show for her contributions of money and labor to the home in which she and husband lived for 23 years, while husband will have rent- or mortgage-free housing, a larger income, and, in all probability, a soon-to-be-realized half interest in two parcels of Willamette Valley farm property. I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">ORS 107.105(l)(f) governs the division of a couple\u2019s property when their marriage is dissolved. Under that statute, the court has authority to provide</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">\u201c[f]or the division or other disposition between the parties of the real or personal property, or both, of either or both of the parties as may be just and proper in all the circumstances. * * * There is a rebuttable presumption that both spouses have contributed equally to the acquisition of property during the marriage, whether such property is jointly or separately held.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>In <em>Kunze and Kunze, </em>337 Or 122, 133, 92 P3d 100 (2004), the Supreme Court held that that provision authorizes the court to dispose of \u201cany real or personal property that either or both of the parties hold at the time of dissolution, including property that the parties had brought into the marriage.\u201d That quantum of property, designated \u201cmarital property,\u201d contains a subcategory of property called \u201cmarital assets,\u201d or \u201cproperty that either or both of the parties have acquired during the marriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To reach an overall \u201cjust and proper\u201d distribution, the court preliminarily divides the marital property that is not marital assets according to what is \u201cjust and proper in all the circumstances,\u201d and then divides the marital assets under the same standard, albeit with the rebuttable presumption that a just and proper division of marital assets is an equal division. <em>Id. </em>at 133-34. After that preliminary distribution, however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-4\">\u201cORS 107.105(11)(f) next requires that the court consider what division of all the marital property \u2014 that is, both the marital assets and any other property that the parties had brought into the marriage \u2014 is \u2018just and proper in all the circumstances.\u2019 By contrast to the focus upon the parties\u2019 respective contributions under the statutory presumption, the court\u2019s final inquiry as to the \u2018just and proper\u2019 division concerns the equity of the property division in view of all the circumstances of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><em>Kunze, </em>337 Or at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">As related above, the trial court ultimately ruled that husband\u2019s interest was not \u201cproperty\u201d subject to division under ORS 107.105(l)(f). The court based its conclusion on \u201cthe case law regarding revocable trusts.\u201d That case law is from other states; neither party cites an Oregon case that directly addresses the issue, and we have found none.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>It is true that, with one exception, the cases from other states hold that a beneficiary\u2019s interest in a revocable trust cannot be divided on dissolution. <em>See, e.g., In re Marriage of Balanson, </em>107 P3d 1037 (Colo Ct App 2004), <em>rev den, </em>2005 WL 406503 (Colo 2005); <em>Rubin v. Rubin, </em>204 Conn 224, 527 A2d 1184 (1987); <em>In re Marriage of Centioli, </em>335 Ill App 3d 650, 781 NE2d 611 (App Ct 2002); <em>Lauricella v. Lauricella, </em>409 Mass 211, 565 NE2d 436 (1991); <em>In re Marriage of Beadle, </em>291 Mont 1, 968 P2d 698 (1998). The one exception, <em>In re Marriage of Gorman, </em>36 P3d 211 (Colo Ct App 2001), was subsequently overruled by statute. Typically, the courts adopt the rationale suggested by the <em>Restatement (Third) of Trusts </em>\u00a7 25 comment a (2003) that \u201cthe interests the revocable-trust beneficiaries will receive on the death of the settlor should, generally at least, receive the same treatment and should be subject to the same rules of construction as the \u2018expectancies\u2019 of devisees.\u201d Husband urges us to adopt that rationale as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">He relies on two arguments. First, like testators, settlors of revocable trusts retain complete control over the ultimate disposition of the property, thereby rendering the beneficiary\u2019s interest speculative and difficult to quantify. Second, treating a beneficial interest as property for purposes of ORS 107.105(1)(f) would complicate dissolution proceedings by subjecting any nonparty who might have created a revocable beneficial interest \u2014 be it in a trust, a retirement plan, a will, or an insurance policy \u2014 to \u201cprobing discovery of their financial affairs and health.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Those are strong arguments and I do not reject them lightly \u2014 but I do reject them. The cases from other states depend for the most part on each state\u2019s statutes and precedent. <em>E.g., Rubin, </em>204 Conn at 230-31, 527 A2d at 1187-88. Many cases resolve the issue by declaring that the interest is an expectancy (generally preceded by the adjective \u201cmere\u201d or \u201cbare\u201d), without explaining why that label is anything more than the conclusory announcement of an outcome \u2014 that is, without explaining why the fact that an interest is future, speculative, and difficult to evaluate should logically mean that it cannot be divided upon the dissolution of a marriage, when so many other things that are speculative and difficult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>to evaluate (pensions, for example) can be. <em>E.g., In re Marriage of Centioli, </em>335 Ill App 3d at 656, 781 NE2d at 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Our focus, of course, must be on Oregon law, in particular on ORS 107.105(l)(f) and the Oregon cases that construe it. \u201cProperty,\u201d as that term is used in ORS 107.105(1)(f), means \u201csomething that is or may be owned or possessed, or the exclusive right to possess, use, enjoy, or dispose of a thing.\u201d <em>Massee and Massee, </em>328 Or 195, 206, 970 P2d 1203 (1999) (citing <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1818 (unabridged ed 1993)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Husband \u201cown[s] or possessed]\u201d an equitable interest in the trust property; a trust conveys legal title to the trustee and equitable ownership to the beneficiary. <em>Windle, Adm\u2019x et al. v. Flinn et al., </em>196 Or 654, 675, 251 P2d 136 (1952); <em>Brown v. Brown, </em>206 Or App 239, 249, 136 P3d 745, <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 449 (2006). Husband cites no authority, nor have I found any, for the proposition that a revocable equitable ownership interest, because it is future, contingent, and difficult to value, is, by virtue of those traits, not an ownership interest at all. Indeed, it is black letter law that a \u201cbeneficiary\u2019s equitable interest under the trust may be for a definite period or during a named life, or an absolute interest; it may be contingent or vested, subject to a condition precedent or subsequent, determinable, possessory or non-possessory.\u201d George T. Bogert, <em>Trusts </em>\u00a7 38, 137 (6th ed 1987). Further, husband has the exclusive right to sell his interest, should there be a willing buyer. Nor does the fact that husband\u2019s interest is presently intangible mean that it is not \u201creal or personal property\u201d under ORS 107.105(1)(f); in <em>Massee, </em>for example, the Supreme Court held that appreciation of assets is \u201cproperty\u201d under that statute. 328 Or at 206. In a related context, the interest retained by the vendor of real property under a land sale contract \u2014 that is, the right to receive payment in the future \u2014 is itself real or personal property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number><em>Bedortha v. Sunridge Land Co., Inc., </em>312 Or 307, 312-13, 822 P2d 694 (1991).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><em>Johnson v. Commercial Bank, </em>284 Or 675, 588 P2d 1096 (1978), is not to the contrary. In that case, the court held that a creditor with a claim against the trustor of a revocable trust could reach the trust assets, because, under a then-existing statute,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the transfer of the trustor\u2019s assets to the trust \u201cwas <em>void </em>as against his existing or subsequent creditors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683 (emphasis in original). <em>Johnson </em>is not relevant to the issue in this case. It did not involve an interpretation of ORS 107.105(1)(f); whether a creditor can reach assets held by the settlor of a revocable trust tells us nothing about whether the beneficiary of that trust has a property interest for purposes of dividing property at dissolution. The fact that the settlor\u2019s interest in that case \u201cextended to the entire trust\u201d for purposes of creditors, <em>Johnson, </em>284 Or at 682, does not mean that that interest ousts other interests in the same property, any more than a life estate in property ousts the future interest of a remainderman.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Significantly, Oregon cases establish that an unvested but <em>contingent </em>interest in a trust is marital property and not, therefore, a \u201cmere\u201d expectancy \u2014 if, by expectancy, we mean something that is speculative, difficult to value, and therefore nonproperty. In <em>Walker and Walker, </em>27 Or App 693, 695, 557 P2d 36 (1976), <em>rev den </em>(1977), the husband was the beneficiary of a trust, the corpus of which he would receive only if he was living when his youngest sibling reached the age of 21; his wife was the beneficiary of several trusts, one of which would be distributed only at the discretion of the trustee. The court held that all of the trusts\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>including the ones that could be extinguished at the whim of the trustee \u2014 were \u201cvaluable, alienable property\u201d that \u201cshould properly be considered by the court when making an equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 assets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 696; <em>Bentson and Bentson, </em>61 Or App 282, 284-85, 656 P2d 395, <em>rev den, </em>294 Or 613 (1983) (\u201cWhether vested or contingent, husband\u2019s interest in the trust is a marital asset to be considered in the division of marital property.\u201d); <em>accord von Ofenheim and von Ofenheim, </em>40 Or App 865, 869-71, 596 P2d 1007, <em>rev den, </em>287 Or 477 (1979) (affirming division of the husband\u2019s contingent interest in trust at dissolution). The difference between a contingent trust and a revocable trust is that, in the latter, the beneficiary\u2019s interest depends at least partly on the will or whim of the settlor, whereas in the former, the interest depends at least partly on factors beyond the settlor\u2019s control \u2014 \u201cat least partly,\u201d because some revocable trusts, such as the one in the present case, depend on the settlor\u2019s nonrevocation <em>and </em>on the beneficiary\u2019s outliving the settlor, and some contingent trusts can be defeated by actions or decisions of the settlor short of revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">I do not understand why a trust under which the beneficiary\u2019s interest is speculative because the settlor might change her mind should differ, for purposes of determining the beneficiary\u2019s spouse\u2019s claim on that interest, from a trust under which the beneficiary\u2019s interest is speculative for some other reason, including that the trustee might change his or her mind, as was the case in <em>Walker, </em>27 Or App at 695. In other words, a revocable trust differs from a contingent trust in degree but not in kind; in both, the significant factor for purposes of a just and proper division of property at dissolution is the degree to which the beneficiary\u2019s interest is real as opposed to speculative. Put yet another way: A revocable trust is a type of contingent trust because nonrevocation is a type of contingency, and, for purposes of determining a just and proper division of property, the crucial factor is not where the contingency originates, but how much speculation it entails.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Further, I do not understand how the practical difficulties that, according to husband and the majority, necessarily flow from regarding a beneficial interest in a revocable trust as property differ significantly from the difficulties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>inherent in treating contingent trusts as property. In both cases, the speculative nature of the beneficiary\u2019s interest renders that interest difficult to evaluate. That difficulty can be addressed by, for example, fashioning a judgment such as the one in the trial court\u2019s original letter opinion, in which wife was awarded a non-interest-bearing judgment for one half of the value of husband\u2019s portion of the trust, valued as of the date of dissolution but payable only if and when distributed to husband. It could also be addressed by legislation. As for the problem of subjecting nonparties to intrusive questioning about their finances, health, or other matters, I note, first, that similar inquiries are required in distributing contingent trusts, and, second, that the trial court can exercise control over the proceedings so as to limit unnecessary or overly intrusive questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Nor am I persuaded by the argument that treating husband\u2019s interest as marital property necessarily implies that an heir apparent\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d in a will is also marital property. Although revocable trusts are now common will substitutes, the two things are not the same. Because a trust effects the transfer of legal title to the trustee and equitable title to the beneficiary, \u201c[t]he difference between a will and a trust is that a will operates only from the moment of death, while a trust operates <em>in praesenti, </em>to a certain extent.\u201d <em>Allen v. Hendrick, </em>104 Or 202, 225, 206 P 733 (1922). Thus, a will creates a \u201cbare expectancy\u201d because it conveys nothing until the death of the testator. Trusts \u2014 even trusts that may not ever vest \u2014 convey an equitable interest that can be considered marital property. <em>Bentson, </em>61 Or App at 284-85; <em>von Ofenheim, </em>40 Or App at 870; <em>Walker, </em>27 Or App at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">In sum, I conclude that, in some circumstances, a beneficiary\u2019s interest in a revocable trust may be considered marital property under ORS 107.105(l)(f). For that reason, I also conclude that the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">On <em>de novo </em>review, this court has the discretion to modify a trial court\u2019s division of property in a dissolution judgment. <em>Gardner and Gardner, </em>212 Or App 148, 157, 157 P3d 320 (2007). We exercise that discretion, however, with \u201ca healthy respect for the wisdom of our modern chancellors in the trial courts who see the people, decide the cases and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>develop a feel for the best solution in what are often difficult circumstances.\u201d <em>Haguewood and </em>Haguewood, 292 Or 197, 202, 638 P2d 1135 (1981). In the present case, the trial court\u2019s judgment was based on its conclusion that husband\u2019s beneficial interest in mother\u2019s trust was \u201cnot subject to division as a marital asset\u201d \u2014 a conclusion that the court reached reluctantly and, as I believe, erroneously. In its first letter opinion, however, the trial court divided the parties\u2019 property under the understanding, which I believe was correct, that husband\u2019s interest in the trust was divisible property. I would therefore exercise our discretion to modify the judgment, but by adopting, with slight modification, the judgment that the trial court would have entered had it denied the parties\u2019 motions for reconsideration after the first letter opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">In that letter, the trial court found as fact that husband\u2019s interest in the trust was \u201cmore real than speculative.\u201d Based on mother\u2019s age and her evident affection for wife, I agree. Further, I would conclude that the court\u2019s proposed remedy \u2014 awarding wife one half of husband\u2019s interest in the trust, evaluated by a neutral appraiser as of the date of dissolution, payable when and if the trust corpus was distributed \u2014 obviated the need to gauge the chances of revocation or to take further evidence of value. The court also determined that the future contingent division was just and proper \u201chowever [husband\u2019s interest] may be defined.\u201d I understand that statement to reflect the court\u2019s decision that, if the interest was a marital asset, husband did not overcome the presumption of equal contribution, and, if his interest was marital property, a just and proper division was an equal split, so that, in either case, an equal split was just and proper. <em>See Kunze, </em>337 Or at 133-34. Again, I agree. And I also agree with the court\u2019s division of personal property and its original equalizing judgment, that is, the equalizing judgment that did not take into consideration the inequity that would result from considering husband\u2019s interest in the trust to be nondivisible. In short, I conclude that, had the court reduced its original letter opinion to a judgment, it would not have \u201cmisapplied the statutory and equitable considerations that ORS 107.105(1)(f) requires.\u201d Abreze, 337 Or at 136.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\"> In <em>Coote and Coote, </em>112 Or App 342, 345-47, 831 P2d 32 (1992), this court held that the corpus of a revocable trust created by the husband was a marital asset subject to division under ORS 107.105(1)(f), but it is unclear whether the husband was the trustee, the beneficiary, or both. In any event, the only issue at trial and on appeal regarding the trust was whether the husband had overcome the presumption of equal contribution with respect to the trust corpus. The question presented in this case was not litigated. The trial court in <em>Roger and Roger, </em>175 Or App 540, 542, 28 P3d 1264 (2001), divided the husband\u2019s interest in a revocable trust. On appeal, we did not decide whether the husband\u2019s interest was marital property, because we concluded that there was no evidence that the trust existed. <em>Id. </em>at 546.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b118-5\"> Under Oregon\u2019s trust law, \u201c \u2018[property\u2019 means anything that may be the subject of ownership, whether real or personal, legal or equitable, or any interest therein.\u201d ORS 130.010(13). That definition applies to all trusts \u201ccreated before, on or after January 1, 2006,\u201d but it does not apply \u201cto judicial, administrative and other proceedings concerning trusts commenced before January 1, 2006.\u201d ORS 130.910. The trust in this case was created before January 1,2006, but the judicial proceeding also commenced before that date. It is therefore unclear whether the definition applies here.
