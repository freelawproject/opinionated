J.</author>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">This case is before us on remand from the Supreme Court, which vacated our prior decision, <em>State v. Garza, </em>201 Or App 527, 119 P3d 300 <em>(Garza I), </em>in light of <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008), and <em>State v. Fults, </em>343 Or 515, 173 P3d 822 (2007). <em>State v. Garza, </em>345 Or 315, 195 P3d 63 (2008). In <em>Garza I, </em>we vacated defendant\u2019s sentences and remanded for resentencing because the trial court had imposed departure sentences based on judicial findings. That factfinding constituted plain error, and we exercised our discretion to correct it. The issue before us on remand is whether, in light of <em>Ramirez </em>and <em>Fults, </em>we properly exercised our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We conclude that our exercise of discretion in <em>Garza I </em>was proper. Accordingly, we again remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Defendant was convicted of second-degree assault, coercion, and fourth-degree assault arising out of his prolonged attack on his female domestic partner. The trial court imposed a durational departure sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on the second-degree assault conviction and a consecutive durational departure sentence of 36 months\u2019 imprisonment on the coercion conviction. The court gave the following reasons for its decision to impose the departure sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">\u201cThis is the worst case of domestic violence I have ever seen. * * * This was not just a bruise. This was bruises all over her body, multiple times. * * * You showed no remorse during the trial. You blamed everything on her. You continue to blame her in the PSI. You lied during trial. All of those things show me that you have no ability right now to be rehabilitated. You are an extreme danger in this community to her and any other woman that you become involved with. My goal here is to lock you up for as long as I can[.] * * * So the aggravating factors are, as I\u2019ve said, this is the worst case I\u2019ve seen, you\u2019ve shown no remorse during the trial or in the PSI, you lied during the trial, you were on probation when this occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">In this case, the trial court did not explicitly state that it was relying on the departure factors it found either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>singly or in combination, and therefore we assume that the court did not consider each factor to be independently sufficient to support a departure. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>111 Or App 147, 826 P2d 1010 (1992). Thus, remand for resentencing may be warranted if one of the factors relied on by the trial court is subject to legitimate debate. <em>See Ramirez, </em>343 Or at 513 (setting out \u201clegitimate debate\u201d standard for exercise of discretion to review unpreserved challenges to departure sentences based on judicial findings of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Because it is dispositive, we need examine only the departure factor of defendant\u2019s lack of remorse. On this record, we cannot conclude that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have found that defendant had failed to show remorse. During his allocution at sentencing, defendant claimed that \u201cI can only blame myself for what has happened and the dose of medicine I\u2019m about to receive\u201d and that \u201c[d]omestic violence is no joke. It has made me feel emotions I\u2019ve never felt before and it sucks to be me right now.\u201d Although the jury could have construed defendant\u2019s comments to show a lack of remorse, the jury also could have reasonably concluded that defendant was showing remorse for his actions. The \u201cremorse\u201d shown by a defendant is an inherently subjective departure factor grounded in an assessment, by the trier of fact, of the defendant\u2019s credibility. Where, as here, a jury reasonably could conclude that a defendant had shown remorse, we cannot conclude that there is no legitimate debate that the jury would have found the departure factor relied on by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">We exercise our discretion to correct the trial court\u2019s error for two reasons: First, as discussed above, there is a legitimate debate with regard to one of the departure factors relied on by the trial court. Second, the gravity of the error in this case is not trivial. <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6. Imposition of the departure sentences on defendant\u2019s second-degree assault and coercion convictions increased defendant\u2019s term of incarceration by 66 months. Accordingly, we remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
