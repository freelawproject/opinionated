The 1949 decree is <em>res judicata </em>with regard to the religious education of the boy because no facts were proved tending to show that the effects of such education have been harmful to him or that there has been any material change in circumstances since 1949. On the facts proved, either respondent\u2019s motion should have been denied or custody transferred to the father. <em>(People ex rel. Portnoy </em>v. <em>Strasser, </em>303 N. Y. 539; <em>People ex rel. Sisson </em>v. <em>Sisson, </em>271 N. Y. 285; <em>Duryea </em>v. <em>Bliven, </em>122 N.

The twelve-year-old boy of immature judgment should not have been permitted, on the facts proved in this case, to decide for himself the nature of his religious education. <em>(International Text Book Co. </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>206 N.

Independently of the 1949 judgment and because of the written antenuptial agreement, the father possessed the right and obligation to control the religious educa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>tian of Ms cMM and tMis the right and obligation to protect the religions heritage of the cMld. <em>(Weinberger </em>v. <em>Van Hessen, </em>260 N.

An antenuptial agreement cannot control as against the cMld\u2019s welfare. <em>(Denton </em>v. <em>James, </em>107 Kan. 729; <em>Boerger </em>v. <em>Boerger, </em>26 N. J.

Religious education outside of the faith of the custodian is disfavored. <em>(Weinberger </em>v. <em>Van </em>Hessen, 260 N. Y. 294.) VII. A court is justified in consulting and giving weight to the preferences of a child of Malcolm\u2019s age and qualities. <em>(Matter of Vardinakis, </em>160 Misc. 13.) VIII. Any attempt to change a cMld\u2019s actual religious faith is to be avoided on principle. <em>(Matter of Newton, </em>[1896] Ch. 740.) IX. The constitutional provisions protecting religious liberty forbid restoration of the original order at tMs date.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b176-8\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AnG\">After a fairly extensive hearing, at which the boy, then twelve, now fourteen, years old, testified, the Referee, appointed to hear and determine the matter, decided that the \u201c boy\u2019s welfare \u201d called for modification of the decree in the respects requested, and the Appellate Division affirmed. There being ample evidence to support both the finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>youngster was old enough to testify intelligently and the conclusion that the modification was for his best interests and welfare, the order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b177-5\">Desmond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnqH\">(dissenting). I dissent for these reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">1. There is no finding and no testimony that enforcement of the religious training provision of the 1949 judgment (and of the 1938 agreement which it confirmed) would damage, or has damaged, the boy, mentally, physically or in any other way. All statements as to his becoming \u201c unhappy \u201d or \u201c mentally disturbed\u201d or \u201cill-adjusted\u201d are taken from the mother\u2019s ex parte affidavit which is a mere pleading, not proof. Neither the mother, nor the boy nor anyone else gave any testimony as to any such mental hurt or disturbance. The Referee\u2019s decision makes no such finding. The Referee amended the decree solely because, so he found, this twelve-year-old boy \u201c has a mind of his own \u201d, because failure to amend the decree \u201c would strip him of Ms independent judgment in matters of this Mnd \u201d, and because (so held the Referee) \u201cneither the mother\u2019s wishes nor the father\u2019s wishes should control what is here to be done \u201d. True, at the end of the decision, the Referee said he was doing what \u201c is best for the boy \u201d but it is impossible to read the decision as based on anytMng except the boy\u2019s own wishes and Ms supposedly mature and considered choice of a religion for himself. That was not within the Referee\u2019s competency, in the face of a Supreme Court judgment as to the place and nature of Ms religious training, based on a- solemn prenuptial agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">2. The idea that a child of twelve is competent to make a choice binding on the Supreme Court and on Ms parents in such a matter is not only contrary to our decisions (see <em>Bunim </em>v. Bunim, 298 N. Y. 391), and contrary to all human experience, but is directly opposed to the <em>parens patriae </em>public policy of New York (see Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, \u00a7\u00a7 100, 126; Pari-mutuel Revenue Law [L. 1940, ch. 254], \u00a7 8; Domestic Relations Law, \u00a7\u00a7 15-a, 72; Labor Law, \u00a7 130; Education Law, art. 65, part I; General City Law, \u00a7 18-b; Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 484, 486; Personal Property Law, \u00a7 163; Debtor and Creditor Law, \u00a7 260; Judiciary Law, \u00a7 474; Correction Law, \u00a7 485; Vehicle and Traffic Law, \u00a7 20; N. Y. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 18; Mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Hygiene Law, \u00a7 132; Correction Law, \u00a7 610; Social Welfare Law, \u00a7 373; Code Grim. Pro., \u00a7\u00a7 483, 913-m; N. Y. City Dom. Rel. Ct. Act, \u00a7 88, subd. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">3. This sort of prenuptial agreement is enforcible like any other, unless and until its enforcement is shown to be harmful to the child. \u201c Agreements between parents for a particular sort of religious upbringing have in general been held valid in this country \u201d <em>(Weinberger </em>v. <em>Van Hessen, </em>260 N. Y. 294, 298). Particularly must this be so when the agreement has been confirmed by, and written into, a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">4. Although the child\u2019s welfare is a paramount consideration in every custody case, we cannot close our eyes to fundamental principles as to judgments and agreements, and we cannot forget ancient maxims denying equitable relief to suitors whose hands are unclean. Respondent failed to prove that an amendment to the decree was suggested by anything except the boy\u2019s own desires. She did prove affirmatively that she herself had created this troublesome position by violating not only her solemn agreement, but the plain condition under which custody was decreed to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Lewis, Ch. J., Dye, Fuld, Froessel and Van Voorhis, JJ., concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion; Desmond, J., dissents in an opinion in which Conway, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
