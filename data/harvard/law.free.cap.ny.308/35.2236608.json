The Legislature seeks to regulate rather than prohibit the operation of motor vehicles by junior operators. II. The right of a junior operator to drive \u201c to and from school \u201d, as used in section 20 (subd. 1, par. b.) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, includes the right to operate to and from any function sponsored by, supervised and held on the school premises. <em>(Village of East Hampton </em>v. <em>Mulford, </em>188 Misc. 1037; <em>Mount Herman Boys School </em>v. <em>Town of Gill, 145 </em>Mass. 139; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gillette, </em>172 Misc. 847.) III. The definition of \u201c school \u201d, as printed on junior operators\u2019 licenses issued subsequent to that issued to defendant-appellant, is not binding in this ease. IV. Acts otherwise innocent and lawful do not become crimes unless there is a clear and positive intent to make them criminal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Phyfe, </em>136 N.

The legislative concern with safety on the highways is the controlling standard for interpretation of the statute. II. Any construction of section 20 (subd. 1, par. b) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law which would have the effect of extending a junior operator\u2019s right to drive is contrary to legislative intent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gillette, </em>172 Misc. 847; <em>Matter of Weisse </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of City of N.

The charge was that, on December 11, 1953, defendant, wMle under eighteen years of age and being the holder of a \u201c junior operator\u2019s \u201d license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>only, and not being accompanied by a senior (over eighteen) licensed operator, operated an automobile at 10:30 o\u2019clock at night.</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">At the trial the facts were stipulated thus: <em>\u201c </em>The defendant, who is sixteen years of age and the holder of a junior operator\u2019s license, operated his motor vehicle during the hours of darkness, to wit: 10:30 p.m., unaccompanied by a duly licensed operator over the age of eighteen years. The defendant is a high school student and was operating his motor vehicle from Woodmere High School to his home. He had attended an interscholastic basketball game in which his school had participated. * * * high schools solicit their students to purchase tickets to attend their high school basketball games.\u201d The statute (Vehicle and Traffic Law, \u00a7 20, subd. 1, par. b) reads thus: \u201c No operator\u2019s or chauffeur\u2019s license shall be issued to any person under eighteen years of age, except that junior operators\u2019 licenses may be issued to minors who have arrived at the age of sixteen years, but who have not reached eighteen years of age, under rules and regulations to be established by the commissioner, provided, however, that such license shall not entitle a licensee to operate a motor vehicle, other than <em>going to and from school, </em>during the hours of darkness unless accompanied by a duly licensed operator who is over eighteen years of age \u201d. (Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The question in the case is as to whether the courts below were correct when they construed the Legislature\u2019s phrase \u201c going to and from school \u201d as licensing the use of an automobile, by such a driver, on trips to and from the formal sessions of the educational institution only, and not including extracurricular activities. We agree with the courts below.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The word <em>\u201c </em>school \u201d has a number of different shades of meaning (Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary [5th ed.], p. 889). But when <em>\u201c </em>school \u201d is used without the preceding article in a phrase like <em>\u201c </em>going to school \u201d it means, according to the lexicographers, as well as the usage of the \u201c man in the street \u201d, a school session (Oxford Dictionary, Vol. 8, part 2, p. 213). We see no reason for giving it a different connotation here. The general scheme of paragraph b of subdivision 1 is to permit youngsters between sixteen and eighteen years of age, unaccompanied by elder licensees, to drive cars during daylight hours <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>only. The exception as to going to and from school was added to allow a junior operator to drive an automobile during the hours of darkness, if his journey was to or from school sessions. In the wintertime, for instance, darkness comes in late afternoon and the statutory purpose was to make it possible, during those hours, for children under eighteen to drive, without their elders, between their homes and their classes or other routine educational exercises. It would be quite an extension of that idea to hold that such a junior operator could, unaccompanied, drive, at any hour of the night, so long as he was returning from a school function. It appears that on every junior operator\u2019s license now issued, there is printed notice of a regulation made by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, specifically stating that driving at night by unchaperoned junior operators is not permitted, except when actually going to or from a regular school session. For affirmance here we are not relying on that legend, which did not appear on this defendant\u2019s license. But, in December, 1953, as now, the statute required that \u201c The extent to which a holder of a junior operator\u2019s license may operate a motor vehicle thereunder shall be printed on each such license \u2019 \u2019. The license here did comply with that mandate since it quoted the statute\u2019s own words as to restricted use.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Much of appellant\u2019s brief is an argument that recreational and social activities sponsored by a school and conducted on school premises are as much a part of the educational process as formal class instruction, etc. That may well be, and our decision does not challenge it. But policy questions are for the Legislature. Our task is merely to discover legislative intent. In doing so here, we keep in mind that this is a public safety law, part of the tireless effort to reduce the number (more than 300 per day) of accidents causing personal injuries on our highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Ho one enjoys affirming a misdemeanor conviction for violation of a malum prohibitum statute, but we would have to go far beyond our powers to reverse this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b76-8\">Conway, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ\">(dissenting). The defendant, who was sixteen years of age, has been convicted of the <em>misdemeanor </em>(see Vehicle and Traffic Law, \u00a7 70, subd. 1) of violating section 20 (subd. 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>par. b) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. The arresting officer\u2019s record shows that the night was clear, the defendant courteous, that there had been no accident and that no other crime or offense was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The statute involved is a penal statute since it imposes punishment for a wrong against the State (see McKinney\u2019s Cons. Laws of N. Y., Book 1, Statutes [1942 ed.], \u00a7 273, and cases cited therein), and it has long been the rule in this State that penal statutes are to be strictly construed against the prosecutor and in favor of the accused <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 271, and cases cited therein). Section 21 of the Penal Law, expressly providing to the contrary, does not apply here since, by its terms, section 21 relates only to the provisions of the Penal Law as such. (Indeed, notwithstanding such direction in \u00a7 21 we have held that the Penal Law itself is to be strictly construed [see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>153 N. Y. 90].) Purely statutory wrongs cannot be established by implication, and \u201c acts otherwise innocent and lawful, do not become crimes, unless there is a clear and positive expression of the legislative intent to make them criminal. The citizen is entitled to an unequivocal warning before conduct on his part, which is not <em>malum in se, </em>can be made the occasion of a deprivation of his liberty or property.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Phyfe, </em>136 N. Y. 554, 559; <em>People </em>v. <em>Shifrin, </em>301 N. Y. 445, 447; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wallace &amp; Co., </em>282 N. Y. 417; <em>People </em>v. <em>Adamkiewicz, </em>298 N. Y. 176; <em>Winters </em>v. <em>New York, </em>333 U. S. 507, 515-516.) Accordingly, unless the defendant\u2019s act is a violation of the strict letter of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, he may not be declared a <em>misdemeanant </em>and be stigmatized as a criminal with all of the lifetime consequences thereof. The fact of the conviction cannot be erased even by a Governor\u2019s pardon, for a pardon does not obliterate the record or blot out the fact that defendant has been convicted (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Carlesi, </em>154 App. Div. 481, affd. 208 N. Y. 547, affd. 233 U. S. 51).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The majority of this court has concluded that the words <em>\u201c </em>going to and from school \u201d are unambiguous and that they must receive a narrow construction, that is, a definition which excludes extracurricular, afterhour social and athletic events, even though the activity be one in which the student\u2019s school is participating and one at which his presence has been solicited by the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The majority agrees that the word \u201c school \u201d has a number of different shades of meaning but concludes that when \u201c school \u201d is used in a phrase like <em>\u201c </em>going to and from school \u201d it means but one thing, a regular school session. With that conclusion we cannot agree. As used in the context of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, the word \u2018 \u2018 school \u201d is a noun. As a noun \u2018\u2018 school \u2019 \u2019 has numerous meanings (see, e.g., 38 Words and Phrases [Perm, ed.], School; Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary [2d ed.]) and is by no means restricted to a regular school session. Had the Legislature intended to prohibit a junior operator from driving during hours of darkness except when going to and from \u201c regular school sessions \u201d it could have said so without difficulty. Instead, it selected the term \u201c school \u201d without any qualifications, a term which various courts have characterized as a generic term \u2014 a word of broad signification (see 38 Words and Phrases [Perm, ed.], School). It is not proper for this court to give that word a narrow definition so as to bring defendant within the proscription of the statute and have Mm declared a misdemeanant when his acts were otherwise innocent and lawful and the Legislature has not clearly and positively declared them to be criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Extracurricular and athletic activities are sponsored by schools because the authorities deem them to be an essential and integral part of a young man\u2019s schooling. The authorities are aware that education is a broad term embracing mental, moral and physical powers and faculties alike, and that suitable and guided recreation for the youth of their community is necessary if juvenile crime is to be stemmed. The word \u201c school \u201d in a broad, or even in the ordinary sense, embraces such activities. As we have said, where the violation of a statute carries with it the stigma of conviction of a crime, the statute must be strictly construed against the State, or, conversely stated, must be liberally construed in favor of the defendant. To say that the term \u201c school \u201d means only \u201c a regular session of school \u201d is to construe this statute strictly against the defendant for such a conclusion can be reached only by ignoring the numerous broader meanings which the word \u201c school \u201d admittedly has.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u201c The extent to which a holder of a junior operator\u2019s license may operate a motor veMele * * * shall be printed on each \u2022 \u2022 * [junior operator\u2019s] license * * (Vehicle and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Traffic Law, \u00a7 20, subd. 1, par. b.) Prior to defendant\u2019s conviction, junior operators\u2019 licenses carried the bare warning that the licensee was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle during the hours of darkness except to go to and from school. After defendant\u2019s conviction the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles saw fit to have the warning on these licenses specifically state that extracurricular activities were not included in the term \u201c school \u201d. We think this indicates a recognition on the part of the Commissioner that, as we have concluded, it would not be unreasonable for a student between the ages of sixteen and eighteen to read the noun \u2018 \u2018 school \u2019 \u2019 to mean what defendant here contends it means, viz., that it includes attending and returning from a basketball game at school. If that be so this conviction may not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">We do not believe that, in the circumstances of this case, the construction of the statute by the Trial Justice is such a one as, according to the fair import of the terms of the statute, promotes the ends of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The judgment of conviction should be reversed and the information dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Lewis, Ch. J., Dye, Fuld and Van Voorhis, JJ., concur with Desmond, J.; Conway, J., dissents in an opinion in which Froessel, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
