Plaintiff\u2019s \u201c fortnight\u2019s visit \u201d to her parents did not constitute an abandonment. In any event, defendant\u2019s unjustified rejection of his wife\u2019s early and unequivocal offers to return entitles her to a judgment of separation. Absent an abandonment, defendant had an absolute duty to accept plaintiff\u2019s offers to return. <em>(Silberstein </em>v. <em>Silberstein, </em>218 N. Y. 525; <em>Mirizio </em>v. <em>Mirizio, </em>248 N. Y. 175; <em>Bohmert </em>v. <em>Bohmert, </em>241 N. Y. 446; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>130 N. Y. 193.) II. Defendant\u2019s unjustified rejection of plaintiff\u2019s unequivocal offers would entitle her to a separation even if she had abandoned him. <em>(Bohmert </em>v. <em>Bohmert, </em>241 N. Y. 446; <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>290 N. Y. 337; <em>Mirizio </em>v. <em>Mirizio, </em>248 N. Y. 175; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>306 N. Y. 581.) III. Having then found that defendant, without justification, rejected the wife\u2019s offers, the Appellate Division should not only have reversed the judgment in favor of the husband and dismissed his counterclaims, it should also have granted a separation in favor of the wife.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b569-6\"><em>Harold H.

An annulment should have been granted to defendant. <em>(Coppo </em>v. <em>Coppo, </em>163 Misc. 249; <em>Doroff </em>v. <em>Doroff, </em>283 App. Div. 688; <em>Shelby </em>v. <em>Shelby, </em>278 App. Div. 604; <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Friedman, </em>187 Misc. 689; <em>Lapides </em>v. <em>Lapides, </em>224 App. Div. 257.) II. The dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s complaint and the granting of the separation to defendant were right, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>though annulment was denied on technical grounds. <em>(Solomon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>290 N. Y. <em>337; Bohmert </em>v. <em>Bohmert, </em>241 N. Y. 446; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Fulmer, </em>301 N. Y. 277.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b570-5\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnUc\">In this action brought by plaintiff wife for a separation, defendant husband interposed a counterclaim for separation or, in the alternative, for an annulment on the ground that plaintiff, when she married him, never intended to have any children. The court at Special Term granted the husband\u2019s counterclaim for separation, and dismissed both the wife\u2019s complaint for separation and the husband\u2019s counterclaim for an annulment. The Appellate Division affirmed the dismissal of the latter two claims, but \u2014 reversing certain findings of fact and making new ones in their place \u2014 modified the judgment by dismissing the husband\u2019s counterclaim for separation as well. The parties were thereby left in the same position as they were before the litigation, and each has appealed from so much of the Appellate Division judgment as denied the relief originally sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The weight of the credible evidence supports the findings of the Appellate Division that the act of plaintiff in leaving home for a visit to her mother did not amount to an abandonment of her husband, that soon after her departure she unequivocally offered to return to him and that he rejected those proffers. Accordingly, not only was the Appellate Division justified in reversing the judgment of separation obtained by defendant, but, in our view, it was actually required to go further and grant plaintiff a judgment of separation. \u2018\u2018 If the wife\u2019s absence is a temporary one which has not ripened into an abandonment at the time she offers to return, it is the husband\u2019s duty to take her back \u201d <em>(Bohmert </em>v. <em>Bohmert, </em>241 N. Y. 446, 451), and an unjustified rejection by defendant husband of plaintiff wife\u2019s unconditional offer spells out an abandonment on his part entitling her to a judgment of separation. (See, e.g., <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>306 N. Y. 581; <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>290 N. Y. 337, 340-341; <em>Mirizio </em>v. <em>Mirizio, </em>248 N. Y. 175, 179-180; <em>Silberstein </em>v. <em>Silberstein, </em>218 N. Y. 525, 529.)</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Turning to defendant\u2019s counterclaim for annulment, the Appellate Division was warranted in affirming Special Term\u2019s dismissal upon the ground that the evidence adduced was insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>cient to establish that plaintiff possessed a premarital intention not to bear children; and, in any event, even if plaintiff had been guilty of such fraud, it would have been condoned by the subsequent cohabitation of the parties after defendant learned the facts constituting the alleged fraud (Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 1139).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Division should be modified and the case remitted to Special Term for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Conway, Ch. J., Desmond, Froessel and Burke, JJ., concur with Fuld, J.; Dye and Van Voorhis, JJ., dissent and vote to affirm the judgment of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
