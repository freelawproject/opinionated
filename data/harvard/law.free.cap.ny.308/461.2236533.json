Plaintiff recovered a judgment in the sum of upwards of $19,500 after a jury trial, and the Appellate Division unanimously affirmed without opinion. It will serve no useful purpose to review the voluminous evidence adduced upon the trial; suffice it to say that, viewing the evidence \u25a0\u2014 absent error in its receipt \u2014 in the light most favorable to plaintiff, as we must, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>the jury was entitled to resolve the factual issues. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s contention that plaintiff has failed as a matter of law to make out a prima facie case must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Defendant also claims that plaintiff\u2019s conduct estops it from claiming a commission on this sale. Upon this record, we find the evidence in that connection insufficient to warrant its submission to the jury. More particularly, one of the essential elements of estoppel \u2014 knowledge on the part of plaintiff imposing on him a duty to speak \u2014 is entirely lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">We come, then, to defendant\u2019s final contention concerning the admissibility over its counsel\u2019s repeated and strenuous objections of considerable evidence showing plaintiff\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to sell defendant\u2019s printing plant to one Samuel Chernoble, an individual other than the ultimate purchaser whom plaintiff claimed to have procured. It is fundamental that, for such unsuccessful efforts, a broker must go uncompensated <em>(Sibbald </em>v. <em>Bethlehem Iron Co., </em>83 N. Y. 378, 383), and evidence thereof is not only immaterial but may strongly tend to prejudice the jury, particularly where, as here, the claim was vigorously contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s receipt of this evidence on the merits of the case, \u201c as part of the services rendered \u201d by plaintiff, was serious error, which in our opinion was not cured, after a change of mind, by its belated attempt in its charge to restrict its use solely to that of corroborating a small portion of plaintiff\u2019s testimony <em>(Arthur </em>v. <em>Griswold, </em>55 N. Y. 400, 408; <em>Erben </em>v. <em>Lorillard, </em>19 N. Y. 299; <em>Russell </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., </em>96 App. Div. 151, 153; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Paddleford, </em>183 App. Div. 354; see <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>266 App. Div. 685; <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Butts, </em>198 App. Div. 108). Even for such purpose, it was also erroneous since it was clearly hearsay. Chernoble\u2019s testimony could not be received for the purpose of corroborating plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to the price at which plaintiff claimed defendant\u2019s officer Brown authorized him to offer the printing plant for sale. Such testimony was not admissible as proof of what Brown said; at best, what plaintiff told Chernoble that Brown had said Avas hearsay from Chernoble\u2019s lips. This is not corroboration of plaintiff\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Nor does the record support plaintiff\u2019s argument, suggested for the first time on appeal, that the evidence could properly have been received as hearing upon the credibility of defendant\u2019s witnesses, since, among other reasons, defendant\u2019s witnesses had not yet even been called to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Division and that of the Trial Term should be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Conway, Ch. J., Desmond, Dye, Fuld, Van Voorhis and Burke, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Judgments reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
