Defendant-appellant, Nationwide Insurance Company, appeals the decision of the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas that granted summary judgment to plaintiffappellee, Owners Insurance Company. In that decision, the trial court concluded that both Nationwide and Owners owed a duty to defend their respective insureds against a tort victim\u2019s complaint; that Owners\u2019s duty was secondary to Nationwide\u2019s duty; and that Nationwide should reimburse Owners for the defense that Owners had provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>The trial court erred when entering this judgment. There are genuine issues of material fact regarding whether Nationwide had a duty to defend its insured. Nationwide\u2019s policy with its insured is not in the record, and a stipulation that it had a policy with its insured is insufficient to show that Nationwide\u2019s duty to defend its insured was properly invoked. Furthermore, it appears that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment to Owners on the issue of whether it acted as a volunteer when it defended the driver of a car from the injured party\u2019s complaint. Accordingly, the trial court could not have granted judgment to Owners at this point in the litigation. The trial court\u2019s judgment is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">{\u00b6 3} On November 18, 1998, Valinda Purr was injured in an automobile accident by a motor vehicle driven by Carlos Marsili. At the time of the accident, Marsili\u2019s vehicle was insured through a policy with Nationwide. He was also employed at Marsili\u2019s Family Restaurant, which had a general commercial liability policy with Owners. The Owners policy specifically excluded coverage for most motor vehicle accidents and stated that it was an excess insurance policy for any motor vehicle accidents not specifically excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">{\u00b6 4} Purr filed a complaint against Marsili and his restaurant, alleging that he negligently caused her injuries and was acting in the scope of his employment at the time of the accident. Owners provided Marsili and his restaurant with a defense under its policy with the restaurant, while reserving its rights under the policy. Later, Owners sought a judgment declaring that it did not have a duty to defend Marsili and the restaurant and was granted declaratory judgment to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">{\u00b6 5} At some point, Owners requested that Nationwide assume the defense of Marsili and the restaurant, but Nationwide refused. After it was granted declaratory judgment, Owners filed a complaint against Nationwide seeking the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>cost of the legal defense it provided to Marsili and the restaurant. Owners then moved for summary judgment, claiming that it was a secondary insurer entitled to reimbursement for its expenses from the primary insurer, Nationwide. After Nationwide responded to the motion, the trial court granted summary judgment to Owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">{\u00b6 6} On appeal, Nationwide argues the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding that Appellant Nationwide must reimburse Appellee Owners for legal fees expended in defending Marsili\u2019s Family Restaurant, which was not an insured on the Nationwide policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding that Appellant Nationwide must reimburse Appellee Owners for legal fees expended in defending Carlos Marsili and Marsili\u2019s Family Restaurant where no evidence was presented on the record to show that Appellant Nationwide was primarily liable and where Appellee Owners assumed the defense as a volunteer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">{\u00b6 9} These assignments of error address the same issues of law and fact, so they will be addressed together.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">{\u00b6 10} In its assignments of error, Nationwide claims that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment to Owners. When reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment, this court applies the same standard as the trial court and, therefore, engages in a de novo review. <em>Parenti v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 826, 829, 586 N.E.2d 1121. Under Civ.R. 56, summary judgment is proper only when the movant demonstrates that, viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmovant, reasonable minds must conclude that no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Doe v. Shaffer </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 388, 390, 738 N.E.2d 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">{\u00b6 11} In a motion for summary judgment, \u201cthe moving party bears the initial responsibility of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion, and identifying those portions of the record which demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of fact on a material element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 296, 662 N.E.2d 264. The nonmoving party has the reciprocal burden of specificity and cannot rest on mere allegations or denials in the pleadings. Id. at 293, 662 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">Nationwide\u2019s Duty to Defend</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">{\u00b6 12} In this case, Owners seeks to be indemnified by Nationwide for the legal defense it provided to Marsili and his restaurant. According to Owners, its policy with the restaurant is secondary to Nationwide\u2019s automobile liability policy with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Marsili, so Nationwide should reimburse Owners for the defense it provided to Nationwide\u2019s insured because Owners undertook Marsili\u2019s defense in good faith, even though a trial court ultimately ruled that it had no duty to defend Marsili. In response, Nationwide argues that it did not have a duty to defend Marsili against Purr\u2019s lawsuit at all, so it could not be primarily liable for providing that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">{\u00b6 13} In an insurance policy, an insurer promises to both indemnify the insured for losses incurred by the insured that arise out of the occurrence of a risk identified in the policy and defend the insured in an action arising because of that occurrence. <em>Twin Maples Veterinary Hosp. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>159 Ohio App.3d 590, 2005-Ohio-430, 824 N.E.2d 1027, at \u00b6 11. The duties to indemnify and defend are separate, distinct, and triggered by different events. Id. \u201cThe test of the duty of an insurance company, under a policy of liability insurance, to defend an action against an insured, is the scope of the allegations of the complaint in the action against the insured, and where the complaint brings the action within the coverage of the policy the insurer is required to make defense, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the action or its liability to the insured.\u201d <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Trainor </em>(1973), 33 Ohio St.2d 41, 62 O.O.2d 402, 294 N.E.2d 874, paragraph two of the syllabus. An insurer has no duty to defend if there is no set of facts alleged in the complaint that, if proven true, would invoke coverage. <em>Cincinnati Indemn. Co. v. Martin </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 604, 605, 710 N.E.2d 677. Furthermore, if \u201cthe conduct which prompted the underlying [lawsuit] is so indisputably outside coverage, we discern no basis for requiring the insurance company to defend or indemnify its insured simply because the underlying complaint alleges conduct within coverage.\u201d <em>Preferred Risk Ins. Co. v. Gill </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 108, 113, 30 OBR 424, 507 N.E.2d 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe duty-to-defend principle applies as well to situations where an insured has coverage with both primary and secondary insurers.\u201d <em>Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Travelers Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 302, 314, 692 N.E.2d 1028. \u201c[A] primary insurer violates its duty to defend at its own peril, and * * * its breach of that duty will make it liable for anything the secondary insurer had to pay in a good-faith settlement of the claim as a result of the primary insurer\u2019s breach of duty.\u201d <em>Sanderson v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 582, 587, 635 N.E.2d 19. However, an insurer is not liable for anything another insurance company does if the second insurance company has no right or interest of its own to protect, acts without a moral or legal obligation, and acts without being requested by anyone liable on the obligation. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Buckeye Union Cas. Co. </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 385, 392, 47 O.O. 270, 105 N.E.2d 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>{\u00b6 15} In this case, Owners has not met its burden of identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate that Nationwide had a duty to defend Marsili against Purr\u2019s lawsuit. Purr\u2019s complaint alleged that on November 18, 1998, Marsili was negligently driving an automobile in such a manner as to cause a collision with her vehicle. She alleged that she was neither contributorily nor comparatively negligent. According to Purr, she suffered serious permanent injuries as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">{\u00b6 16} Short of a stipulation specifically stating that Nationwide had a policy covering these allegations, the best way for Owners to demonstrate that Nationwide has such a policy would be to introduce a copy of that policy. However, we cannot look to the language of Nationwide\u2019s contract with Marsili to determine whether the allegations in Purr\u2019s complaint invoked Nationwide\u2019s duty to defend because neither Nationwide nor Owners has placed a copy of Nationwide\u2019s policy with Marsili into the record. The only evidence in the record that shows that Nationwide had a policy with Marsili that could cover this accident is a stipulation that the parties entered into on June 22, 2005. That stipulation provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cOn or about November 18, 1998, Nationwide Assurance Company had in effect a policy of insurance that provided motor vehicle liability insurance coverage for the 1990 Plymouth vehicle that was driven by Carlos Marsili and was involved in the accident with Valinda Purr.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">{\u00b6 18} This stipulation is insufficient to demonstrate that Nationwide had a duty to defend Marsili against Purr\u2019s lawsuit. Most, if not all, insurance policies place certain burdens upon an insured before coverage can be invoked, even if the policy covers the type of conduct that the insured engaged in. For instance, many motor vehicle insurance policies have clauses that require an insured to notify the insurance company of any claims before the insurance company\u2019s duties are invoked. The record in this case is silent regarding both whether this policy contains such clauses and whether Marsili did in fact comply with the requirements of those clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">{\u00b6 19} We could give further examples showing why an insurance company may not have a duty to defend against a lawsuit even though its policy covers a vehicle that is the subject of the lawsuit, but one such example is enough to show that there are genuine issues of material fact that need to be resolved in this case. Owners is asking this court to assume certain facts that are not in evidence so we can affirm the trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to it. But summary judgment is inappropriate if facts need to be assumed in the movant\u2019s favor. Without more evidence showing that Nationwide had a duty to defend Marsili from Purr\u2019s lawsuit, the trial court erred when it determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Nationwide had a duty to defend Marsili. Nationwide\u2019s assignments of error are meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Owners\u2019 Duty to Defend</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">{\u00b6 20} Nationwide also argues that the trial court erred when granting summary judgment to Owners because it never had a duty to defend Marsili, so Nationwide has no obligation to reimburse Owners for its voluntary act. In response, Owners argues that at the time Purr\u2019s complaint was filed, it was not clear whether it had a duty to defend Marsili from Purrs allegations. It stated that it provided a defense only under a reservation of rights because of that uncertainty. Accordingly, it disagrees that it was acting as a volunteer when it defended Marsili.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">{\u00b6 21} The legal issue of whether Owners owed a duty to defend its insured was dealt with in a prior declaratory judgment action. In that action, none of the parties offered any arguments rebutting Owners\u2019 claim that it had no duty to defend its insured against Purr\u2019s action, and the trial court declared that Owners had no such duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">{\u00b6 22} Owners claims that it undertook Marsili\u2019s defense in good faith based on the status of the law in Ohio at the time of the complaint because it alleged that Marsili was acting in the course of his employment when Purr was injured, but this argument makes little sense. Owners\u2019 policy with Marsili\u2019s restaurant specifically excluded coverage for injuries \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to others of any aircraft, \u2018auto\u2019 or watercraft owner or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured.\u201d The policy defines an \u201cauto\u201d as \u201ca land motor vehicle, trailer or semi-trailer designed for travel on public roads, including any attached machinery or equipment.\u201d Since Purr\u2019s complaint alleged that her injury occurred due to the negligent use of a motor vehicle and Owners\u2019 policy specifically excludes coverage for injuries due to the use of a motor vehicle, Owners did not have a duty to defend Marsili and his restaurant from Purr\u2019s lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">{\u00b6 23} Ohio case law in effect at the time Purr filed her complaint, in particular <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 660, 710 N.E.2d 1116, does not alter this conclusion. That case, since overruled by <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, said that general-liability policies issued to corporations covered corporate employees, even when those employees were not acting in the scope of their employment, absent some limiting language in the contract. The policy in this case contains such limiting language and specifically stated that employees are insured by the policy only when they are acting in the scope of their employment. But this fact, and other Scott-Pontzer-related issues, does not affect this case because the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>excludes from coverage injuries caused by the use of a motor vehicle; it does not matter who is an insured if the act causing the accident is excluded from coverage. Furthermore, <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>applied only to issues involving uninsured and underinsured motor vehicle coverage, neither of which is involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">{\u00b6 24} In conclusion, it is difficult to understand how Owners legitimately believed that it had a duty to defend Marsili and his restaurant from Purr\u2019s allegations. Accordingly, the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment to Owners on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">{\u00b6 25} In this case, there are genuine issues regarding whether Nationwide had a duty to defend its insured from the allegations in Purr\u2019s complaint. The stipulation the parties have entered into fails to demonstrate that Nationwide had such a duty, and the record is devoid of other facts addressing this issue. Furthermore, it appears that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment to Owners on the issue of whether it had acted as a volunteer when it defended Marsili from Purr\u2019s complaint. Accordingly, the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment to Owners. The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b322-8\">Vukovech and Waite, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
