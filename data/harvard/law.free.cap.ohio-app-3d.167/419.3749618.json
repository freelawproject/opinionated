McMonagle, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Lavelle Person, appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment, rendered after a jury trial, finding him guilty of drug trafficking and possession of drugs, fifth-degree felonies, and sentencing him to 18 months\u2019 incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-15\">{\u00b6 2} In his four assignments of error, Person argues that the trial court should have declared a mistrial after the prosecutor elicited testimony that he remained silent after the arresting officers gave him his <em>Miranda </em>rights and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>later, after the jury inquired during deliberations about the identification of Person by the state\u2019s confidential reliable informant (\u201cCRI\u201d), who did not testify at trial; the trial court erred in sustaining the prosecutor\u2019s objection to defense counsel\u2019s use of photographs of the scene; and, the cumulative effect of these errors so prejudiced him that he was denied his right to a fair trial. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">{\u00b6 3} The record reveals the following. On July 28, 2004, Cleveland police detectives from the Fourth District conducted a buy-bust operation. They utilized a CRI to approach persons believed to be selling drugs on the street in order to make a purchase of drugs within the sight of detectives. The detectives would first search the CRI, making sure he had nothing in his possession but a marked $20 bill. The CRI would then approach a person on the street and, in some manner or form, request to purchase crack cocaine. Six detectives would take part in this procedure: two would be \u201ccontrollers\u201d and/or \u201cobservers;\u201d four would act as \u201ctake-downs\u201d or arresting officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 4} In the buy-bust leading to Person\u2019s arrest, Detectives John Hall and Terrance Longstreet acted as observers. Hall testified that he saw the CRI approach the seller and saw a hand-to-hand transaction take place. At the time of the transaction, the seller was on a bicycle riding northbound on the west side of East 116th Street. At the conclusion of the transaction, the seller turned southbound on East 116th Street, rode to Continental Street, and turned west. Hall then lost sight of the seller. Detective Longstreet was parked in a location where he could not see the transaction; Detective Hall apprised him of what was happening via radio broadcast.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">{\u00b6 5} Detective Hall broadcast a description of the suspect; however, at trial, all he remembered of the description was the bicycle. Hall\u2019s testimony was also inconsistent as to the distance from which he viewed the transaction. At one point, Hall testified that the CRI met up with the seller about 400 feet south of where Hall let the CRI out of the car. At another point, however, Hall testified that the distance was \u201cfrom the witness stand to the end of the courtroom\u201d (approximately 40 feet).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">{\u00b6 6} As a result of the radio broadcast, the take-down officers (who were parked in another location) arrested Person, an African-American man seated on a bicycle on Continental Street. At trial, the take-down officers could not remember any details about the offender given to them over the radio, except that he was riding a bicycle. Detective Hall came to the scene and identified appellant in what appellant has characterized as a \u201ccold stand.\u201d Detective Hall testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>{\u00b6 7} \u201cI drove west on Continental with the CRI, and I confirmed to the take-down cars that the defendant was the individual that sold to the CRI, and that the CRI also confirmed that he was the male that \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">{\u00b6 8} Defense counsel immediately objected to this testimony, and the trial court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">{\u00b6 9} Despite this ruling, when the prosecutor later questioned Detective Luther Roddy during trial, he asked the detective:</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cQ. Did Detective Hall identify him?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cQ. Did the CRI identify him?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">{\u00b6 13} Defense counsel again objected to this line of questioning, and the trial court again sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">{\u00b6 14} Only Detective Hall observed the hand-to-hand transaction. Detective Longstreet, who did not see the transaction, testified that he saw the suspect turn the corner after the transaction was completed, but then lost sight of him. Neither the drugs nor the marked \u201cbuy money\u201d was discovered on Person when he was searched upon his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">{\u00b6 15} Person did not take the stand in his own defense; however, Michael Turner and Kimberly Tate, two Continental Street residents, testified for the defense. Both testified that they saw a male from the neighborhood, who was known as \u201cG,\u201d take Person\u2019s bike and head north on East 116th Street. They then saw G return and ride the bicycle behind the house. Less than a minute later, they saw Person ride that same bike down the driveway, and they then observed his arrest. Although at trial the police officers could not recollect any description of the seller, Turner and Tate testified that both G and Person were tall, slim African-American men dressed in a white t-shirt and jeans, which both Turner and Tate described as the \u201cuniform\u201d of the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">{\u00b6 16} During trial, the prosecutor asked Detective Roddy, who arrested Person:</p>\n<p id=\"b460-14\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cQ. Did you read him his Miranda rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-15\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-16\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cQ. Did he make my (sic) statements?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-17\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cA. No.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-18\">{\u00b6 21} The defense objected, but the court made no ruling. Defense counsel requested that the court give no curative instruction, alleging that any such instruction would only serve to highlight the error, rather than ameliorate it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>The court, nonetheless, gave an instruction on defendant\u2019s right to maintain his silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">{\u00b6 22} It is mainly in light of these colloquies that Person seeks relief from this court. We agree with Person that significant errors and prosecutorial misconduct in this case deprived him of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">{\u00b6 23} The facts in this case are disputed. On one hand, we have Detective Hall, who saw the hand-to-hand transaction from some distance away but absolutely identified Person as the seller of the drugs. On the other hand, within minutes of the transaction, Person is arrested, and two neighbors, neither shown to have any reason to prevaricate, indicate that minutes before the arrest, another man \u2014 \u201cG\u201d\u2014was on this same bicycle, dressed similarly to appellant. Corroborating their testimony is the fact that neither drugs nor \u201cbuy money\u201d was found on Person when he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">{\u00b6 24} The neighbors\u2019 testimony should not be construed as proof that the jury lost its way in rendering a verdict of guilty, but rather utilized to place in context the prosecutor\u2019s inappropriate comment on Person\u2019s assertion of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and, further, his impermissible attempts to get the CRTs alleged identification of Person before the jury without any testimony from CRI. In short, that which standing alone might be insufficient to cause reversal, when viewed in the context of other attempts by the prosecutor to elicit inadmissible testimony, could well have been the breakpoint between a guilty and a not-guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">{\u00b6 25} If the defense case is to be believed, Person had just begun riding the bicycle before he was arrested and was mistaken by the police for the drug seller. Under such circumstances, Person\u2019s assertion of his Fifth Amendment rights at arrest could readily cause jury suspicion as to his innocence. What person, innocently riding his bicycle and immediately accosted by police and accused of selling drugs to an undercover informant, would not immediately protest his innocence and explain his whereabouts in the minutes proceeding the arrest? That is obviously the inference suggested by the prosecutor\u2019s question to Detective Roddy about Person\u2019s failure to make a statement. If that were not the inference desired, why then ask the question at all? Detective Roddy\u2019s answer that Person failed to make a statement after he was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights has no possible relevance save the inference that Person did not speak because he was guilty, or had no innocent explanation for his behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">{\u00b6 26} The same is true for the prosecutor\u2019s questions concerning the identification of Person by the CRI. The state went to great lengths to resist identification of the CRI \u2014 including but not limited to refusing to produce his/her name in discovery and not producing him at trial. Once in trial, however, the prosecution realized that the <em>only </em>person who got a close look at the seller was the CRI. The state\u2019s attempt to elicit his testimony in his absence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>impermissibly attempted not once \u2014 -but twice. While timely objections prevented the answer both times, the impression undoubtedly and indelibly imprinted upon the jury was that the CRI would indeed identify the defendant \u2014 if called.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">{\u00b6 27} We cannot agree, as argued by the state, that the prosecutor\u2019s question regarding Person\u2019s silence after he was given his <em>Miranda </em>rights was not error because it was an \u201cisolated incident,\u201d and the trial court gave a curative instruction. The prosecutor\u2019s impermissible question was error because, in context, it can only be construed as evidentiary use of Person\u2019s silence as evidence of his guilt. There simply was no other reason for asking the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">{\u00b6 28} In <em>Doyle v. Ohio </em>(1976), 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91, the United States Supreme Court noted that <em>\u201cMiranda </em>warnings contain an implied promise, rooted in the Constitution, that \u2018silence will carry no penalty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wainwright v. Greenfield </em>(1986), 474 U.S. 284, 295, 106 S.Ct. 634, 88 L.Ed.2d 623. Thus, \u201cwhat is impermissible is the evidentiary use of an individual\u2019s exercise of his constitutional rights after the State\u2019s assurance that the invocation of those rights will not be penalized.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">{\u00b6 29} This court has likewise recognized that \u201cadmitting evidence of post-arrest silence in a manner that implicitly suggests a defendant\u2019s guilt is impermissible.\u201d <em>State v. Gooden, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82621, 2004-Ohio-2699, 2004 WL 1172074, at \u00b6 54. \u201cThe <em>Miranda </em>decision precludes the substantive use of a defendant\u2019s silence during police interrogation to prove his guilt.\u201d Id., citing <em>State v. Correa </em>(May 15, 1997), Cuyahoga App. No. 70744, 1997 WL 253173.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">{\u00b6 30} Here, it is apparent that the prosecutor elicited inadmissible testimony from the state\u2019s police witnesses that Person remained silent after the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given in order to support an inference that he was guilty. Although the prosecutor argues that the question and answer were \u201cisolated\u201d and, therefore, not prejudicial, we do not agree on the effect of the question and answer, especially in light of the prosecutor\u2019s other improper questions regarding whether the CRI had identified Person, despite the trial court\u2019s ruling that such testimony was objectionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">{\u00b6 31} Moreover, although this court has held that an isolated reference to a defendant\u2019s postarrest silence does not constitute reversible error, see <em>State v. Ervin, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 80473, 2002-Ohio-4093, 2002 WL 1824977, we made that ruling in the context of other overwhelming evidence against the defendant. Likewise, in cases citing <em>Ervin </em>and its apparent \u201csingle isolated comment rule,\u201d we have found the state\u2019s reference to the defendant\u2019s postarrest silence to be harmless error, <em>in light of other overwhelming evidence in the record. </em>See, e.g., <em>State v. Sims, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 84090, 2005-Ohio-1978, 2005 WL 984499, at \u00b6 55 (\u201cThere is moreover an independent and substantive basis to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>trial court\u2019s verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d); <em>Gooden, </em>2004-Ohio-2699, 2004 WL 1172074, at \u00b6 55 (\u201cThe remaining evidence presented * * * comprised overwhelming proof of Gooden\u2019s guilt\u201d); <em>State v. Dowdell, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 83829, 2004-Ohio-5487, 2004 WL 2306678, at \u00b6 29 (\u201cThere is, moreover, an independent and substantive basis to support the trial court\u2019s guilty verdict\u201d); <em>State v. Thomas, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 78570, 2002-Ohio-4026, 2002 WL 1821919 (single reference to the defendant\u2019s postarrest silence was not reversible error because \u201chad the jury never heard the impermissible reference * * *, it would still have been justified in finding Thomas guilty * * * \u201d). Thus, <em>Ervin </em>should not be read or understood to stand for the proposition that the state gets one free constitutional violation of a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right not to be compelled to be a witness against himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">{\u00b6 32} \u2018Where evidence has been improperly admitted in derogation of a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, the admission is harmless \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 if the remaining evidence alone comprises \u2018overwhelming\u2019 proof of defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 281, 6 OBR 345, 452 N.E.2d 1323, quoting <em>Harrington v. California </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 250, 254, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">{\u00b6 33} Because the evidence in this case is equivocal and does not provide \u201coverwhelming\u201d proof of Person\u2019s guilt, the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in eliciting testimony regarding Person\u2019s postarrest silence cannot be construed as harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\"> {\u00b6 34} The prosecutor\u2019s questions about the CRI\u2019s alleged identification of Person are similarly offensive. As outlined above, the prosecutor twice asked questions of the state\u2019s witnesses regarding whether the CRI, who did not testify, had identified Person at the scene as the person who sold him the drugs. In one instance, the officer answered in the affirmative before the objection was sustained; in the second instance, the objection to the same question was sustained before the answer was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">{\u00b6 35} We view this objectionable questioning by the prosecutor, coupled with the prosecutor\u2019s question regarding Person\u2019s postarrest silence, as misconduct that prevented Person from receiving a fair trial. It is important to note that the prosecutor continued to ask the same question despite the trial court\u2019s ruling as to its inadmissibility. And lest there be any doubt that the jury was confused as to whether the CRI had identified Person as the drug seller, during the deliberation phase of the trial, the jury submitted the following question in written form to the court: \u2018We would like to revisit the testimony of officer Hall\u2019s remark that he drove by during the cold stand, regarding who made identification of Mr. Person. Was <em>it officer Hall who made the ID, or both Officer Hall and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>the CRI? </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) The jury\u2019s question is a clear indication that the prosecutor\u2019s improper questions about the CRI\u2019s identification of Person affected the jury. It was considering evidence of the CRI identification, even though there was no such evidence before them, and, therefore, the trial court should have declared a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">{\u00b6 36} In light of these significant errors, we sustain appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error and hold that the cumulative effect of the errors, coupled with the fact that both errors involved prosecutorial misconduct in an otherwise questionable case, did in fact deprive Person of his right to a fair trial. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">{\u00b6 37} In light of our resolution of this assignment of error, appellant\u2019s first, second, and third assignments of error are moot, and therefore we need not consider them. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b464-7\">Karpinski, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b464-8\">Kilbane, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b464-9\">Kilbane, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AaK\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">{\u00b6 38} I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion and would affirm the judgment of the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">{\u00b6 39} Both Person and the majority find error in the trial court\u2019s reference to Person\u2019s postarrest silence. The relevant portion of the trial transcript concerns the testimony of Cleveland Police Detective Luther Roddy, who testified that in his capacity as part of the take-down team, he received a description of Person from one of the investigating officers and was told Person\u2019s general direction of travel. Based on this information, Roddy testified that he approached an apartment building between East 116th Street and Continental and saw an individual, later identified as Person, at the side of the apartment building and sitting on a bike. Roddy and his partner approached Person, identified themselves as Cleveland police officers, and placed him under arrest. After testifying as to the details of the arrest, the following exchange took place between Roddy and the prosecutor:</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cQ: Did you read him his Miranda rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cA: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cQ: Did he make any statements?</p>\n<p id=\"b464-15\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cA: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>{\u00b6 44} \u201cMR. BALBIER: Ob \u2014 .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">{\u00b6 45} Although no full \u201cobjection\u201d to this line of questioning appears on the record, the court later clarified its interpretation of the exchange with the following statement:</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Thank you. All right. And I do recall that during the course of the testimony in question, the question was asked, the question, did he make a statement [sic] was preceded by the question, was he given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, or words to that effect, which was answered yes, and then, did he make a statement was answered no.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cNow, whether or not there actually was an objection at that point, again, that\u2019s questionable. I know counsel did \u2014 at least that\u2019s my understanding, that counsel did try \u2014 begin to make an objection, but then the answer was given no. I don\u2019t think the objection was followed through. Nonetheless, I do not recall ever ruling on an objection of that nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">{\u00b6 48} The trial court then proceeded to cite this court\u2019s opinion in <em>State v. Thomas </em>(Aug. 8, 2002), Cuyahoga App. No. 78570, 2002-Ohio-4026, 2002 WL 1821919, which held that \u201ceven where courts have assumed error from the introduction of a statement regarding a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to remain silent, the admission of such a statement will constitute harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt if, because of the relative strength of other evidence introduced, \u2018no juror could have entertained a reasonable doubt\u2019 as to * * * [the defendant\u2019s] guilt.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 29, citing <em>State v. Motley </em>(1985), 21 Ohio App.3d 240, 21 OBR 256, 486 N.E.2d 1259.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">{\u00b6 49} In addition to the reference to Person\u2019s post-Miranda silence, the court gave the following instruction to the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">{\u00b6 50} \u201c[I]f there are any references made during the course of this trial to whether or not the defendant made any statements, you need to be advised, and it\u2019s certainly part of the Court\u2019s closing instructions as well, that the defendant need not give any statement at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cThe defendant is not required to make a statement. Now, whether the police ask a question or not, the defendant has no responsibility or reason to provide a statement, so any inference that you might draw from the fact, if a statement is not given is to be \u2014 is totally disregarded, because that is not a responsibility of any citizen to provide a statement in response to a request for same after an allegation of crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">{\u00b6 52} Based upon the isolated nature of the prosecutor\u2019s statement and the trial court\u2019s curative instruction, I would find that the state did not use the witness\u2019s postsilence comment in any prejudicial manner. Moreover, the record reflects that the state did not make evidentiary use of Person\u2019s silence as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>evidence of his guilt. Therefore, from this record, I cannot conclude that but for the error, the outcome of the trial would clearly have been otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">{\u00b6 58} In Person\u2019s second assignment of error, he additionally claims that a mistrial was warranted because of the jury\u2019s inquiry about whether the CRI or the investigating detective identified Person at the scene. He contends that this question violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation of witnesses. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">{\u00b6 54} During jury deliberation, and as referenced in the majority opinion, the jury submitted the following question to the trial court: \u201cWe would like to revisit the testimony of Officer Hall\u2019s remark that he drove by during the cold stand, regarding who made identification of Mr. Person. Was it Officer Hall who made the ID, or both Officer Hall and the CRI?\u201d The trial court responded, \u201cThe Court has determined to respond to that question by saying, the Court cannot provide any transcript of any witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">{\u00b6 55} A review of the transcript clearly shows that Detective Hall testified that he personally saw the hand-to-hand drug transaction take place, that Person was the same male he identified to the take-down officers as the one who sold to the CRI, and that Person was also the same man who was arrested that day as well. When the detective attempted to testify as to the CRI\u2019s statements, defense counsel objected to the following exchange:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cA: The take-down cars arrived shortly, and detained the defendant on Continental, west of East 116th. During his detainment, I drove west on Continental with the CRI, and I confirmed to the take-down cars that the defendant was the individual that sold to the CRI, and the CRI also confirmed that he was the male that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cMR. BALBIER: Objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cTHE COURT: Sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cQ: So you identified him, is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cA: Yes, I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">{\u00b6 61} Person claims that through Detective Hall\u2019s testimony, the CRI made a statement to police that was testimonial in nature and that he was therefore deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine the CRI as to this statement in violation of his right to confrontation. Detective Hall\u2019s statement regarding both his and the CRI\u2019s identification of Person, however, did not amount to a separate statement by the CRI, as inferred by the majority. Defense counsel objected to the question, and the objection was sustained; any further testimony focused only on Detective Hall\u2019s personal observations. This testimony, and the isolated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>reference to the CRI, did not amount to a violation of Person\u2019s right to confrontation of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">{\u00b6 62} For these reasons, I would hold that Person\u2019s second assignment of error also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">{\u00b6 63} Although found moot by the majority due to its dispensation of the case on the fourth assignment of error, in Person\u2019s third assignment of error, he claims the trial court erroneously failed to admit relevant crime-scene photographs. The record reveals that defense counsel failed to file discovery and that the trial court refused to admit the photographs as a remedy for a Crim.R. 16 violation. In refusing to admit the photographs, the trial court found:</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 64} \u201c[T]he Court is not \u2014 at this point is not altering any of its prior rulings with respect to any of the issues addressed here. The photo evidence is obviously, still excluded. I will permit that to be marked and submitted as part of the record for appellate purposes only.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cBut the Court will note that the reason for their exclusion, again, is the violation of the discovery rule, and also, although, appreciate counsel\u2019s argument that certainly pictures are what they are, pictures can take many different forms, can be taken from different angles, can emphasize different things in photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cTherefore, I believe that is the reason why we do have discovery rules, so that can at least be disclosed to the other side. So they do have a fair chance then to \u2014 if they do not feel pictures are accurate representations of the scene, that they would be able to introduce any evidence that would be contrary to the evidence sought to be introduced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">{\u00b6 67} As the Ohio Supreme Court held in <em>Lakewood v. Papadelis </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 1, 511 N.E.2d 1138, paragraph two of the syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cA trial court must inquire into the circumstances surrounding a discovery rule violation and, when deciding whether to impose a sanction, must impose the least severe sanction that is consistent with the purpose of the rules of discovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">{\u00b6 69} <em>State v. Harcourt </em>(1988), 46 Ohio App.3d 52, 546 N.E.2d 214, then found that the <em>Lakewood </em>holding should not be construed to mean that \u201c[t]he exclusion of testimony or evidence is never a permissible sanction in a criminal case. It is only when the exclusion acts to completely deny the defendant his or her constitutional right to present a defense that the sanction is impermissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">{\u00b6 70} I agree with Person\u2019s assertion that both he and the state elicited a substantial portion of testimony regarding the scene of the incident and that the defense witnesses, Michael Turner and Kimberly Tate, were lay witnesses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>However, a review of the transcript indicates that Person failed to comply with discovery and that the photographs were not available to the state\u2019s witnesses during their testimony, in violation of Crim.R. 16. Despite this discovery violation, the transcript indicates that the trial court permitted both the state\u2019s and the defense\u2019s witnesses to utilize a diagram to illustrate the positions of both the parties and the houses throughout the course of their respective testimony. Although Person\u2019s photographs were not admitted, both defense witnesses were permitted to testify and both witnesses utilized a diagram to aide and illustrate their testimony. I cannot say that the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit the photographs amounted to a complete denial of Person\u2019s right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">{\u00b6 71} Therefore, I would hold that Person\u2019s third assignment of error lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">{\u00b6 72} In his final assignment of error, and the assignment that the majority finds dispositive, Person asserts that the cumulative effect of the trial court\u2019s errors, as set forth in his first three assignments of error, deprived him of a fan-trial. However, and as the Ohio Supreme Court has held, \u201csuch [nonprejudicial] errors cannot become prejudicial by sheer weight of numbers.\u201d <em>State v. Hill </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 212, 661 N.E.2d 1068, <em>State v. Hooks </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 83, 85, 748 N.E.2d 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">{\u00b6 73} Because I would hold that the first three assignments of error lack merit, I cannot say that the cumulative effect of these alleged errors during Person\u2019s trial denied him due process and a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">{\u00b6 74} Although defense witnesses Tate and Turner put forth an alternative set of facts and claimed that a person known only as \u201cG\u201d committed the crime, the jury was free to disregard this testimony and accept the officers\u2019 testimony that Person was, in fact, the man seen conducting a hand-to-hand drug transaction with the CRI. Person also asserts that the fact that the marked Cleveland Police Department buy money was never recovered also weighs in favor of his innocence. The jury heard testimony that buy money is not recovered in each instance; therefore, the failure to recover such money is not indicative of either guilt or innocence, and the jury was free to weigh the testimony before reaching its decision. For these reasons, I would also hold that Person\u2019s fourth assignment of error lacks merit and affirm the ruling of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
