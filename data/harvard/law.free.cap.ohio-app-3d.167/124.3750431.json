Pelligrini appeals the September 14, 2005 trial court decision, issued following remand, modifying the visitation of David Lomakoski, Pelligrini\u2019s ex-husband, with the parties\u2019 minor son. The parties were married in 1995, and they were divorced in 2001 in Michigan. Their divorce decree provided for joint custody of their son. The parties later moved to Greene County, Ohio, where they registered their divorce decree. In September 2003, they executed a \u201cParenting Plan and Parenting Time Schedule,\u201d in which they agreed that Pelligrini would be the residential and custodial parent of their son, and that Lomakoski would have parenting time that included overnight visitation on Tuesdays, dinner on Wednesdays, and every other Friday through Monday morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>In June of 2004, Pelligrini filed a notice of intent to relocate to North Carolina, along with a motion to modify visitation. At the time, Pelligrini was engaged to Nick Pelligrini, who had accepted a job offer in Raleigh, North Carolina, as a computer-systems-integration analyst. Pelligrini, an anesthesiologist, also found employment in Raleigh. Pelligrini and her fianc\u00e9 were married in November 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">{\u00b6 3} Lomakoski opposed the motion to modify his visitation. After a hearing on December 6, 2004, and January 28, 2005, the trial court overruled Pelligrini\u2019s motion on March 23, 2005. The trial court\u2019s decision was based in part upon the report of Tyrone Payne, a psychologist who evaluated the child, and was also based in part upon the report of the child\u2019s guardian ad litem. The child suffers from Tourette\u2019s syndrome. After noting the child\u2019s \u201cpossibly deficient skills in adaptability,\u201d Dr. Payne concluded that \u201cmoving to North Carolina is not in [the child\u2019s] bests interests. Specifically, moving away from his father would be the major negative factor affecting his adjustment.\u201d The guardian ad litem recommended that Lomakoski\u2019s parenting time not be modified. He acknowledged that there may be significant benefits in relocating to North Carolina, benefits which <em>\u201ccould </em>override the Guardian\u2019s belief that [the child\u2019s] best interests require no change in his parenting time with [Lomakoski], if, but only if, [Lomakoski] were to receive significant blocks of parenting time with [the child], including [the child\u2019s] entire summer vacation, every spring break, two weeks during the Christmas season, and all holiday weekends which are extended by virtue of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Friday or Monday holiday, every Thanksgiving, etc. Still further, [Pelligrini] would need to pay [the child\u2019s] transportation costs, as the relocating party.\u201d The guardian noted that he was simply appointed to determine whether a modification of Lomakoski\u2019s parenting time was in the child\u2019s best interest, and that his recommendation against modification \u201cwill require other litigation, perhaps with respect to custody.\u201d The trial court concluded that the child and his father \u201chave made a life in the Greene County area and should not have it disrupted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">{\u00b6 4} Pelligrini appealed the trial court\u2019s decision. We concluded that the trial court abused its discretion: \u201c[T]he trial court improperly determined that the child should not be relocated, when it should have limited its inquiry to whether visitation should be effectuated in a different manner.\u201d We reversed the trial court\u2019s decision, and we remanded the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court then modified Lomakoski\u2019s visitation, without further hearing, consistent with the guardian ad litem\u2019s recommendation. Specifically, the trial court awarded Lomakoski parenting time \u201cat least one three or four day weekend per month\u201d coinciding with the national holidays; December parenting time consistent with the standard order of parenting time; parenting time during the child\u2019s spring breaks each year; parenting time during the second weekend in March; summer parenting time beginning on the day after the last day of school until the Sunday which falls not less than one week before school resumes in the fall; and parenting time for up to a full weekend any time he can travel to the area where the child resides. With the exception of Lomakoski\u2019s travel to North Carolina, \u201call travel arrangements and costs will be the responsibility of the Mother. She is in a superior financial position and the modification of the parenting time schedule is due to her voluntary actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">{\u00b6 6} The procedural history of this matter is not limited to Pelligrini\u2019s first and instant appeals. Lomakoski filed a motion for contempt on March 9, 2005, based on Pelligrini\u2019s failure to notify the court of her relocation and her failure to provide Lomakoski with parenting time. On April 4, 2005, Lomakoski filed a motion to reallocate parental rights and a request for reappointment of a guardian ad litem. On April 26, Lomakoski filed a motion for contempt and a motion for emergency judicial review of his motion, and Pelligrini filed a response on May 5, 2005. On August 23, 2005, Lomakoski filed a motion for contempt and a motion for interim parenting orders, based upon Pelligrini\u2019s failure to comply with the trial court\u2019s decision of March 23, 2005. On August 25, 2005, the trial court entered a decision and order granting interim ex parte custody to movant, in which the court ordered Pelligrini to \u201creturn the child to the State of Ohio and into the care of the Movant J. David Lomakoski on or before 6:00 o\u2019clock p.m. on the 1st day of September.\u201d The court also reappointed the guardian ad litem. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>On August 26, 2005, Pelligrini filed a motion to dismiss Lomakoski\u2019s motion for contempt and motion for interim parenting orders \u201cfor the reason that Mr. Lomakoski has a case pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court and the automatic stay is in effect.\u201d The trial court issued an order providing that all pending motions before it would be decided on December 8, 2005. The resolution of these additional matters is not currently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">{\u00b6 7} Pelligrini asserts four assignments of error, and we note that Lomakoski responds to only two of them in his brief. Pelligrini\u2019s assignments of error will be addressed together, and they are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court did not comply with R.C. 3109.051 in issuing the modified visitation order of September 14, 2005.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court\u2019s visitation order is contrary to the child\u2019s best interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe trial court erred in issuing the modified visitation order without further evidentiary proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe trial court erred in assessing to appellant all travel arrangements and costs as a penalty for remarrying and relocating to another state to live with her spouse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c \u2018[W]hen a parent seeks to modify a previous visitation arrangement, it is that party who bears the burden of proof as to whether the prior arrangement was not in the best interests of the [child].\u2019 <em>Bodine v. Bodine </em>(1988), 38 Ohio App.3d 173, 175 [528 N.E.2d 973]. We will not reverse a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for modification of visitation rights absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Archer v. Archer </em>(Sept. 24, 1997), Pickaway App. No. 96CA37 [1997 WL 600233]. An abuse of discretion \u2018connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u2019 <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219 [5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140]. When applying the abuse of discretion standard of review, we must not substitute our judgment for the trial court. <em>In re Jane Doe I </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 135, 138 [566 N.E.2d 1181]. We must presume the findings of the trial court are correct because the trial judge is best able to observe the witnesses and use those observations in weighing the credibility of the testimony. <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 81 [10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273].\u201d <em>Knapp v. Knapp, </em>Lawrence App. No. 05CA2, 2005-Ohio-7105, 2005 WL 3642718, at \u00b6 18. \u201cA reviewing court will presume that the trial court considered relevant statutory factors in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Minoughan v. Minoughan, </em>Montgomery App. No. 18089, 2000 WL 799737. \u201cIt is to be expected that most instances of abuse of discretion will result in decisions that are simply unreasonable, rather than decisions that are unconscionable or arbitrary. A decision is unreasonable if there is no sound reasoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>process that would support that decision. It is not enough that the reviewing court, were it deciding the issue <em>de novo, </em>would not have found that reasoning process to be persuasive, perhaps in view of countervailing reasoning processes that would support a contrary result.\u201d <em>AAAA Ents., Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp., </em>50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 3109.051 lists several factors that a trial court must consider when determining parenting time matters, including the prior interaction and interrelationships of the child and his parents; the location of each parent\u2019s residence; the child and parents\u2019 available time; the child\u2019s age; the child\u2019s adjustment to home, school and community; the child\u2019s wishes; the health and safety of the child; the mental and physical health of all parties; each parent\u2019s willingness to facilitate the other parent\u2019s rights to parenting time; whether either parent has continuously and willfully denied the other parent\u2019s parenting time rights; whether either parent has established or plans to establish an out-of-state residence; and any other factor in the best interest of the child. The trial court must apply the factors and determine the parenting time plan that is in the child\u2019s best interest. <em>Braatz v. Braatz </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 40, 706 N.E.2d 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">{\u00b6 14} At the hearing, the trial court heard testimony from Mr. and Mrs. Pelligrini, Barbara Dykhuizen, the child\u2019s maternal grandmother, and Rhonda Bush, the child\u2019s preschool teacher during the period of time from August 2003 until June 2004. The court interviewed the child and made a finding for the record that he \u201cdoes not possess the sufficient reasoning ability of a child because maybe of his age. * * * But his \u2014 his ability to interact was pretty much a parroting I call it, just being able to politely answer yes and no and repeat things. * * * [w]hatever was gained from him would not be of any probative value &amp; <em>* </em>^ \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">{\u00b6 15} It is evident from the trial court\u2019s decision of September 14, 2005, that it considered the psychological evaluation performed by Dr. Payne and the report of the guardian ad litem, both of which concluded that the parties\u2019 child \u201cwould suffer if the current amount of parenting time is disrupted.\u201d The court considered Pelligrini\u2019s relocation and the distance Lomakoski must travel to visit the child in Raleigh. The court reviewed the available time of the parents and the fact that the child, at the age of six, is attending school. The court noted that the child is safe but suffers from Tourette\u2019s syndrome. The court also noted the good health of both parties. The court concluded that \u201cmodification of the parenting time is necessary to insure that [the child] spends adequate and substantive time with his father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">{\u00b6 16} Clearly a modification is necessary to insure that the child has adequate time with Lomakoski, but the schedule as modified is onerous and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>unreasonable for Pelligrini and, more importantly, for the child. We agree with Pelligrini that the trial court should have conducted a full evidentiary hearing before issuing its judgment entry. We remanded the matter \u201cfor further proceedings.\u201d The hearing upon which the trial court\u2019s initial decision was based occurred on December 6, 2004, and January 28, 2005. In its September 14, 2005 judgment entry, the court noted that it found \u201cno need for further hearing as the evidence and testimony was fully presented at the original hearings in this matter.\u201d While the trial court noted that the \u201cchild was adjusted to his school and community while living in Beavercreek, Ohio * * * [there was] no evidence before the Court regarding his current adjustment to his new school and community,\u201d a factor that R.C. 3109.051 requires the trial court to consider. Dr. Payne noted the child\u2019s \u201cpossibly deficient skills in adaptability,\u201d making an assessment of his adjustment to his new school and new community an especially critical factor in the analysis of the proper modification of Lomakoski\u2019s parenting time.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">{\u00b6 17} Facts regarding the child\u2019s available time were also absent from the record. Pelligrini testified that the child\u2019s neurologist recommended year-round school for the child, and she indicated that she would follow his advice. She also testified that she planned to seek \u201cthe newest treatments\u201d for the child at the Tourette\u2019s clinic at Duke Medical Center, as well as participate with him in a Tourette\u2019s support group. The trial court lacked the facts necessary to consider whether the child, due to his school and medical treatment schedules, could accommodate the visitation schedule as modified. Because Lomakoski did not testify at the hearing, his current circumstances, financial resources, and available time are also not included in the record. We agree with Pelligrini that the trial court issued the modified visitation schedule without proper application of the factors in R.C. 3109.051(D); many of the facts required to make a proper analysis are absent from this record. In other words, \u201cthere is no sound reasoning process that would support [the trial court\u2019s] decision.\u201d Pelligrini\u2019s four assignments of error are sustained; there being an abuse of discretion, the decision of the trial court is reversed, and this matter is remanded for a full hearing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b168-7\">Brogan and Fain, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
