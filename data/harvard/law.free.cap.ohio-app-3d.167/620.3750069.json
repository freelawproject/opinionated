Meredith was discharged from the hospital later that day. Over the weekend, Meredith was very lethargic and nauseous.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-17\">{\u00b6 2} By Monday, January 29, Meredith\u2019s condition had worsened. She was vomiting profusely and was short of breath. That afternoon, Meredith\u2019s husband, Brian Thamann, called Dr. Bartish. Dr. Bartish told Brian to take Meredith to the emergency room at Providence Hospital. They arrived at the emergency room around 4:30 p.m. Dr. Bartish arrived ten minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-18\">{\u00b6 3} Dr. Bartish and Dr. Elie Zayyat, a surgical resident, assumed Meredith\u2019s care. Dr. Bartish determined that Meredith was suffering from septic shock due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>to an infection related to her surgery. Over the next six hours, Dr. Bartish treated Meredith for septic shock, but her condition kept deteriorating. Around 10:45 p.m., Meredith went into cardiac arrest and died. An autopsy revealed that Meredith had died from pulmonary emboli, multiple blood clots that had built up in her lungs and had blocked her blood supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">{\u00b6 4} Plaintiff-appellant Brian Thamann in his individual capacity and as the administrator of the estate of his late wife, Meredith Thamann, filed a complaint for wrongful death and medical malpractice against defendants-appellees, Lawrence Bartish, M.D., and his employer, Queen City General and Vascular Surgeons, Inc. Following a two-and-a-half-week trial, the jury returned a verdict for Dr. Bartish and his employer. Thamann subsequently moved for a new trial, which the trial court denied. Thamann now appeals, raising eleven assignments of error. Finding merit in his first assignment of error, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this cause for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Improper Comments by Defense Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">{\u00b6 5} In his first assignment of error, Thamann contends that the trial court erred in permitting defense counsel to repeatedly make improper and inflammatory comments to the jury throughout the trial. Thamann contends that even though he did not object to most of the comments, defense counsel\u2019s comments were so abusive and grossly improper that the trial court should have intervened sua sponte to admonish defense counsel and to correct the prejudicial effect of the comments. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">{\u00b6 6} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]he proper role of an attorney at the trial table is not that of a contestant seeking to prevail at any cost but that of an officer of the court, whose duty is to aid in the administration of justice and assist in surrounding the trial with an air conducive to an impartial judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When trial counsel makes inappropriate comments and engages in abusive tactics throughout a trial, those comments and tactics undermine the fairness and impartial administration of justice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[Trial] counsel is obligated to refrain from unwarranted attacks on opposing counsel, the opposing party, and the witnesses.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>{\u00b6 7} \u201c[W]hen [trial counsel] deliberately attempts to influence and sway the jury by a recital of matters foreign to the case, which matters he knows or ought to know cannot be shown by competent or admissible evidence, or when he makes a statement through accident, inadvertence or misconception which is improper and patently harmful to the opposing side, it may constitute the basis for ordering a new trial or for the reversal by a reviewing court of a judgment favorable to the party represented by such counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cIt is the trial court\u2019s duty to see that [trial] counsel\u2019s statements are confined to proper limits and to prohibit counsel from creating an atmosphere of passion and prejudice or misleading the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cAbusive comments directed at opposing counsel, the opposing party, and the opposing party\u2019s witnesses should not be permitted.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cIf there is room for doubt about whether counsel\u2019s improper remarks may have influenced the outcome of the case, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the losing party.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">{\u00b6 8} In this case, the record reveals that defense counsel consciously engaged throughout the trial in a pattern of misconduct that was designed to inflame the jury\u2019s passion and prejudice. Defense counsel told the jurors that plaintiffs witnesses, plaintiffs counsel, and their expert witnesses had manipulated them and lied to them in order to win a big verdict. Additionally, defense counsel urged the jury to render a verdict for Dr. Bartish not because his conduct was above the standard of care, but because he was a \u201cgood doctor\u201d who had never left the decedent\u2019s side and because he had done the best that he could in treating the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">{\u00b6 9} The record shows that even before the jury was seated, defense counsel began laying out his \u201cgood doctor\u201d theme to the jury. For example, defense counsel told the prospective jurors that \u201c[t]here [wa]s no way to get around the fact this is a solemn, serious situation. Can\u2019t get around it. And so because of that, because of my responsibility representing this good doctor, I have to ask you questions that make you a little uncomfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>{\u00b6 10} Later on in voir dire, defense counsel again told the jury, \u201cOne thing you\u2019re going to see, ladies and gentlemen in this trial, you\u2019re not going to be able to point your finger at any one entity, any one individual and say that\u2019s the bad person, that\u2019s the bad thing.\u201d When plaintiffs counsel objected, the trial court sustained the objection but did not instruct the jury to disregard the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Opening Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">{\u00b6 11} Defense counsel\u2019s efforts to engender sympathy for Dr. Bartish continued in his opening statement to the jury. He told the jury, \u201cNow Dr. Bartish didn\u2019t ask for this. He did not ask to be in this courtroom. [S]o* * * the niceties to some extent are over here. * * * [T]he evidence in this case is that he\u2019s being criticized for never having left her side.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">{\u00b6 12} Defense counsel then asked the jurors if Dr. Bartish and his staff had \u201cignore[d] [Meredith], did * * * just not care, or were just stupid?\u201d Then he told them that \u201cthe answer to those questions is absolutely no. This was a physician who laid his hands on her, who did his best, who met his patient at the emergency room, and never left her side, did the best he could based on what he saw when he was there. * * * That\u2019s what he is and that\u2019s who he is, and I\u2019m very, very proud to represent this man. * * * But this good doctor did not cause this woman\u2019s death. This good doctor did exactly what he could and should have done under the circumstances. And that you must, you must say no, he did not do anything wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">{\u00b6 13} In addition to his sympathy theme, defense counsel laid the foundation for another recurrent theme throughout the trial, namely, the denigration of the plaintiff, his counsel, and their expert witnesses. \u201cThe evidence will demonstrate that there are only three people, three individuals in this case who thought Dr. Bartish and all his team should have thought pulmonary embolism. And those three people are the three individual experts or doctors, if you will, that they\u2019re going to bring into the courtroom starting tomorrow. And you\u2019re going to ask yourself, well, why, why? And the answer is because these three doctors who evaluated this case, allegedly fairly, they read the autopsy and they worked backwards * * * with an autopsy report in his hand drinking coffee in his office getting paid by the hour to come in here and testify as a plaintiffs expert.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Examination of Witnesses</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">{\u00b6 14} During the examination and cross-examination of witnesses, defense counsel again made remarks designed to arouse the jury\u2019s passion and prejudice. Sometimes these remarks were in the form of speaking objections, and sometimes they were in the form of questions in which defense counsel made long speeches during cross-examination to buttress his case and then concluded with a mundane question. For example, in his cross-examination of plaintiffs expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>witness, Dr. Panacek, defense counsel stated, \u201cLet\u2019s get back to Dr. Bartish. He\u2019s going through this process. He thinks, well, maybe there\u2019s peritonitis. Maybe there\u2019s some problem in the abdomen. Maybe there\u2019s infection causing this. She has an elevated temperature, et cetera. They take the bile out. He gave oxygen did he not?\u201d Dr. Panacek replied, \u201cThey gave oxygen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">{\u00b6 15} Even more disturbing than these long speeches, however, was the sheer amount of contempt defense counsel displayed toward plaintiffs witnesses. For example, when he stood up to cross-examine Patty Potts, the decedent\u2019s aunt, who had been crying on the stand, defense counsel asked her if she wanted a glass of water. He then asked, \u201cWould you like some of our water or some of their water? You probably don\u2019t trust our water.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">{\u00b6 16} Counsel\u2019s inflammatory comments continued during his cross-examination of plaintiffs witnesses. In particular, defense counsel displayed contemptuous behavior towards the plaintiffs expert witnesses. Defense counsel told one of the plaintiffs experts, Dr. Kenneth Williams, that he was \u201cplaying games.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">{\u00b6 17} And when defense counsel was permitted over objection to bring up the fact that plaintiffs second expert, Dr. Jeffrey Snow, had settled a case involving a pulmonary embolism, defense counsel proceeded to chide Dr. Snow, over the plaintiffs objection, that he was not negligent in that case. Defense counsel also chided Dr. Panacek during cross-examination, often interjecting his own comments to undercut Dr. Panacek\u2019s qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cQ. I don\u2019t understand a thing you just said * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cQ. It\u2019s interesting you say that because your name is on this. You told us this is one of the reasons why you think you\u2019re qualified to be here. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cQ. Let\u2019s read from the same one so you\u2019re not confused. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cQ. Maybe we can get you to understand here. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cQ. How many hours have you spent on this case looking at the record, talking to [plaintiffs counsel] * * * including thinking about it * * * dreaming about it?</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cA. Dreaming about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">{\u00b6 24} During his cross-examination of this same expert, Dr. Panacek, the following exchange took place, which again highlights defense counsel\u2019s demeanor toward plaintiffs expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cQ. There are an estimated 650,000 cases per year in the United States and 200,000 deaths. Is that accurate?</p>\n<p id=\"b663-16\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cA. Well, the problem is\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b663-17\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cQ. Yes or no, is that accurate?</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>{\u00b6 28} \u201cA. It\u2019s yes and no. Well, sir\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c[Plaintiffs Counsel]: Your Honor, may he been [sic] * * * allowed to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cQ. I\u2019ve got a paper. I think I can cross-examine him about this paper that he has his name on that he\u2019s represented in his CV as one of the reasons why he can be here today and I think I can ask him these questions without being interrupted.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cTHE COURT: I think that\u2019s fair. I do want to suggest to the doctor, you do have to answer. If you have an explanation, you can give that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">{\u00b6 32} In another exchange with Dr. Panacek, defense counsel remarked, \u201cIf you don\u2019t understand that question I\u2019m not going to waste your time with it. So you think you\u2019re in as good a position as Dr. Bartish to tell this jury?\u201d When Dr. Panacek replied that he did not say that, defense counsel replied, \u201cDon\u2019t answer before I finish.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">{\u00b6 33} Counsel continued this same pattern of inflammatory remarks in his closing argument. Defense counsel again attacked Thamann, his counsel, and their expert witnesses. Defense counsel accused them of lying to the jurors and manipulating them so they could win money at the expense of Dr. Bartish.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cA half lie is worse than a whole lie. I submit to you that from the first witness in this case, Brian Thamann, until the last question asked in this trial yesterday * * * we see a continuous pattern of behavior on the part of the plaintiffs in this case that is half-truths, manipulations, taking things out of context, attempting to create something that is not there, a case for purposes of winning a lot of money from you. * * * Now what is going on here? That\u2019s the first of numerous examples of manipulations, of half-truths, out of context in this whole case. * * * We find out that it\u2019s an attempt to manipulate you. Not me, you. Why? Because they want to win money at the expense of this good doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cTo take this situation like this and to hire three doctors \u2014 we\u2019ll talk about them in a moment \u2014 to have them come into this courtroom and to give the kind of testimony they gave in an attempt to create a case against a physician who was doing everything in his power to save the life of a young woman merely for the purpose of winning all kinds of money so he can get married next week and live happily ever after \u2014 you might think this man is nasty, lawyer thing, whatever \u2014 I think it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s wrong. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cThese three people that came in here and told you how easy it was, especially [plaintiffs expert Dr.] Panacek. * * * It\u2019s ridiculous. * * * The fact [is] they bring in these people who\u2019ve been found by these expert witness groups <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>to say what they want them to say. What did the plaintiffs expert, Dr. [Kenneth] Williams\u2019s character say to you? I couldn\u2019t believe it. He sits up here and says to you Dr. Bartish was wrong, he should have turned her over to the emergency department. I promise you that if Dr. Bartish had turned her over to the emergency department and she died of a pulmonary embolism, which she would have, he\u2019d be in here criticizing him for turning her over to the emergency department. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind. No doubt in my mind.\u201d * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cI\u2019ll let you be the judge of [Dr.] Ken Williams. I could hardly get an answer out of this guy. * * * Dr. Snow, I liked him. He was the only honest guy that came in here for the plaintiffs. * * * Then you get to my favorite, [Dr.] Panacek. Very clever guy, very glib, funny guy * * * he teaches this to his students as the classic example of pulmonary embolus. I find that unbelievably absurd and so intellectually disingenuous it made me sick.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cFor those people to sit on the witness stand here and take 35 hours over a five-year period to review this stuff and come in here and say the things they do and point the finger at Dr. Bartish and say it\u2019s so easy, I think is wrong * * * It\u2019s one thing and one thing only, so you\u2019ll walk back in here, whenever you do, and give a lot of all kinds of money to these people. That\u2019s what it\u2019s for.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cWould you want to base a verdict against this good physician on this kind of garbage? * * * I submit to you that would be a tragedy in and of itself to do that to this man.* * * If you want to find a verdict against this good doctor based on this kind of disingenuous half truths, bought and sold testimony, that\u2019s your business. I don\u2019t think you will. You\u2019re too smart. You\u2019re too smart.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">{\u00b6 40} Defense counsel even attacked Dr. Leopold Buerger, the pathologist who performed Meredith\u2019s autopsy, in his closing argument. \u201cLet me say one thing about Dr. Buerger. May I? He was an insult to the medical profession. Total insult to the medical profession in my view. He was a disparaging, insulting, repulsive witness who talked about the decedent in a manner in which I\u2019ve never in my twenty-eight years seen. It was horrible. Absolutely horrible. There\u2019s no excuse for that testimony. No excuse for him saying the things he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">{\u00b6 41} In addition to the inflammatory and abusive comments about the plaintiff, his counsel, and their expert witnesses, defense counsel once again asked the jury to sympathize with Dr. Bartish and to render a verdict for him if he had done the best that he could. During his closing argument, defense counsel told the jury, \u201cMake no mistake about it. This is not an ATM machine sitting at the table. * * * [H]e\u2019s a human being. He\u2019s not a bank. There hasn\u2019t been one scintilla of expression in this courtroom for two weeks, not one, how this man felt when this patient died. Not one expression about Dr. Bartish and how he felt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>* * *[0]n the verge of tears at times * * * because this man profoundly has pain.* * * Now in our system if you point a finger at a doctor like this and you accuse him of causing the death of a young woman, there\u2019s nothing light about this. And there\u2019s blood being spilled because they\u2019re accusing him of causing the death of this young lady. Do you think they don\u2019t care about him? * * * This good doctor did not cause this woman\u2019s death. This good doctor did exactly what he could and should have done under the circumstances. And that you must, you must say, no, he did not do anything wrong.\u201d When plaintiffs counsel objected to these comments, defense counsel remarked, \u201cThey don\u2019t care about him.\u201d The trial court overruled the objection, told the jury that it must make those decisions about the facts, and then directed defense counsel to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">{\u00b6 42} And continue defense counsel did. In addition to maligning the plaintiff and the expert witnesses, defense counsel also improperly opined on the credibility of his own witnesses, telling the jury that his experts were more credible than the plaintiffs experts because they \u201care physicians who are in there trying to help and fix people every day. They\u2019re not these paid individuals who belong to Ellen Rybeck\u2019s expert witness group.\u201d With respect to one particular defense expert, he told the jury that this expert \u201c * * * Jim Kennealy came in here and he testifies, only he\u2019s from this community * * * He comes in here and perjures himself for Dr. Bartish? I doubt it. It\u2019s hardly worth that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">{\u00b6 43} Defense counsel ended his closing argument with a veiled threat to the members of the jury, informing them that they should not complain about the quality of the medical care in their community if they rendered a verdict for the plaintiffs. \u2018You\u2019re going to carry a verdict. You\u2019re going to go back in this jury room and decide the case. When you come back out here you won\u2019t be able to hide from me and you won\u2019t be able to hide from Dr. Bartish. But most importantly, you won\u2019t be able to hide from your own heart and soul. You\u2019ll have to carry back into this courtroom and you\u2019ll be known by the thing you carry and this your verdict. You\u2019ll be known by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cHere\u2019s the beauty of this. * * * Your verdict in this case will speak for the community, just the eight of you. Your verdict will talk, if you will. It will express what you feel about this type of case in this situation and what you think of the practice of medicine * * *. We all stand around sometimes complaining about certain things and complaining about problems in life and we read the newspaper about situations that take place. And we hear about the situations of other people. But here\u2019s one of those times in your life, the eight of you, this is one of those times you may not like it, it may be very difficult, but the fact is here\u2019s one of those times in life where you have to draw a line and have to take a position. And don\u2019t complain at some cocktail party two weeks or five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>years from now about what\u2019s going on in our society, you have your chance right now to talk about this and reach a verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">{\u00b6 45} Defense counsel\u2019s strategy in this case was clear. He sought to arouse the jury\u2019s passion and prejudice by repeatedly making improper remarks about the plaintiff, his counsel, and their expert witnesses. Defense counsel insinuated throughout his cross-examination of the plaintiffs witnesses that the witnesses and plaintiffs counsel were playing games. In his closing argument, he repeatedly told the jury that they had engaged in lies, manipulations, and half-truths in order to manipulate the jury into awarding the plaintiff a big verdict.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">{\u00b6 46} Moreover, defense counsel\u2019s comments to the jury to consider only whether Dr. Bartish had done his best were extremely pervasive and prejudicial to the plaintiffs case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These comments misled the jury away from considering the proper legal standard, the care of a reasonably prudent physician, to considering only whether Dr. Bartish personally did his best.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additionally prejudicial were defense counsel\u2019s threats to the members of the jury, informing them that they should not complain about the quality of the medical care in their community if they rendered a verdict for the plaintiff.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Most disturbing to this court, however, is that this particular defense counsel has utilized these exact same inflammatory and grossly abusive comments in three other medical-malpractice cases.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">{\u00b6 47} While we recognize that many of defense counsel\u2019s comments, in and of themselves, were not that egregious, when viewed in their entirety, they demonstrate a pattern of misconduct by defense counsel that warrants reversal. Moreover, given the pervasiveness of defense counsel\u2019s comments, we are convinced that the trial court\u2019s cautionary instructions to the jury before opening and closing arguments, and the few objections it sustained, had little effect, if any, in erasing counsel\u2019s comments from the jury\u2019s consideration. Because there was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>substantial likelihood that the jury was misled and that the verdict was influenced by defense counsel\u2019s improper and inflammatory remarks, we sustain Thamann\u2019s first assignment of error. We, therefore, reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand this cause for further proceedings.

Despite this court\u2019s statements that \u201c[w]e are reluctant to reverse a case because of improper closing argument,\u201d to the exclusion of Thamann\u2019s other assigned errors, the majority focuses solely on the opening statement and closing argument by Dr. Bartish\u2019s counsel to overturn a jury verdict reached after two and one-half weeks of trial.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">{\u00b649} Following this court\u2019s recent trend in <em>Roetenberger v. Christ Hosp.,</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> Fehrenbach v. O\u2019Malley,</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Furnier v. Drury,</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the majority struggles to find a bright-line test or to impose Marquis of Queensberry rules to restrain counsel in medical-malpractice trials. The effect of our decisions, however, is to elevate the otherwise laudable goals of civility and professionalism above the traditional requirement of overturning a jury\u2019s verdict only where counsel\u2019s comments, properly preserved by a timely objection, affect the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">{\u00b6 50} To overturn a jury\u2019s verdict due to counsel\u2019s remarks in opening statement or closing argument, to which there was no objection, invites \u201csandbagging.\u201d Trial counsel can sit on his hands, gambling that the verdict will be favorable. If not, on appeal, counsel can argue that the remarks were so disparaging and outrageous that the jury\u2019s verdict must be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">{\u00b6 51} The issue for the jury here was whether Dr. Bartish negligently failed to diagnose and treat a pulmonary embolism from the symptoms that Meredith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Thamann presented in the emergency room. The evidence was undisputed that 75 percent of the deaths caused by a pulmonary embolism are not discovered until there is an autopsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">{\u00b6 52} There was but one lone objection during the 39 pages of closing argument by Dr. Bartish\u2019s counsel. The common-law waiver doctrine, adopted by the Ohio Supreme Court, requires that a timely objection be made to improper remarks so that the trial court may take proper action, including the giving of a curative instruction.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">{\u00b6 53} Statements that counsel did not object to are waived unless they are plain error. The doctrine originated in criminal law and permits an appellate court to notice errors affecting substantial rights that were not brought to the attention of the trial court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> A party in a civil case does not have the Sixth Amendment protections of a criminal defendant.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, it is the law in Ohio that \u201c[i]n appeals of civil cases, the plain error doctrine is not favored and may be applied only in the extremely rare case involving exceptional circumstances where error, to which no objection was made at the trial court, seriously affects the basic fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial process, thereby challenging the legitimacy of the underlying judicial process itself.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">{\u00b6 54} In addition to failing to recognize the limitations of unobjected-to error, the majority castigates Dr. Bartish\u2019s counsel for his harsh comments. But context matters. The majority has identified the comment that the plaintiffs told the jury \u201chalf truths\u201d as a key basis for concluding that Dr. Bartish\u2019s counsel disparaged Mr. Thamann, his counsel, and his experts. The transcript, however, shows that it was Mr. Thamann\u2019s counsel who first used the phrase in closing argument, saying \u201cagain, there\u2019s an old saying half a truth is worse than a whole he.\u201d Dr.'Bartish\u2019s comments were made to rebut Mr. Thamann\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">{\u00b6 55} For example, on direct examination, Mr. Thamann had presented himself as a man left to struggle on, in his counsel\u2019s phrase, as \u201cMr. Mom\u201d for his eight-year-old daughter since the death of his wife. In closing argument, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Bartish\u2019s counsel argued that this profile was only part of the truth of Mr. Thamann\u2019s situation. Counsel noted that it was not until the cross-examination of Mr. Thamann that he disclosed to the jury that, for three years, he had been living with a 26-year-old woman and that they had had a child together. He also admitted that he had postponed their impending marriage until after the trial. Counsel\u2019s \u201chalf truth\u201d statement was within the bounds of fair argument, because he was commenting on the evidence \u2014 that Mr. Thamann told the jury only part of the truth, and that the rest of the story had to be dragged from him on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">{\u00b6 56} The majority is also concerned that Dr. Bartish\u2019s counsel exceeded the bounds of acceptable argument by directing abusive comments at Mr. Thamann\u2019s experts in closing argument. The purpose of these comments was to differentiate the testimony of Dr. Bartish\u2019s expert witnesses \u2014 practicing physicians working regularly in the operating room \u2014 from Mr. Thamann\u2019s expert witnesses\u2014 physicians hired from a group that was in the business of providing expert testimony in malpractice trials. An expert\u2019s bias and pecuniary interests and the limitations of his opinion are appropriate subjects for cross-examination and comment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">{\u00b6 57} The majority castigates Dr. Bartish\u2019s counsel for his harsh comments about Dr. Buerger\u2019s professionalism. But the deposition testimony, read into the record, reveals that Dr. Buerger, the pathologist, repeatedly and needlessly commented on how fat Meredith was. He also admitted that he had not autopsied her legs to search for deep-vein thromboses \u2014 conditions that Mr. Thamann\u2019s experts stated were almost always the cause of pulmonary embolism. Moreover, the deposition was not conducted by Dr. Bartish\u2019s trial counsel, but by counsel no longer in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">{\u00b6 58} An appellate court should recognize that disparagement of an expert witness is not determined by how rough the cross-examination is or how withering the closing argument seems to one reading the transcript. Only \u201c \u2018[w]hen argument spills into disparagement <em>not based on any evidence, </em>is it improper.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The majority agrees that counsel must be afforded wide latitude during opening statement and closing argument as long as the remarks are based on the evidence.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> But a reviewing court cannot easily discern the limits of that latitude from a cold record. This task is made more difficult when trial counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>has failed to raise a timely objection to \u201cspecific acts or omissions by the trial court constituting legal error, * * * properly suggested as error to the trial court.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">{\u00b6 59} An additional hurdle to appellate review of the case is the difficulty of reconciling the civil plain-error doctrine codified in the syllabus paragraph of <em>Goldfuss </em>and the analysis in <em>Pesek. </em>In <em>Pesek, </em>the Supreme Court appeared to impose a duty on the trial court to intervene sua sponte to admonish counsel and to take curative action.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The court said that, on review, we should be guided by the principle that \u201cif \u2018there is room for doubt, whether the verdict was rendered upon the evidence, or may have been influenced by improper remarks of counsel, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the defeated party.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Acknowledging that the \u201cline between forceful advocacy and unacceptable conduct is sometimes obscure,\u201d the Supreme Court concluded that any error should be resolved on the side of professionalism.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">{\u00b6 60} But this open-ended test is at odds with the plain-error rule in civil cases requiring exceptional circumstances that challenge the legitimacy of the underlying judicial process before reversal. Furthermore, in every medical-malpractice case, something has gone terribly wrong in an operating room or a doctor\u2019s office, but not necessarily as the result of medical negligence. Accordingly, under the subjective standard of <em>Pesek, </em>there would always be \u201croom for doubt\u201d that counsel\u2019s comment influenced the jury, whether objected to or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">{\u00b6 61} As harsh as some of the comments by counsel for Dr. Bartish may have sounded to the jury, the judicial system was not a casualty in this case. The remarks that the majority calls into question, when examined in context rather than as isolated comments strung together to make a worst-case scenario, were based on the evidence in the record or were squarely within recognized limits for challenging the foundation for the opinions of Mr. Thamann\u2019s experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">{\u00b6 62} I suggest that this court\u2019s recent trend toward overturning defense jury verdicts in medical-malpractice cases by focusing on counsel\u2019s use of taboo words, to the exclusion of all else, places the court on a slippery slope. Appellate courts should look to whether counsel\u2019s unobjected-to comments in closing argument constitute misconduct or merely reflect representation \u201czealously within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>bounds of the law.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> A reviewing court should be guided by the following: (1) although counsel has wide latitude during closing argument, statements and inferences not warranted by the evidence create an atmosphere of passion or prejudice and inflame the minds of the jurors;<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> (2) before reversal of a jury verdict, counsel\u2019s remarks must be so prejudicial that an appropriate curative instruction cannot eliminate the probability that the remarks affected the jury\u2019s verdict; (3) whether counsel\u2019s remarks, such as appeals to racial, ethnic, or religious bias, so unfairly affected the trial that, if left uncorrected, they would undermine the integrity and public confidence in the jury system;<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> (4) whether the misconduct, no matter how improper or unethical, affected the outcome of the trial; and (5) reversal does not simply provide the court a method to deal with a lawyer\u2019s unprofessional conduct.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">{\u00b6 63} I cannot imagine that public confidence in the jury system will be undermined if we follow Ohio law and enforce the waiver doctrine when an appellant\u2019s experienced trial counsel, specializing in medical-malpractice cases, does not object to opposing counsel\u2019s remarks on the evidence in the opening statement or closing argument.</p>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b668-12\">. <em>Clark v.
