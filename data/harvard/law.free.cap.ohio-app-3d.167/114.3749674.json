McMonagle, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant Cuyahoga Community College appeals the trial court\u2019s June 15, 2005 entry granting the motion to dismiss of plaintiff-appellee, Eileen Hamilton. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">{\u00b6 2} In August 2000, Hamilton filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, seeking an allowance for \u201csprain lumbar region,\u201d \u201cherniated disc L-3, L-4, and L-5,\u201d and \u201caggravation of left hip osteoarthritis.\u201d The claim was allowed for \u201csprain lumbar region\u201d and \u201cherniated disc L-3, L-4, and L-5,\u201d but denied for \u201caggravation of left hip osteoarthritis.\u201d Hamilton filed a motion requesting additional allowance for \u201caggravation of left hip osteoarthritis,\u201d \u201cspondylolisthesis,\u201d and \u201clumbar degenerative disc disease.\u201d On October 18, 2002, a hearing was held on Hamilton\u2019s motion, and the district hearing officer allowed the claims for \u201cspondylolisthesis\u201d and \u201clumbar degenerative disc disease,\u201d but denied the claim for \u201caggravation of left hip osteoarthritis.\u201d Both Hamilton and Cuyahoga Community College appealed the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">{\u00b6 3} On December 11, 2002, a staff hearing was held on the parties\u2019 appeals. The staff hearing officer affirmed the district hearing officer\u2019s decision and further allowed the condition of \u201caggravation of left hip osteoarthritis.\u201d Cuyahoga Community College filed an appeal to the Industrial Commission of Ohio. In an order dated January 16, 2003, the commission refused Cuyahoga Community College\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">{\u00b6 4} On March 19, 2003, Cuyahoga Community College filed a notice of appeal with the common pleas court. In its notice of appeal, Cuyahoga Community College stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cTri-C, Defendanh-Appellant, hereby gives notice of its appeal from the decision of Milutin Zlojutro, District Hearing Officer, in Claim No. 00-479532 [filed] on October 22, 2002. Thereafter, a Staff Hearing Officer affirmed District Hearing Officer Zlojutro\u2019s Order at a December 11, 2002 Staff Hearing from which decision the Industrial Commission of Ohio, by and through Staff Hearing Officer Jaimee L. Touris, refused to permit Employer\u2019s appeal directly to the three member Industrial Commission, in an Order dated January 16, 2003, and received by Tri-C on January 21, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>{\u00b6 6} \u201cSaid Order is appealable to this Court pursuant to the provisions of Section 4123.512, Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">{\u00b6 7} In accordance with R.C. 4123.512, Hamilton filed a complaint on March 25, 2003, which she voluntarily dismissed on December 16, 2003. Hamilton refiled her complaint on November 23, 2004. On May 11, 2005, she filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. In her motion, Hamilton argued that Cuyahoga Community College\u2019s March 19, 2003 notice of appeal was inadequate. Cuyahoga Community College opposed Hamilton\u2019s motion, but the trial court granted the motion, and this appeal follows. In its sole assignment of error, Cuyahoga Community College contends that the trial court erred in dismissing its appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">{\u00b6 8} The standard of review for a motion to dismiss, pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(1), lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, is \u201cwhether any cause of action cognizable by the forum has been raised in the complaint.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Bush v. Spurlock </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 537 N.E.2d 641. An appellate court considers the issue de novo, reviewing the issue independently of the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>D\u2019Agnese v. Holleran, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 83367, 2004-Ohio-1795, 2004 WL 744610.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. 4123.512(B) governs appeals from decisions of the Industrial Commission to the common pleas court and provides, \u201cThe notice of appeal shall state the names of the claimant and the employer, the number of the claim, the date of the order appealed from, and the fact that the appellant appeals therefrom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">{\u00b6 10} Hamilton contends that Cuyahoga Community College\u2019s notice of appeal asserted that the appeal was taken from the district hearing officer\u2019s decision and, thus, was untimely and defective and rendered the trial court without subject-matter jurisdiction to decide the case. Hamilton relies on the following sentence from the notice of appeal in support of her argument: \u201cTri-C, Defendant-Appellant, hereby gives notice of its appeal from the decision of Milutin Zlojutro, District Hearing Officer, in Claim No. 00-479532 [filed] on October 22, 2002.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">{\u00b6 11} In addressing an appellant\u2019s compliance with the requirements of R.C. 4123.512(B), the Supreme Court of Ohio held:</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c1. The jurisdictional requirements of R.C. [4123.512] are satisfied by the filing of a timely notice of appeal which is in substantial compliance with the dictates of that statute. <em>(Cadle v. General Motors Corp. </em>[1976], 45 Ohio St.2d 28, 74 O.O.2d 50, 340 N.E.2d 403, overruled.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c2. Substantial compliance for jurisdictional purposes occurs when a timely notice of appeal filed pursuant to R.C. [4123.512] includes sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>information, in intelligible form, to place on notice all parties to a proceeding that an appeal has been filed from an identifiable final order which has determined the parties\u2019 substantive rights and liabilities.\u201d <em>Fisher v. Mayfield </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 8, 30 OBR 16, 505 N.E.2d 975, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>Fisher, </em>the court held that although the date of the order being appealed was stated incorrectly, the appellant provided enough information for the parties to determine that a particular claim or action was forthcoming and, hence, there was no surprise or unfair prejudice to the parties. Id. at 11, 30 OBR 16, 505 N.E.2d 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">{\u00b6 15} This court has generally adhered to a substantial compliance requirement for appeals brought pursuant to R.C. 4123.512. For example, in <em>Dorrington v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>(Sept. 11, 1986), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 50694 and 50617, 1986 WL 9956, this court, relying on <em>State ex rel. Ormet Corp. v. Burkhart </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 112, 25 OBR 160, 495 N.E.2d 422, and <em>Mullins v. Whiteway Mfg. Co. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 18, 15 OBR 15, 471 N.E.2d 1383, rejected an \u201cinflexible test\u201d for determining the sufficiency of an appeal pursuant to R.C. 4123.512 when it was questionable from the notice of appeal which decision was being appealed. Similarly, in <em>Connelly v. Parma Community Gen. Hosp., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 83747, 2004-Ohio-3738, 2004 WL 1576411, relying on <em>Fisher, </em>supra, this court found substantial compliance even though the notice of appeal incorrectly stated which decision was being appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">{\u00b6 16} We do recognize, however, that this court reached a different result in <em>Walker v. Trimble </em>(Oct. 20, 1994), Cuyahoga App. No. 66303, 1994 WL 581508, wherein it found that the appellant failed to place concerned parties on sufficient notice as to the particular final order being appealed. In <em>Walker, </em>the appellant incorrectly designated the order being appealed without any reference whatsoever to the decision that the appellant actually intended to appeal. Thus, <em>Walker </em>does not apply here \u2014 Cuyahoga Community College referenced the order it intended to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">{\u00b6 17} In this case, the record demonstrates that Hamilton was put on notice as to what was being appealed. While perhaps the notice of appeal was somewhat inartfully phrased, it did give notice of what was being appealed: \u201cThe Industrial Commission of Ohio, by and through Staff Hearing Officer Jaimee L. Touris, refused to permit Employer\u2019s appeal directly to the three member Industrial Commission, <em>in an Order dated January 16, 2003, </em>and received by Tri-C on January 21, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">{\u00b6 18} <em>\u201cSaid Order is Appealable to this Court </em>pursuant to the provisions of Section 4123.512, Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Further, the statutory requirements themselves put Hamilton on notice of what was being appealed. Specifically, a tentative order is issued by the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, and if that tentative order is appealed, a hearing is held before a district hearing officer. If the district hearing officer\u2019s decision is appealed, then a hearing is conducted before a staff hearing officer. An appeal from the decision of the staff hearing officer may then be taken to the Industrial Commission. The Industrial Commission then either hears the appeal on the merits of claim or declines to hear the appeal. A party may then appeal the commission\u2019s decision to the common pleas court. See R.C. 4123.512(B) through (E).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">{\u00b6 20} In fact, when a party in a workers\u2019 compensation case fails to exhaust the statutorily prescribed administrative remedies prior to appealing to the common pleas court, the case is subject to dismissal. <em>Evans v. Visiting Nurse Assn. </em>(Aug. 8, 1996), Cuyahoga App. No. 69825, 1996 WL 447965.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">{\u00b6 21} Hamilton\u2019s complaint itself demonstrates that she had notice of what decision was being appealed:</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c10. The Order of the Industrial Commission is the final order allowing plaintiffs right to participate in the workers\u2019 compensation fund in Claim No. 00-479532 for the injuries of aggravation of pre-existing osteoarthritis of the left hip, aggravation of pre-existing spondylolisthesis at L4-5 and aggravation of preexisting [lumbar] degenerative disc disorder at L3-4 and L4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c11. Tri-C filed a Notice of Appeal with the Clerk of this Court from the final Order of the Industrial Commission of Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">{\u00b6 24} Hamilton argues in her brief that \u201c[t]he parties may not, by stipulation or agreement, confer subject matter jurisdiction on a court where subject matter jurisdiction is otherwise lacking.\u201d This court\u2019s reference to Hamilton\u2019s complaint, however, is not an endorsement that she waived jurisdiction; rather, the reference is to merely point out that she was put on <em>notice </em>as to what Cuyahoga Community College was appealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">{\u00b6 25} Accordingly, we hold that the record before us demonstrates that Cuyahoga Community College substantially complied with the requirements of R.C. 4123.512 and that Hamilton was not surprised or unfairly prejudiced by the appeal and, thus, the notice of appeal was sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the common pleas court. The assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b157-12\">Celebrezze, P.J., and Blackmon, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
