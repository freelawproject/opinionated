Bowshier contends that his conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence and is not supported by the evidence. He also contends that a tape recording of telephone conversations he had with his girlfriend while he was in jail was erroneously admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">{\u00b6 2} We conclude that the inference that Bowshier, during and after his arrest, made certain reprehensible statements to the arresting police officer, threatening physical violence, with an awareness that his statements constituted an \u201cattempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder\u201d the officer is manifestly outweighed by the competing inference that Bowshier was aware merely that his outbursts constituted an expression of his fury at having been arrested. Therefore, the finding that Bowshier knowingly made an \u201cattempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder\u201d the officer, an element of the offense of intimidation, is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Because there is a possible inference arising from the evidence that would support the conviction, we conclude that the evidence is sufficient. We also conclude that the tape recording was sufficiently authenticated, so that the trial court did not err in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">{\u00b6 4} The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">{\u00b6 5} In late June 2004, Springfield police officers Brett Bower and Nicholas Holt were dispatched to Bowshier\u2019s apartment on a report of a disturbance. The officers saw large pieces of broken glass in the street in front of the apartment and began kicking them off the street. While they were doing this, they noticed Bonnie Arnold on the street corner, crying. Their efforts to speak to Arnold at that time were rebuffed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">{\u00b6 6} After first speaking to someone in the other half of a double residence, the officers knocked on Bowshier\u2019s door. Bower evidently knew Bowshier already. Bowshier was extremely agitated, was shouting, and appeared to the officers to be intoxicated. He and Arnold, his girlfriend, had been at a bar earlier. Bowshier had left the bar and come home without Arnold, who walked home from the bar. Bowshier indicated that in the ensuing argument, Arnold had broken furniture and glass, \u201cwhich was laying all over the place.\u201d Bowshier told the officers that if Arnold returned, \u201cI\u2019m going to kick her ass, I\u2019m going to kick her out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">{\u00b6 7} The officers persuaded Bowshier that it would be better for him to contact them if Arnold returned to the apartment. The officers then left.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">{\u00b6 8} While parked nearby, completing paperwork, the officers noticed Arnold coming down the street. She went to the cruiser and told the officers that everything was fine, that she was going to Bowshier\u2019s apartment to pick up her shoes and a purse, and that she was going to go and stay at her mother\u2019s. Bower suggested that the officers accompany Arnold, but she declined. She did agree that they could observe from a distance, which they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">{\u00b6 9} Bower described the interaction between Bowshier and Arnold as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cShe started up the stairs to the porch. As she approached the door, the defendant swung the door open, pushed \u2014 half pushed and half struck her in the chest with the palm of his hand in this type of motion. [Indicating.]</p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cShe went backwards down the steps, was able to regain her balance without falling, but did have to take several steps backwards as she went down the steps.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Bower described what happened next as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cQ. Okay. When you saw this happen, what did you do?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cA. I followed my partner, who was already on his way, down the alley left or north on Race Street, crossed North Street, went up the \u2014 went up the steps to the porch. I grabbed Mr. Bowshier. I told him, T warned you. You\u2019re under arrest.\u2019 And at some point he pulled away and retreated back into the house, and we followed him into the house and effected an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cQ. Okay. Once you went into the \u2014 to the house, can you describe how you effectuated that arrest?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cA. Again, he retreated in the house. We had to follow him in there. At that point I grabbed him by his shirt around his chest. He continued to pull away. He pulled to his left. My partner and I followed him. We just went with the motion that he was \u2014 that he was making into the \u2014 into what would be the southwest corner of the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cWhile he\u2019s cursing me out and telling me he\u2019s going to kick my ass and break my skinny ass in half, I put my pepper spray near his face. I said, I\u2019m\u2014 \u2018Stop resisting Teddy, or I\u2019m going to spray you.\u2019 At some point he said, \u2018Fuck you.\u2019 And I sprayed him once with a \u2014 about a half second burst of pepper spray.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cHe had his glasses on. The pepper spray had no effect on his vision or his breathing, but it distracted him enough that we were able to get him cuffed at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cQ. Okay. Once you got Mr. Bowshier cuffed, what happened next, Officer?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cA. More \u2014 more of the same with respect to the cussing and name calling, and he began spitting. Told him several times to stop spitting at me. He didn\u2019t stop so then we placed each one of us on either side of Mr. Bowshier, placed our arms under his arm with our hand over the shoulder to bend him over at the torso so that he couldn\u2019t spit upwards at us.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b129-15\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cQ. Okay. Now, I hate to be indelicate; but it\u2019s part of this case. What type of \u2014 what types of things was Mr. Bowshier saying to you? .</p>\n<p id=\"b129-16\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA. I have some notes over there. Could I refer to them?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-17\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b129-18\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cQ. If you need anything additional to refresh, just \u2014 please continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>{\u00b6 27} \u201cA. Your direct quotations are in the notes; but the substance of the quotations are, \u2018Fuck you, Bowers. I\u2019ll kick your ass, Bowers. If you didn\u2019t have that badge, I\u2019d kick your ass. When I see you out on the street, I\u2019ll shove that badge up your ass.\u2019 And I know that one was very close to \u2018if you want to go man-to-man, I\u2019ll break your skinny ass in half.\u2019 Then there' was a couple more that I can\u2019t\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cQ. Okay. All these were directed to you?</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cA. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">{\u00b6 30} Two other officers transported Bowshier to the jail, but Bower also went to the jail, arriving soon after Bowshier, when the following ensued:</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cQ. Okay. When you arrived there, did you see Mr. Bowshier there?</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cQ. And Mr. Bowshier at that point say anything to you?</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cA. \u2018Fuck you, Bowers. I\u2019m going to kick your ass.\u2019 I believe the \u2014 the quote that I gave you about breaking my skinny ass in half, I believe that one actually occurred at the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cQ. How long were you at the jail \u2014 how long before you arrived at the jail after you left the scene at 604 West North Street?</p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cA. How long did it take to get to the jail from 604?</p>\n<p id=\"b130-14\">{1137} \u201cQ. Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-15\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cA. Five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-16\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cQ. Okay. And how long were you there in Mr. Bowshier\u2019s presence?</p>\n<p id=\"b130-17\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cA. Off and on for \u2014 for probably 45 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-18\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cQ. Okay. At any point did Mr. Bowshier calm down and stop these\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b130-19\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cA. No, sir. He \u2014 he continued, and at one point in front of a female prisoner\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b130-20\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cMR. MARSHALL: Object, Your Honor. It\u2019s not responsive. It\u2019s not relevant for the reasons we discussed earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-21\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. I\u2019ll overrule it with respect to it being nonresponsive; but I will admonish the witness to only testify to what, if anything, the defendant said that was directed to you.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-22\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cTHE WITNESS: What he said or the gestures count as well?</p>\n<p id=\"b130-23\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cTHE COURT: Anything he did or said that was directed to you as opposed to anybody else.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>{\u00b6 47} \u201cA. Okay. What he said accompanied by the gesture, \u2018Come on, faggot. Come on. Suck my dick.\u2019 Pulled his pants down, was not \u2014 and exposed his penis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">{\u00b6 48} Holt also testified concerning Bowshier\u2019s arrest and its aftermath. Holt testified that when Bower first told Bowshier that he was under arrest, Bowshier said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do a fucking thing.\u201d Then, after Bowshier was handcuffed, Bowshier said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do a fucking thing, you guys can\u2019t arrest me for this. I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d And, according to Holt, Bowshier kept trying to spit in Bower\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">{\u00b6 49} On cross-examination, Holt, who had undergone pepper spraying as part of his training, acknowledged that a person who is pepper sprayed \u201cmight start spitting because of the effects of the pepper spray in their mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">{\u00b6 50} Holt testified that outside the house, as Bowshier was being taken into custody, Bowshier \u201cthreatened to \u2014 threatened to beat him [Bower] up several times; threatened to assault him there; and later on that same evening, he did the same thing.\u201d Later, at the jail, according to Holt:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cThe defendant was still highly agitated and angry, cursing, threatening Officer Bower. He made the comment that he would \u2014 if he saw Officer Bower out on the street, that he would snap him like a twig. He was going to beat his ass and take his badge and shove it up his ass. He threatened to assault him numerous times.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cKept saying over and over again calling Officer Bower \u2014 basically, he was yelling at quite a few people in the jail; but mostly directed at Officer Bower stating, you know, telling him he was a \u2014 calling him a faggot and telling him to suck his dick, just making all sorts of crude comments and threatening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">{\u00b6 53} On cross-examination, Holt testified that Bowshier \u201cwas yelling because he was furious about being arrested.\u201d In his report, Holt wrote: \u201cWhen officers arrived at the jail, defendant was still furious about being arrested and repeatedly made dirty comments and threatened physical harm to Officer Bower.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">{\u00b6 54} Robin Carter, a police service clerk at the jail, essentially corroborated Bower\u2019s and Holt\u2019s testimony concerning Bowshier\u2019s demeanor at the jail. Additionally, she testified that from the very moment Bowshier was brought into the jail, before Bower\u2019s subsequent arrival, \u201c[Bowshier] was very irate and swearing, causing all kinds of ruckus and cussing at the deputies and the officers that brought him in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">{\u00b6 55} While at the jail, Bowshier appears to have made several telephone calls to Arnold, which were taped as part of the routine at the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>{\u00b6 56} Bowshier was charged with domestic violence and intimidation. During his jury trial, the state reduced the domestic-violence charge to assault, conceding a failure of proof of the relationship between Bowshier and Arnold required for a domestic violence conviction. The jury found Bowshier not guilty of assault, but guilty of intimidation. Bowshier, who was evidently on federal parole for a 2001 federal drug conviction and had prior convictions for domestic violence, aggravated assault, and possession of marijuana, was sentenced to four years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">{\u00b6 57} From his conviction and sentence, Bowshier appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">{\u00b6 58} Bowshier\u2019s third assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cThe jury verdict should be reversed because it was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">{\u00b6 60} Intimidation, the offense with which Bowshier was charged and of which he was convicted, is proscribed by R.C. 2921.03(A), as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cNo person, knowingly and by force, by unlawful threat of harm to any person or property, or by filing, recording, or otherwise using a materially false or fraudulent writing with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner, shall attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder a public servant * * * in the discharge of the person\u2019s duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cA person acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist.\u201d R.C. 2901.22(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">{\u00b6 63} There is no question that Bowshier threatened Bower with bodily harm in a disgusting and vile manner. There is no evidence that Bower was, in fact, influenced, intimidated, or hindered in the performance of his duties as a result of Bowshier\u2019s threats. The key issue concerns the state\u2019s burden of proving that in uttering his vile remarks, Bowshier knowingly attempted to influence, intimidate, or hinder Bower. This would require that Bowshier knew, when he made his remarks, that they would probably be of a nature that they would constitute an attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder Bower.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">{\u00b6 64} Bowshier did not testify. Nor were any out-of-court statements of Bowshier introduced that would provide direct evidence of his knowledge when making his vile threats of bodily violence upon Bower. Therefore, proof of Bowshier\u2019s knowledge is necessarily circumstantial; it must be inferred what Bowshier knew when he made the remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>{\u00b6 65} One potential inference is that Bowshier understood that his threats of bodily harm against Bower would constitute an attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder Bower in the performance of his duties, presumably by dropping the charges against Bowshier and releasing him, or perhaps by reducing those charges. Another potential inference is that Bowshier understood nothing of the kind, but was instead venting his frustration and rage at having been arrested under circumstances in which, with at least some reasonable basis, he considered himself to have been the victim of his girlfriend\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"> {\u00b6 66} With respect to weight-of-the-evidence reviews on appeal, we have distinguished the weighing of competing inferences from the weighing of credibility, concluding that an appellate court does not need to be as deferential to a finder of fact in reviewing the weight of competing inferences. \u201cThe decision whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses is within the peculiar competence of the factfinder, who has seen and heard the witness. Contrastingly, the decision as to which of several competing inferences, suggested by evidence in the record, should be preferred, is a matter in which an appellate judge is at least equally qualified, by reason and experience, to venture an opinion. Therefore, although this distinction is not set forth in <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Thompkins </em>[ (1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 678 N.E.2d 541], we conclude that a decision by a factfinder as to which testimony to credit, and to what extent, is a decision that is entitled to greater deference than the decision as to how much logical force to assign an inference suggested by that evidence \u2014 in short, how persuasive it is.\u201d <em>State v. Lawson </em>(Aug. 22, 1997), Montgomery App. No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">{\u00b6 67} Significantly, <em>State v. Thompkins, </em>supra, which expanded the traditional scope of appellate weight-of-the-evidence review, involved competing inferences, which are also the key considerations in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">{\u00b6 68} In our view, the inference in the case before us that Bowshier, in threatening Bower with bodily harm, was venting his fury at Bower\u2019s having arrested him, and did not understand that his threats would constitute an attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder Bower, clearly outweighs the contrary inference that Bower understood that his threats were an attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder Bower. In this regard, we note Holt\u2019s characterization, in his report, that Bowshier \u201cwas still furious about being arrested and repeatedly made dirty comments and threatened physical harm to Officer Bower.\u201d We also note that Bowshier\u2019s threats appear to have been made unconditionally. That is, there is nothing in his remarks that we can find to have suggested, either expressly or by implication, that Bowshier would physically harm Bower <em>unless </em>Bower either let him go or went easy on him. An attempt to influence, intimidate or hinder Bower would involve a quid pro quo: let me go or I will hurt you.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>{\u00b6 69} We conclude, then, that this is the rare case in which the factfinder lost its way in weighing the evidence and reached a conclusion that is a miscarriage of justice. See <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717, cited approvingly in <em>State v. Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d 380, 678 N.E.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">{\u00b6 70} Bowshier\u2019s third assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">{\u00b6 71} Bowshier\u2019s second assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cThe evidence was insufficient to convict defendant of intimidation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">{\u00b6 73} For the reasons indicated in Part II, above, we conclude that one possible inference arising from Bowshier\u2019s physical threats to Bower is that Bowshier understood that his threats constituted an attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder Bower in the performance of his official duties. This inference involves a conclusion that Bowshier would understand that his threats would have the effect of attempting to induce Bower to placate Bowshier by either letting Bowshier go, or by going easy on him. Because a mere attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder the public official is sufficient, it is not necessary that the attempt actually had that effect. Because the element of \u201cknowingly\u201d is in the statute, it is necessary that the utterer of the threats shall have understood that his threats would constitute an attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder the public official.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">{\u00b6 74} We conclude that the evidence in the record, together with all reasonable inferences, when viewed in a light most favorable to the state, would permit a reasonable jury to conclude, beyond reasonable doubt, that Bowshier understood that his threats of physical violence constituted an attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder Bower in the performance of his official duties. Accordingly, Bowshier\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">{\u00b6 75} Bowshier\u2019s first assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">{\u00b6 76} \u201cThe court erred by allowing into evidence over defendant\u2019s objection a tape recording of telephone conversations allegedly between defendant and another individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">{\u00b6 77} Bowshier contends that a tape recording of certain conversations, admitted in evidence over his objection, was not sufficiently authenticated. The state offered the tape recording on the theory that the conversations were between Bowshier and Arnold, conducted over the telephone while Bowshier was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>in jail on these charges. Several conversations, recorded on the same day, were played to the jury from a single tape. A number of redactions were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">{\u00b6 78} We have listened to the tape. While there may have been irrelevant and prejudicial statements on the tape pertaining to the assault charge, on which Bowshier was acquitted, the statements pertaining to the intimidation charge were of limited materiality. Although Bowshier acknowledged having made some threatening comments to Bower, his acknowledgment was general and conclusory, and added nothing to the testimony of Bower and Holt concerning the threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">{\u00b6 79} As Bowshier acknowledges, Evid.R. 901(A) provides generally: \u201cThe requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d As Bowshier also acknowledges, Evid.R. 901(B)(5) provides that \u201c[b]y way of illustration only, and not by limitation\u201d the following example of sufficient authentication under the Rule: \u201cIdentification of a voice, whether heard firsthand or through mechanical or electronic transmission or recording, by opinion based upon hearing the voice at any time under circumstances connecting it with the alleged speaker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">{\u00b6 80} Bower testified that the voices on the tape were those of Bowshier and Arnold. Bower had heard Bowshier and Arnold both speak, at the time of the arrest, if not, in Bowshier\u2019s case, even before then. Bowshier complains that Bower had not heard the voices of either Bowshier or Arnold over the telephone, or, for that matter, as recorded over the telephone. In our view, Evid.R. 901 does not require that a witness identifying a voice must have heard that voice in the same medium in order to identify it. If the identifying witness has an opinion, based upon having heard the voice previously, the witness may express it. The circumstances of the witness\u2019s having previously heard the voice, including any differences in those attendant circumstances from the witness\u2019s listening to the voice at the time of identification, affect the weight to be given to the witness\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">{\u00b6 81} In this case, there were circumstances corroborating Bower\u2019s in-court identification of the voices on the tape recording. These circumstances included testimony by a jail official that the telephone calls recorded were made to the telephone number Bowshier had given as his telephone number, from the section of the jail where he was a prisoner, at a time when he was a prisoner. In our view, this evidence, together with Bower\u2019s testimony identifying the voices, is \u201csufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">{\u00b6 82} Bowshier\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">{\u00b6 83} Bowshier\u2019s first and second assignments of error have been overruled; his third assignment of error is sustained. App. R. 12(B) provides that a court of appeals may enter judgment in an appellant\u2019s favor when it concludes that the appellant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. This provision does not apply, because we have had to weigh the evidence to sustain Bowshier\u2019s third assignment of error, so we cannot conclude that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. App. R. 12(C) permits the entry of judgment in an appellant\u2019s favor in a civil case where there has been a bench trial, and the judgment is reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence. Obviously, App.R. 12(C) does not apply, because this was neither a civil case nor a bench trial. \u201cIn all other cases where the court of appeals finds error prejudicial to the appellant, the judgment or final order of the trial court shall be reversed and the cause shall be remanded * * * for further proceedings.\u201d App.R. 12(D). We conclude, therefore, that the extent of the relief we may afford Bowshier, upon sustaining his third assignment of error, is limited to the reversal of the judgment of the trial court and the remand of this cause for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">{\u00b6 84} We find support for this conclusion in <em>State v. Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d 380, 678 N.E.2d 541, the decision expanding the scope of weight-of-the-evidence reviews on appeal. In that case, the Ohio Supreme Court quoted with approval the following passage in <em>Tibbs v. Florida </em>(1982), 457 U.S. 31, 41-43, 102 S.Ct. 2211, 72 L.Ed.2d 652:</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">{\u00b6 85} \u201cAs we suggested just last Term, these policies do not have the same force when a judge disagrees with a jury\u2019s resolution of conflicting evidence and concludes that a guilty verdict is against the weight of the evidence. * * * A reversal on this ground, unlike a reversal based on insufficient evidence, does not mean that acquittal was the only proper verdict. Instead, the appellate court sits as a \u2018thirteenth juror\u2019 and disagrees with the jury\u2019s resolution of the conflicting testimony. This difference of opinion no more signifies acquittal than does a disagreement among the jurors themselves. A deadlocked jury, we consistently have recognized, does not result in an acquittal barring retrial under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Similarly, an appellate court\u2019s disagreement with the jurors\u2019 weighing of the evidence does not require the special deference accorded verdicts of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">{\u00b6 86} \u201cA reversal based on the weight of the evidence, moreover, can occur only after the State both has presented sufficient evidence to support conviction and has persuaded the jury to convict. The reversal simply affords the defendant a second opportunity to seek a favorable judgment. An appellate court\u2019s decision to give the defendant this second chance does not create \u2018an unacceptably high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>risk that the Government, with its superior resources, [will] wear down [the] defendant\u2019 and obtain conviction solely through its persistence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">{\u00b6 87} Earlier, in <em>State v. Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, the Ohio Supreme Court expressly recognized that when an appellate court reverses a judgment on the basis that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, the appellate court sits as a \u201c13th juror.\u201d As a \u201c13th juror,\u201d the appellate court has no power to impose its factual conclusion upon the jury of 12 that returned the original verdict, but merely, by its contrary view of the facts, to hang the jury \u201cof 13,\u201d requiring a retrial (unless, of course, the state decides to dismiss the charge, the defendant decides to plead guilty as charged, or a plea bargain is negotiated).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">{\u00b6 88} The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b137-8\">Brogan and Wolff, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
