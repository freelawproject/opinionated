In denying the application, the division found that the issuance of a liquor permit for that location would substantially interfere with the public decency, sobriety, peace, or good order of the neighborhood. The commission affirmed the division\u2019s application denial, and appellant appealed to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas in accordance with R.C. 119.12. The trial court affirmed the commission\u2019s order. Appellant timely appealed and raises the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. I</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">The Franklin County Common Pleas Court erred when it affirmed the order of the Liquor Control Commission and found that the order was in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. II</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The Franklin County Common Pleas Court erred when it affirmed the order of the Liquor Control Commission and found that the order was supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">{\u00b6 3} In an administrative appeal pursuant to R.C. 119.12, the trial court reviews an order to determine whether it is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with the law. <em>Huffman v. Hair Surgeon, Inc. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 83, 87, 19 OBR 123, 482 N.E.2d 1248. In applying this standard, the court must \u201cgive due deference to the administrative resolution of evidentiary conflicts.\u201d <em>Univ. of Cincinnati v. Conrad </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 108, 111, 17 O.O.3d 65, 407 N.E.2d 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">{\u00b6 4} Reliable, probative, and substantial evidence has been defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAJ\">* * * \u201cReliable\u201d evidence is dependable; that is, it can be confidently trusted. In order to be reliable, there must be a reasonable probability that the evidence is true. * * * \u201cProbative\u201d evidence is evidence that tends to prove the issue in question; it must be relevant in determining the issue. * * * \u201cSubstantial\u201d evidence is evidence with some weight; it must have importance and value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-8\"><em>Our Place, Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 570, 571, 589 N.E.2d 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">{\u00b6 5} On appeal to this court, the standard of review is more limited. Unlike a court of common pleas, a court of appeals does not determine the weight of the evidence. <em>Bd. of Edn. of Rossford Exempted Village School Dist. v. State Bd. of Edn. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 705, 707, 590 N.E.2d 1240. In reviewing the common pleas court\u2019s determination that the commission\u2019s order was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, this court\u2019s role is limited to determining whether the court of common pleas abused its discretion. <em>Roy v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 675, 680, 610 N.E.2d 562. The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. However, on the question of whether the commission\u2019s order was in accordance with the law, this court\u2019s review is plenary. <em>Univ. Hosp., Univ. of Cincinnati College of Medicine v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 339, 343, 587 N.E.2d 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">{\u00b6 6} The division denied the renewal application because it found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlO\">The place for which the permit is sought is so located with respect to the neighborhood that substantial interference with public decency, sobriety, peace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>or good order would result from the renewal of the permit and operation thereunder by the applicant. R.C. 4303.292(A)(2)(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">{\u00b6 7} In rejecting appellant\u2019s renewal application, appellee relied on R.C. 4303.292, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">(A) The division of liquor control may refuse to issue, transfer the ownership of, or renew, and shall refuse to transfer the location of, any retail permit issued under this chapter if it finds either of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">(2) That the place for which the permit is sought:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">(c) Is so located with respect to the neighborhood that substantial interference with public decency, sobriety, peace, or good order would result from the issuance, renewal, transfer of location, or transfer of ownership of the permit and operation under it by the applicant!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">{\u00b6 8} In its first assignment of error, appellant argues that the division should have rejected the city\u2019s objections to appellant\u2019s renewal application because the objections were untimely. Specifically, appellant argues that the city did not meet the 30-day filing requirement contained in R.C. 4303.271(B), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">The legislative authority of the municipal corporation, the board of township trustees, or the board of county commissioners of the county in which a permit premises is located may object to the renewal of a permit issued under sections 4303.11 to 4303.183 [4303.18.3] of the Revised Code for any of the reasons contained in division (A) of section 4303.292 [4303.29.2] of the Revised Code. Any objection shall be made no later than thirty days prior to the expiration of the permit, and the division shall accept the objection if it is postmarked no later than thirty days prior to the expiration of the permit. The objection shall be made by a resolution specifying the reasons for objecting to the renewal and requesting a hearing, but no objection shall be based upon noncompliance of the permit premises with local zoning regulations that prohibit the sale of beer or intoxicating liquor in an area zoned for commercial or industrial uses, for a permit premises that would otherwise qualify for a proper permit issued by the division.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">{\u00b6 9} The city\u2019s objections were postmarked May 2, 2002, but according to appellant, the objections needed to be postmarked by May 1, 2002, in order for them to have been considered by the division. To the contrary, appellee contends that the city\u2019s objections were timely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">{\u00b6 10} The trial court found that it was not necessary to engage in day counting because appellee\u2019s authority to reject a renewal application is not dependent upon an adequate objection by a legislative authority. In so finding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>the trial court relied on <em>Sowders v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(Aug. 4, 2000), Montgomery App. No. 18173, 2000 WL 1063729, discretionary appeal not allowed by 4 Ohio St.3d 143, 4 OBR 386, 447 N.E.2d 118. In <em>Sowders, </em>the appellant Sowders argued that the Harrison Township Trustees\u2019 objection to Sowders\u2019s renewal application for a class D-5 liquor permit was not timely filed as required by R.C. 4303.271(B). The trial court declined to reach the question of whether or not the objections were timely filed, but instead found that the trustees had failed to specify the reasons for objection as required by R.C. 4303.271(B). Therefore, the trial court concluded that the objections should not be considered. However, the trial court went on to hold that even without the objection there was sufficient evidence presented for the commission to conclude that there was reliable, probative, and substantial evidence to support the commission\u2019s decision to deny the renewal application.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">{\u00b6 11} On appeal, Sowders argued that because the objections were excluded, the objection hearing should not have even taken place. The appellate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">Aside from rejecting Sowders\u2019 renewal application based upon the Trustees\u2019 objection, however, the Division rejected Sowders\u2019 renewal application for \u201cgood cause,\u201d an entirely different ground. Because the Division rejected Sowders\u2019 renewal application for an independent reason aside from the Trustees\u2019 objection, the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the Trustees\u2019 objection would not have precluded the Division from rejecting Sowders\u2019 application for \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>Tiger Invest. of Columbus Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 316, 318[, 8 OBR 424], 457 N.E.2d 320, 323; <em>Leo G. Keffalas, Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1991), 74 Ohio App.3d 650, 652, 600 N.E.2d 275, 276. Further, the Liquor Control Commission could have conducted its own investigation and called an evidentiary hearing without an objection from the Trustees to investigate whether \u201cgood cause\u201d existed from the denial of Sowders\u2019 renewal application. See <em>Triplett Grille, Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(Dec. 12, 1996), Franklin App. No. 95APE06-712, unreported[, 1996 WL 715472], We understand that Sowders is arguing that because the Trustees\u2019 objection was not adequate, the objection hearing before the Liquor Control Commission should not have taken place, and thus all of the evidence from that hearing should have been excluded from consideration. We do not agree with such argument, however. R.C. 4303.271(A) provides that the Division can reject a renewal application for a reason independent of a legislative authority\u2019s objection to such renewal. Although the trial court found that the Trustees\u2019 objection, which triggered the objection hearing in this case, was inadequate, we do not believe that the law enforcement evidence which was presented at such hearing should have been excluded from consideration. We so conclude because the Division\u2019s authority to reject a renewal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>application is not dependent upon an adequate objection by a legislative authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">{\u00b6 12} As found by the trial court in the case before us, <em>Sowders </em>has been approved and followed by this court in <em>Ossie, Inc. v. Ohio State Liquor Control Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-1209, 2003-Ohio-2729, 2003 WL 21234925, and <em>Marciano v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-943, 2003-Ohio-2023, 2003 WL 1908247.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>Ossie, </em>the Cleveland City Council objected to the permit holder\u2019s renewal application, but Withdrew its objections the day before the commission\u2019s hearing on the matter. On appeal, the permit holder argued that when the city withdrew its objections, good cause to deny renewal of the liquor permit no longer existed. In rejecting the permit holder\u2019s argument, this court, citing <em>Sowders, </em>stated, \u201cPursuant to R.C. 4303.271(A), a liquor permit renewal can be denied for reasons independent of a legislative authority\u2019s objections to such renewal.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 20. This court found that the division did not deny the renewal application simply because the city objected to renewal of the liquor permit, but rather the division denied the renewal for good cause as established under R.C. 4303.292(A)(1)(b) and 4303.292(A)(2)(c). Finding that the grounds cited by the division for rejecting the renewal application were supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>Marciano, </em>this court was faced with a similar scenario as that in <em>Ossie </em>when the city of Youngstown withdrew its objections to the permit holder\u2019s renewal application for a liquor permit prior to the commission\u2019s hearing on the matter. This court noted that the grounds on which the division may deny a liquor-permit renewal are set forth in R.C. 4303.292, and if any of the grounds the division cites for rejection are supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, the commission\u2019s decision must be upheld. Id. at \u00b6 19, citing <em>Maggiore v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(Mar. 29, 1996), Franklin App. No. 95APE06-713, 1996 WL 367268. Again, citing <em>Sowders, </em>this court reiterated that pursuant to R.C. 4303.271(A), a liquor-permit renewal can be denied for reasons independent of a legislative authority\u2019s objection to the renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">{\u00b6 15} Appellant is arguing, as the appellant did in <em>Sowders, </em>that because of the inadequate objection, the hearing before the division should not have taken place, and the city should not have been able to present evidence in support of its objections. Like the court in <em>Sowders, </em>we do not agree with appellant\u2019s argument. Pursuant to R.C. 4303.271(A), the division can reject a renewal application for a reason independent of a legislative authority\u2019s objection to the renewal. Further, the commission could have conducted its own investigation and called for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>an evidentiary hearing without any objection from the city. Therefore, we find that the trial court did not err in determining that it was not necessary to engage in day counting to determine whether or not the city\u2019s objections were timely because the division\u2019s authority to reject a renewal application is not dependent upon an adequate objection by a legislative authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">{\u00b6 16} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">{\u00b6 17} In its second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred when it affirmed the order of the commission and found that the order was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. The permit-renewal application was rejected because the division, and ultimately the commission, found that the issuance of a liquor permit at the applied location would substantially interfere with the public decency, sobriety, peace, or good order of the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">{\u00b6 18} The evidence presented by the division at the commission\u2019s hearing included the testimony of three Dayton police officers. While appellant admits that the testimony of all three officers indicated that Asylum was responsible for hundreds of police runs, appellant argues that the information and documents presented do not corroborate the testimony of the officers. Specifically, appellant takes issue with the division\u2019s exhibits and contends that despite the officers\u2019 testimony, the reports do not establish whether it was appellant, appellant\u2019s employees, patrons, or other individuals who were responsible for the incidents documented on exhibits showing the police dispatches to appellant\u2019s address. In support of its position, appellant relies on <em>Marsh v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm., </em>Franklin County C.P. No. 95CVF08-5230, in which the trial court found that even though the division attempted to show that over 200 police runs had been made to a liquor establishment, when viewed more closely, the evidence did not relate to the permit premises. Appellant also relies on <em>Marwan, Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1994), 93 Ohio App.3d 229, 638 N.E.2d 135, and <em>Quaranta v. Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1983), 17 Ohio App.3d 156, 17 OBR 287, 478 N.E.2d 825, for the proposition that it is improper to consider the rowdiness and actions of patrons of a permit premises that are unrelated to the applicant\u2019s operation of the premises and sale of liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">{\u00b6 19} We find no merit to appellant\u2019s argument. Initially, we note that <em>Marsh </em>is a decision from a court of common pleas and is not binding on this court. Second, <em>Quaranta </em>was decided <em>prior to </em>the Ohio legislature\u2019s amendment to R.C. 4303.292(A)(2)(c), which now expressly provides that the division may refuse to renew any retail permit exclusively on the basis of environmental conditions and does not require that any control or fault be shown on the part of the permit holder. Further, when analyzing R.C. 4303.292(A)(2)(c), courts focus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>on the location of the permit business, not on the person who operates the business. See <em>Kamm\u2019s Korner Tavern v. Liquor Control Comm. </em>(May 24, 2001), Franklin App. No. 00AP-1423, 2001 WL 548726 (distinguishing <em>Marwan). </em>See, also, <em>Harbi Abuzahrieh &amp; Co., Inc. v. Liquor Control Comm. </em>(July 22, 1999), Cuyahoga App. No. 74556, 1999 WL 528503.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">{\u00b6 20} In fact, this court recently stated in <em>2971, Inc. v. Liquor Control Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-1188, 2005-Ohio-3372, 2005 WL 1532397, \u00b6 9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">When interpreting R.C. 4303.292(A)(2)(c), courts focus on the location of the liquor premises rather than the employees who operate the business. <em>Marciano v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-943, 2003-Ohio-2023[, 2003 WL 1908247], at \u00b6 28. The causation requirement for rejecting an application for renewal based on R.C. 4303.292(A)(2)(c) is \u201csome connection between the permit premises and adverse effects upon the surrounding area.\u201d <em>Marciano, </em>at \u00b6 29; see, also, <em>Right Now Mini Market, Inc., v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-914, 2005-Ohio-1125[, 2005 WL 590707], at \u00b6 12. Thus, the commission need not demonstrate that the permit holder\u2019s actions were directly related to the conduct of its patrons. \u201cEven if other influences have asserted a negative effect on the area, outside of appellant\u2019s control, this can only underline the importance to the city and the commission of maintaining strict compliance with liquor control laws in the vicinity.\u201d <em>Harbi Abuzahrieh, </em>supra.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">{\u00b6 21} During the commission\u2019s hearing, Lieutenant Patrick Welsh of the Dayton Police Department testified about conduct that he has witnessed on or about the permit premises. Welsh described witnessing a sexual act between two males in the back doorway, damaged cars, \u201cjust about every kind of drug, weapons, [and] disorderly, drunk, out-of-control people.\u201d Welsh also described disturbances involving as many as 300 to 400 people at a time in the parking lot or in the immediate vicinity of the permit premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">{\u00b6 22} When asked how many officers might be called to the permit premises, Welsh related that on Saturday nights a minimum of six to eight officers must be called to assist in disturbances and that as many as 20 officers have had to respond. Welsh also related that it is not uncommon to have to barricade the street and redirect traffic because of the people \u201ctaking over the street.\u201d Because of the coverage needed at the permit premises, Welsh testified that additional officers had to be pulled from various districts throughout the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">{\u00b6 23} After testifying that he had feared for his safety and his life while at the permit premises, Welsh stated that when a canine handler is on duty, they take a dog out to help with crowd control, and that officers now have access to tasers as well. Additionally, Welsh stated that they have had \u201cextremely violent, large crowds there\u201d and that they have had officers with bean-bag shotguns come out.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>{\u00b6 24} Officer Edmund Trick of the Dayton Police Department testified that he was assigned to the district where the permit premises is located from the time it opened until he left in 2003, but that he is called almost every Saturday night to assist at the permit premises. Trick described making numerous arrests and responding to numerous calls regarding assaults, property crimes, and drug offenses. Trick also described instances in which there were large disturbances involving 300 to 400 people out in the streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">{\u00b6 25} Dayton Police Detective Michelle Moser testified and identified summaries of police logs and incident reports. Moser related that hundreds of police runs were made to the permit premises for calls on fights, shots fired, robberies, disorderly persons, assaults, and armed robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 26} Given the officers\u2019 testimony, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion when it found that reliable, probative, and substantial evidence supported the commission\u2019s order to reject appellant\u2019s renewal applications for class D-5-6 liquor permits based upon R.C. 4303.292(A)(2)(c). See <em>2971, Inc., </em>supra (finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in affirming the commission\u2019s denial of a renewal application for liquor permits when there was sufficient evidence of numerous unlawful and violent acts committed nearby and adverse effects on law enforcement); <em>M &amp; M Grill, Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm., </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-1244, 2005-Ohio-2431, 2005 WL 1177922 (holding that there was no abuse of discretion for the trial court to rely on evidence of the adverse effects of the premises and its patrons on law enforcement pursuant to R.C. 4303.292(A)(2)(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 27} Appellant attempts to focus this court\u2019s attention on the fact that for one of the calendar years at issue, only three misdemeanor convictions resulted, despite there being over 100 police runs made to the permit premises. This court has previously found that evidence of a high volume of police calls can cause a strain on police resources, regardless of whether there were resulting convictions. See <em>M &amp; M Grill, </em>supra. We recognize that the sheer volume of police calls cannot be the touchstone for determinations under R.C. 4303.292(A)(2)(c), but the severity of the incidents underlying the police calls must also be considered relevant. See id. Here, substantial evidence was presented by three members of the city\u2019s police force regarding the permit premises\u2019 adverse effect on the surrounding area, as well as the additional strain it put on police resources. The record before the commission amply supports a finding that the location of the permit premises substantially interferes with public decency, sobriety, peace, or good order pursuant to R.C. 4303.292(A)(2)(c). Thus, the evidence reveals that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the commission\u2019s decision to be supported by rehable, probative, and substantial evidence and to be in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">{\u00b6 29} For the foregoing reasons, appellant\u2019s two assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b546-6\">Petree, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b546-7\">Bowman, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
