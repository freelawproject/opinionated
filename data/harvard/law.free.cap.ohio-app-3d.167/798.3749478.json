And taking isn\u2019t limited to physical confiscation \u2014 it can also be by impairing the property\u2019s value by, as here, cutting off access.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">{\u00b6 2} In this case, the city of Cincinnati has denied access to a piece of property, leaving it landlocked \u2014 and not just figuratively, but literally: the only access would be by boat. Cincinnati not being Waterworld, boat access is not sufficient. Though the city makes a series of bizarre arguments attempting to support its position, its legal position is as wet as the access it would leave the property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">\n<em>I. Access by River Only</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b837-15\">{\u00b6 3} Relators Hilltop Basic Resources, Inc. and Queensgate Terminals, L.L.C. have brought a verified petition for a writ of mandamus concerning a 30-acre <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>piece of riverfront property along River Road in Cincinnati. They contend that respondent city of Cincinnati\u2019s refusal to allow them to have access from the River Road property to a public road is a taking of their property interests. They ask this court to order the city to bring an eminent-domain action to value the interests taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">{\u00b6 4} In a previous decision on the city\u2019s motion to dismiss, the city contended that Hilltop and Queensgate had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, thus precluding them from seeking mandamus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But we ruled that Hilltop and Queensgate could not have appealed the city\u2019s denial of a curb-cut/driveway permit to an entity named the Sidewalk Board of Appeals or to the court of common pleas.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And we held that mandamus is proper to compel a public body to bring appropriation proceedings for an involuntary taking of private property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">{\u00b6 5} The parties are now again before us on dueling summary-judgment motions. Hilltop and Queensgate argue that the city has substantially and unreasonably interfered with their right of access to the only public street adjoining the property by denying their request for a curb-cut permit. Hilltop and Queensgate believe that this denial requires the city to begin appropriation proceedings to determine the value of their property interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">{\u00b6 6} The city contends that Hilltop and Queensgate have not proved that they have a right of access to River Road because Hilltop has not taken any steps to develop the property. The city contends that this lack of development and the lack of reliance by Hilltop or Queensgate on the current grade of River Road have extinguished any right of Hilltop or Queensgate to the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">{\u00b6 7} Also, the city claims that (1) \u201cingress and egress\u201d or \u201caccess\u201d to a public roadway is not synonymous with vehicular access and (2) the city\u2019s plan to create a retaining wall along River Road does not amount to a compensable taking. Instead, the city asserts that since Hilltop currently has another access to a public road, albeit through a license agreement with an adjoining property owner, there is no substantial or unreasonable interference with access to River Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">{\u00b6 8} Lawyers can make an argument for any proposition. We understand it\u2019s their job. Here, the city argues two legally untenable positions. The city\u2019s brief even reads well; but the city\u2019s arguments are fallacious.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Hilltop and Queensgate have a clear legal right to compel the city to begin appropriation proceedings. The law in Ohio is clear: \u201cAn owner of a parcel of real property has a right to access public streets or highways on which the land abuts. Therefore, any governmental action that substantially or unreasonably interferes with this right constitutes a taking of private property within the meaning of Section 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, the city\u2019s denial of Hilltop\u2019s and Queensgate\u2019s curb-cut/driveway permit leaves Hilltop and Queensgate with no adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. The city must bring an appropriation action \u2014 thus the writ of mandamus must issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">\n<em>II. The Proposed Project</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">{\u00b6 10} Hilltop acquired approximately 30 acres of riverfront property along River Road, west of Cincinnati\u2019s central business district, in 1991. Because the property is separated from River Road by two rail lines and does not have any other access to a public roadway, Hilltop acquired a fee simple interest in the ground under the railroads at the intersection of River Road and State Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">{\u00b6 11} In 1995, Hilltop applied to the city for a building permit, which included a proposed curb-cut and driveway onto River Road at the intersection of River Road and State Avenue. The city approved the building permit in 1996. But Hilltop did not develop the property then and let the permit expire.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">{\u00b6 12} In 2001, the city and Hilltop (together) applied for a federal grant to develop the River Road property as an \u201cintermodal truck/barge/train facility\u201d that would use the access onto River Road at the State Avenue intersection for heavy truck traffic. The city\u2019s application asserted that one reason for the grant request was to \u201copen the essentially land locked 30-acre site for development as a commercial intermodal facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">{\u00b6 13} In May 2004, Hilltop and Queensgate agreed to a \u201cLease Agreement with Purchase Option.\u201d Queensgate intended to develop the River Road property as an intermodal barge-to-rail facility that would serve as part of a broader national transportation network. Queensgate already is developing a 2,500-acre site in central Ohio for a national distribution and manufacturing center marketed by the state of Ohio and Miller-Valentine Realty.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">\n<em>III. The City Switches</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">{\u00b6 14} A year later, Queensgate asked the city about the permits necessary to begin to develop the River Road property. In responding, the city told Queens-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>gate and Hilltop about the planned Waldvogel Viaduct Improvement Project. The city had evidently switched sides and was no longer cooperating on the intermodal project.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">\n<em>IV. The Waldvogel Viaduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">{\u00b6 15} The Edward N. Waldvogel Memorial Viaduct is a 2,690-foot bridge in Lower Price Hill that carries more than 50,000 vehicles a day. The Waldvogel Viaduct is an important connection to the central business district for many of Cincinnati\u2019s western neighborhoods and suburbs. Although the viaduct is a \u201ccritical link in the regional transportation system,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it (1) has the lowest bridge sufficiency rating in Hamilton County (3.3 out of 100), (2) has a 16-ton weight restriction, (3) has poor geometry, and (4) does not meet current design standards. The city has thus developed plans to remove the deficient structure and replace it with a bridge that would meet current Ohio Department of Transportation design standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">{\u00b6 16} To do so, the city\u2019s Transportation and Engineering Department intends to elevate River Road adjoining the River Road property by seven feet and to build a retaining wall along River Road that would eliminate the River Road property\u2019s only access to a public roadway. Queensgate and Hilltop assert that the city developed these plans in the fall of 2004, but failed to alert them.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">{\u00b6 IT} At a meeting with the city\u2019s Traffic Engineer, the Director of the Engineering Department, and representatives from the City Solicitor\u2019s Office, the city told Queensgate and Hilltop that the city would never permit them to use the River Road access \u2014 in effect killing the deal and thwarting plans for developing a major transportation facility. In August 2005, Hilltop tried to save the contract to sell the property to Queensgate by reapplying for the curb-cut/driveway permit the city had granted in 1996. But in September 2005, the city denied the permit application.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">\n<em>V. Motion to Dismiss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">{\u00b6 18} In the first hearing before us on the city\u2019s motion to dismiss and then subsequently in its answer to Hilltop and Queensgate\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus, the city claimed that Hilltop and Queensgate failed to state a claim because they had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. The city argued that Hilltop and Queensgate could have appealed the city\u2019s decision denying them a permit for curb-cut and driveway construction to either (1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>city\u2019s Sidewalk Board of Appeals, under Cincinnati Municipal Code (\u201cCMC\u201d) 721-155, or (2) the court of common pleas under R.C. 2506.01. But as our previous decision in this case explained, Hilltop and Queensgate could not appeal to the Sidewalk Board of Appeals because that board did not have jurisdiction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Further, Hilltop and Queensgate could not appeal to the common pleas court under R.C. 2506.01, since there was no administrative decision made in a quasi-judicial proceeding from which to appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The city has now abandoned this argument for purposes of its summary-judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">\n<em>VI. Both Sides Want Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">{\u00b6 19} Summary judgment should be granted only when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can only come to a conclusion adverse to the nonmoving party, when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of demonstrating that no genuine issue of material fact exists. Once it has satisfied its burden, the nonmoving party has a reciprocal burden to set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">{\u00b6 20} Hilltop and Queensgate assert that there is no genuine issue about any material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law because (1) the city\u2019s refusal to permit a curb-cut and driveway is an involuntary taking of their property without compensation in violation of Section 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and (2) the city must bring appropriation proceedings to determine the value of the property interests taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">{\u00b6 21} The city opposes Hilltop and Queensgate\u2019s motion, but also contends that it is entitled to summary judgment because Hilltop and Queensgate do not have an absolute right of access to River Road and therefore are not entitled to compensation for a taking of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">\n<em>VII. Mandamus Appropriate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">{\u00b6 22} A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy. Mandamus is a writ that commands the \u201cperformance of an act which the law specially enjoins as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For a writ of mandamus to issue, Hilltop and Queensgate need to establish (1) a clear legal right to compel the city to commence an appropriation action, (2) a corresponding legal duty for the city to institute such an action, and (3) the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">{\u00b623} The Ohio Constitution provides that \u201c[pjrivate property shall ever be held inviolate, but subservient to the public welfare. * * * [Wjhere private property shall be taken for public use, a compensation therefor shall first be made in money * * * and such compensation shall be assessed by a jury, without deduction for benefits to any property of the owner.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Similarly, the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that private property shall not \u201cbe taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">{\u00b6 24} To establish a taking, a landowner must show a substantial or unreasonable interference with a property right.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That interference may involve the actual physical taking of real property, or it may include impairing an intangible interest.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">{\u00b6 25} One of the elemental rights of real property ownership is the right of access to abutting public roadways.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018An owner of property abutting on a public highway possesses, as a matter of law, not only the right to the use of the highway in common with other members of the public, but also a <em>private right or easement </em>for the purpose of ingress and egress to and from his property, which latter right may not be taken away or destroyed or substantially impaired without compensation therefor.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>{\u00b6 26} Based on the affidavits and stipulations of both the city and Hilltop and Queensgate, Hilltop and Queensgate have a clear legal right to compel the city to begin appropriation proceedings. The law in Ohio is clear: \u201cAn owner of a parcel of real property has a right to access public streets or highways on which the land abuts. Therefore, any governmental action that substantially or unreasonably interferes with this right constitutes a taking of private property within the meaning of Section 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Here, with the city\u2019s denial of Hilltop and Queensgate\u2019s curb-cut/driveway permit, the city proposes to landlock the 30 acres, not just legally, but actually \u2014 by making the property inaccessible from land.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">\n<em>VIII. No Requirement that Property Be \u201cDeveloped\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">{\u00b6 27} The city, relying on the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State ex rel. OTR v. Columbus, </em>and in particular Justice Cook\u2019s dissent, contends that there can be a compensable taking only when the government has established a street grade, a property owner has subsequently developed the land in reliance upon that grade, and a change in that grade has affected the property owner\u2019s existing right of access to the property.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The city argues that the timing of the roadway construction and pre-existing development of abutting properties are necessary elements in determining whether a compensable taking has occurred. When a party relies on a <em>dissent, </em>but the <em>majority </em>decision is binding on us, its argument is looking bleak.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">{\u00b6 28} In <em>State ex rel. McKay v. Kauer, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court stated that \u201c[wjhere the grade of a street constituting a part of a state highway has been established and the owner of the property abutting thereon has improved his property in reliance upon and in conformity to such grade, and thereafter a highway improvement is made upon such street * * * to such extent that there is no physical access to or from the property to the street, the owner of such property suffers a \u2018taking\u2019 of his property and is entitled to compensation by way of damages from the state to the extent of his loss, even though no part of the physical property is taken or disturbed.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">{\u00b6 29} The city has grasped at this language, insisting that a property owner must have \u201cimproved his property in reliance upon and in conformity to such grade.\u201d But the city\u2019s reliance on this language, further misunderstood by</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Justice Cook\u2019s dissent in <em>OTR, </em>is misplaced. Both the city and Justice Cook\u2019s dissent attempt to engraft the \u201cimproved\u201d language onto takings jurisprudence. But both share a misperception. <em>McKay </em>simply stands for the sensible proposition that an owner who develops property in reliance upon the city\u2019s grading of the roadway is entitled to compensation if the city changes the grade to the detriment of the development. This holding in no way <em>requires </em>that the property be developed if the city cuts off access entirely!</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">{\u00b6 30} In fact, a careful reading of the <em>OTR </em>decision demonstrates that the Ohio Supreme Court had disapproved as a \u201c \u2018judicial fiat\u2019 an arbitrary distinction between developed and undeveloped rights of access.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">{\u00b6 31} The court has instead held that \u201c[a]n owner of a parcel of real property has a right to access public streets or highways on which the land abuts. Therefore, any governmental action that substantially or unreasonably interferes with this right constitutes a taking * * * within the meaning of Section 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the United States <em>Constitution.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">{\u00b6 32} This language is unambiguous. <em>OTR </em>does not make a distinction between property owners who have developed their land and those who have not. The city\u2019s argument would undermine the rights of all property owners who have yet to develop their land \u2014 the government could landlock undeveloped property with impunity. So a parcel with an outhouse would be protected, but not one without. To so state the issue is to see the result \u2014 undeveloped land is no less private property than developed land.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\"><em>IX. Another Feckless Argument </em>\u2014 Ingress <em>and Egress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">{\u00b6 33} The city also maintains that merely having \u201cingress and egress\u201d or \u201caccess\u201d to an abutting public road is not synonymous with a property owner\u2019s necessarily having a driveway or vehicular access, relying on the Ninth Appellate District\u2019s decision in <em>Spencer v. Myers.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">{\u00b6 34} In <em>Myers, </em>the property owners bought a lot on which the garage and driveway extended over the property line and encroached on the abutting public road.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> When the village attempted to improve the street, the property owners refused to move their garage and driveway. The village then sought a declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>tion that the disputed portion of that road was a publicly dedicated street and that the property owners had not acquired the disputed portion by adverse possession. The property owners counterclaimed that they had adversely possessed the disputed portion of the street and demanded compensation for any land taken by eminent domain for road improvements. The Ninth Appellate District commented that \u201c \u2018ingress and egress\u2019 does not refer to one\u2019s ability to proceed into property by means of a driveway, but rather to access to public streets from one\u2019s property.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> That court held that the property owners were not entitled to compensation for the loss of their garage and driveway, since they had no right to have the garage and driveway on public property.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">{\u00b6 35} The city seems to contend that this dicta holds that property owners are not necessarily entitled to a driveway or vehicular access to their property. It again shows that lawyers who have an incentive to do so can read any case to say anything. We have to believe that the court meant to say only that <em>these </em>property owners did not have a right to <em>that </em>driveway, since it was built upon public property. No one here is asking to build a garage on city property. They just want access to their own property.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">{\u00b6 36} We instead believe that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>OTR </em>and <em>State ex rel. Merritt v. </em>Linzell<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> have unambiguous holdings \u2014 \u201cAn owner of property abutting on a public highway possesses, as a matter of law, not only the right to use of the highway in common with other members of the public, but also a private right or easement for the purpose of ingress and egress to and from his property, which latter right may not be taken away or destroyed or substantially impaired without compensation therefor.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">{\u00b6 37} While the property owners in <em>Myers </em>may have had other outlets for budding a driveway onto the abutting public roads, in the present case, Hilltop and Queensgate have no such ability. The property in question borders the Ohio River to the south, River Road to the north, and abutting property owners to the east and west. Without a curb-cut and driveway onto River Road, Hilltop and Queensgate would be left with 30 acres of landlocked property.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">\n<em>X. Circuity of Travel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">{\u00b6 38} The city does not believe that Hilltop and Queensgate will be landlocked because of the denial of the curb-cut/driveway permit. Instead, it points to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>license agreement that Hilltop has secured from an adjacent property owner. Again, the city cites an inapposite case for a goofy proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">{\u00b6 39} The city relies on the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>State ex rel. Preschool Dev., Ltd. v. Springboro </em>for the proposition the mere circuity of travel does not warrant a finding of a compensable taking.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In that case, Preschool Development had sought a writ of mandamus to force the city of Springboro to bring an appropriation action after Springboro had eliminated a curb-cut in front of Preschool Development\u2019s property. While Preschool Development no longer had direct access to S.R. 73, Springboro granted Preschool Development and the public a permanent easement between Preschool Development\u2019s property and S.R. 73 through an adjacent shopping center. The court held that even though drivers were required to negotiate an additional turn and travel an extra 300 feet, Preschool Development did not incur a compensable taking.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The court concluded that the mere circuity of travel, or lack of a straightforward alternative, did not substantially or unreasonably interfere with Preschool Development\u2019s property rights.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">{\u00b6 40} In this case, the city is correct that when Hilltop purchased the property in 1991, it secured a license from an adjacent property owner. This license allowed Hilltop to have access to the property by crossing over land owned by other parties. But this license agreement is revocable at will by the abutting property owner upon five days\u2019 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">{\u00b6 41} Then, the circuity of travel would be to go by boat. Or perhaps waterskis?</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">{\u00b6 42} We cannot accept the city\u2019s argument. To do so would put Hilltop and Queensgate at the mercy of an abutting property owner, who at a whim could halt Hilltop and Queensgate\u2019s access to the property within five days. This is wholly distinguishable from the permanent easement granted to Preschool Development. If the license here is revoked, which it can be on five days\u2019 notice, Hilltop is left with boat access only \u2014 not just a bit longer driveway. We venture to guess that no one would build a barge-to-rail facility on the strength of a revocable license.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">\n<em>XI. Writ Granted</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">{\u00b6 43} Despite the extraordinary nature of a writ of mandamus, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201c \u2018[mjandamus is the appropriate action to compel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>public authorities to institute appropriation proceedings where an involuntary taking of private property is alleged.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In this case, Hilltop and Queensgate have a clear legal right to compel the city to begin appropriation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">{\u00b6 44} We hold that the city has substantially and unreasonably interfered with Hilltop and Queensgate\u2019s right of access to the abutting public roadway, River Road, in violation of Section 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. And the city\u2019s denial of Hilltop and Queensgate\u2019s curb-cut/driveway permit leaves Hilltop and Queensgate with no adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. Thus the city has a corresponding legal duty to institute an appropriation action.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">{\u00b6 45} The writ of mandamus is issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Writ issued.</p>\n<judges id=\"b847-8\">Doan, P.J., and Sundermann, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-10\">.
