We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">{\u00b6 2} In August 2001, Carla Calhoun phoned the Middletown police and reported that a \u201ccreepy\u201d man, unknown to her, was repeatedly driving up and down her street. Calhoun feared that the man was stalking her young daughter. An officer responded and stopped appellant. The officer admonished appellant to stay away from the Calhouns. In the following several years, appellant would frequently park outside the Calhoun residence and on one occasion lowered his car window to speak with Calhoun\u2019s daughter. Several of these incidents were reported to the police, while numerous incidents went unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-13\">{\u00b6 3} In early 2004, the Calhouns moved to a different residence. On March 7, 2004, while riding her bike home, Calhoun\u2019s daughter stopped to fix her shoestring, which had become caught in a pedal. Appellant got out of his car, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>approached her, and asked where she lived. She did not respond but got back on her bike and rode home. On March 25, 2004, Carla Calhoun again observed appellant\u2019s car parked across the street from her apartment, as she was leaving the building. She saw that appellant was sitting in the automobile. Calhoun called the Middletown police on her cellular telephone to report appellant\u2019s presence. Appellant observed Calhoun place the call and drove off. Calhoun provided the responding officer with a description of appellant\u2019s vehicle. He was stopped a few moments later in the same neighborhood and arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant was charged with menacing by stalking, a violation of Middle-town Codified Ordinance 636.045, and the matter proceeded to trial. Appellant was found guilty and sentenced accordingly. He appeals, raising a single assignment of error in which he alleges that the conviction is contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">{\u00b6 5} When reviewing whether a conviction is supported by the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court \u201c \u2018review[s] the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, [and] considers the credibility of witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Hancock, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, 840 N.E.2d 1032, \u00b6 39, quoting <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. The relevant inquiry is \u201cwhether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the [trier of fact] clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed.\u201d Id.; see, also, <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant was convicted of menacing by stalking, a violation of Middle-town Codified Ordinance 636.045(a)(1), which states that \u201c[n]o person, by engaging in a pattern of conduct, shall knowingly cause another to believe that the offender will cause physical harm to the other person or cause mental distress to the other person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant first contends that the evidence did not demonstrate that appellant\u2019s actions caused mental distress. Middletown Codified Ordinance 636.045(a)(4)(A) defines mental distress as \u201cany mental illness or condition that involves some temporary substantial incapacity or mental illness or condition that would normally require psychiatric treatment.\u201d However, whether treatment is sought is not determinative; rather, it is the duty of the trier of fact to determine whether a victim suffered mental distress as a result of the offender\u2019s actions. <em>State v. Rucker </em>(2002),0 Butler App. No. CA2001-04-076, 2002 WL 83731. In making this determination, the trial court \u201cmay rely on its knowledge and experience in determining whether mental distress has been caused.\u201d <em>Smith v. Wunsch, </em>162 Ohio App.3d 21, 2005-Ohio-3498, 832 N.E.2d 757, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Calhoun testified that appellant\u2019s actions made her feel \u201cnervous,\u201d \u201cfrightened,\u201d and \u201cvery scared.\u201d Because of appellant\u2019s actions, Calhoun was more protective of her daughter. She required her daughter to phone whenever arriving or departing from visiting friends, and Calhoun would wait outside her home for her daughter\u2019s return. The officer who responded to the March 25, 2004 incident testified that Calhoun and her daughter were \u201cupset,\u201d \u201cworried,\u201d and \u201cscared.\u201d Given these particular facts, we conclude that the trial court did not err in finding that appellant caused Calhoun to suffer mental distress. Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, his actions did in fact cause Calhoun mental distress \u201cgreater than the alleged victim would have experienced had she seen any other stranger on the street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant next contends that the evidence fails to demonstrate that he engaged in a \u201cpattern of conduct closely related in time.\u201d In support of his argument, appellant points out that a period of years elapsed between the first incident in 2001 and the incident leading to his arrest, which occurred in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\"> {\u00b6 10} Pursuant to Middletown Codified Ordinance 636.045(a)(4)(D), a pattern of conduct \u201cmeans two or more actions or incidents closely related in time, whether or not there has been a prior conviction based on any of those actions or incidents.\u201d Because the statute does not specifically state what constitutes incidents \u201cclosely related in time,\u201d whether the incidents in question were \u201cclosely related in time\u201d should be resolved by the trier of fact \u201cconsidering the evidence in the context of all the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>State v. Honeycutt, </em>Montgomery App. No. 19004, 2002-Ohio-3490, 2002 WL 1438648, \u00b6 26, citing <em>State v. Dario </em>(1995), 106 Ohio App.3d 232, 238, 665 N.E.2d 759. In determining what constitutes a pattern of conduct for purposes of R.C. 2903.211(D)(1), courts must take every action into consideration even if, as appellant argues, \u201csome of the person\u2019s actions may not, in isolation, seem particularly threatening.\u201d <em>Guthrie v. Long, </em>Franklin App. No. 04AP-913, 2005-Ohio-1541, 2005 WL 737402, \u00b6 12; <em>Miller v. Francisco, </em>Lake App. No. 2002-L-097, 2003-Ohio-1978, 2003 WL 1904066, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">{\u00b6 11} In the present case, the incidents spanned a number of years, beginning in 2001. Four incidents were reported to the police over a period of four years, and Calhoun testified that there were \u201cnumerous\u201d other incidents that she did not report. The most recent two incidents both occurred in March 2004. These two incidents considered alone are, by definition, a \u201cpattern of conduct\u201d as contemplated by Section 636.045(a)(4)(D) and viewed in the context of appellant\u2019s actions over the course of the prior four years are overwhelming evidence of his pattern of conduct. Accord <em>Noah v. Brillhart, </em>Wayne App. No. 02CA0050, 2003-Ohio-2421, 2003 WL 21078077, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Finally, appellant argues that the state failed to demonstrate that he knowingly committed the acts that constitute the pattern of conduct. Appellant alleges that there are reasonable and innocent explanations for each of the incidents in which he appeared in the vicinity of Calhoun\u2019s daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">{\u00b6 13} A person acts knowingly \u201c \u2018regardless of his purpose, when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Schwab </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 463, 471, 695 N.E.2d 801, quoting R.C. 2901.22(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">{\u00b6 14} In the instant case, Calhoun had notified police on four occasions that appellant\u2019s presence was unwanted, and appellant had been admonished by police to stay away from Calhoun and her daughter. Yet, for a period of years, appellant continued to place himself near Calhoun\u2019s residence and approached her daughter on at least one occasion. With regard to the March 7, 2004 incident where he spoke to Calhoun\u2019s daughter, appellant offered the unlikely explanation that he mistook the 12-year-old for his own 30-year-old daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">{\u00b6 15} While appellant\u2019s explanations may create a conflict in the evidence, the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony are ultimately matters for the trier of fact to resolve. <em>State v. Tenace, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 255, 2006-Ohio-2417, 847 N.E.2d 386, \u00b6 37, quoting <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. The trial court did not lose its way in this case simply because it chose not to believe appellant\u2019s version of the incidents. See <em>State v. Cramer, </em>Butler App. No. CA2003-03-078, 2004-Ohio-1712, 2004 WL 720451, \u00b6 39; <em>State v. White, </em>Butler App. No. CA2003-09-240, 2004-Ohio-3914, 2004 WL 1662297, \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">{\u00b6 16} Reviewing the record as a whole, we cannot say that the evidence weighs heavily against a conviction, that the trier of fact lost its way, or that a manifest miscarriage of justice has occurred. Appellant\u2019s conviction for menacing by stalking is not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">{\u00b6 17} The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b722-10\">Powell, P.J., and Bressler, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
