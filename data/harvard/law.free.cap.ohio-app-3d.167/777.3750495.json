For the following reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-17\">{\u00b6 2} As this case is postured, we are limited to the facts alleged in the complaint. Appellants, David and Susan McMullian, husband and wife, purchased a parcel of land from Patricia Borean, who had procured the property by entering into a purchase/lease agreement with the Lakeside Association (\u201cLakeside\u201d), an appellee herein. Originally, the parcel was Lot 11, Block 76 of Lakeside, a subdivision of Danbury Township, Ottawa County, Ohio. Upon her purchase/lease of the property, Borean split the parcel into two plots. Appellants purchased one of those plots, known as \u201cLot 11, N <em>% </em>Lot 12, Blk 76, Cherry Street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-18\">{\u00b6 3} Firelands Abstract &amp; Title Agency, Inc. (\u201cFirelands\u201d), the second appellee herein, which the complaint describes as a licensed real estate title examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>tion company, performed the title search and acted as an agent for the General Title &amp; Trust Co. (\u201cGeneral Title\u201d), which issued a policy of title insurance to appellants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Approximately a year and a half after appellants had closed on the purchase, appellants received permission from Lakeside to construct a certain planned residence on their property. Shortly afterwards, appellants discovered the existence of a sewer easement that the parties agree was not disclosed in Firelands\u2019 title search and was not expressly excepted from coverage in the title insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">{\u00b6 4} Appellants filed the instant complaint, alleging, inter alia, that the undisclosed sewer easement rendered them unable to construct their approved and planned residence. Appellants have appealed the trial court\u2019s grants of Firelands\u2019 Civ.R. 12(C) motion and Lakeside\u2019s Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion, dismissing all claims against each, by way of the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court erred when it found that appellants\u2019 complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted against appellee Firelands Abstract <em>&amp; </em>Title, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe trial court erred when it found that appellants\u2019 complaint failed to state any claim upon which relief could be granted against appellee the Lakeside Association.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">{\u00b6 7} A Civ.R. 12(C) motion for judgment on the pleadings has been characterized as a belated Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, and the same standard of review is applied to both motions. <em>Gawloski v. Miller Brewing Co. </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 160, 163, 644 N. E.2d 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">{\u00b6 8} The standard for granting a motion to dismiss a claim is \u201cstraightforward.\u201d <em>Cincinnati v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 416, 2002-Ohio-2480, 768 N.E.2d 1136, \u00b6 5. \u201cA motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is procedural and tests the sufficiency of the complaint.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Hanson v. Guernsey Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 545, 548, 605 N.E.2d 378. \u201c[I]t must appear beyond doubt from the complaint that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts entitling him to recovery.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien v. Univ. Community Tenants Union, Inc. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 242, 71 O.O.2d 223, 327 N.E.2d 753, syllabus. \u201c[A]s long as there is a set of facts, consistent with the plaintiffs complaint, which would allow the plaintiff to recover, the court may not grant a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Beretta, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>supra, citing <em>York v. Ohio State Hwy. Patrol </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 143, 145, 573 N.E.2d 1063. Courts are limited to examining the face of the complaint, may not consider matters outside the complaint, and must presume that all the assertions in the complaint are true. <em>Estate of Sherman v. Millhon </em>(1995), 104 Ohio App.3d 614, 617, 662 N.E.2d 1098; <em>State ex rel. Fuqua v. Alexander </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 206, 207, 680 N.E.2d 985. The standard of review for dismissals granted pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6) is de novo. <em>Battersby v. Avatar, Inc., </em>157 Ohio App.3d 648, 2004-Ohio-3324, 813 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">{\u00b6 9} First, we examine the trial court\u2019s dismissal, pursuant to Civ.R. 12(C), of appellants\u2019 claim against Firelands. The trial court\u2019s entry stated only that appellants failed to state a cause of action as pleaded in the seventh count of their complaint. Appellants initially complain that the trial court should have provided an explanation for its decision. However desirable explanations are, \u201ca reviewing court is not authorized to reverse a correct judgment merely because erroneous reasons were assigned as the basis thereof.\u201d <em>Joyce v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 93, 96, 551 N.E.2d 172, citing <em>Agricultural Ins. Co. v. Constantine </em>(1944), 144 Ohio St. 275, 284, 29 O.O. 426, 58 N.E.2d 658. Therefore, we need only determine whether appellants\u2019 complaint, assuming all facts are true, states a cause of action against Firelands.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">{\u00b6 10} Appellants filed their initial complaint on June 10, 2004, and filed an amended complaint on March 9, 2005. The initial complaint\u2019s stated claim against Firelands is entirely as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cSeventh Claim for Relief: * * * Plaintiffs state that Defendant Fire-lands Abstract &amp; Title, Inc. performed the title examination on Plaintiffs\u2019 lot. Defendant disclosed the easement recorded at Volume 290, Page 369 but negligently failed to disclose the easement that directly encroached on Plaintiffs\u2019 lot to such an extent that they were unable to construct their residence as planned and approved. As a direct and proximate result thereof, Plaintiffs have sustained damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">{\u00b6 12} Appellants correctly state the long-standing rule that title examiners may be hable for failing to disclose an encumbrance when there is privity of contract between the title examiner and the plaintiff, citing <em>Thomas v. Guarantee Title &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1910), 81 Ohio St. 432, 442, 91 N.E. 183, and <em>Cedar Dev., Inc. v. Exchange Place Title Agency, Inc., </em>149 Ohio App.3d 588, 2002-Ohio-5545, 778 N.E.2d 136. Appellate courts have strictly applied the syllabus in <em>Thomas, </em>rejecting, for instance, a less restrictive \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d test. See id. at \u00b6 22; <em>Kenney v. Henry Fischer Builder, Inc. </em>(1998), 129 Ohio App.3d 27, 32, 716 N.E.2d 1189 (rejecting proposed Restatement test).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>{\u00b6 13} In response, Firelands points only to the policy of title insurance issued by General Title and attached to the complaint as required by Civ.R. 10(D), noting that some sewer line easements are expressly excepted from coverage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The \u201cExceptions from Coverage\u201d section lists sewer line easements recorded at Volume 290, Page 369; Volume 407, Page 245; Volume 411, Page 557, and easements not shown by public records. The easement that appellants allege prevented them from construction is not listed. Firelands argues, however, that since the listed exceptions gave appellants notice that some sewer easements affected their property, appellants carried the burden to \u201cinquire further,\u201d asserting, \u201c[I]t is incomprehensible that they did not inquire further when given notice that a particular sewer easement * * * affected the premises * * In support, Firelands cites <em>Findlay Ford Lincoln-Mercury v. Huffman, </em>3d Dist. No. 5-02-67, 2004-Ohio-541, 2004 WL 231511. <em>Findlay Ford, </em>however, is entirely inapposite to the instant matter. There, the plaintiff buyer alleged that the defendant seller intentionally concealed and misrepresented the existence of water and oil wells on the property through the seller\u2019s oral representations; the wells were, however, discoverable through a public-records search, which the buyer failed to do. The grant of summary judgment to the defendant seller was upheld based upon the doctrine of caveat emptor and the rule that a buyer of real estate has \u201cno right to rely upon oral representations regarding the property transferred where the true facts are equally open to both parties.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 17. Here, appellants\u2019 claim is not based upon oral representations by Firelands, but rather Firelands\u2019 failure to disclose a certain easement. Moreover, the doctrine of caveat emptor only imposes a duty upon a seller or seller\u2019s agent to disclose only those defects known by the seller that could not be readily discovered by a reasonable inspection. <em>Layman v. Binns </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 176, 177, 519 N.E.2d 642; <em>Blake v. John Doe 1 </em>(1993), 89 Ohio App.3d 130, 133, 623 N.E.2d 1229. Appellants are also the named insureds in the policy issued by Firelands for General Title.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">{\u00b6 14} Assuming that all facts in the complaint are true, appellants have sufficiently pleaded a claim against Firelands. Appellants have alleged that Firelands had a duty to disclose all easements of record, that it failed to disclose an easement of record, and that the particular easement prevented them from constructing their residence as planned and approved. Firelands has not argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>that appellants lack privity of contract. Because it does not appear beyond a doubt that appellants can prove no set of facts entitling them to recovery, appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">{\u00b6 15} Next, we turn to the trial court\u2019s grant of Lakeside\u2019s motion to dismiss. The trial court\u2019s entry states only that it found Lakeside\u2019s arguments in support of dismissal justified. In their complaint, appellants asserted that Lakeside was the owner and lessor of the subject real property; that appellants closed the purchase on December 17, 2002; that on September 3, 2003, Lakeside approved the building of a two-story residence on the lot; that appellants were unable to build their residence due to the particular sewer easement previously discussed. First, appellants allege in the fourth count that Lakeside knew or should have known of the existence of the sewer line in dispute and negligently failed to disclose its existence to appellants. Second, appellants allege in the fifth count that Lakeside made knowing misrepresentations when it gave appellants permission to construct their planned residence. Third, appellants allege in the sixth count that Lakeside improperly permitted Borean to split the original lot and then negligently failed to disclose the improper split.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">{\u00b6 16} Lakeside argues that the first claim fails on its face because Ohio does not recognize a cause of action for negligent failure to disclose. Even assuming, as we must for testing the sufficiency of the complaint, that Lakeside knew of the sewer easement missing from Firelands\u2019 title search, appellants\u2019 claim would fail. A negligent misrepresentation occurs when one \u201csupplies <em>false information </em>for the guidance of others.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Leal v. Holtvogt </em>(1998), 123 Ohio App.3d 51, 62, 702 N.E.2d 1246, quoting <em>Textron Fin. Corp. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 115 Ohio App.3d 137, 149, 684 N.E.2d 1261, quoting 3 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1977), 126-127, Section 552(1), adopted in <em>Delman v. Cleveland Hts. </em>(1989), 41 Ohio St.3d 1, 4, 534 N.E.2d 835. A \u201c[negligent misrepresentation does not lie for omissions; there must be some affirmative false statement.\u201d Id. Thus, the trial court properly dismissed the fourth count of appellants\u2019 complaint. Appellants\u2019 third claim, listed in the sixth count of their complaint, must fail for the same reason; appellants allege only that Lakeside negligently failed to disclose that Borean had improperly split her original lot into two parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">{\u00b6 17} For similar reasons, appellants\u2019 claim that Lakeside made knowing misrepresentations when it permitted them to construct their residence also fails. The doctrine of caveat emptor only requires sellers of real estate to disclose that which is not discoverable by resort to public filings and matters of record, as in <em>Findlay Ford, </em>3d Dist. No. 5-02-67, 2004-Ohio-541, 2004 WL 231511. The doctrine applies when \u201c(1) the condition complained of is open to observation or discoverable upon reasonable inspection, (2) the purchaser had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>unimpeded opportunity to examine the premises, and (3) there is no fraud on the part of the vendor.\u201d <em>Layman v. Binns, 35 </em>Ohio St.3d 176, 519 N.E.2d 642. Appellants insist, however, that the separate issue of whether a claim lies for Lakeside\u2019s alleged negligence in approving Borean\u2019s lot split must survive. The original parcel split was also a matter of record and is clearly reflected in the materials attached to appellants\u2019 policy of title insurance received prior to or at closing; thus, the complaint itself shows that the \u201ctrue facts\u201d were discoverable by appellants. <em>Parahoo v. Mancini </em>(Apr. 14, 1998), 10th Dist. No. 97APE08-1071, 1998 WL 180539, citing <em>Traverse v. Long </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 249, 252, 59 O.O. 325, 135 N.E.2d 256. The trial court did not err in dismissing appellants\u2019 claims against Lakeside. Appellants\u2019 second assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">{\u00b6 18} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Ottawa County Court of Common Pleas dismissing appellants\u2019 claims against Lakeside is affirmed. The judgment dismissing appellants\u2019 claim against Fireside is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Appellants are ordered to pay one-half of the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24. Firelands is ordered to pay one-half of the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24. Judgment for the clerk\u2019s expense incurred in preparation of the record, fees allowed by law, and the fee for filing the appeal is awarded to Ottawa County.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b822-7\">Pietrykowski and Parish, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-12\">. We reversed the dismissal of appellants' claims against General Title in <em>McMullian </em>v. <em>Borean, </em>6th Dist. No. OT-05-17, 2006-Ohio-861, 2006 WL 456771. Borean is also not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b820-6\">. Firelands bases its arguments in part on a recorded easement and a plat map attached to its appellate brief. It is well established that reviewing courts \"cannot add matter to the record before it, which was not a part of the trial court\u2019s proceedings, and then decide the appeal on the basis of the new matter.\" <em>State v. Ishmail </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 402, 8 O.O.3d 405, 377 N.E.2d 500, paragraph one of the syllabus. We may not consider new evidence that was not a part of the trial court proceedings. <em>Papadelis v. First Am. Sav.
