Merillat, appeals the judgment of the Fulton County Court of Common Pleas that granted summary judgment to appellee, Auto-Owners Insurance Company (\u201cAuto-Owners\u201d), on its complaint seeking a declaratory judgment on a policy of insurance. Auto-Owners\u2019 named insureds were David and Angela Towers. Aaron Towers, David Towers\u2019s son and a minor at the time, was driving a car that was involved in a one-car accident in Fulton County, Ohio. Although Aaron Towers was a defendant below, he is not a party to this appeal. Merillat, a passenger in the car, sustained serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">{\u00b6 2} In this accelerated appeal, Merillat asserts a sole assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant-appellant in granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff-appellee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court determined, without legal analysis, factual reference, or citation of authority, that neither Aaron Towers nor appellant was entitled to coverage under David Towers\u2019s policy with Auto-Owners, based on the \u201cclear meaning\u201d of the policy language. For the following reasons, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">{\u00b6 5} In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, an appellate court employs a de novo standard of review, the same standard as the trial court. <em>Lorain Natl. Bank v. Saratoga Apts. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 127, 129, 572 N.E.2d 198. A de novo review is conducted without deference to the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Brewer v. Cleveland City Schools Bd. of Edn. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 378, 383, 701 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>N.E.2d 1028; <em>Brown v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 704, 622 N.E.2d 1153. Summary judgment is properly granted when the evidence, construed most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, demonstrates that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion. Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">{\u00b6 6} This matter compels reiteration of the axiomatic rule that \u201cevidence must be strongly construed in favor of the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Ferrando v. Auto-Owners Mut. Ins. Co., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 186, 190, 2002-Ohio-7217, 781 N.E.2d 927. Throughout the summary-judgment analysis, all inferences from the evidence must weigh in the nonmoving party\u2019s favor. Initially, the moving party must demonstrate that \u201cthere are no genuine issues of material fact concerning an essential element of the opponent\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 292, 662 N.E.2d 264. Either party may carry its burden by pointing to evidence listed in Civ.R. 56(C), which includes \u201cthe pleading, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence in the pending case, and written stipulations of fact, if any.\u201d Id. at 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. \u201cWhile the movant is not necessarily obligated to place any of these evidentiary materials in the record, the evidence must be in the record or the motion cannot succeed.\u201d Id. \u201cUnsupported allegations in the pleadings do not suffice to necessitate the denial of a summary judgment.\u201d <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46. If the moving party fails to carry its initial burden, the motion for summary judgment must be denied. Id. If, however, the moving party \u201caffirmatively shows that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support that party\u2019s claims,\u201d then the nonmoving party has a reciprocal burden to \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Id., citing Civ.R. 56(E). Only if the nonmoving party fails to carry its reciprocal burden may judgment as a matter of law be entered in the moving party\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">{\u00b6 7} The policy provisions at issue state:</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cSECTION I \u2014 DEFINITIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c9.

The record contains scant evidence. Auto-Owners attached a copy of David and Angela Towers\u2019s policy to its complaint and attached a copy of the accident report to its motion for summary judgment. To his motion for summary judgment, Merillat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>attached a copy of the judgment entry of David and Diane Towers\u2019s divorce. From these documents, we glean the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">{\u00b6 32} David Towers and Aaron Towers\u2019s mother, Diane Towers, were divorced in 1991. Diane was granted legal custody of Aaron, and David was granted visitation privileges. Aaron was driving Diane Towers\u2019s car when the accident occurred, and Merillat was his passenger. The accident occurred at approximately 3:00 a.m., after Aaron and Merillat had left an \u201cafter-prom\u201d party for a local high school, according to a witness who had seen them at the party and who came upon the accident scene. Aaron and Merillat were transported to St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">{\u00b6 33} Appellee first argues that Aaron Towers was not an insured under David Towers\u2019s policy because he was neither a named insured nor did he \u201creside\u201d with David Towers. Pursuant to the divorce decree, Diane was named Aaron\u2019s custodial parent. Appellant responds (1) that a genuine issue of fact exists because no evidence (beyond the 15-year-old divorce decree) demonstrates with whom Aaron resides and (2) that even if David Towers had only visitation rights with Aaron, those visits may constitute \u201cresiding\u201d for the purposes of establishing policy coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">{\u00b6 34} Appellee concedes that under some circumstances, a minor child of divorced parents may reside at either or both parents\u2019 homes when the child\u2019s parents maintain separate residences; appellee argues, however, that the only evidence available, the divorce decree, demonstrates that Aaron resided with Diane Towers. In determining the applicability of the term \u201creside\u201d to these facts, traditional principles control. \u201cInsurance policies are generally interpreted by applying rules of contract law. If the language of the insurance policy is doubtful, uncertain, or ambiguous, the language will be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured. However, the general rule of liberal construction cannot be employed to create an ambiguity where there is none. If the terms of a policy are clear and unambiguous, the interpretation of the contract is a matter of law.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Progressive Ins. Co. v. Heritage Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 781, 783-784, 682 N.E.2d 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">{\u00b6 35} The term \u201creside\u201d is not defined in the policy. When a word is undefined, we examine the common meaning of the word and Ohio case law involving the language at issue. <em>Shear v. West Am. Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 162, 165, 11 OBR 478, 464 N.E.2d 545 (interpreting the term \u201chousehold\u201d). \u201cCommon words appearing in a written instrument will be given their ordinary meaning unless manifest absurdity results, or unless some other meaning is clearly evidenced from the face or overall contents of the instrument.\u201d <em>Alexan</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>der v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 7 O.O.3d 403, 374 N.E.2d 146, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">{\u00b6 36} In <em>Entenman v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co. </em>(2000), 136 Ohio App.3d 541, 737 N.E.2d 119, we held that minor children of divorced parents may have dual residency at both parents\u2019 homes. Id. at 547, 737 N.E.2d 119. In doing so, we rejected the bright-line test employed by <em>Plessinger v. Cox </em>(Dec. 31, 1997), 2d Dist. Nos. 1428 and 1429, 1997 WL 797689, which held that a minor child must have been under the \u201ccustody, care, supervision, and control of the insured parent at the time of the accident pursuant to the court\u2019s custody and/or visitation decree.\u201d Instead, we adopted the definition of \u201cresident\u201d employed by <em>Farmers Ins. of Columbus v. Taylor </em>(1987), 39 Ohio App.3d 68, 528 N.E.2d 968, and the majority of Ohio appellate courts:</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">{\u00b6 37} A resident is \u201c \u2018[o]ne who lives in the home of the named insured for a period of some duration or regularity, although not necessarily there permanently, but excludes a temporary or transient visitor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Entenman, </em>136 Ohio App.3d at 547, 737 N.E.2d 119, quoting <em>Farmers Ins., </em>39 Ohio App.3d at 70, 528 N.E.2d 968; see, also, <em>Bell v. Currier, </em>5th Dist. No. 02-CA-10, 2003-Ohio-3294, 2003 WL 21453054, rejecting <em>Plessinger </em>in favor of the \u201csome duration and some regularity\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">{\u00b6 38} Central to our analysis in <em>Entenman </em>was the fact that the term \u201cresident\u201d was not defined in the insurance policy, and insurance policies \u201c \u2018may be written so as to preclude dual coverage if that be the intent of the insurer.\u2019 \u201d 136 Ohio App.3d at 548, 737 N.E.2d 119, quoting <em>Taylor, </em>39 Ohio App.3d at 70, 528 N.E.2d 968. Further, the term \u201cresident\u201d has no fixed meaning in the law, and ambiguous words will be construed in favor of coverage with \u201c \u2018greater force to language that purports to limit or to qualify coverage.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Watkins v. Brown </em>(1994), 97 Ohio App.3d 160, 164, 646 N.E.2d 485. \u201c \u2018That which is not clearly excluded from coverage is included.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Prudential Property &amp; Cas. Co. v. Koby </em>(1997), 124 Ohio App.3d 174, 177, 705 N.E.2d 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">{\u00b6 39} The dual-residency concept has particular force in light of children of divorced parents. Examining the plain and ordinary meaning of the word, the Second District Court of Appeals noted that the word \u201chousehold\u201d has been defined variously as \u201c \u2018 \u201c those who dwell under the same roof and compose a family: * * * a social unit comprised of those living together in the same dwelling place,\u201d \u2019 <em>Shear v. W. Am. Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 162, 166, 11 OBR 478, 481, 464 N.E.2d 545, 548, quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, or, alternatively, \u2018 \u201cthe inmates of a house collectively; an organized family, including servants or attendants, dwelling in a house; a domestic estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>lishment,\u201d \u2019 <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Davidson </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 101, 106, 621 N.E.2d 887, 891, quoting the Oxford English Dictionary.\u201d <em>Am. States Ins. Co. v. Guillermin </em>(1996), 108 Ohio App.3d 547, 553, 671 N.E.2d 317. Surely children of divorced parents who are \u201cinmates\u201d of both parents\u2019 homes, \u201ccompose a family\u201d in both homes, and comprise a \u201csocial unit\u201d in both homes, are justly considered \u201cresidents\u201d of both homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">{\u00b6 40} Examining circumstances in which the dual-residency concept has been applied, the inquiry is flexible; the fact pattern of a particular case should play a significant role. <em>Entenman, </em>136 Ohio App.3d at 549, 737 N.E.2d 119, citing <em>Prudential Property &amp; Cas. Co., </em>124 Ohio App.3d at 178-179, 705 N.E.2d 748. <em>Entenman </em>listed several factors, none considered to the exclusion of others. Usual considerations include \u201cthe amount of time the person spends at the household, the person\u2019s age, the person\u2019s intent, and whether the insured is \u2018legally obligated\u2019 to the person.\u201d Id. See, also, <em>Midwestern Indemn. Co. v. Patrick </em>(Jan. 16, 1997), 3d Dist. No. 12-96-06, 1997 WL 13768 (daily interaction, discipline, and financial support constitutes de facto \u201cfull parental responsibilities\u201d and child member was of the \u201chousehold\u201d despite lack of custody). Other courts have approached the inquiry using factors more compatible with the concept of dual residency, finding dual residency for a minor child of divorced parents when \u201c(1) the minor alternately resides with each parent under a custody or visitation arrangement; and (2) the minor\u2019s residency with each parent involves a consistent pattern between the two households for a period of some duration or regularity.\u201d <em>Entenman, </em>136 Ohio App.3d at 549, 737 N.E.2d 119, citing <em>Wood v. McQueen </em>(Sept. 21, 1995), 8th Dist. No. 68472, 1995 WL 558925, and <em>Brooks v. Progressive Ins. Co. </em>(July 20, 1994), 9th Dist. No. 16639, 1994 WL 376768. See, also, <em>Bolin v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(Mar. 25,1988), 2d Dist. No. 87-CA-46, 1988 WL 35291 (minors residing with their mother during the week and their father on the weekends were dual residents for purposes of both the father\u2019s and stepfather/uncle\u2019s insurance policies); <em>Willis v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(Dec. 30, 1986), 7th Dist. No. 86-C-22, 1986 WL 14955 (minor who resided with her mother during the week and with her father on the weekends was a resident of her father\u2019s household for purposes of his uninsured-motorist coverage); <em>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Henderson, </em>8th Dist. No. 85557, 2005-Ohio-5148, 2005 WL 2388401, \u00b6 22 (finding numerous cases in which the question of whether a person is a \u201cresident\u201d is a question of fact to be determined by the finder of fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">{\u00b6 41} In the Towers\u2019s policy, Auto-Owners did not expressly withhold coverage from individuals with dual-residencies. This policy contains the same language found to comport with the dual-residency concept applied in cases cited previously. Each of these cases, particularly <em>Entenman, </em>demonstrates the factors that the trial court should have employed to determine whether Aaron <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>resided with David and Angela Towers for some duration or regularity. Applying these factors to the available evidence, genuine issues of fact remain. No evidence indicates the extent to which Aaron Towers resides with David and Angela Towers. Construing all inferences from the divorce decree and visitation schedule in appellant\u2019s favor, Aaron Towers\u2019s residency with his father may have been continuous, regular, and for some duration. Although Aaron gave his mother\u2019s address as his own to the officer investigating the accident, this is not conclusive as to whether Aaron was not a part of a family within David Towers\u2019s home, as appellee argues. We find appellant\u2019s argument on this issue well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">{\u00b6 42} Alternatively, appellee argues that even if Aaron is an insured relative of David Towers under the policy, summary judgment must still be proper because Aaron was driving a noncovered automobile. Since Diane Towers\u2019s car was not listed on the policy\u2019s declarations page, appellee argues that it was not a covered automobile. Appellant points to the policy provision excluding from coverage vehicles that are available to an insured for regular use, arguing that no evidence demonstrates whether Diane Towers\u2019s car was available to Aaron for regular use or even whether Aaron owned another car.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">{\u00b6 43} Provisions barring coverage of vehicles available for regular use are common. See Sanderson <em>v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 582, 589, 635 N.E.2d 19, and cases cited therein. Unlike the slippery term \u201cresides,\u201d the phrase \u201cregular use\u201d is unambiguous and should be given its ordinary meaning. <em>Beverly v. Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(1989), 60 Ohio App.3d 139, 573 N.E.2d 1221, syllabus. The phrase does, however, require a fact-specific inquiry. Construing a similar provision, <em>Sanderson </em>held that an \u201cautomobile is not furnished for the regular use of an insured where the insured has only occasional possession of the automobile, which does not exceed ten occasions in <em>one year.\u201d 69 </em>Ohio St.3d 582, 635 N.E.2d 19, at paragraph four of the syllabus. Rather than establishing a bright-line test, however, <em>Sanderson </em>instead focused on whether the use was \u201cfrequent, steady, constant or systematic,\u201d id. at 589, 635 N.E.2d 19, and determined that coverage existed because the insured had only occasional possession of the automobile. Id. By comparison, the claimant in <em>Kenney v. Employer\u2019s Liab. Assur. Corp. </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St.2d 131, 34 O.O.2d 259, 214 N.E.2d 219, was denied coverage because he had the use of his employer\u2019s vehicle approximately 75 percent of the time. The court also conducted a fact-specific inquiry in <em>Thompson v. Preferred Risk Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 340, 513 N.E.2d 733, and examined whether the insured had \u201csole dominion and control\u201d over the vehicle and whether the insured was required to \u201csecure the permission of and obtain the keys from\u201d the owner. Id. at 343, 513 N.E.2d 733. Concluding that \u201cregular use\u201d was not synonymous with \u201cregularly used,\u201d the court found the policy\u2019s exclusion inapplicable. Id. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>{\u00b6 44} Very recently, this court, in <em>Hartman v. Progressive Max Ins. Co., </em>6th Dist. No. WM-05-007, 2006-Ohio-1629, 2006 WL 832915, listed \u201c \u2018signposts\u2019 which are indicative of the point at which a vehicle has been furnished for \u2018regular use.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 13, citing <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. v. Siefert </em>(Aug. 8, 1980), 6th Dist. No. L-79-361, 1980 WL 351460. Those \u201csignposts\u201d include \u201c(1) whether the vehicle was available most of the time to the insured; (2) whether the insured made more than mere occasional use of the vehicle; (3) whether the insured needed to obtain permission to use the vehicle; (4) whether there was an express purpose conditioning use of the vehicle; and (5) whether the vehicle was being used in an area where its use would be expected.\u201d Id. No evidence supporting any of these factors exists in the record. Summary judgment on this alternative ground is therefore improper, because genuine issues of fact remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">{\u00b6 45} Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is well taken.
