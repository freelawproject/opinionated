Hendon, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b529-14\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant, Jane Doe, has appealed from the trial court\u2019s entry granting the motion to dismiss of defendant-appellee, Archdiocese of Cincinnati. For the following reasons, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-15\">\n<em>I. Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b529-16\">{\u00b6 2} This case arose out of a relationship that began in 1965 between Doe and her parish priest, Father Norman Heil. Doe alleges that Father Heil induced her into carrying on a sexual relationship with him and that as a result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>relationship, Doe became pregnant. Doe further alleges that various members of the Archdiocese knew of the relationship between Doe and Father Heil and that the Archdiocese paid for her to spend a large portion of her pregnancy at Maple Knoll Hospital and Home, a private institution that housed unwed, pregnant teenagers.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">{\u00b6 3} Doe asserts that Sister Mary Patrick, a former teacher of Doe\u2019s, pressured her throughout her pregnancy into giving her child up for adoption and into remaining silent about the identity of her child\u2019s father. Doe\u2019s complaint states that Sister Mary Patrick told Doe that her baby would not be baptized, and thus not cleansed of original sin, if Doe did not consent to an adoption. Doe was raised as a devout Roman Catholic, and she heeded Sister Mary Patrick\u2019s words. According to the complaint, Sister Mary Patrick continually attempted to coerce and intimidate Doe by telling her that her pregnancy was solely her fault and that she had to offer penance by giving up her child. Father Heil also told Doe that she had to place their child up for adoption because he could not remain a priest if the Church were required to pay for 18 years of child support. Doe\u2019s complaint further alleges that other agents of the Archdiocese intimidated Doe into giving up her child, although the complaint does not specify these other agents by name.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">{\u00b6 4} Doe gave birth in November 1965, and she placed her child for adoption. Doe alleges that, as a consequence of giving up her child, she has suffered emotional, mental, and spiritual anguish for years.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">{\u00b6 5} In December 2004, Doe filed suit against the Archdiocese, raising claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, tortious interference with familial relations, loss of filial consortium, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligent supervision and retention. The Archdiocese filed a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss, which the trial court granted. The trial court apparently found that the statute of limitations barred Doe\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">\n<em>II. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">{\u00b6 6} We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss de novo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We must consider all the plaintiffs factual allegations to be true, and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the plaintiff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss should be granted only if a plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle her to relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>\n<em>III. Equitable Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">{\u00b6 7} Doe concedes that the statutes of limitations for her claims have expired, but she argues that the Archdiocese should be equitably estopped from asserting the statutes of limitations as a defense. Equitable estoppel \u201cprevents a party from exercising rights which that party might have otherwise had against one who has, in good faith, relied upon the conduct of that party to his detriment.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\n<em>A. Legal Requirements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">{\u00b6 8} In order to establish equitable estoppel, a plaintiff must make a prima facie showing of four elements: (1) that the defendant made a factual misrepresentation, (2) that the misrepresentation was misleading, (3) that the misrepresentation induced actual reliance that was reasonable and in good faith, and (4) that the misrepresentation caused detriment to the relying party.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Regarding the first two elements, a plaintiff must show either actual or constructive fraud.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">{\u00b6 9} Additionally, when it is used in a statute-of-limitations context, a plaintiff asserting equitable estoppel must show either \u201c \u2018an affirmative statement that the statutory period to bring an action was larger than it actually was\u2019 or \u2018promises to make a better settlement of the claim if plaintiff did not bring the threatened suit,\u2019 or \u2018similar misrepresentations or conduct\u2019 on defendant\u2019s part.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">\n<em>B. Application to Doe</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">{\u00b6 10} Doe\u2019s complaint is replete with allegations that the Archdiocese intimidated her into believing that the pregnancy was solely her fault, pressured her into giving up her child, and coerced her into remaining silent about the identity of her child\u2019s father. She was led to believe that her child unless adopted, would not be baptized.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">{\u00b6 11} The Archdiocese urges us to conclude that these statements were not factual misrepresentations, but rather were expressions of subjective, personal beliefs. But drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Doe, we conclude that Doe has effectively alleged that these statements by the Archdiocese constituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>misleading factual misrepresentations. We do not presume to determine whether these statements were in fact factual misrepresentations; our decision is solely based on the sufficiency of the allegations in Doe\u2019s complaint. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">{\u00b6 12} The Archdiocese further argues that even if these allegations are factual, they are insufficient to warrant the application of equitable estoppel. For support, the Archdiocese relies on <em>Livingston v. Diocese of </em>Cleveland,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a case involving sexual-abuse claims brought against the Diocese of Cleveland. The <em>Livingston </em>court held that statements telling the victims not to reveal the abuse they had suffered were insufficient to meet the first two elements of equitable estoppel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But <em>Livingston </em>is distinguishable from the case at bar. Doe has alleged not only that she was intimidated into never revealing the identity of her baby\u2019s father, but also that she was told that she alone was responsible for her pregnancy and that her child would not be baptized if she did not place it for adoption. These allegations, taken together, are sufficient assertions of fraud and misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">{\u00b6 13} Doe has also successfully alleged that her reliance on the Archdiocese\u2019s misrepresentations was reasonable and in good faith. Doe was raised in a devout Catholic home; she attended Catholic schools, participated in her parish\u2019s youth group, and regularly attended Mass. Doe\u2019s upbringing, coupled with the intimidation she experienced while pregnant, led her to believe the Archdiocese\u2019s statements. Given the religious indoctrination that Doe had experienced, her reliance was both reasonable and in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">{\u00b6 14} Doe\u2019s complaint further adequately alleges that she suffered detriment as a result of the Archdiocese\u2019s misrepresentations. Doe underwent psychotherapy and hospitalization for mental anguish; she has additionally suffered from the loss of a relationship with her daughter. We conclude that Doe has sufficiently alleged the necessary elements of equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">{\u00b6 15} But, as we have already noted, when a party relies on equitable estoppel in a statute-of-limitations context, it must additionally show some statement or conduct by the defendant that in essence encouraged the party not to bring suit. In the present case, the Archdiocese made no express statements to Doe regarding the length of time she had to bring a claim against it. Nor did the Archdiocese make any attempt or offer to settle Doe\u2019s potential claims. Because the Archdiocese made no direct or express statements, to establish equitable estoppel Doe must have alleged that the Archdiocese utilized \u201csimilar misrepresentations or conduct\u201d to prevent her from filing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Doe\u2019s complaint asserts that the statements made to her by various representatives of the Archdiocese were \u201cmade with the sole purpose and intent to coerce Ms. Doe to forgo the best legal interests of her and of her child.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It further alleges that the conduct of, and the actions taken by, the Archdiocese \u201cwere calculated to, and resulted in, Ms. Doe\u2019s relinquishment of her parental rights and the forbearance from any legal action.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> After reviewing Doe\u2019s complaint, we conclude that these statements adequately allege that the Archdiocese\u2019s conduct was motivated by a desire to prevent Doe from bringing suit. Again, we emphasize that we pass no judgment as to whether the Archdiocese was actually motivated by such a desire; rather, our conclusion is based on the well-pleaded allegations in Doe\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">{\u00b6 17} In summary, we conclude that Doe has successfully alleged the necessary elements of the defense of equitable estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\n<em>TV. Religious Entanglement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">{\u00b6 18} The Archdiocese argues that should this court hold the defense of equitable estoppel to be applicable, we should nonetheless affirm the dismissal of Doe\u2019s claims because a trial court cannot determine their validity without infringing on the First Amendment guarantee of religious freedom. According to the Archdiocese, this case cannot be decided without a court assessing the legitimacy of many of the Catholic Church\u2019s beliefs, including those on baptism and sin.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">{\u00b6 19} A court\u2019s inquiry into religious doctrine is limited. \u201cThe First Amendment to the United States Constitution, through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits state courts from making any inquiry into religious doctrine, practice or policy.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But a court is not prohibited from determining whether a religious institution\u2019s proffered reason for its action is a mere pretext for a secular purpose.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">{\u00b6 20} Doe urges this court to conclude that the Archdiocese\u2019s actions were in fact motivated by a secular purpose and that its reliance on the church\u2019s religious beliefs to justify its actions was solely a pretext. Although Doe\u2019s complaint does not expressly contain such an allegation, we believe that it can reasonably be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>{\u00b6 21} The complaint alleges that Doe was coerced into giving up her child to protect Father Heil and the Church, that Father Heil told Doe he would be unable to remain a priest if the Church had to pay for 18 years of child support, and that the Archdiocese representatives were acting with the Church\u2019s pecuniary interests in mind. Considering these allegations to be true, and making all reasonable inferences in favor of Doe, we conclude that Doe\u2019s complaint sufficiently alleges that the Archdiocese\u2019s actions were motivated by a secular purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\n<em>V. Sufficiency of the Individual Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">{\u00b6 22} The Archdiocese further argues that several of Doe\u2019s claims must fail as a matter of law because her complaint does not state claims upon which relief can be granted. The Archdiocese takes issue with Doe\u2019s claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress, loss of filial consortium, and negligent supervision and retention. We address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\n<em>A. Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">{\u00b6 23} A claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress occurs when \u201cthe plaintiff has either witnessed or experienced a dangerous accident or appreciated the actual physical peril.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This district has further held that the tort requires a bystander or witness to be traumatized by the emotionally distressing occurrence of a sudden, negligently caused event.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">{\u00b6 24} Doe did not experience a dangerous accident or physical peril resulting from such an accident. Nor did she witness a sudden, negligently caused event. Rather, Doe alleges that her trauma resulted from continuous and intentional pressure and intimidation over a lengthy period of time. The allegations in Doe\u2019s complaint cannot sustain a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress. We note that it is of no importance that Doe did not suffer physical harm. Severe emotional injuries will suffice for a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> But Doe\u2019s claim must fail because she neither experienced nor witnessed a sudden traumatizing event or accident.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We conclude as a matter of law that Doe\u2019s claim for negligent infliction of emotion distress was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>\n<em>B. Loss of Filial Consortium</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">{\u00b625} The Ohio Supreme Court first recognized the tort of loss of filial consortium in <em>Gallimore v. Children\u2019s Hosp. Med. Ctr.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court held that \u201ca parent may recover damages, in a derivative action against a third-party tortfeasor who intentionally or negligently causes physical injury to the parent\u2019s minor child, for loss of filial consortium.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">{\u00b6 26} The facts alleged in Doe\u2019s complaint do not support this cause of action. Loss of filial consortium requires the child to experience some type of physical injury. Doe has made no allegation that her child experienced any type of physical injury, and we accordingly conclude that her claim for loss of filial consortium was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">\n<em>C. Negligent Supervision and Retention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">{\u00b6 27} To prevail on a claim for negligent supervision and retention, a plaintiff must show the following: \u201c(1) the existence of an employment relationship; (2) the employee\u2019s incompetence; (3) the employer\u2019s actual or constructive knowledge of such incompetence; (4) the employee\u2019s act or omission causing the plaintiffs injuries; and (5) the employer\u2019s negligence in * * * retaining the employee as the proximate cause of plaintiffs injury.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A plaintiff must also show that the employee\u2019s act was reasonably foreseeable.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> An act is reasonably foreseeable if the employer knew or should have known of the employee\u2019s \u201cpropensity to engage in similar criminal, tortious, or dangerous conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">{\u00b6 28} In essence, this tort requires the plaintiff to suffer an injury at the hands of an employee, after an employer has discovered the employee\u2019s incompetence and continued to maintain his employment. Doe\u2019s complaint does not support this cause of action. She does allege that the Archdiocese was aware that its employees were coercing and intimidating her. But she makes no allegations that the employees had engaged in similar behavior in the past or that the Archdiocese had maintained their employment after becoming aware of such conduct. The complaint does not allege that the behavior of the Archdiocese <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>employees was reasonably foreseeable before it occurred. We conclude that Doe\u2019s claim for negligent supervision and retention was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\n<em>VI. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">{\u00b6 29} Because Doe\u2019s complaint sufficiently alleges the necessary elements of equitable estoppel, we conclude that the trial court erred in dismissing her claims based upon the statute of limitations. And because Doe has also adequately asserted that the Archdiocese\u2019s actions were motivated by a secular purpose, we conclude that her complaint could not be dismissed on First Amendment grounds. However, regarding Doe\u2019s claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress, loss of filial consortium, and negligent supervision and retention, we hold that Doe\u2019s complaint fails to state claims upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">{\u00b6 30} We thus affirm the dismissal of Doe\u2019s claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress, loss of filial consortium, and negligent supervision and retention. But we reverse the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Doe\u2019s claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, tortious interference with familial relationships, and breach of fiduciary duty, and we remand this cause for further proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b536-8\">Hildebrandt, P.J., and Doan, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-10\">. <em>Battersby v.
