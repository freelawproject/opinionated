As relevant here, the association alleged that the district violated the Public Employees Collective Bargaining Act (PECBA) \u2014 specifically ORS 243.672(l)(a), (b), and (e) (set out below) \u2014 by improperly deducting health insurance premiums normally paid by the district from striking teachers\u2019 paychecks and by not allowing the association to directly reimburse the district for those amounts so that its members\u2019 paychecks would not be reduced. The association seeks judicial review of ERB\u2019s ruling in the district\u2019s favor with respect to those allegations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ORS 183.482. We reverse and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">We draw the facts from ERB\u2019s findings and the record. The district, a public employer operating a school district in Sandy, Oregon, and the association, a labor organization representing approximately 215 full-time and part-time teachers employed by the district, were parties to a collective bargaining agreement that expired in June 2004. After they reached an impasse in bargaining for a successor agreement, and the district unilaterally implemented its final contract offer, the association notified the district on October 14,2005, that the teachers that it represented intended to go on strike on October 25, 2005. <em>See </em>ORS 243.712(2)(d); ORS 243.726(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>On October 19, 2005, the district notified bargaining unit members that, if the strike occurred as announced and they did not return to work by November 7, they</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\">\u201cwill be ineligible to receive district fringe benefits for November (applied to December health coverage). If this occurs, employees will receive notice from the district and may self[-]pay premium balances to continue health insurance coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The strike commenced as planned on October 25, 2005, and continued through November 16, 2005. On November 8, the district sent the association\u2019s members another written notice, stating, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">\u201cAs communicated to you on October 19, 2005, those licensed staff [who] had not returned to work by 11/7/2005 would not earn district fringe benefits for November. By our records, you fall in the group that did not meet this requirement. In order to continue health insurance coverage, an amount equal to the premium due will be withheld from your November payroll check. This amount will then be applied to pay your December premium (October benefit was used to pay your November premium).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">On November 10, counsel for the association wrote to the district\u2019s business manager, informing him that the Oregon Education Association (OEA) intended to \u201cmake direct payment of any unpaid health insurance premiums on behalf of striking teachers which are necessary to guarantee that the teachers will have continued coverage during the ongoing strike\u201d and requesting information about how to make those payments. The district did not respond until November 14, 2005, when the business manager notified the association that it had already made arrangements to deduct premiums from employees\u2019 paychecks but would provide the association with information to allow it to reimburse its members individually. On November 23, 2005, OEA issued checks directly to the teachers to reimburse them for the premiums that the district had deducted from their paychecks.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Article 32 of the parties\u2019 2001-04 collective bargaining agreement governed fringe benefits. As to the first year of the contract, the agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u201cThe District shall pay the full premium for each employee and for all enrolled dependents for the current medical/ vision plan, dental plan, and orthodontia coverage or provide substantially equivalent coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The agreement further provided that, in the second year of the contract, \u201c[tjhere will be a maximum district contribution cap of up to $600 per full time teacher per month per insurance year,\u201d and that, if the amount paid by the district for the premiums was less than the actual cost, \u201cthen each affected employee shall pay the difference through payroll deduction.\u201d The agreement increased the maximum district contribution to $680 for the third year of the contract and retained the language allowing payroll deductions to make up any difference in cost; the district\u2019s implemented final offer again increased the insurance contribution \u2014 to a maximum amount of $720 per month for the 2005-06 school year. The contract did not define when an employee becomes eligible for insurance premium contributions. The only mention of prorated district contributions toward insurance benefits was in reference to part-time employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">As a result of the events described above, the association filed an unfair labor practice complaint against the district alleging that the fringe benefit deductions and the way in which the district made those deductions violated ORS 243.672(l)(a), (b), and (e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a defense to the complaint, the district asserted that its processing of insurance contributions during the strike was in accordance with its \u201cnormal business practices,\u201d which, according to the district, required an employee to work more than half the work days in a pay period in order to be eligible for district-paid insurance benefits for that pay period. Before the hearing on the complaint, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>the association served the district with a subpoena <em>duces tecum, </em>requesting documentation of that practice. The district moved to quash the subpoena, in part, because it was \u201cunduly burdensome and costly.\u201d The administrative law judge (ALJ) denied the district\u2019s motion but ruled that the association was required to pay the district\u2019s costs to comply with the subpoena. The association elected not to pay those costs, and, consequently, the information was not produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">ERB subsequently ruled that the ALJ had correctly denied the motion to quash but had erred in requiring the association to pay the district\u2019s costs to comply with the subpoena. ERB found that, because the subpoena \u201cdid nothing more than require the District to produce the documents needed to prove its own defense,\u201d its \u201cunexplained failure to produce evidence in support of its position warrants an inference that the documents would have been unfavorable to the District.\u201d That negative inference, ERB concluded, would render harmless the AL J\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">ERB also found, however, that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">\u201c[bletween 1996 and 2004, the District notified three Association bargaining unit members that because they would be in paid status for one-half or fewer of the days in a pay period, they would lose District-paid fringe benefits for the next pay period. One bargaining unit member chose to self-pay fringe benefit costs, another elected to drop District insurance coverage, and the third person changed the dates of her planned leave to avoid any loss in benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">\u201cThe practice used on these three occasions was not written down in any document. The parties never addressed it at the bargaining table or in other discussions between the parties prior to this labor dispute. Association officials were unaware of this practice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">ERB ultimately ruled in the district\u2019s favor on the association\u2019s allegations that the district\u2019s conduct had violated ORS 243.672(l)(a), (b), and (e), and the association assigns error to each of those rulings. We discuss each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">A. <em>Violation of ORS 243.672(l)(e).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">We begin with the association\u2019s challenge to ERB\u2019s dismissal of its claim that the district violated ORS 243.672(l)(e). Under that provision, it is \u201can unfair labor practice for a public employer or its designated representative\u201d to \u201c[r]efuse to bargain collectively in good faith with the exclusive representative.\u201d The duty to bargain in good faith includes refraining from making a unilateral change to the status quo of the parties\u2019 employment relations after a contract has expired. <em>Oregon State Police Officers\u2019 Assn. v. State of Oregon, </em>240 Or App 419, 424, 246 P3d 97 (2011) (\u201cWe have consistently held that \u2018[a] unilateral action on a mandatory subject of bargaining during negotiations is a violation of the duty to bargain in good faith.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Gresham Tchrs. v. Gresham Gr. Sch., </em>52 Or App 881, 889, 630 P2d 1304 (1981); brackets in <em>Oregon State Police Officers\u2019 Assn.))</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">\u201cTo determine whether a change to the status quo has occurred, ERB compares the new provision to either the existing collective bargaining agreement or, if that agreement does not address the disputed issue with sufficient clarity, to past practice. If the asserted change takes place after a collective bargaining agreement has expired but before a successor agreement is in place, then, because an employer has an obligation to preserve the status quo in the interim period, <em>see </em>ORS 243.712(2)(d), the terms of the expired agreement or the practice in place during its existence remains the status quo benchmark.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-7\"><em>Lincoln Cty. Ed. Assn. v. Lincoln City Sch. Dish, </em>187 Or App 92, 96, 67 P3d 951 (2003). Thus, ERB must answer two questions: First, what was the status quo? And, second, did the employer unilaterally change it? <em>Bend Firefighters </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number><em>Association v. City of Bend, </em>16 PECBR 378, 381 (1996). The burden is on the party claiming that the status quo was violated to prove the existence of the past practice establishing the status quo. <em>AFSCME Local 88 v. Multnomah County, </em>22 PECBR 279, 285, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>22 PECBR 444 (2008); ORS 183.450(2) (\u201cThe burden of presenting evidence to support a fact or position in a contested case rests on the proponent of the fact or position.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">In this case, ERB understood the association to be arguing that, based on past practice, the status quo before the strike was that \u201cteachers who were in paid status for less than a full pay period paid <em>a prorated share </em>of their fringe benefit premium costs if they wished to continue coverage\u201d and, therefore, that the district had unilaterally changed the status quo by instead deducting the <em>full amount </em>of the monthly premium costs from the paychecks of striking workers. (Emphasis added.) Analyzing <em>that </em>question, ERB found that \u201c[t]he Association has not shown a long-standing, consistent District practice of requiring a teacher to pay a prorated share of the teacher\u2019s health insurance premium costs if the teacher was in paid status for less than a full pay period.\u201d ERB reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">\u201cThe expired contract does not address this subject, and the District has no written policy or rule regarding this matter. The Association relies on past practice to establish the <em>status quo. </em>A past practice must be clear, consistent, and repeated over a long period of time. The record demonstrates no consistent past practice in regard to the amount that teachers were required to pay for insurance premiums if they were in paid status for less than a full pay period. To the contrary, the practice is mixed. Based on the District\u2019s failure to produce payroll records, evidence it would naturally wish to produce if it was favorable to the District\u2019s position, we have inferred that this evidence supports the Association\u2019s position: that the District prorated fringe benefit premium costs for teachers who were in paid status for less than a full pay period. However, actual examples in the record are contrary to this inference. On three occasions between 1996 and 2004, the District warned teachers that they would lose District-paid fringe benefits for a full pay period if they did not remain in paid status for more than one-half of the days in the preceding pay period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>(Internal citation omitted.) Consequently, ERB concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\"><em>\u201cBecause the Association has failed to establish that District proration of fringe benefit premium costs was the status quo, </em>we do not find that the District unlawfully changed it in violation of subsection (l)(e) when it required bargaining unit members to pay the full monthly cost of their premiums in November. We will dismiss this allegation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">On judicial review, the association argues that ERB\u2019s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or substantial reason and is wrong as a matter of law. According to the association, the basis for its complaint was <em>not </em>that the district had a past practice of prorating employee fringe benefit premiums based on the number of days an employee was in paid status during the pay period. That is, the association never contended that the status quo was to prorate the amount of insurance premiums paid by the district for employees in those circumstances and to deduct the remainder from the employees\u2019 paychecks. Rather, the association insists that its argument throughout the proceedings below was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">\u201cthe District had no authority under any prior relations between the parties to deduct <em>any </em>amount of District-paid insurance premiums \u2014 let alone a pro-rated amount \u2014 from employee paychecks, based on the employees\u2019 failure to work for some specified period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">(Emphasis in original.) In other words, according to the association, its argument asserted that the district had changed the status quo by implementing a new practice that did not exist before (eliminating district-paid insurance premiums for employees in paid status who work half or fewer of the work days in a pay period), not that the district had changed an existing practice (prorating district-paid fringe benefit payments based on days in paid status) to that new practice. Consequently, in the association\u2019s view, it \u201chad only to prove that the District\u2019s alleged practice never existed before,\u201d not that the district had \u201csome other practice\u201d that it had changed, and ERB thus erred in rejecting its claim for failing to prove the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>As explained below, we agree with the association that ERB misapprehended the premise underlying the association\u2019s ORS 243.672(l)(e) claim; it follows that ERB\u2019s conclusion rejecting that claim is therefore not based on substantial reason. <em>See generally </em>ORS 183.482(8)(c). Accordingly, we reverse ERB\u2019s dismissal of the association\u2019s claim under ORS 243.672(l)(e) and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The association\u2019s amended complaint included the following allegations in support of its claim that the district\u2019s actions had violated ORS 243.672(l)(e):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">\u201c27. Both the District\u2019s Implemented Final Offer and the parties\u2019 expired collective bargaining agreement provided that the District would pay either the full premium or a maximum contribution toward a full premium for each full time teacher \u2018per month per insurance year.\u2019 [T]he District\u2019s Implemented Final Offer and the parties\u2019 expired collective bargaining agreement also provided that the District would pay for part-time employees a \u2018pro rata contribution towards the regular District cost of insurance based upon the relationship their regularly scheduled work hours bear to those of full time employees.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">\u201c28. Neither the District\u2019s Implemented Final Offer nor the parties\u2019 expired collective bargaining agreement provided either directly or implicitly that the District could withhold payment of an <em>entire </em>month\u2019s fringe benefit premium based on the fact that the employee did not work for all days during the month when the premium became due. Nor did either document provide either directly or indirectly that the District could withhold the pro rata contribution towards insurance that would normally be paid on behalf of a part-time employee based on the fact that the part-time employee did not work all days during the month when the contribution became due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">\u201c29. The District\u2019s deduction of [an] <em>entire </em>month\u2019s worth of fringe benefit premiums from the salary of all bargaining unit employees upon their return to work following the strike constituted a unilateral change and failure to maintain the status quo in violation of the District\u2019s duty to bargain in good faith under ORS 243.672(l)(e).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">(Emphasis added; underscoring omitted.) The district apparently relies on the association\u2019s references to the district\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>deduction of an <em>\u201centire\u201d </em>month\u2019s benefit premium as reflecting the association\u2019s argument \u2014 correctly understood by ERB, in the district\u2019s view \u2014 that to maintain the status quo, the district should have deducted from striking employees\u2019 paychecks only a <em>prorated </em>amount of the monthly fringe benefit premium normally paid by the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">However, the context of the complaint does not support the district\u2019s position. Nowhere in the complaint does the association assert an existing district practice of prorating insurance premium payments to employees based on the number of days in paid status. Moreover, in its request for relief, the association sought, <em>inter </em>alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">\u201cAn order requiring the District to reimburse the OEA <em>for all amounts </em>that the OEA paid directly to District employees to prevent those employees from suffering losses in salary due to the District\u2019s unilateral and improper deductions from the employees\u2019 paychecks taken to pay for the employees\u2019 November 2005 fringe benefit premiums.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, the complaint requests full \u2014 not partial or prorated \u2014 reimbursement of the amounts that the association paid employees to make up for the insurance premiums deducted from their paychecks. In short, the complaint can only be understood as alleging as the status quo the payment of fringe benefit premiums without regard to the number of days in paid status during the relevant pay period.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Similarly, in opening argument before the ALJ, counsel for the association argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">\u201c[0]ur amended complaint suggests that even if it was not retaliatory, even if the district can somehow contend that it had no motivation to harm the employees, our contention is that there\u2019s no evidence that the status quo, <em>the past practice of these parties allowed the district to deduct an entire month\u2019s pay </em>\u2014 premium <em>payments from employees\u2019 paychecks when the employees had actually worked during that month.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">\u201cAnd the evidence is that these employees returned to work on November 17th, which was the middle of the month, approximately, and they did work days in November. And the district\u2019s essentially saying that, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>though you worked in the month of November you are entitled to absolutely no contribution or [sic] health insurance premiums, fringe benefit premiums, and our contention is that that\u2019s unprecedented in the practices of this employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Significantly, the association reiterated that position in its post-hearing brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">\u201cThere is nothing * * * in the parties\u2019 expired contract or in the district\u2019s written implemented final offer which says anything about employees having to work a designated period of time in a designated \u2018payroll period\u2019 in order to \u2018earn\u2019 district paid insurance contributions for a given month of the contract year. Moreover, nothing in those documents states or even implies that the district would be entitled to withhold the \u2018full premium for each employee\u2019 in a given month if the employee failed to satisfy such a condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">(Emphasis omitted.) It further argued that there was no evidence showing that the district \u201chad any written rule or policy that created a <em>status quo </em>allowing it to unilaterally deduct[ ] money from employee paychecks if the employees failed to work enough to somehow \u2018earn\u2019 district paid benefits.\u201d The association concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">\u201cIn sum, there is no evidence in the parties\u2019 expired contracts, the district\u2019s implemented final offer, the parties\u2019 bargaining history, the district\u2019s work rules or policies, or any of the parties\u2019 past practices to support the district\u2019s assertion that the <em>status quo </em>permitted it to require employees to fulfill certain conditions to \u2018earn\u2019 monthly insurance premiums or to deduct from employee paychecks if they did not \u2018earn\u2019 their benefits by fulfilling such conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Thus, the association\u2019s underlying theory remained essentially <em>consistent </em>\u2014 viz., that the status quo did not permit the district to withhold any amount of the monthly fringe benefit payments based on an employee\u2019s failure to work a specified number of days in the pay period and, thus, that the district\u2019s unilateral implementation of that practice following the strike was a violation of ORS 243.672(l)(e).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>As evidence supporting ERB\u2019s contrary understanding, the district points only to two November 22,2005, letters written by the association\u2019s counsel to the district business manager, in which counsel asserted, first, that \u201c[i]t seems clear that the District will be obligated to pay at least a portion of the \u2018fringe amounts\u2019 it normally pays for licensed employees for the month of November,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, in the second letter, that the association \u201cadamantly disagrees with the District\u2019s unilateral conclusion that employees owe the entire amount of their monthly fringe benefit premiums for the past pay cycle.\u201d We do not agree that those communications, written in the midst of discussions between the parties regarding the association\u2019s efforts to pay any unpaid health insurance premiums on behalf of its members, are sufficient somehow to transform the legal theory advanced by the association in its pleadings and post-hearing brief. Rather, in context, it appears, as the association contends, that counsel\u2019s statements were suggestions for resolving the dispute between the parties about the provision of insurance benefits during the strike and were intended \u201cmerely to underscore the unfairness of the District\u2019s unilateral deduction of a full month of benefits from employees who had been on strike for far fewer days.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Indeed, in the first of those letters, counsel made clear that OEA\u2019s willingness to reimburse employees for amounts deducted by the district for insurance benefits was \u201cnot intended to indicate that it agrees * * * that the District even has the right to make such deductions unilaterally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">In sum, it is apparent that ERB incorrectly characterized the association\u2019s claim as asserting that, to maintain the status quo, the district should have deducted from striking employees\u2019 paychecks a prorated amount of the costs of the monthly insurance benefit premiums normally paid by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>the district, rather than the full amount.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> ERB then reasoned from that erroneous premise to the conclusion that the association failed to satisfy its burden of proving that the district had violated the status quo. As a result, ERB\u2019s conclusion is not supported by substantial reason, and we reverse and remand for ERB to consider in the first instance whether the association carried its burden of proof under a proper characterization of its claim. <em>See Portland Assn. Teachers v. Mult. Sch. Dist. No. </em>1, 171 Or App 616, 627, 16 P3d 1189 (2000) (in reviewing for substantial reason, \u201cwe review ERB\u2019s reasoning for whether ERB correctly applied legal principles in the individual case before it\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">B. <em>Violation of ORS 243.672(l)(a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In its second assignment of error, the association asserts that ERB also erred in dismissing its claim under ORS 243.672(l)(a). As explained below, ERB\u2019s ruling suffers from the same flaw as its resolution of the association\u2019s ORS 243.672(l)(e) claim discussed <em>above </em>\u2014 viz., it is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the association\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>and that misunderstanding necessarily undermines its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Under ORS 243.672(l)(a), it is an unfair labor practice for a public employer to \u201c[interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in or because of the exercise of rights guaranteed in ORS 243.662.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Subsection (l)(a) contains two prohibitions: \u201c(1) restraint, interference, or coercion \u2018because of the exercise of protected rights; and (2) restraint, interference, or coercion \u2018in\u2019 the exercise of protected rights.\u201d <em>Portland Assn. Teachers, </em>171 Or App at 623. In a claim based on the \u201cbecause of\u2019 prohibition, motive is an element. Hence, to succeed on such a claim, a complainant \u201cmust establish that the employer was motivated by the exercise of the protected right to take the disputed action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted). In other words, there must be \u201ca direct causal nexus between the protected activity and the employer\u2019s action\u201d; it is not necessary to show \u201canti-union animus or other hostility\u201d toward the exercise of the right. <em>Id. </em>at 623 n 3.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">\u201cThe ultimate issue of whether an employer acted coer-cively and was motivated to do so by the exercise of protected activity is a factual determination, one that ERB must make considering the nature of the action taken and the circumstances in which it was taken. In testing whether the record supports ERB\u2019s resolution of that issue, we review for whether ERB has correctly identified the applicable legal principles; we further review for substantial evidence and for substantial reason.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 626-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">With respect to claims based on the \u201cin\u201d prong, on the other hand, the question is not one of motive, but one of consequences: \u201c[T]he essential issue is only whether, objectively viewed, the action that the employer took under the particular circumstances would chill union members generally in their exercise of protected rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>In this case, the association\u2019s complaint encompasses both the \u201cbecause of\u2019 and \u201cin\u201d prongs of a subsection (l)(a) claim. Specifically, the association contended that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-4\">\u201c[t]he District\u2019s decision to deduct fringe benefit premiums from employee paychecks and to spurn OEA offers of direct reimbursement to prevent such deductions interfered with employees in and because of the exercise of their rights protected by ORS 243.662.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">ERB\u2019s error in mischaracterizing the basis for the association\u2019s claim, however, again undermines its reasoning. Regarding the \u201cbecause of\u2019 claim, ERB described the association\u2019s theory as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">\u201cThe Association contends that the District refused to use the fairest method of dealing with the absence resulting from the <em>strike </em>\u2014 requiring <em>teachers to pay a prorated share of their fringe benefit premium costs </em>\u2014 because it was angry about the strike. According to the Association, the District deducted the cost of an entire month\u2019s fringe benefit premiums \u2018because of the teachers\u2019 participation in a lawful strike, an activity protected under the PECBA.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">(Emphasis added.) With the issue thus framed, ERB reasoned that the district\u2019s actions in deducting the premiums did not violate the \u201cbecause of\u2019 prong of subsection (l)(a) because, on the date (October 19, 2005) that it notified district teachers about the consequences that the strike would have on their health insurance premiums, the district did not know whether its choice to apply the method that it did\u2014 deducting the entire monthly premium amount \u2014 rather than the alternative \u2014 prorating\u2014would help or hurt teachers. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ERB explained, because of the timing of the pay period, under the district\u2019s method,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">\u201c[i]f the planned strike lasted 9 days or [fewer], bargaining unit members would have paid <em>no </em>fringe benefit premium costs. Had this occurred, they would have been in a better position than if the District had adopted the method advocated by the Association \u2014 prorating premium costs. If the planned strike lasted 10 days or more, then bargaining unit members would have to pay the costs of their monthly fringe benefit premiums.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">(Emphasis in original.) Consequently, ERB concluded, the approach to payment that the district adopted was \u201cneutral on its face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Thus, as with the subsection (l)(e) claim, ERB\u2019s rationale for dismissing the association\u2019s subsection (l)(a) claim is predicated on its mischaracterization of the basis for that <em>claim </em>\u2014 viz., that the district had violated the statute based on its choice to deduct the entire monthly fringe benefit premiums from employees\u2019 paychecks <em>rather than </em>prorating the deduction. However, as discussed above, the association\u2019s complaint was targeted, not at the district\u2019s failure to prorate the premiums, but at its withholding of any amount of the premiums. ERB\u2019s reasoning \u2014 that the district\u2019s action was not motivated by the employees\u2019 exercise of their protected right to strike because it could not have known which method \u2014 as between the two \u2014 would adversely affect the striking workers \u2014 is thus inapposite. In other words, ERB made no finding on the pivotal question presented by the association\u2019s claim: whether, in deducting <em>any </em>fringe benefit premiums from employees\u2019 paychecks, the district was motivated by the employees\u2019 exercise of their right to strike. Accordingly, we remand for ERB to consider that question. Moreover, because ERB explicitly and necessarily relied on its \u201cbecause of\u2019 analysis to resolve the association\u2019s claim under the \u201cin\u201d prong of the statute,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> on remand, ERB must also address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>C. <em>Violation of ORS 243.672(l)(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">In its final assignment of error, the association challenges ERB\u2019s dismissal of its claim under ORS 243.672(l)(b), which provides that it is an unfair labor practice for a public employer to \u00a3\u00a3[d]ominate, interfere with or assist in the formation, existence or administration of any employee organization.\u201d Our resolution of the association\u2019s first assignment of error compels a remand on this claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The association claimed that the district committed an unfair labor practice under ORS 243.672(l)(b) by (1) deducting the cost of monthly health insurance premiums from employees\u2019 salaries, and (2) arbitrarily refusing the association\u2019s offer to reimburse it for those costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">With regard to the first of those contentions \u2014 the district\u2019s deduction of the costs of health insurance premiums itself \u2014 ERB found that the association had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">\u201cfailed to demonstrate that the District\u2019s actions actually and adversely affected its ability to represent its members. Although the Association alleges that the District\u2019s requirement that teachers pay monthly fringe premium costs caused members to doubt the Association\u2019s ability to represent its members, its claims were purely speculative since it presented no evidence in support of this contention. <em>In addition, we have found that the District\u2019s choice to require each bargaining unit member to pay the cost of an entire month\u2019s fringe benefit premium was lawful and based on legitimate considerations. </em>Accordingly, the District\u2019s action did not violate subsection (l)(b).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">ERB separately addressed the association\u2019s contention that the district\u2019s refusal to accept the association\u2019s payment for the fringe benefit costs was also a violation of subsection (l)(b). Again, ERB found that the association had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>failed to provide proof of \u201cany actual loss of confidence in the Association that resulted from the District\u2019s conduct\u201d in that regard; it further found that \u201cthe District had valid reasons for refusing the Association\u2019s offer of payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">On review, the association challenges only the former \u2014 that is, ERB\u2019s conclusion that the district did not violate subsection (l)(b) by deducting the costs of the premiums.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that ERB\u2019s ruling cannot stand because it is predicated on ERB\u2019s erroneous conclusion that the district\u2019s decision to deduct employee fringe benefit premiums from employee paychecks was \u201clawful and based on legitimate considerations.\u201d We agree with the association as to this dispositive point: Because ERB\u2019s decision that the district did not violate subsection (l)(b) is dependent, at least in part, on its previous finding that the district\u2019s action in deducting the health insurance premiums from employees\u2019 paychecks was lawful \u2014 a finding that we have determined must be revisited in light of ERB\u2019s mischaracterization of the association\u2019s claim, <em>see </em>244 Or App at 207, 210 n 11 \u2014 ERB\u2019s decision was not based on substantial reason. Accordingly, we also reverse and remand ERB\u2019s dismissal of the association\u2019s subsection (l)(b) claim for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Reversed and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\"> The association also alleged violations of ORS 243.672(l)(a) based on the district\u2019s denial of contractual \u201cother paid\u201d leave and various conduct by district officials allegedly interfering with unit members\u2019 activity during the strike in retaliation for the exercise of their rights under PECBA. ERB found in favor of the district on the \u201cother paid\u201d leave issue and in favor of the association with respect to the remaining allegations. None of those rulings is at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-6\"> The association\u2019s original complaint was limited to allegations that that conduct violated ORS 243.672(l)(a) and (b). At the start of the ERB hearing, however, the association moved to amend its complaint to include allegations that the district\u2019s conduct also violated ORS 243.672(l)(e). The administrative law judge (ALJ) eventually denied the motion in his proposed order. ERB concluded that the ALJ should have allowed the motion to amend but the error was not prejudicial because the parties had been told that subsection (e) was an issue for the hearing and they had presented evidence and argument regarding it at the hearing and in their post-hearing briefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b220-8\"> The parties do not dispute that health insurance benefits are a mandatory subject of bargaining in this case. <em>See </em>ORS 243.650(4) (defining \u201ccollective bargaining\u201d to mean the performance of the mutual obligation of a public employer and employee representative to meet and confer in good faith with respect to employment relations); ORS 243.650(7)(a) (\u201c \u2018Employment relations\u2019 includes, but is not limited to, matters concerning direct or indirect monetary benefits, hours, vacations, sick leave, grievance procedures and other conditions of employment.\u201d); <em>Service Employees Int\u2019l Union Local 503 v. DAS, </em>183 Or App 594, 598, 54 P3d 1043 (2002) (recognizing that employee health insurance is an \u201cindirect monetary benefit\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b225-10\"> It was not until its reply brief before this court that the association made the qualitatively different argument that the expired collective bargaining agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>directly addressed the subject by <em>requiring </em>the payment of the full premium and, thus, that ERB had erred in even considering past practice. ERB never had an opportunity to address that question, and, hence, we do not address it either.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\"> This letter is also described in the factual allegations of the association\u2019s complaint. That allegation states, in part, \u201cCouncil\u2019s lawyer pointed out that it seemed clear that the District would have to pay for some portion of the fringe amounts it normally paid for licensed staff, since the strike lasted for just slightly more than half of November.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b227-6\"> It is possible that the confusion arose as a result of <em>the district\u2019s </em>characterization of the <em>association\u2019s </em>position during opening arguments before the ALJ. Specifically, counsel for the district plainly stated during his opening argument, \u201cThe union argues that the district should have deducted only a prorated share for the number of days of the strike.\u201d However, we do not agree that the district\u2019s characterization of the association\u2019s argument defeats the clear statements in the association\u2019s own pleadings, including, as described above, those in its post-hearing brief, which, of course, was submitted after that statement was made. ERB erred in accepting the district\u2019s characterization.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\"> We reject the association\u2019s assertion that this court \u201ccan reach the conclusions that * * * ERB should have reached, as a matter of law, based on the facts and inferences [ERB] declared, and despite [ERB\u2019s] misinterpretation of the Association\u2019s views on the <em>status quo </em>prior to the strike.\u201d We likewise reject the district\u2019s contention that, even if ERB misunderstood the association\u2019s status quo argument, we can nonetheless affirm ERB because \u201cwhat [the alleged] past practice may be or may not be is of no consequence because * * * ERB does not find evidence of any past practice and, in order to determine if ORS 243.672(l)(e) is violated, the past practice must first be identified.\u201d (Boldface omitted.) Those arguments should be addressed in the first instance by ERB, particularly in light of the remand required by our resolution of the association\u2019s second assignment of error. <em>Cf.

Hence, we do not address that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b229-9\"> ERB found that, before the strike, the district used two methods of calculating health insurance premium costs for teachers who were in unpaid status for some portion of the pay period: The first, as established by the three examples in the record, required teachers to pay the cost of an entire month\u2019s premium if they were in unpaid status for one-half or more of the days; the second, as established by the \u201cnegative inference\u201d that ERB derived from the district\u2019s failure to comply with the subpoena, see 244 Or App at 199, prorated premium costs and required teachers to pay a portion of the costs based on the number of days they were in unpaid status. The negative inference, of course, would have different implications under a proper characterization of the association\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\"> ERB first found that there necessarily was no derivative violation of the \u201cin\u201d prong of the statute because of its previous finding that the \u201cbecause of\u2019 prong was not violated. <em>See OPEU and Termine v.

ERB also found no independent violation of the \u201cin\u201d prong, stating only, <em>\u201cAs uie have discussed above, </em>a lawful employer action does not have the natural and probable effect of discouraging bargaining unit members from exercising their PECBA-protected rights.\u201d (Emphasis added.) ERB, however, did not analyze the lawfulness of the specific action challenged by the association \u2014 that is, deducting <em>any </em>amount of fringe benefit payments from employees\u2019 paychecks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\"> The association did not challenge ERB\u2019s ruling with respect to the district\u2019s refusal of its offer of reimbursement for the costs of the insurance premiums in its assignment of error and made no argument concerning that error in its opening brief; rather the issue was first presented in its reply brief.
