Access to her property is across a bridge that she also owns. Plaintiff purchased a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy from defendant State Farm. When the bridge collapsed, plaintiff made a claim under the policy. Defendant denied the claim, and plaintiff filed this action, seeking a declaration that the policy covers the cost of replacing the bridge. The trial court concluded on defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment that the collapse of the bridge is not covered under the policy, and plaintiff appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The parties\u2019 arguments on appeal address the proper interpretation of the insurance policy, which is a question of law. <em>Hoffman Construction Co. v. Fred S. James &amp; Co., </em>313 Or 464, 469-71, 836 P2d 703 (1992). In interpreting an insurance policy, the goal is to determine the intentions of the parties. <em>Holloway v. Republic Indemnity Co. of America, </em>341 Or 642, 649, 147 P3d 329 (2006). The parties\u2019 intentions are determined from the terms of the policy. <em>Groshong v. Mutual of Enumclaw Ins. Co., </em>329 Or 303, 307, 985 P2d 1284 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Thus, we begin with the policy. Section I of plaintiffs policy, entitled \u201cCoverages,\u201d includes the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">\u201cSECTION I \u2014 COVERAGES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">\u201cCOVERAGE A \u2014 DWELLING (INCLUDING PROVISIONS POTENTIALLY RESTRICTING OR ABRIDGING THE RIGHTS OF THE INSURED)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">\u201c1. Dwelling. We cover the dwelling used principally as a private residence on the residence premises shown in the Declarations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-10\">\u201cDwelling includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-11\">\u201ca. structures attached to the dwelling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-12\">\u201cb. materials and supplies located on or adjacent to the residence premises for use in the construction, alteration or repair of the dwelling or other structures on the residence premises;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\u201cc. foundation, floor slab and footings supporting the dwelling; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\">\u201cd. wall-to-wall carpeting attached to the dwelling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">\u201c2. Dwelling Extension. We cover other structures on the residence premises, separated from the dwelling by clear space. Structures connected to the dwelling by only a fence, utility line, or similar connection are considered to be other structures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">\u201cWe do not cover other structures:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">\u201ca. not permanently attached or otherwise forming a part of the realty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">\u201cb. used in whole or in part for business purposes; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">\u201cc. rented or held for rental to a person not a tenant of the dwelling, unless used solely as a private garage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">(Boldface and uppercase in original.) Section I also describes losses not insured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\">\u201cSECTION I \u2014 LOSSES NOT INSURED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-12\">\u201c1. We do not insure for any loss to the property described in Coverage A which consists of, or is directly and immediately caused by, one or more of the perils listed in items a through n. below, regardless of whether the loss occurs suddenly or gradually, involves isolated or widespread damage, arises from natural or external forces, or occurs as a result of any combination of these:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-13\">\u201ca. <em>collapse, </em>except as specifically provided in SECTION I \u2014 ADDITIONAL COVERAGES, Collapse[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">(Boldface and uppercase in original; italics added.) At \u201cSECTION I \u2014 ADDITIONAL COVERAGES,\u201d the policy lists an exception to the exclusion of collapse and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-15\">\u201c11. Collapse. We insure only for direct physical loss to covered property involving the sudden, entire collapse <em>of a building or any part of a building.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-16\">\u201cCollapse means actually fallen down or fallen into pieces. It does not include settling, crackling, shrinking, bulging, expansion, sagging or bowing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-18\">\u201cThe collapse must be directly and immediately caused only by one or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>\u201ca. perils described in SECTION I \u2014 LOSSES INSURED, COVERAGE B \u2014 PERSONAL PROPERTY. These perils apply to covered building and personal property for loss insured by this Additional Coverage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">\u201cb. hidden decay of a supporting or weight-bearing structural member of the building;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">\u201cc. hidden insect or vermin damage to a structural member of the building;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">\u201cd. weight or contents, equipment, animals or people;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">\u201ce. weight of ice, snow, sleet or rain which collects on a roof; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">\u201cf. use of defective material or methods in the construction (includes remodeling or renovation) of the building, if the collapse occurs during the course of the construction of the building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">\n<em>\u201cLoss to an awning, fence, patio, pavement, swimming pool, underground pipe, flue, drain, cesspool, septic tank, foundation, retaining wall, bulkhead pier, wharf, or dock is not included under the items b., c., d., e., and f. unless the loss is the direct and immediate cause of the collapse of the building.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">(Boldface and uppercase in original; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">It is undisputed that plaintiffs bridge consisted of two logs spanning the Santiam River and was covered with decking, planks, and metal grates. The bridge collapsed under the weight of a large tow truck. The parties have assumed, for the sake of this appeal, that the bridge \u201ccollapsed\u201d within the meaning of the policy due to one of the <em>causes </em>covered by the policy. The only dispute is whether the bridge was a \u201cbuilding\u201d within the meaning of the policy and therefore falls within the policy\u2019s exception to the exclusion for \u201ccollapse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">In arguing that the collapse of a bridge is covered by the policy, plaintiff does not seriously contend that the bridge was a \u201cdwelling,\u201d and we conclude that such an interpretation would be implausible. However, in plaintiffs view, the bridge was a \u201cdwelling extension\u201d within COVERAGE A because it was a \u201cstructure\u201d on the residence premises and, further, that the collapse of the bridge falls within the policy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>exception to the exclusion for \u201ccollapse,\u201d because the bridge was a \u201cbuilding.\u201d In the alternative, plaintiff contends that the meaning of the term \u201cbuilding\u201d as used in the policy is ambiguous and could plausibly encompass the bridge; therefore, according to plaintiff, the insurance contract must be interpreted in favor of the insured and the trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Defendant, for its part, agrees that the case turns on whether the bridge is a \u201cbuilding\u201d and reasons that the term, as used in the policy, unambiguously does not include a bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">As did the trial court, we conclude that the bridge is plausibly a \u201cdwelling extension\u201d within the meaning of COVERAGE A, because \u2014 depending on plaintiffs proof as to the location of the bridge \u2014 it is plausibly a \u201cstructure.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The exception to the collapse exclusion provides coverage for the collapse of a \u201cbuilding or any part of a building.\u201d Thus, coverage depends on whether the bridge is a \u201cbuilding or any part of a building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The term \u201cbuilding\u201d is not defined in the policy. In the absence of a policy definition, we \u201cresort to various aids of interpretation to discern the parties\u2019 intended meaning.\u201d <em>Groshong, </em>329 Or at 307-08. One such \u201caid\u201d is the determination whether the relevant terms have a \u201cplain meaning,\u201d determined by reference to the usual source of ordinary meaning, the dictionary. <em>Smith v. State Farm Insurance, </em>144 Or App 442, 447, 927 P2d 111 (1996). If a term has a plain meaning because it \u201cis susceptible to only one plausible interpretation,\u201d we will apply that meaning and conduct no further analysis. <em>Groshong, </em>329 Or at 308. If, however, the term has more than one plausible interpretation, we will \u201cexamine the phrase in light of \u2018the particular context in which that term is used in the policy and the broader context of the policy as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312, (quoting <em>Hoffman Construction Co., </em>313 Or at 470). If a term remains ambiguous because two or more plausible interpretations continue to be reasonable, we will interpret the provision against the insurance company and in favor of coverage. <em>Dewsnup v. Farmers Ins. Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>349 Or 33, 40, 239 P3d 493 (2010). In all events, the interpretation of an insurance contract must be based on the four corners of the document; extrinsic evidence is not admissible to determine its meaning. <em>Bresee Homes, Inc. v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, </em>227 Or App 587, 206 P3d 1091 (2009), <em>rev allowed, </em>347 Or 533 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">As pertinent here, <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>292 (unabridged ed 2002) defines a \u201cbuilding\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">\u201c1: a thing built: a : a constructed edifice designed to stand more or less permanently, covering a space of land, usu. covered by a roof and more or less completely enclosed by walls, and serving as a dwelling, storehouse, factory, shelter for animals, or other useful structure \u2014 distinguished from structures not designed for occupancy (as fences or monuments) and from structures not intended for use in one place (as boats or trailers) even though subject to occupancy^]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">(Boldface in original.) The dictionary provides both a broad definition \u2014 \u201ca thing built\u201d \u2014 and a narrower definition \u2014 \u201ca constructed edifice * * * usu. covered by a roof and more or less completely enclosed by walls, and serving as a dwelling * * * distinguished from structures not designed for occupancy (as fences or monuments)[.]\u201d <em>Cf. State v. Jenkins, </em>157 Or App 156, 159, 969 P2d 1048 (1998) (citing <em>Webster\u2019s </em>definition in support of conclusion that, for purposes of offense of burglary in the first degree, a bar area within a tavern is not a separate \u201cbuilding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Plaintiff contends that, in the context of the policy, the broader definition is plausibly applicable and that the bridge is covered by the policy because it is \u201ca thing built.\u201d We conclude that, considered in the context in which the term is used, the narrower definition is more plausible. Further, when the term is viewed in the context of the policy as a whole, the narrower common meaning of \u201cbuilding\u201d is the only plausible meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">First, as noted, the policy describes, as an exception to its \u201ccollapse\u201d exclusion, the \u201cdirect physical loss to covered property involving the sudden entire collapse of a building or any part of a building.\u201d The policy lists certain structures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>(\u201cawning, fence, patio, pavement, swimming pool, underground pipe, flue, drain, cesspool, septic tank, foundation, retaining wall, bulkhead pier, wharf, or dock\u201d) for which no collapse coverage is provided, \u201cunless the loss is the direct and immediate cause of the collapse of the building.\u201d Implicitly, the policy contemplates that the listed structures are not buildings, despite the fact that they are things \u201cbuilt.\u201d Thus, necessarily, the term \u201cbuilding\u201d has a meaning narrower than simply a \u201cthing built.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">That conclusion is borne out by the many references to \u201cbuilding\u201d throughout the policy. For example, the policy\u2019s \u201cwindstorm or hail\u201d peril \u201cdoes not include loss to the property contained in a building caused by rain, snow, sleet, sand or dust\u201d except \u201cwhen the direct force of wind or hail damages the building <em>causing an opening in a roof or wall </em>and rain, snow, sleet, sand or dust enters through this opening.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The policy\u2019s \u201cfalling object\u201d peril does not \u201cinclude loss to property contained <em>in a building unless the roof or an exterior wall of the building is first damaged by a falling object.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The peril of \u201cweight of ice, snow or sleet\u201d applies to \u201cdamage to property <em>contained in a building.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The policy covers \u201cdirect physical loss to a covered building or covered property <em>contained in a building </em>resulting from the eruption from a volcano.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It would seem from the various references to \u201cbuilding\u201d that the policy contemplates the narrower common meaning of \u201cbuilding\u201d and that a building is a structure that can contain things and that has walls and a roof; the disputed bridge had none of those characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Thus, we conclude that, under the unambiguous terms of the policy, the collapsed bridge was not a \u201cbuilding\u201d within the meaning of the policy and that the collapse of the bridge was not a covered loss. The trial court therefore did not err in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-6\"> We assume for the purposes of this appeal that the bridge is on the \u201cresidence premises.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
