J.</author>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction of reckless driving. ORS 811.140. She contends that the trial court erred by refusing to allow her to present evidence, pursuant to ORS 161.300, that she suffered from a mental disease or defect. We agree and therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The charged acts arose from an incident in which, as defendant\u2019s trial counsel phrased it, defendant \u201cdrove in a scary way and * * * in a way that alarmed other people.\u201d Before trial, defendant filed a notice of intent to offer evidence of a mental disease or defect to negate the \u201creckless\u201d mental state required by ORS 811.140. <em>See </em>ORS 161.309(2) (requiring a notice of intent to introduce expert testimony pursuant to ORS 161.300). The state moved to exclude such evidence, and the trial court granted the state\u2019s motion. The jury returned a guilty verdict, and the trial court entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Defendant appeals, asserting that ORS 161.300 may be applied to a defendant who is charged with an act requiring a mental state of recklessness. She contends that her interpretation of the statute is supported by its text, context, and legislative history. The legislative history, she argues, reveals an intent for the statute to apply to any offense with a specific, identifiable mental element, including a reckless state of mind. The state responds that, although the text is ambiguous, the legislative history suggests that the legislature did not intend for ORS 161.300 to extend to crimes in which the mental state is recklessness. We conclude that the legislative history supports applying ORS 161.300 to offenses requiring a reckless mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">We begin with the pertinent statutes. As noted, defendant was convicted of reckless driving under ORS 811.140. ORS 811.140(2) provides that \u201crecklessly,\u201d as used in the reckless driving statute, is defined in ORS 161.085. ORS 161.085(9) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">\u201c \u2018Recklessly,\u2019 when used with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense, means that a person is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard thereof constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">On the issue of recklessness, defendant sought to offer evidence under ORS 161.300, which provides, \u201cEvidence that the actor suffered from a mental disease or defect is admissible whenever it is relevant to the issue of whether the actor did or did not have the intent which is an element of the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The question for us, then, is whether the legislature intended ORS 161.300 to apply when a reckless mental state is an element of the charged crime. <em>See State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009) (explaining that the paramount goal in statutory interpretation is discerning the legislature\u2019s intent, which is accomplished by first examining statutory text and context, along with any useful legislative history). As the Supreme Court has observed, ORS 161.300 allows a defendant to offer mental disease or defect evidence \u201cto negate \u2018the intent which is an element of the crime.\u2019 One who succeeds in persuading the trier of fact with evidence admitted under this section is not guilty of the crime charged, because a necessary element of the crime is not established.\u201d <em>State v. Olmstead, </em>310 Or 455, 462, 800 P2d 277 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In <em>Olmstead, </em>the issue was whether the defendant could raise an insanity defense to charges of driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII) and driving while suspended (DWS). DUII and DWS are strict liability crimes involving no element of a culpable mental state. 310 Or at 461. ORS 161.300 did not apply in that case, because evidence bearing on intent is not material to a strict liability crime; nonetheless, the court examined ORS 161.300 to shed light on the insanity defense set out in ORS 161.295. 310 Or at 462-63. Thus, the analysis in <em>Olmstead </em>\u201csuggests that \u2018partial responsibility\u2019 evidence is inadmissible only when no \u2018culpable mental element\u2019 is alleged, <em>i.e., </em>when the crime charged is a strict liability crime.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>154 Or App 37, 46, 960 P2d 877 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">In <em>Smith, </em>we concluded that the defendant could offer evidence under ORS 161.300 where \u201cknowing\u201d conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>was charged. There, the defendant had been convicted of escape in the second degree. The indictment alleged that he had \u201cknowingly\u201d escaped from a correctional facility, and the defendant sought to offer evidence under ORS 161.300. 154 Or App at 39-40. We observed that, although the Criminal Code defines \u201c \u2018intentionally or \u2018with intent,\u2019 \u201d ORS 161.085(7), ORS 161.300 instead uses the term \u201cintent,\u201d which is not defined in the Criminal Code. <em>Smith, </em>154 Or App at 47. We noted that, in common usage, \u201cintent\u201d could refer to \u201ca particular mental state\u201d but also could refer to a \u201c \u2018state of mind or mental attitude\u2019 more generally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1176 (unabridged ed 1993)). That latter reading is \u201csyntactically more logical, because ORS 161.300 refers to <em>\u2018the </em>intent which is an element of the crime.\u2019 (Emphasis supplied.) Such a grammatical structure suggests that there are several \u2018intents,\u2019 any of which could be <em>\u2018the\u2019 </em>intent that is an element of a particular crime.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>154 Or App at 47-48 (footnote and citation omitted; emphasis in <em>Smith). </em>After turning to legislative history to resolve the ambiguity, we concluded that \u201cthe intent which is an element of the crime,\u201d as used in ORS 161.300, was meant to, \u201cat least, include the \u2018knowing\u2019 mental state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50. <em>Smith </em>thus identified the ambiguity in ORS 161.300 but did not decide the question that we confront here: whether the legislature intended \u201cthe intent which is an element of the crime\u201d to include a mental state of recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">ORS 161.300 was enacted as part of the comprehensive revision of substantive criminal law proposed by the Criminal Law Revision Commission. Despite some early discussions that suggest a narrower understanding, the legislative history suggests that ORS 161.300 \u2014 which was Article 5, section 2, of the Commission\u2019s preliminary drafts and section 37 of the final draft \u2014 applies broadly enough to include a culpable mental state of recklessness. Professor George Platt, the reporter for Article 5, told the Criminal Law Revision Commission that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">\u201c[a] person charged with a crime with a specific culpability element such as intent or knowledge \u2014 burglary, for example \u2014 under section 2 could raise the partial responsibility defense and then produce evidence he was suffering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>from a mental disease or defect which would interfere with his ability to form the requisite knowledge or intent to commit the burglary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Minutes, Criminal Law Revision Commission, Sept 12,1969, 6. Similarly, Platt told the Senate committee considering the proposed revisions that section 37 \u201cis a defense where the mental disease or makeup of the defendant may interfere with his ability to form the particular kind of intent required as a material element of the crime.\u201d Minutes, Senate Committee on Criminal Law and Procedure, SB 40, Feb 10, 1971, 3. Platt further explained that section 37 \u201cis not a lack of responsibility which will excuse crime of any sort; it will excuse only crime charged which requires the state [to] show a specific mental element.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Later in that hearing, Frank Knight of the District Attorneys Association argued that section 37 was unnecessary in light of the proposed changes to the law concerning homicide; he further suggested that section 37 would relate only to crimes requiring a specific intent. <em>Id. </em>at 8-9. Platt then told the committee that section 37</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">\u201cwould apply to many kinds of crimes, other than homicide, where there is a specific, identifiable intent as a material element. He disagreed with Mr. Knight, contending that the partial responsibility defense does still directly relate to the new homicide provisions in the Proposed Code because under the new provisions, murder may only be committed intentionally, knowingly or recklessly with extreme indifference to life. All of these mental elements take a conscious formation of some capacity in the person\u2019s mind in order for him to understand that he is acting intentionally, knowingly or with extreme indifference to human life. The defendant should be allowed to present his evidence to try to convince a jury that because of mental disease or defect he was not capable of acting with these elements, which, if believed by a jury, would reduce his crime of murder to a lesser included crime of homicide, probably negligent homicide.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 9. In short, Platt\u2019s explanations to the legislature suggested that section 37 would apply if a mental disease or defect might prevent a defendant from consciously forming a mental element required as part of a crime \u2014 including, in the example of homicide, a mental state of recklessness with extreme indifference to human life.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The commentary to section 37 gives examples of the section\u2019s applicability to crimes such as burglary and first-degree murder, explaining that a defendant\u2019s mental disease or defect might directly affect his ability to form the specific intent or purpose required for those crimes. Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 37 (July 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Consistently with the more plausible reading of the text of ORS 161.300, the legislative history suggests that the legislature meant \u201cthe intent which is an element of the crime\u201d in ORS 161.300 to include a mental state of recklessness. Platt\u2019s statements and the commentary suggest that ORS 161.300 applies whenever a mental state element may be negated by evidence of a defendant\u2019s mental disease or defect. Like an intentional or knowing mental state, recklessness includes a subjective component that may be affected by a mental disease or defect. In this case, the crime of reckless driving requires such a subjective component: awareness of and conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk. ORS 161.085(9). We therefore conclude that a defendant who is charged with a crime requiring proof of a \u201creckless\u201d mental state may offer evidence under ORS 161.300 to negate that element. Thus, in this case, the trial court erred by granting the state\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of defendant\u2019s mental disease or defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
