We allow DLCD\u2019s petition for reconsideration and adhere to our opinion as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Specifically, DLCD seeks reconsideration of the final two sentences of the second paragraph of footnote 5 of our opinion that state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">\u201cOn appeal, the parties make different assertions as to whether the numerator in the expenditure ratio is approximately $500,000, as determined by the county, or approximately $900,000, as noted by the circuit court. We need not resolve that issue because it was not assigned as error on appeal. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (providing, in part, that \u2018[n]o matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court and is assigned as error in the opening brief in accordance with this rule\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">242 Or App at 584 n 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">On reconsideration we modify the second paragraph of footnote 5 to state as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">\u201cOn appeal, the parties make different assertions as to whether the numerator in the expenditure ratio is approximately $500,000, as determined by the county, or approximately $900,000, as noted by the circuit court.
