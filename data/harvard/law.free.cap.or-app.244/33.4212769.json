J.</author>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Petitioners Oregon Shores Conservation Coalition (OSCC) and Richard and Patricia Rowland (collectively petitioners)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal from the circuit court\u2019s judgment in a writ of review proceeding that affirmed respondent Clatsop County\u2019s determination that respondents James and Virginia Carlson (the Carlsons) have a vested right to complete development of a residential subdivision in compliance with county and state waivers issued pursuant to Ballot Measure 37 (2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">On appeal, petitioners advance three assignments of error. First, petitioners contend that the circuit court erred in concluding that the Carlsons had a vested right because the Carlsons had not \u201cobtained preliminary approval or any building permits, nor begun construction on residential buildings\u201d prior to the effective date of Measure 49. We reject that argument for the reasons set out in <em>Friends of Yamhill County v. Board of Commissioners, </em>237 Or App 149, 166, 238 P3d 1016 (2010), <em>rev allowed, </em>349 Or 602 (2011) <em>(Friends).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Second, petitioners argue that the county and the circuit court erred by failing to consider whether the Carlsons\u2019 use complied with the state and county Measure 37 waivers that they had obtained, as required by section 5(3) of Measure 49.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Carlsons respond that this issue was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>properly before the circuit court, and it is not before this court, because the question of whether the use of the property complied with the Measure 37 waiver orders was adjudicated as part of the Carlsons\u2019 preliminary subdivision application by the Clatsop County Planning Commission. Because our resolution of the third assignment of error requires a remand in this case, we decline to address that assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Third, petitioners argue that the circuit court erred in concluding that the Carlsons had established a vested right in their proposed residential subdivision because (a) the circuit court miscalculated the \u201cexpenditure ratio\u201d by failing to consider as part of the denominator the cost of building homes on the property as of December 6, 2007; (b) the Carlsons\u2019 expenditures indicated a \u201crush to vest\u201d and demonstrated \u201cbad faith\u201d; (c) the Carlsons\u2019 expenditures were adaptable to an alternative use; and (d) those expenditures did not rise above \u201cmere preparation.\u201d We reject petitioners\u2019 \u201cbad faith\u201d argument for the reasons set forth in <em>Friends. See id. </em>at 176. However, as explained below, petitioners\u2019 argument that the circuit court miscalculated the expenditure ratio is well taken, and, because that error requires a remand to afford the board the opportunity to apply the correct legal standard, we decline to consider petitioners\u2019 arguments regarding adaptability and \u201cmere preparation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">In a cross-assignment of error, the Carlsons argue that the circuit court erred by declining to dismiss DLCD as a party for lack of standing. Further, the Carlsons argue that, because DLCD lacked standing to participate in the writ of review proceeding, petitioners \u2014 who intervened with DLCD \u2014 also lacked standing and, thus, the circuit court erred by not dismissing petitioners as parties as well. We reject the Carlsons\u2019 cross-assignment without further discussion, for the reasons set forth in <em>DLCD v. Crook County, </em>242 Or App 580, 588-91, 256 P3d 178 (2011)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The material facts are uncontroverted. Since 1957, the Carlsons have owned a 75.65 acre parcel of land in rural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Clatsop County. In 2006, the Carlsons obtained state and county waivers authorizing them to divide that property into 43 parcels and to place a dwelling on each parcel. The Carlsons subsequently applied for preliminary plat approval for a 31-lot subdivision and expended approximately $244,000, of which the circuit court determined that $163,000 had been incurred before Measure 49 became effective on December 6, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Thereafter, the Carlsons applied to the county\u2019s Director of Transportation and Development Services for a determination that they had a vested right to complete and continue the use described in the Measure 37 waivers. DLCD and petitioners submitted comments in response to the application; OSCC specifically argued that the Carlsons\u2019 proposed subdivision was inconsistent with the Measure 37 waivers that they had obtained. The director determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">\u201c[T]he Carlsons have expended just over $82,000 in includable expenses, only 2% to 3% of the total cost to develop their property as a residential subdivision, and therefore do not meet the ratio test in <em>Holmes. </em>The Carlsons acted in good faith in the initial planning and design of their property (pursuant to their waivers), but their actions in seeking preliminary plat approval and the date on which they began development on the property indicate a rush to beat the effective date of Measure 49. * * * Furthermore, the actual construction was limited to septic test holes and approvals that took place after the effective date of Measure 49. While much of the planning and design expenditures cannot be used for a permitted use, the Carlsons could have seen a return to their investments if they had applied for 1-10 lots under Measure 49.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">\u201cComparing the Carlsons\u2019 case to others in Oregon in which owners have been found to have a vested right, the Carlsons\u2019 actions do not rise to the level of a vested right. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>* * * The Carlsons have only tested for septic test holes, and this development took place after Measure 49 was effective. Finally, the proposed development, if construction takes place, is not in compliance with the Carlsons\u2019 state Measure 37 waiver, which is required for the Carlsons to continue development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\">\u201cConsidering all the <em>Holmes </em>factors, the Carlsons have not demonstrated a common law vested right to continue and complete the use permitted by their Measure 37 waivers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Significantly, unlike in other cases that we have considered,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the director determined that, in calculating the vested right expenditure ratio, the cost of residences must be included in the denominator. The director noted that the Carlsons had not included the cost of constructing homes on each lot in the subdivision, but the director estimated that, assuming an average price per square foot of $120 and a residence with an area of between 1,500 and 2,500 square feet, the total cost to complete the project was \u201clikely between five and eight million dollars.\u201d It followed, the director concluded, that the Carlsons had expended between two and three percent of the total project cost.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Pursuant to a local procedure, the Carlsons appealed the director\u2019s decision to the board of commissioners, and, again, DLCD and petitioners submitted comments. The board\u2019s decision examined only the vesting factors codified in Clatsop County Ordinance 08-06.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> With respect to the expenditure ratio, the board disagreed with the director, explaining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>\u201c[w]e find that depending upon whether the Measure 37 costs, interest costs, and appeal costs are included in the numerator, the [Carlsons] have expended between $124,000 and $244,000 toward the completion of this project. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-4\">\u201cIf the costs of home construction do not need to be included in the total project cost, then the denominator of the ratio is between $522,000 and $642,000. Depending on what numerator as described above is included, and incorporating the respective limits of the numerator and denominator, the [Carlsons] have expended somewhere between 23% and 38% of the total project cost. The cost to complete the infrastructure is based on the [Carlsons\u2019] engineer\u2019s estimate provided by the [Carlsons]. We find that estimate to be credible, and no evidence to the contrary was presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">\u201cIf the costs of home construction must be included, then the denominator must be recalculated. We find that the [Carlsons] qualified expert, who performed a specific market analysis of the project <em>based on current market conditions, </em>to be credible. While the County Staffs estimate is certainly one method to value what is otherwise a purely speculative model, it was based on generalized numbers from historic building permits from a broad geographic area. In this case, we find the [Carlsons\u2019] evidence more specific and persuasive than the County Staffs hypothetical. Therefore, the denominator of the ratio, if housing costs are included, is between $1,575,000 and $2,467,000, depending on what costs are allowed in the numerator and whether site built, modular, or manufactured homes are assumed. Depending on the scenario, the [Carlsons] [are] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>between 5.3% and 14.4% complete with the project, assuming housing costs must be included.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\">\u201cWhile we decline to pass judgment on whether housing costs must be included, we find that the [Carlsons] [have] proved by a preponderance of the evidence that depending upon one\u2019s interpretation of the ratio guideline, the project is at least 5.3% complete, and may be up to 38% complete. This range is within the ranges found in prior decisions that weigh in favor of the [Carlsons]. In any event, we believe the guideline is best described as one of substantiality, and the [Carlsons] have made a substantial investment towards completion of the project. We find that this factor weighs in favor of the [Carlsons].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">(Emphasis added.) The expert witness reported that the Carlsons\u2019 proffered estimate had been prepared by a real estate appraiser based on market conditions as of August 2008. As the appraiser opined in his report, \u201c[t]here has been a dramatic change in the residential real estate market since its peak in mid-2005, and its recent sharp decline, noted especially since the beginning of2008.\u201d The appraiser\u2019s \u201clocal market analysis\u201d was based on residential sales in Clatsop County that occurred in June and July of 2008. The board ultimately concluded that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">\u201c[t]aken together, and considering all of the evidence in totality, we find that by a preponderance of the evidence sufficient factors weigh in favor of the [Carlsons], and conclude that the [Carlsons] [have] established a vested right to continue the use permitted under Measure 37.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">DLCD sought review of the board\u2019s decision, by way of writ of review, in the circuit court. As noted, petitioners intervened in support of DLCD.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">The court\u2019s reasoning, expressed in its letter opinion, was limited to the vesting factors that the board considered. The court concluded that the board\u2019s determination that the Carlsons had established a vested right was supported by substantial evidence. Insofar as the expenditure ratio was concerned, the court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">\u201c[t]he board did not provide a breakdown of the expenses provided by [the] Carlson[s], although the director\u2019s initial decision * * * provided such an analysis which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>the board apparently considered when coming up with a range of figures. The board\u2019s low end figure appears to deduct everything the director indicated should be deducted. The upper figure appears to include everything claimed by [the] Carlson[s]. From the vested rights cases, it would appear the low end figure plus what [the] Carlson[s] spent on the Measure 37 process would be included in the numerator, thus a figure of $163,000. I have not found a case which indicates interest is factored into the determination and neither party has provided any citations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\">\u201cThe closer question is what figure goes into the denominator. The state/interveners argue building costs must be included[.] * * * While those cases provide some authority for their arguments, it is questionable whether <em>Webber [v. Clackamas County, </em>42 Or App 151, 600 P2d 448 (1979),] is still considered viable and the court did not specifically indicate in <em>Cook </em>[v. <em>Clackamas County, </em>50 Or App 75, 622 P2d 1107, <em>rev den, 290 Or 853 </em>(1981),] or <em>Milcrest </em>[v. <em>Clackamas County, </em>59 Or App 177, 650 P2d 963 (1982),] if building costs still must be included. * * * The board chose to believe [the] Carlsons\u2019 project did not include actual building of houses and the court cannot overturn that factual finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">\u201cIn any event, the board expressly chose to believe the Carlson[s\u2019] expert regarding building costs and rejected other evidence regarding a more likely building cost. My review of the exhibits indicates houses that will be place[d] on the lots will be high end ones and not modular or mobile homes. * * * Even if building costs must be included in the ratio test, the figures found by the board would still indicate substantial expenditure to satisfy this requirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The circuit court entered a judgment affirming the board\u2019s decision. Petitioners appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">On appeal, OSCC renews its argument that the board and the circuit court erred by \u201cruling that [the Carlsons] established a vested right in the proposed residential subdivision,\u201d specifically with regard to the circuit court\u2019s calculation of the expenditure ratio. We have previously addressed contentions that are identical or closely resemble those of the parties in this case. In <em>Biggerstaff v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>240 Or App 46, 54, 245 P3d 688 (2010), we summarized the pertinent governing principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u201cIn <em>Friends of Yamhill County, </em>we reasoned that, in determining whether a vested right exists in this context, consideration of the expenditure ratio is \u2018necessary.\u2019 237 Or App at 178. More recently, <em>in Kleikamp v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>240 Or App 57, 65-66, 246 P3d 56 (2010), we reiterated the fundamental underpinnings of our directive in <em>Friends of Yamhill County. </em>More specifically, we noted that, in all but the most exceptional case, \u2018a landowner\u2019s proof of \u201csubstantial expenditures\u201d is the <em>sine qua non </em>of a vesting determination\u2019 and that, \u2018[f]or vesting purposes, we understand that the concept of \u201csubstantial expenditures\u201d * * * requires an examination of both the absolute amount expended and the percentage yielded by the expenditure ratio.\u2019 <em>Kleikamp, </em>240 Or App at 65, 66.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-4\">\u201cConsideration of the expenditure ratio requires, in turn, that a landowner demonstrate the total project cost\u2014 that is, \u2018the <em>likely costs </em>of completing the particular development sought to be vested <em>based on construction costs as of December 6, </em>2007.\u2019 <em>Friends of Yamhill County, </em>237 Or App at 178 (emphasis added). Significantly, in <em>Kleikamp, </em>we also explained that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">\u201c \u2018a cogent assessment of total project cost (and, concomitantly, the expenditure ratio) will, in turn, require particular identification of the development that the property owner sought to vest as of December 6, 2007. * * * Thus, it is incumbent on the property owner to establish the likely total project cost in relation to the size and character of the structures that the owner contemplated building in compliance with a Measure 37 waiver as of December 6, 2007.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">(Second brackets and omissions in <em>Biggerstaff.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Consistently with those principles, we conclude, as we did in <em>Friends of Yamhill County, Biggerstaff, </em>and <em>Kleikamp, </em>that the circuit court \u201cshould have remanded for the county to determine the extent and general cost of the project to be vested and to give proper weight to the expenditure ratio factor in the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Friends, </em>237 Or App at 178. In this case, the board determined that the denominator did not have to include the cost of the residences that were sought to be developed, and the circuit court followed that same analysis. In the alternative, both the board and the circuit court considered building costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>taken from the Carlsons\u2019 appraiser\u2019s report that were based on construction costs as of August 2008, not as of December 6, 2007, the effective date of Measure 49. Those are legal errors that require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-7\"> Petitioners intervened in the writ of review proceeding after the State of Oregon, through the Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD), filed a petition for a writ of review of the county\u2019s vested rights determination. DLCD is not a party on appeal. Further, although named as a respondent, Clatsop County has not appeared on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b55-8\"> This is one of many recent cases concerning whether a property owner has a vested right to complete development in compliance with a Measure 37 waiver after the voters approved Ballot Measure 49 (2007), which \u201cnarrowed the effect of Measure 37, including a reduction in the degree of residential development allowed under a requested Measure 37 waiver.\u201d <em>Friends of Yamhill County v.

Section 7 permits discretionary approval of up to 10 homesites under a more narrow set of circumstances.\u201d <em>Friends of Yamhill County, </em>237 Or App at 153 n 1.

The circuit court adopted the figure of $163,000 based on the Carlsons claimed total expenditures of approximately $179,000, minus the nine percent interest the Carlsons had included in that figure.
