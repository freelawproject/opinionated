Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">We state the facts consistently with the trial court\u2019s express and implied findings, limiting our review to the record before the court at the time it decided the motion. <em>State v. Saunders, </em>221 Or App 116, 118, 188 P3d 449, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 416 (2008). At 1:05 a.m. on a cold December night, Bonds, a deputy sheriff for the Columbia County Sheriffs Office, observed a pickup truck illegally parked on the side of a rural road in a remote area. Bonds stopped his marked patrol car \u201cabout two car lengths\u201d behind the truck in order to do \u201ca welfare check.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was dark and there were no street lights. The truck\u2019s windows were \u201cfogged up,\u201d but Bonds could see defendant and a girl wrapped in a brown sleeping bag sitting in the middle of the front seat of the truck. They were face-to-face, \u201clike she was sitting on his lap.\u201d Bonds turned on his spotlight and directed it into the cab. The girl\u2019s breasts were bare, and defendant was shirtless. Both occupants \u201cwere frantically moving around, putting on clothing.\u201d Bonds immediately noticed that the girl looked 15 or 16 years old, and he suspected that a sex crime had occurred. He waited a moment before approaching the vehicle to allow the occupants to dress.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Bonds was in uniform and his badge was visible. When he approached the vehicle, the window was down and defendant was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. Defendant appeared to be over 18 years old. Both he and the girl were \u201cout of breath and sweaty.\u201d The girl stated that she was 16 years old. Bonds requested and obtained defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license, which indicated that he was 20 years old. Bonds ran a warrant check, which came back negative, but retained defendant\u2019s license. Bonds asked defendant why they were parked there, and defendant responded that they had stopped to \u201cmake out.\u201d The girl also stated that \u201cthey were just making out.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">By that time, another deputy, Hinkle, had arrived. He parked behind Bonds\u2019s patrol car and turned on his rear-facing blue and red strobe lights, which were \u201cfairly bright.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bonds left the truck for a few minutes in order to apprise Hinkle of the situation and to ask him to interview the girl. Bonds then returned to the truck and asked defendant if he would \u201cvoluntarily\u201d exit the vehicle and accompany Bonds to the front of his patrol car. Defendant agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Hinkle interviewed the girl, who remained seated in the truck, while Bonds questioned defendant at the front of his patrol car. Although Hinkle spoke to defendant on a \u201climited basis,\u201d he did not engage in any questioning of defendant. A third deputy, Harper, arrived sometime after Hinkle. Harper did not participate in the interviews but provided \u201ccover\u201d and stood \u201caround either one of [the other deputies] or in that area.\u201d The spotlight remained on during the course of the interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In response to questioning, defendant at first denied \u201ceven what [Bonds] had seen happen[ ].\u201d Bonds continued to question defendant, but defendant was \u201cnot really forthcoming.\u201d Throughout the interview, Bonds periodically conferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>with Hinkle. According to Bonds, \u201c[t]here were several times that I would walk over to Deputy Hinkle and we\u2019d discuss what the girl was telling him and what I was being told, see if the stories were matching.\u201d Bonds would then go \u201cback to [defendant]\u201d and, as the trial court found, \u201c[tell] Defendant during the questioning that his story did not \u2018match\u2019 that of the alleged victim, and impl[y] that she had already accused the Defendant of facts amounting to a crime.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Over the course of an hour, Bonds told defendant \u201cfive or six times\u201d that \u201cwe knew what was going on, we\u2019d been talking to the girl, we knew, so I needed him to tell me the truth\u201d and admonished him to \u201ctell me exactly what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">After the fifth or sixth attempt by Bonds to elicit more information, defendant made incriminating statements. Bonds then cited defendant and, as he did so, \u201callowed [defendant] to sit in his vehicle\u201d because defendant had said that he was cold. At no point during the 60-minute encounter was defendant given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Moreover, as Bonds testified and the trial court found, defendant was not free to leave until he had been cited and his license was returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Defendant was charged with two counts of third-degree sexual abuse. Prior to trial, he moved to suppress the incriminating statements that he made during the encounter with police. He argued that, among other things, the circumstances became compelling during the course of the stop and that, because the police had failed to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings, his statements were obtained in violation of Article I, section 12. After a hearing on the matter, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The court reasoned that, although defendant was not free to leave during the encounter, the \u201cimplications made by Deputy Bonds to the Defendant, regarding the alleged victim\u2019s statements, do not appear to be any more coercive than those in <em>[State v. Shaff, </em>343 Or 639, 175 P3d 454 (2007)].\u201d Consequently, the court concluded that \u201cthe stop and ensuing investigation did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>not ever rise to the level of circumstances sufficiently compelling to require suppression of Defendant\u2019s statements.\u201d Defendant was subsequently convicted of two counts of sexual abuse in the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">On appeal, defendant renews his contention that the circumstances of the stop were compelling and points to several facts in support of that argument: the questioning took place late at night on a secluded road; a spotlight, as well as blue and red flashing lights, remained on throughout the stop; the encounter lasted an hour, during which defendant was outside in the cold weather; defendant was unable to terminate the encounter; the deputy exerted at least some control over defendant\u2019s movement when he asked defendant to stand at the front of the patrol car and when he later \u201callowed\u201d defendant to return to the truck; and defendant was repeatedly pressured to divulge more information until he ultimately relented and did so. The state responds that a reasonable person would not have felt compelled to answer the deputy\u2019s questions under the circumstances: the questioning took place on a public road; the interview was a one-on-one exchange; the duration of the stop was reasonable; and the deputy used no coercive tactics and made no show of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">To protect a person\u2019s right against compelled self-incrimination under Article, section 12, \u201cbefore questioning, police must give <em>Miranda </em>warnings to a person who is in full custody or in circumstances that create a setting which judges would and officers should recognize to be compelling.\u201d <em>State v. Roble-Baker, </em>340 Or 631, 638, 136 P3d 22 (2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Whether a defendant was in compelling circumstances \u201cturns on how a reasonable person in the [defendant\u2019s] position would have understood his or her situation.\u201d <em>Shaff, </em>343 Or at 645. In making that determination, a number of considerations may be relevant: \u201c(1) the location of the encounter; (2) the length of the encounter; (3) the amount of pressure exerted on the defendant; and (4) the defendant\u2019s ability to terminate the encounter.\u201d <em>Roble-Baker, </em>340 Or at 640-41 (citations omitted). Other factors that we have considered include \u201cthe number of officers and police cars at the scene, the demeanor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>the investigating officer, and the use of physical force or confinement during questioning.\u201d <em>State v. Nunez, </em>243 Or App 246, 253, 259 P3d 941 (2011) (citation omitted). However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\">\u201c[t]hose factors are neither the exclusive factors that this court will consider, nor are they to be applied mechanically. Rather, in determining whether the police placed a defendant in compelling circumstances, this court will consider all the circumstances, and its overarching inquiry is whether the officers created the sort of police-dominated atmosphere that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were intended to counteract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-5\"><em>Roble-Baker, </em>340 Or at 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In this case, the questioning took place late at night on a remote country road. Although that locale was, strictly speaking, a public place, <em>see State v. Schwerbel, </em>233 Or App 391, 397, 226 P3d 100, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 172 (2010) (noting that public location of the encounter made circumstances less compelling), it was not a setting familiar to defendant and was, in some sense, secluded. <em>Cf. Shaff, </em>343 Or at 646 (\u201c[T]he fact that the interview occurs in familiar surroundings[, such as a person\u2019s home,] diminishes the police-dominated atmosphere[.]\u201d). Similarly, although the duration of the encounter \u2014 one hour \u2014 does not, by itself, suggest that the circumstances were compelling, defendant was subjected to the cold weather during most of that time. <em>Compare Saunders, </em>221 Or App at 119-20 (interview in the defendant\u2019s home, which lasted one and a half hours, was not compelling), <em>with Schwerbel, </em>233 Or App at 397-98 (circumstances became compelling during traffic stop although encounter lasted less than 15 minutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Bonds did not raise his voice, threaten defendant, or apply any physical restraints.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, although there were three officers at the scene, the interview with defendant was primarily one-on-one. On the other hand, factors weighing in favor of a conclusion of compelling circumstances include that a spotlight and blue and red flashing lights shone throughout the questioning, defendant\u2019s license was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>retained, defendant was not free to leave, and defendant was under Bonds\u2019s supervision throughout the encounter except for brief periods when Bonds conferred nearby with another officer. <em>See State v. McMillan, </em>184 Or App 63, 68, 55 P3d 537 (2002), <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 355 (2003) (finding that compelling circumstances existed where, among other things, a police officer took and retained the defendant\u2019s cell phone, the defendant was not free to leave, the officer supervised the defendant closely during the stop, and the officer confronted the defendant with incriminating evidence); <em>State v. Nevel, </em>126 Or App 270, 276, 868 P2d 1338 (1994) (among the factors contributing to a lack of compelling circumstances was the fact that \u201cnone [of the patrol cars] had on flashing lights, a siren or a spotlight\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Those factors standing alone might not give rise to compelling circumstances. <em>See, e.g., McMillan, </em>184 Or App at 68 (explaining that, although the stop involved lights and a siren, the defendant was not free to leave, and the officer supervised the defendant closely, \u201c[t]hose factors * * * are present in many stops, and they are insufficient standing alone to make the circumstances * * * sufficiently compelling to require <em>Miranda </em>warnings\u201d). However, in this case, there is an additional factor to consider: Bonds told defendant that his story did not match the alleged victim\u2019s account and implied that she had accused him of facts amounting to a crime. Bonds repeatedly pressured defendant to tell him more while confronting him with that false evidence of guilt. The Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[W]hat matters is not whether evidence of guilt was apparent to the suspect; rather, it is whether the officers used that evidence in a coercive manner.\u201d <em>Shaff, </em>343 Or at 650. We conclude that the officer\u2019s repeated commands to divulge more information, coupled with his implications of guilt, gave the encounter coercive overtones. <em>See Roble-Baker, </em>340 Or at 643 (noting that officers \u201cheightened the intensity of the inquiry by putting questions to [the] defendant that assumed her guilt\u201d). In light of that factor, and the other factors discussed above, compelling circumstances existed that warranted the administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Our decision is informed by <em>Shaff. </em>In that case, two officers went to the defendant\u2019s home after receiving a report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>that a woman there had been injured. 343 Or at 641. One officer engaged in a general conversation with the defendant. When the subject matter turned to the woman\u2019s injuries, the defendant denied inflicting them. The officer \u201cdid not press the point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 642. After about 10 minutes, the second officer walked by with the woman. The officer speaking with the defendant then remarked that it was obvious that the woman had been assaulted and falsely suggested to the defendant that the woman had accused him of that crime. The defendant then made incriminating statements. The court concluded that the circumstances were not compelling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-4\">\u201cIn this case, [the officer] raised the issue whether the argument had become physical only twice during his approximately 10-minute conversation with defendant. The first time, the officer did not pursue the point after defendant\u2019s denial. The second time the officer raised the issue, he did so only after seeing, and noting, the woman\u2019s obvious injuries. The officer\u2019s questions were not coercive, aggressive, or repetitive. * * * Given the location of the encounter, the brief time that it lasted, and the absence of any \u2018heightened level of activity\u2019 by the officers, evidence that an assault had occurred (whether apparent to defendant or reflected in the officer\u2019s questions) is not sufficient to say that the officers had placed defendant in compelling circumstances that required <em>Miranda </em>warnings under the Oregon Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 650-51. <em>Cf. Roble-Baker, </em>340 Or at 643-44 (circumstances were compelling where the defendant was subjected to questioning at police headquarters for five to six hours, the defendant was effectively unable to terminate the encounter, and officers asked the defendant questions that assumed her guilt); <em>State v. Machain, </em>233 Or App 65, 75-76, 225 P3d 75 (2009) (circumstances were compelling where, among other factors, officers repeatedly told the defendant that they knew what happened and that she needed to tell the truth and asked her questions that assumed her guilt).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Unlike <em>Shaff, </em>here the encounter was prolonged and the officer persistently pressured defendant for more information in ways that assumed defendant\u2019s guilt. Moreover, the setting of the encounter was inhospitable and unfamiliar: defendant was isolated on a remote country road late at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>night, he had to endure the frigid December weather, and he was questioned under the glare of a spotlight. Defendant was not free to leave and was subjected to close supervision. In sum, the officers \u201ccreated the sort of police-dominated atmosphere that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were intended to counteract.\u201d <em>Roble-Baker, </em>340 Or at 641. Consequently, because defendant was not advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, his incriminating statements should have been suppressed. The trial court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-6\"> Defendant advances two other assignments of error. However, we need not address those claims, because we conclude that defendant\u2019s first assignment of error provides grounds for reversal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\"> Article I, section 12, provides, in part, that \u201c[n]o person shall * * * be compelled in any criminal prosecution to testify against himself.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b311-8\"> Bonds alternately described the distance between the vehicles as \u201c30 [or] 40 feet.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\"> The exact sequence of the statements is not clear.
