J.</author>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">After receiving a citizen\u2019s report about a suspected drunk driver, the police located defendant, whose vehicle matched the caller\u2019s description, and arrested him. One of the officers, Moyle, drove defendant to jail, escorted him to a small room, and asked him whether he wanted to contact \u201canyone for advice.\u201d Defendant stated that he did, and Moyle gave defendant 20 minutes to contact someone. Defendant attempted to call his attorney during that time but was unsuccessful. Moyle then told defendant that his time was up and asked defendant whether he would submit to a breath test. Defendant, unable to contact his lawyer, refused to submit to the test. He was ultimately charged with driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII), ORS 813.010, and a jury found him guilty. Defendant now appeals, arguing that the trial court should have suppressed evidence of his refusal to take the breath test and, in any event, should have declared a mistrial when the prosecutor later referred to defendant\u2019s statement that he refused to take the test on advice of counsel as an \u201cexcuse\u201d for not taking the test. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">PRIVATE COMMUNICATION WITH COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Before trial, defendant moved to suppress evidence of his refusal to take the breath test on the ground that the police had not provided him with a reasonable opportunity to communicate privately with counsel before deciding whether to submit to the test. <em>See State v. Durbin, </em>335 Or 183, 190, 63 P3d 576 (2003) (\u201c[W]hen an individual has a constitutional right to consult with counsel, that right includes the right to confer privately with counsel.\u201d). In his first assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\u201cWe state the facts consistently with the trial court\u2019s factual findings and its decision denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.\u201d <em>State v. Shaff, </em>343 Or 639, 641, 175 P3d 454 (2007). Officer Moyle arrested defendant for DUII around midnight and transported him to the jail. On the way, Moyle mentioned to defendant that a breath test would be offered at the jail. When they arrived, Moyle completed the booking process and then walked defendant \u201cinto the Intoxilyzer room,\u201d an eight-foot by eight-foot chamber. At that point, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Moyle asked defendant \u201cif he wanted to call anyone for advice,\u201d and defendant responded that he did. Moyle then \u201cpointed to the phone and the phone books, and told him that [Moyle would] be out in the hall, and to please let [him] know when he was done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Defendant asked Moyle if he was \u201cgoing to help me.\u201d Moyle responded, \u201c \u2018No,\u2019 and that I\u2019d be out in the hall.\u201d At 1:10 a.m., Moyle left the Intoxylizer room and closed its door \u201call but the last few inches\u201d; the door was \u201ceither touching or [there was] up to two inches of a gap between the door and the doorframe.\u201d Moyle did not shut the door completely because he \u201cknow[s] that some people are claustrophobic and being closed in a small room can cause anxiety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Moyle walked around the corner to do paperwork but returned from time to time to check on defendant. The door to the Intoxilyzer room had a small window that allowed Moyle to see into the room. Moyle \u201cpeek[ed] in to see if [defendant] was on the phone, if he was sitting there, make sure that he hadn\u2019t, you know, passed out or had any sort of medical problems, * * * because I am responsible for him, just to check on kind of his \u2014 his overall progress.\u201d During those checks, Moyle \u201csaw [defendant] on the phone attempting to call\u201d but \u201c[a]t no time was [Moyle] able to hear anything that he said, nor [did Moyle] know if he said anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">At 1:29 a.m., \u201cfrom outside the Intoxilyzer room,\u201d Moyle told defendant \u201cthat he needed to finish up on the phone\u201d and that he \u201chad about a minute longer.\u201d At 1:30 a.m., Moyle \u201copened the door and told [defendant] that he needed to be done now.\u201d Defendant responded \u201cthat he hadn\u2019t been able to contact John Henry,[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] and that he wasn\u2019t \u2014 he wasn\u2019t answering and he got a weird message.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">At 1:31 a.m., Moyle began the 15-minute observation period that precedes a breath test. He read defendant the implied consent rights, which included asking defendant, \u201cWill you take a breath, blood or urine test? Specifically, will you take a breath test?\u201d Defendant replied that \u201che couldn\u2019t get his attorney.\u201d Moyle informed defendant that he \u201chad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>given him time to contact someone for advice and that [Moyle] was sorry he had not been able to reach anyone.\u201d Defendant told Moyle \u201cthat that was right, but he didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d At that point, Moyle began the process of obtaining breath samples. He gave defendant directions on how to provide proper samples and where to stand. He then \u201ctold him this was his opportunity to give the samples\u201d and that \u201cif he chose not to give the samples, it would be considered a refusal.\u201d Defendant explained, \u201cI can\u2019t get ahold of my attorney. I\u2019m not saying I won\u2019t take the test, but since I can\u2019t get ahold of him I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Defendant emphasized that \u201cit was very important that [Moyle] understood that.\u201d When Moyle presented the Intoxylizer tube to defendant and asked him to give the sample, defendant \u201ccontinued to say he wasn\u2019t refusing.\u201d Defendant \u201cneither grabbed the tube, nor gave the sample,\u201d and Moyle informed defendant that he \u201cwould be taking his lack of beginning to give samples as a refusal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Defendant filed a number of pretrial evidentiary motions, including a motion to exclude evidence of his refusal to submit to the breath test. Defendant advanced two arguments in support of that motion. Initially, he argued that the sequence of events was wrong \u2014 that, under Oregon law, the request to submit to a breath test must <em>precede </em>the opportunity to communicate with counsel, in order to ensure that the decision whether to take the test has the benefit of counsel\u2019s advice, whereas Moyle\u2019s request to submit to the breath test did not occur until <em>after </em>defendant had already been given an opportunity to contact someone. Next, defendant argued that Moyle, by leaving the door ajar, had violated his right to communicate <em>privately </em>with counsel. The trial court rejected both arguments and denied defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">On appeal, defendant reprises his arguments that Moyle failed to take the proper steps to afford him a reasonable opportunity to consult privately with counsel. Specifically, defendant argues that (1) Moyle failed to request that defendant submit to the breath test before providing him an opportunity to seek counsel; (2) defendant\u2019s equivocal invocation of the right to counsel \u2014 that is, answering affirmatively to the question whether he wanted to \u201ccall <em>anyone </em>for advice\u201d \u2014 required Moyle to further inquire if defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>intended to contact <em>counsel </em>and, if so, to inform defendant that the conversation would be private; and (3) no reasonable person in defendant\u2019s position would have understood his communications with counsel to be private with the door left ajar. We are not persuaded by those contentions; in short, defendant overstates the right to counsel under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">A driver arrested for DUII has a \u201cright upon request to a reasonable opportunity to obtain legal advice before deciding whether to submit to a breath test.\u201d <em>State v. Spencer, </em>305 Or 59, 74-75, 750 P2d 147 (1988). The driver need not specifically request privacy to consult with counsel; rather, \u201c[t]he request for counsel, by itself, indicates that the arrested driver wants the essential elements that inhere in that right, including the opportunity for confidential communication.\u201d <em>Durbin, </em>335 Or at 191. There is no right, however, to actually contact an attorney. In other words, a defendant \u201chas only the right to a reasonable opportunity to do so.\u201d <em>State v. Roesler, </em>235 Or App 547, 551, 234 P3d 1004 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Neither this court nor the Oregon Supreme Court has ever endorsed a particular script or timeline that officers must follow in order to afford an arrested driver a reasonable opportunity to obtain advice of counsel before submitting to a breath test. In <em>Durbin, </em>the court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">\u201cTo obtain evidence of an arrested driver\u2019s blood alcohol level without violating the driver\u2019s right to counsel, <em>police might find it preferable </em>to inform the driver of their intent to administer the breath test and then, if the driver requests counsel, to allow the driver a reasonable time in which to seek legal advice, in private, before beginning the required observation period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">335 Or at 194 (emphasis added). That, however, is a far cry from imposing on police the requirement that defendant urges \u2014 namely, that an actual request for the breath sample precede any opportunity to consult with counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The touchstone in this circumstance is whether a DUII suspect has been provided a \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d to obtain counsel before submitting to the breath test; the inquiry is not susceptible to a bright-line test demanding a particular sequence of events. Here, there is no question that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>before asking defendant whether he wanted to call anyone for advice, Moyle had communicated his intent to administer a breath test. Moyle informed defendant on the way to the jail that such a test would be offered. Once at the jail, Moyle took defendant to a room in which he was seated next to an Intoxylizer machine, at which point Moyle asked him whether he wanted to \u201ccall anyone for advice.\u201d After later being asked whether he would submit to a breath test, defendant replied that \u201che couldn\u2019t get his attorney.\u201d In other words, Moyle communicated \u2014 and defendant understood\u2014 that the opportunity provided was for the purpose of obtaining advice about whether to take the breath test; there is no requirement in Oregon law that an officer formally request the sample before providing an opportunity for a suspect to seek advice about whether to provide such a sample, so long as the suspect, when he or she has that opportunity, knows or should know that a breath test is imminent.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Nor do we agree with defendant that, in all cases, an equivocal invocation of the right to counsel \u2014 such as answering affirmatively to Moyle\u2019s question whether he wanted to \u201ccall anyone for advice\u201d \u2014 necessarily triggers a duty on the officer\u2019s part to further inquire about a suspect\u2019s intentions, although that contention merits further discussion in light of certain language in our previous cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">\u201cOfficer Moyle asked the defendant if he wanted to \u2018call anyone for advice.\u2019 Defendant responded that he did. That was sufficient to constitute \u2018an equivocal invocation of the right to counsel\u2019 triggering duties to be performed by Officer Moyle. Officer Moyle failed in his duty to ask the defendant follow up questions to determine whether defendant was going to try to contact an attorney. The police <em>\u2018must\u2019 </em>ask follow-up questions to determine whether they must inform the person that once an attorney is contacted, privacy of communication will be afforded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">(Footnote omitted; emphasis in original.) Defendant premises his argument on a paragraph in <em>State v. Ohm, </em>224 Or App 390, 395-96, 197 P3d 1136 (2008), in which we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">\u201cThe question in this case, therefore, is whether defendant invoked her right to counsel when she told the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>officer that she \u2018wanted to ask someone\u2019 for advice before deciding whether to take the breath test. If a suspect makes an equivocal invocation of the right to counsel under Article I, section 12[, of the Oregon Constitution], police are required to ask follow-up questions to determine what the suspect meant before proceeding with interrogation. <em>State v. Charboneau, </em>323 Or 38, 54, 913 P2d 308 (1996). Similarly, <em>we conclude that, if a driver arrested for DUII makes an equivocal invocation of the right to counsel under Article I, section 11, police must ask follow-up questions to determine whether they must inform the driver that, once he or she contacts an attorney, privacy will be afforded. </em>In determining whether a defendant\u2019s statement is an equivocal invocation, we view the statement in light of the totality of the circumstances at and preceding the time that it was made \u2018to ascertain whether a reasonable officer in the circumstances would have understood that defendant was invoking [her] rights.\u2019 <em>State v. Holcomb, </em>213 Or App 168, 176, 159 P3d 1271, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 224 (2007).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">(Footnote omitted; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Viewed in isolation, the emphasized sentence in <em>Ohm </em>could be read to support defendant\u2019s position. Our holding in that case, however, must be viewed in the context of its facts (\u201c[t]he question in <em>this case </em>* * *\u201d) \u2014 and one fact in particular: The officer never left the suspect alone. In that context, where a suspect has made an equivocal request for counsel <em>and it appears that the officer intends to remain in the room with the suspect, </em>it is imperative that the officer inquire further. That is so for two reasons. First, the right to private communication is only accorded if the suspect has invoked the right to <em>counsel, Ohm, </em>224 Or App at 395 (\u201c[A] driver arrested for DUII has the right, upon request, to consult with a lawyer or a nonlawyer, but to consult <em>privately </em>only with <em>counsel.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.)), so it is necessary for the officer to determine whether the suspect has, in fact, invoked that right. Second, if the right to counsel has been invoked, the officer\u2019s continued presence has a potential chilling effect on that right. As we explained in <em>State v. Matviyenko, </em>212 Or App 125, 130, 157 P3d 268 (2007),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201c[W]hen a DUII arrestee has asked to call an attorney, <em>if an officer intends to remain seated in the room until the call is made, </em>we think that the onus is properly on the officer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>inform the arrestee \u2014 before the call is made \u2014 that, once he or she contacts an attorney, privacy will be afforded. <em>That is because a person in circumstances such as these could reasonably conclude that, if an officer says that the person may make his or her phone calls and then sits down at the desk, the officer is planning to remain for the duration of the calls.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">(Emphasis added.) <em>See also State v. Tyon, </em>226 Or App 428, 439, 204 P3d 106 (2009) (\u201c[T]he constitutional problem in <em>Durbin </em>was that the officer stayed in the room, within earshot, during the actual conversation between the defendant and his attorney.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">If, however, an officer leaves the room once a suspect makes an equivocal request for counsel \u2014 thereby affording the suspect the opportunity to communicate privately with anyone, lawyer or nonlawyer \u2014 the relevant concerns in <em>Ohm </em>are not present. That is, the obligations on officers to inquire in the context of an equivocal request for counsel and to inform a suspect that privacy will be provided are not distinct from, or in addition to, the suspect\u2019s right to a reasonable opportunity to consult privately with counsel. Rather, they are means of ensuring that such an opportunity has been provided when the circumstances \u2014 such as the presence of the officer in the room \u2014 would otherwise chill the exercise of the right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Indeed, that is the approach this court has since taken, albeit without specifically addressing <em>Ohm. </em>In <em>Tyon, </em>the defendant, after being arrested for DUII, was placed in a holding cell and told that he could contact an attorney. During a 45-minute period, the officer who had arrested the defendant (Morehead) and the jail staff remained near the holding cell, in an adjacent room and another room connected to the adjacent room. The door between the holding cell and adjacent room was closed, \u201cbut there was an open cuff port (slot) in the door.\u201d 226 Or App at 433. A recording from the jail demonstrated that \u201cthroughout the entire period, [the] defendant, Morehead, and the jail staff were able to hear one another through the door slot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Neither Morehead nor the jail staff ever informed the defendant that \u201cthey would give him privacy once he reached his attorney by closing the cuff port or moving out of earshot of [the] defendant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>On appeal, the defendant in <em>Tyon, </em>relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Durbin, </em>argued that \u201cthe fact that Morehead and the jail staff remained within earshot while he attempted to contact his attorney and never told [the] defendant that he would be given privacy once he reached an attorney violated his right to a private consultation with an attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439. We rejected that argument, explaining that the \u201cconstitutional problem in <em>Durbin </em>was that the officer stayed in the room, within earshot, during the actual conversation between the defendant and his attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The facts in <em>Tyon </em>were distinguishable from <em>Durbin, </em>we held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">\u201cbecause the defendant in [Durbin] actually contacted his attorney and, at that point, the officer declined to give the defendant privacy in consulting with his attorney. <em>Under those circumstances, we presume that there was a chilling effect and thus do not require the defendant to prove that there was. </em>However, where, as in this case and in <em>Matviyenko, </em>the defendant never actually contacts an attorney, the potential chilling problem pertains to the defendant\u2019s decision whether to continue trying to make the call.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 439-40 (emphasis added). We then held that, despite the fact that there was an open slot in the door and an officer within earshot, the defendant\u2019s right to consult privately with counsel had not been violated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">\u201cThat concern is not present in this case, because the record demonstrates that defendant was not deterred from trying to call his attorney. His efforts to do so continued unabated until Morehead intervened by calling \u2018Time.\u2019 The officers\u2019 failure to inform defendant that he would have been afforded privacy had he actually contacted his attorney did not have the chilling effect that we identified in <em>Matviyenko. </em>We do not have to speculate as to the effect of Morehead\u2019s and the jail staffs presence within earshot of defendant because we know that it did not have any effect\u2014 defendant never stopped trying to reach his attorney during the attorney consultation period. Thus, defendant\u2019s right to consult privately with an attorney was not violated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\"><em>Tyon </em>essentially disposes of defendant\u2019s arguments. Here, too, defendant never actually contacted counsel, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>there could be no chilling effect on the content of an attorney-client conversation. Nor did anything chill defendant\u2019s <em>attempt </em>to contact an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">On that point, defendant argues that his efforts to call an attorney were impeded by the fact that the Intoxilyzer door was left slightly ajar \u2014 \u201cup to two inches.\u201d According to defendant, \u201c[t]he effect of Officer Moyle leaving the door to the Intoxylizer room ajar was the functional equivalent of the officer staying in the room, as in <em>Matviyenko.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Setting aside the obvious differences between an officer present in the room and a door slightly ajar, there is no basis on this record to conclude that the cracked door had any effect on defendant\u2019s efforts to contact counsel. The reason that defendant was unable to contact counsel was that his attorney \u201cwasn\u2019t answering and he got a weird message\u201d; that had nothing to do with the fact that the door was cracked two inches. Defendant was given a reasonable opportunity to contact an attorney but was unable to do so, through no fault of the police. Defendant\u2019s right to consult privately with an attorney extends no farther than that, and the trial court did not err in denying his motion to suppress evidence of his refusal to submit to a breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">THE \u201cHOBSON\u2019S CHOICE\u201d TO TESTIFY</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Defendant also moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude any reference to his refusal based on another theory: that it forced him into an unfair choice. According to defendant, he only refused to submit to the test because he wanted first to talk with his lawyer \u2014 that is, he was asserting his constitutional right to counsel. Thus, he argued, evidence of his refusal forced him into a \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d: Either leave the refusal unexplained before the jury, thereby creating the impression that he feared that the outcome of the test would reveal intoxication, or waive his right to exclude evidence of his invocation of the right to counsel. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The case was then tried to a jury, and, as defendant anticipated, the state offered evidence of his refusal to take the breath test. Defendant chose the latter option of his Hobson\u2019s choice, endeavoring to explain why he did not take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>the test. He elicited testimony from Moyle on cross-examination regarding the circumstances of the refusal, which included defendant\u2019s statement to Moyle that, \u201cI\u2019m not saying I won\u2019t take the test. Since I can\u2019t get ahold of [my attorney], I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">The prosecutor, during closing argument, addressed that very testimony. She argued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">\u201cLet\u2019s talk just a little bit more about that. The defendant said that he wasn\u2019t saying he wouldn\u2019t take the test, but he wanted to speak to an attorney. <em>And I would submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, that that\u2019s an excuse.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Defendant immediately objected and asked for a mistrial, arguing that the prosecutor was \u201cdemeaning\u201d the exercise of the right to counsel by describing it as an \u201cexcuse.\u201d The prosecutor responded that \u201cthe defense opened the door to this and brought this evidence in and I believe it\u2019s now properly arguable * * The court overruled defendant\u2019s objection and denied the motion for a mistrial. However, the court instructed the jury that \u201c[e]vidence that the defendant requested the advice of a lawyer has been admitted for a limited purpose. You may not consider defendant\u2019s request for a lawyer as evidence that the defendant is guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">On appeal, defendant offers a combined argument as to why the court erred (1) by denying the motion <em>in limine </em>and (2) by refusing to declare a mistrial. Both arguments are premised on the theory, set out above, that the admission of the breath test refusal put defendant in an impossible position whereby he was forced to waive his privilege to exclude otherwise inadmissible evidence regarding his invocation of the right to counsel. For that reason, he argues, the prejudice resulting from the admission of his refusal substantially outweighed its probative value and, coupled with the prosecutor\u2019s comments, denied him a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">We have previously rejected the proposition that the right to counsel is violated <em>per se </em>when the admission of a breath test creates this type of dilemma for a defendant. In <em>State v. Anderson, </em>53 Or App 246, 251, 631 P2d 822 (1981), the defendant argued that, \u201cif evidence of the fact of his refusal is admissible at trial, \u2018the only way a defendant can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>rebut the inference that he has refused the test because he believed he would fail the test, is to reveal his conversations with his attorney.\u2019 \u201d Additionally, the defendant argued that \u201cto corroborate his own testimony concerning his conversation with his attorney, he will be forced to call his attorney as a witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">\u201cThere may be many reasons, besides consciousness of guilt, for a person to refuse to take a test. Advice of counsel is one reason. Once the fact of defendant\u2019s refusal is admitted into evidence, he must make the choice to explain it or not. While he may feel some compulsion to explain his behavior, he is not forced to reveal any conversation with counsel or to have his attorney take the stand. It is simply a matter of choice, and we do not agree that it violates defendant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel or interferes with the attorney-client privilege.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 251-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\"><em>Anderson </em>also involved an OEC 403 argument similar to that advanced by defendant: that the probative value of the evidence of his refusal was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court had not addressed that argument, so we remanded for the court to do so in the first instance. We noted, however, our view that \u201cit will be a rare case indeed in which [a] defendant is entitled to have this evidence kept from the trier of fact. The legislature has declared this evidence to be relevant; trial courts should not ignore the legislative policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Against that backdrop, defendant argues that this is indeed the \u201crare case\u201d envisioned in <em>Anderson, </em>in which the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. We are not persuaded. This court will not reverse a trial court\u2019s ruling under the OEC 403 balancing test unless the trial court has abused its discretion. <em>State v. Williams, </em>313 Or 19, 29-30, 828 P2d 1006, <em>cert den, </em>506 US <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>858 (1992). Defendant\u2019s refusal was a key piece of the evidence against him. Meanwhile, the prejudice that he identifies \u2014 the risk that the jury might draw some inference of consciousness of guilt from his request for counsel \u2014 could be mitigated with a jury instruction like the one given in this case: \u201cYou may not consider defendant\u2019s request for a lawyer as evidence that the defendant is guilty.\u201d <em>See State v. Barone, </em>329 Or 210, 236, 986 P2d 5 (1999), <em>cert den, </em>528 US 1086 (2001) (probative value of evidence was not \u201csubstantially outweighed\u201d by prejudice where \u201cany prejudicial effect of the testimony was blunted by the trial court\u2019s limiting instruction. The court clearly instructed the jury to consider the evidence only for the specific purposes for which it was admitted.\u201d). Under the circumstances, the court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of his refusal to submit to the breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Our conclusion in that regard effectively resolves defendant\u2019s remaining assignment of error regarding his motion for a mistrial. Once the evidence of his refusal was properly admitted, and once <em>defendant </em>elicited testimony suggesting that he had refused only because he could not obtain counsel, the door was open for the prosecutor to comment on defendant\u2019s reasons for refusing the test. <em>See State v. Clark, </em>233 Or App 553, 559, 226 P3d 120 (2010) (prosecutor\u2019s comments in closing argument on the defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to remain silent were not grounds for a mistrial where defense counsel during cross-examination \u201copened the door to the prosecutor\u2019s comment\u201d); <em>State v. Guritz, </em>134 Or App 262, 270, 894 P2d 1235, <em>rev den, </em>321 Or 560 (1995) (\u201cThe prosecutor has the right * * * to reply to argument made by opposing counsel, and, in doing so, statements may be made which otherwise would be improper. * * * Defense counsel effectively precipitated the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, and, under the circumstances, [the] defendant now should not be heard to complain of the consequences.\u201d). Thus, the court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-8\"> The parties agree that \u201cJohn Henry\u201d referred to defendant\u2019s attorney, John Henry Hingson III.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-8\"> OEC 403 provides that relevant evidence \u201cmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
