J.</author>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Plaintiffs Charles M. and Lillian M. Fischer (the Fischers) appeal the circuit court\u2019s judgment in a writ of review proceeding that affirmed respondent Benton County\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> determination that the Fischers have a vested right to complete a subdivision of their property in compliance with waivers issued pursuant to Ballot Measure 37 (2004)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but do not have a vested right to establish seven residential dwellings on the lots in that subdivision. The dispositive legal issue on appeal is whether the circuit court misconstrued the applicable law in sustaining the county\u2019s determination that the Fischers did not have a vested right to complete and continue the development of the residential subdivision \u2014 including dwellings \u2014 because there was inadequate consideration of the expenditure ratio (i.e., a comparison of the relevant expenditures to the \u201ctotal project cost\u201d). Consistently with our decision in <em>Friends of Yamhill County v. Board of Commissioners, </em>237 Or App 149, 165-68, 178, 238 P3d 1016 (2010), <em>rev allowed, </em>349 Or 602 (2011), we conclude that the court should have remanded the decision to the county to determine the total project cost and to give proper weight to the expenditure ratio under the circumstances of this case. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The material facts are uncontroverted. In early spring 2007, the Fischers obtained state and county waivers that allowed for the development that they ultimately sought \u2014 that is, a seven-lot residential subdivision. Thereafter, in October, they obtained tentative subdivision plat approval. The Fischers expended over $66,000 to develop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>their property before Measure 49 became effective on December 6, 2007.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Thereafter, the Fischers applied to the county for a determination that they had a vested right to continue and complete the use described in their Measure 37 waivers. Initially, the planning commission affirmed a staff decision denying the Fischers\u2019 application. The Fischers then appealed the commission\u2019s decision to the Board of Commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">As pertinent on appeal, the board\u2019s reasoning reflected uncertainty about how to assess the \u201cuse\u201d that the Fischers sought to vest, which, in turn, affected its determination of the \u201ctotal project cost\u201d as reflected in the denominator of the expenditure ratio. Initially, the board reasoned that, if the \u201cuse\u201d was platting the subdivision, \u201c[t]he ratio of expenditures [(i.e., approximately $66,814)] to project cost for the platting of the subdivision <em>[(i.e., </em>approximately $300,745 to $327,952)] is approximately 20% to 22%, which the Board of Commissioners concludes is substantial progress.\u201d (Boldface omitted.) Alternatively, the board reasoned that, if the \u201cuse\u201d included the establishment of residential dwellings, the \u201ctotal project cost\u201d could be estimated based on average <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>regional housing construction costs rather than on the cost of purchasing and installing \u201csingle-wide manufactured dwellings at a cost of $20,000 to $25,000 [each]\u201d as the Fischers contended. Specifically, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\">\u201cBased on 2007 building permit records, average cost for establishment of a dwelling is estimated at $284,077. Total project cost therefore includes the remaining expenditures to plat the subdivision ($320,774 to $352,952) plus residential development on six of the resulting lots ($1,704,462).[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] Total cost estimate: $2,025,236 to $2,057,414. The ratio of expenditures to total project costs is 3.2% to 3.3%; this is not \u2018substantial progress.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">(Footnote omitted.) Ultimately, the board determined that the Fischers had a vested right \u201cin platting the subdivision\u201d but that the Fischers \u201cdo[ ] not have a vested right in establishing dwellings on the subject property * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">After the board issued its decision, the Fischers filed an action in circuit court seeking various forms of relief that were denominated as separate claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In their first claim, the Fischers sought a review of the board\u2019s decision by way of writ of review. <em>See </em>ORS 195.318. In their second claim, the Fischers sought a declaration that their Measure 37 waivers \u201cwere constitutionally protected, permanent and legally binding contracts]\u201d under Article I, section 10, of the United States Constitution and Article I, section 21, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, in their third claim, the Fischers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>sought mandamus \u201cto compel [the county], its elected officials, officers, agents, and employees to recognize and ratify [their] tentative plat and compel [the county] to continue to process [their] tentative plat in accordance with ORS 215.427(3) and ORS 92.040.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The county moved to dismiss the separately denominated claims for declaratory relief and mandamus on the ground that the circuit court lacked \u201cjurisdiction to review a Measure 49 decision under those two procedural vehicles.\u201d The circuit court granted the motion and, in October 2008, entered a limited judgment dismissing those two claims. The Fischers petitioned for reconsideration, which, as noted below, 244 Or App at 173 n 9, the court denied approximately ten months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Although the limited judgment was independently appealable when it was entered in October 2008, the Fischers did not timely appeal it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, they proceeded to obtain review of the board\u2019s decision by way of their only remaining <em>claim </em>\u2014 viz., writ of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>With respect to writ of review, the Fischers contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court needed to determine whether the county \u201ccorrectly construed the law regarding whether [the Fischers] had made substantial progress in the overall development entitling them to complete the use of the property in compliance with the Measure 37 waivers they received from the State and the County.\u201d The Fischers asserted that they had shown \u201ccompliance with the <em>Holmes </em>ratio test\u201d and that the county \u201cerred in speculating about the cost of the completed project\u201d in evaluating the expenditure ratio. Specifically, the Fischers suggested that the county had speculated that the lots \u201cwould only be used for McMansions with a completed project cost estimated to be $2,025,236 to $2,057,414.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">In September 2009, the trial court affirmed the county\u2019s decision that the Fischers \u201chave a vested right to subdivide their property, but not to establish dwellings on the resulting lots * * With regard to the expenditure ratio, the court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">\u201c[t]he seven planned lots multiplied by the Board\u2019s figure placed the total estimated costs to develop the property [with residential dwellings] at between $2,025,236 and $2,057,414. Therefore, the $66,814 which had already [been] expended by [the Fischers] placed the range of expenditure at between 3.2% and 3.3% of the total cost of development. [The Fischers] argue that the Board\u2019s findings are speculative, asserting that under the Board\u2019s claim the \u2018lots would only be used for McMansions.\u2019 The expenditure ratio factor clearly weighs in [the county\u2019s] favor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">\u201cThe Board found that [the Fischers] had made substantial good faith progress in the platting, in preparing the land for the use of platting to subdivide \u2018as opposed to other uses,\u2019 and progress in the actual platting. These findings were only in relation to platting the subdivision because the Board found that neither the expenditures nor the physical process toward establishing dwellings were substantial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Ultimately, the court concluded that \u201cthe Board properly determined that there is a distinction between substantial work done for platting and work done for developing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>property and that [the Fischers] have failed to establish that they had a vested right to establish dwellings on the subject property.\u201d The court entered judgment accordingly,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the Fischers appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">On appeal, the Fischers raise seven assignments of error, only one of <em>which </em>\u2014 viz., the fourth \u2014 is dispositive. The gravamen of that assignment is that the Fischers have a vested right to complete and continue the residential subdivision as described in their Measure 37 waivers. In other words, they have a vested right to establish residential dwellings on the lots in the subdivision. Specifically, the Fischers contend that, in determining whether they have a vested right to complete and continue that use, the court erred in including the speculative cost of home construction in the denominator of the expenditure ratio. Instead, they posit that \u201cthe only hard evidence in the record based on dwelling types legally permitted in the modern zoning, <em>i.e., </em>without reliance on Measure 37, is the evidence [that they] produced\u201d concerning the cost of placing manufactured dwellings on the lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Conversely, the county and the neighbors posit that the <em>average </em>cost to develop a dwelling on each lot was properly included in the total project cost for purposes of the expenditure ratio. Specifically, the neighbors assert that, because \u201c[t]he common law allows the decision maker to consider a range of possible total project costs,\u201d the county properly \u201cconsidered a cost that was the average of the total costs of constructing six homes in Benton County\u201d rather than the costs associated with the \u201cnewly created project that [the Fischers] presented as a way to rationalize a finding of vested rights.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>We have addressed contentions concerning the ratio factor that are similar to those raised by the parties in this case. As we explained in <em>Kleikamp v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>240 Or App 57, 65, 246 P3d 56 (2010), \u201ca landowner\u2019s proof of\u2018substantial expenditures\u2019 is the <em>sine qua non </em>of a vesting determination.\u201d Further, we noted that that determination \u201crequires an examination of both the absolute amount expended and the percentage yielded by the expenditure ratio.\u201d Id at 66. Significantly, in <em>Kleikamp, </em>we explained that \u201ca cogent assessment of total project cost (and, concomitantly, the expenditure ratio) will, in turn, require particular identification of the development that the property owner sought to vest as of December 6,2007\u201d and that \u201cproperty owners must demonstrate \u2018the <em>likely costs </em>of completing the particular development sought to be vested <em>based on construction costs as of December 6, 2007' \"Id. </em>(quoting <em>Friends of Yamhill County, </em>237 Or App at 178) (emphasis in <em>Kleikamp).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Such an assessment of total project cost (and concomitantly, the expenditure ratio) is necessarily predicated on a proper assessment of the \u201cuse\u201d that is described in the waiver \u2014 that is, the \u201cuse\u201d that the landowner seeks to vest under section 5(3) of Measure 49. In <em>Friends of Yamhill County, </em>where the claimant had obtained waivers to subdivide his property and construct residences, we reasoned that, for purposes of section 5(3) \u201cuse\u201d refers to \u201cthe actual employment of land for a residential purpose.\u201d 237 Or App at 167. Stated differently, in a case such as this in which a claimant has obtained Measure 37 waivers to subdivide property and construct residential dwellings on the resulting lots, the pertinent \u201cuse\u201d is not simply the subdivision of the property. Instead, under those circumstances, the \u201cuse\u201d for purposes of determining the total project cost is the subdivision of the property <em>and </em>the establishment of residences on the resulting lots. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>In light of those principles, we conclude that the circuit court \u201cshould have remanded for the county to determine the extent and general cost of the project to be vested and to give proper weight to the expenditure ratio factor in the totality of the circumstances of this case.\u201d <em>Friends of Yamhill County, </em>237 Or App at 178. Here, the county\u2019s and reviewing court\u2019s treatments of the expenditure ratio were predicated on two legal errors. First, the reviewing court sustained the county\u2019s determination that the Fischers had a vested right to subdivide the property but not to establish dwellings. That determination was necessarily predicated on the county\u2019s failure to properly assess the total project cost for purposes of the expenditure ratio in relation to the pertinent \u201cuse\u201d that the Fischers sought to vest \u2014 that is, the subdivision of the property <em>and </em>the establishment of residences. Second, by relying on regional housing construction costs, the county failed to cogently assess the total project cost of the \u201cparticular development\u201d that the Fischers sought to vest as of December 6,2007, based on construction costs as of that date. Those legal errors require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">The Fischers\u2019 other assignments of error require little discussion. In their first and third assignments of error respectively, the Fischers contend that the court erred in failing to conclude that they had a binding contract with the county to develop their property and that the court erred in determining that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the claims for declaratory relief and mandamus. Those assignments of error, however, concern the claims for declaratory relief and mandamus that were resolved in the October 2008 limited judgment. Because the Fischers did not appeal that judgment, <em>see </em>244 Or App at 171, the first and third assignments of error are unreviewable. Accordingly, we do not consider them further.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In their remaining assignments of error, the Fischers contend that (1) Measure 49 cannot be retroactively applied, (2) the deprivation of the right to establish dwellings was an unconstitutional taking of their property, and (3) they had a vested right to establish dwellings pursuant to various statutes. We and the Supreme Court have previously rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the fundamental underpinnings of those assignments.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we do not address them further.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-6\"> Several of the Fischers\u2019 neighbors, Mark Lindgren, Josephine Alexander, and Jeff and Elizabeth Peterman, intervened in the proceeding before the circuit court and are also respondents on appeal.
