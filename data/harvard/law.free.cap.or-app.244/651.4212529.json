ORS 419B.504. On <em>de novo </em>review, ORS 19.415(3)(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we conclude that the trial court erred in terminating mother\u2019s and father\u2019s parental rights because the state did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that parents\u2019 conduct or conditions were seriously detrimental to the children. We thus reverse the judgments terminating their parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">We state the relevant facts as we find them, with due regard to the trial court\u2019s findings as to the credibility of witnesses. <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Geist, </em>310 Or 176, 194, 796 P2d 1193 (1990). We begin with background information regarding father and mother, their children, and the conflicts between mother and the Department of Human Services (DHS) regarding father\u2019s paternity and whether he posed a danger to the children. We then proceed to mother\u2019s history with DHS; father and his contacts with the children and, later, with DHS; the status of the children; and the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Mother, H. L. R., and father, K. D., met in prison more than 10 years ago and have maintained a relationship in some form since that time. Mother was serving a sentence for her 1996 conviction of robbery and assault in the first degree, while father was serving a sentence for his 1999 conviction of two counts of attempted sex abuse in the first degree for touching the clothed breasts of an 11-year-old girl. Mother and father have three children together. They are H, a boy born in 2005; L, a girl born in 2006; and K, another girl, born in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Mother also has two older children, unrelated to father, whom she has never parented. They are not the subject of this case, but the removal of one of those children from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>mother\u2019s parents led DHS to contact mother around 2004. At that time, DHS evaluated mother to determine whether to place that child in mother\u2019s care. In 2005, while DHS was working with mother in regard to her older child, mother gave birth to H.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Starting in 2005, DHS suspected that K. D., a sex offender, was the biological father of H and, later, of L and K, despite mother\u2019s denials that he was the father of any of the children. In February 2007, at DHS\u2019s request, the juvenile court ordered paternity testing so that DHS could determine whether he was indeed the father, despite mother\u2019s denials. Nothing in the record indicates that DHS followed through and completed paternity testing as to father and any of the children at any time before 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In the meantime, DHS maintained that father was a threat to H and then L and K because of his sex offender status, and DHS directed mother to have no contact with him. Mother, however, did not believe and denied that father was a threat. She repeatedly defied DHS by maintaining her relationship with father and lying to DHS caseworkers concerning that relationship. Later, she allowed the children to have contact with father, contrary to DHS directives. Father, meanwhile, knew he was the father of the children but did not contact DHS and claim that he was the father until 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">In large part, mother\u2019s decision to remain in a relationship with father and to allow father to have a relationship with the children resulted in DHS removing H and the other children from mother\u2019s care at various points between 2005 and 2009. Ultimately, after all three children had been removed from mother and after father\u2019s paternity was established, a DHS evaluator concluded in 2009 that father was a low risk for sexually abusing his or any other children.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">B. <em>Mother and removals of the children from her care</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">DHS first removed H from mother at his birth in 2005 based on concerns about mother\u2019s previous criminal conviction; her mental health; and her relationship with a registered sex offender, father. Mother\u2019s 1996 criminal conviction was based on her stealing a purse and cutting a man in the neck with a box cutter when he confronted her as she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>fled. In two psychological evaluations of mother that DHS arranged in late 2004 and early 2005 in regard to her older child, mother was diagnosed with a personality disorder not otherwise specified, with antisocial and narcissistic traits. Both evaluators found that her prognosis was poor until she could recognize concerns held by DHS and accept some personal responsibility for her situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">As for mother\u2019s relationship with father, she denied to DHS that he was H\u2019s father or that she had contact with father. But DHS learned from mother\u2019s probation officer that mother had lied about having no contact with father and that he was probably H\u2019s father. DHS also contacted father\u2019s probation officer to explore the matter of his paternity and learned that father had previously told his probation officer that he was going to be a father, but identified someone other than H. L. R. as the mother. Father\u2019s probation officer was skeptical of father\u2019s claim that H. L. R. was not the mother of his child.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">While H was in state custody, mother engaged in therapy and other services DHS provided. In early 2006, when H was over nine months old, DHS placed him in mother\u2019s care. H remained in mother\u2019s care for about 10 months, until DHS removed H again in late 2006 because mother failed to advise DHS that she was pregnant again. DHS was concerned that mother was having ongoing contact with father.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Within a few weeks of H\u2019s second removal from mother, L was born and was immediately removed from mother\u2019s care because \u201cshe was having ongoing contact\u201d with father and \u201cher mental health was not stable at the time.\u201d Mother, though, continued to deny to DHS that K. D. was the father of H or of L. Mother admitted that she hid her pregnancy from DHS because \u201cshe had felt threatened because she already had so little contact with her children.\u201d According to mother, her refusal to disclose her pregnancy to DHS led to a more hostile relationship with the caseworker.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Mother has completed a \u201cnon-offending parent\u201d class, which educates parents who have been in a relationship with a sex offender about threats of harm that such a person may pose to a child and how to keep the child safe. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>also participated in individual counseling. In the spring of 2007, a psychologist evaluator, Sorensen, noted that mother nevertheless remained angry and resistant to accepting oversight and monitoring by DHS. In his opinion, mother had an antisocial personality disorder and, in general, in individuals with an antisocial personality \u201c[m]arked distrust, a lack of empathy, and irresponsibility impair relationship development. Substance abuse, reckless behavior, and even criminal involvement also present concerns for this population.\u201d But, Sorensen found \u201cno direct evidence to indicate a specific inappropriate, illegal, or dangerous action\u201d by mother that was harmful to her children and could not say that mother\u2019s \u201cself-focus\u201d will result in harm or threat of harm to children in her care. Sorensen noted that no one had reported danger to the children during mother\u2019s visits and that he saw \u201clittle reason to continue strict restrictions regarding her visitation.\u201d He also suggested leaving it up to mother and her therapist to determine whether she wanted to continue counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Thereafter, in 2008, DHS placed L, who was almost 18 months old, with mother and returned H, who was three years old, to her. Mother\u2019s therapist noted that she believed that mother had \u201clearned techniques for keeping [\u00b6] and L] safe from outside influences in the parenting program.\u201d All home visits went well and the \u201cchildren appealed] healthy and reasonably well adjusted.\u201d In June 2008, DHS was satisfied with mother\u2019s progress and dismissed jurisdiction over H and L.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">In late 2008, mother gave birth to K, a pregnancy that she had not disclosed to DHS before the dismissal of jurisdiction over H and L. Of the three children, K was the only one DHS did not remove from mother at birth. In December 2008, a teacher and special education coordinator with the Relief Nursery visited mother and all three children and noted that they were doing well. According to their report, mother\u2019s \u201chouse appeared clean[,] tidy[,] and safe [and] * * * the kids have books and art supplies easily accessible and clean up when asked.\u201d Mother \u201cwas very engaged with the kids and attentive[. She] set appropriate limits and followed through with consequences and praise.\u201d In regard to H, their report noted that he \u201chas met most of his goals and we had to think a bit to come up with new ones. [\u00b6] is doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>especially well with social/peer interaction and cognitive skills.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\">In early 2009, though, DHS learned that mother faced possible eviction from her apartment because father was reported to be on the public housing property against a federal policy that bans all convicted sex offenders. DHS went to the home and observed blankets mother had hung up inside the otherwise clean apartment, which mother said was due to her fear of a neighbor who was harassing her. DHS removed all three children based on concerns about mother\u2019s mental health and DHS\u2019s ongoing suspicion that mother was having contact with father. The children showed no signs of abuse or neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">After DHS removed the children in February 2009, mother finally acknowledged father\u2019s paternity. Sorensen conducted another assessment of mother, who was then 38 years old, in the summer of 2009. He noted that DHS believed that father and mother were more involved with each other than mother described. Mother admitted that she allowed father to visit the children, including having unsupervised contact with them. Her dishonesty with DHS and the construction of a website critical of DHS, Sorensen noted, demonstrated mother\u2019s poor judgment and failure to sustain her focus on child protection. Sorensen determined that while \u201cthere is no evidence that [mother] will behave in a way that is dangerous to her children during brief contact with them, she appears unwilling to modify her willingness to sustain separation from a man believed to present a serious risk to their welfare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In mother\u2019s final psychological evaluation just before the termination trial in May 2010, again with Sorensen, mother was reported to be \u201cdoing well\u201d with her children, but she continued to have a hostile relationship with DHS. Mother would not follow DHS instructions to bring nutritious snacks to visitations, and DHS criticized mother for bringing a video to watch during a supervised visit. Additionally, mother spoke critically of DHS in front of the children. Further, according to Sorensen, DHS described mother as \u201chighly focused on identifying evidence of maltreatment by foster parents\u201d and again noted the website that \u201clashes out\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>at child welfare agencies. Sorensen\u2019s evaluation predicted \u201cwith considerable confidence that she will continue to act without much interest in following future [DHS] directives\u201d to refrain from any contact with father.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">In all three evaluations Sorensen conducted of mother while the children were in state care, in 2007, 2009, and 2010, he reported that mother\u2019s involvement with DHS was \u201clargely due to her continued relationship with a known sexual offender,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>father. Additionally, based in significant part upon mother\u2019s continued cover up of her relationship with father and her resistance to accepting DHS monitoring and demands, Sorensen consistently diagnosed mother with an antisocial personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">At trial, Sorensen testified, in regard to mother\u2019s ongoing relationship with father, that Sorensen had \u201cserious concerns about her ability to have some assessment of how well somebody is functioning.\u201d But Sorensen then acknowledged that for all of his evaluations of mother, DHS had informed Sorensen that mother \u201cwas having a dangerous person around her children[,] i.e., [father],\u201d who was an untreated sex offender. Sorensen also said that he did not know at the time of his May 2010 evaluation of mother that father\u2019s sex offender treatment provider and a psychologist who evaluated father in 2009, Colistro, were of the opinion that father did not need further sex offender treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Basham, a psychologist who evaluated mother in 2005 with regard to her older child, concluded provisionally at that time that mother had a personality disorder not otherwise specified, with antisocial and narcissistic features. He testified at trial that someone with mother\u2019s diagnosis is not <em>per se </em>unable to be an adequate parent; \u201cit is possible someone could have that diagnosis and still be capable of parenting.\u201d He also acknowledged that if father were not in fact a danger to the children, then mother\u2019s reduced ability to protect them based on her diagnosis \u201cis much less relevant\u201d or is \u201cnot a relevant issue.\u201d And, Basham noted that individuals with personality disorders can and do change, particularly with age and maturity: \u201cby middle age, many of the personality disorders kind of \u2014 it\u2019s kind of like they fade out. They just become less severe or less manifest in behavior. That\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>generally accepted to be true of antisocial, that it declines; particularly the behavioral signs of that in middle age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">In summary, mother was aware of DHS\u2019s position that father was a threat to the children due to his 1999 sex abuse conviction; but, she did not agree he was a threat and consistently lied to DHS about her ongoing contact and relationship with him. Mother completed services required by DHS and consistently attended supervised visits with her children when they were placed out of her care, but she remained very defensive towards DHS. Mother\u2019s housing has appeared relatively stable except for her conflict with neighbors and property management that culminated in the threat of eviction for allowing father to be present on public housing property. Mother has not been arrested, charged, or convicted for any crime following her release from incarceration for her 1996 conviction. The record contains no evidence of any domestic violence, substance abuse, or additional safety concerns as to mother, other than DHS\u2019s concerns about mother\u2019s continued contact with the children\u2019s father and her resistance to DHS involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">C. <em>Father and his contacts with the children and DHS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">During post-prison supervision, for over three years from 2002 to 2005, father participated in, but did not complete, sex offender treatment. His sex offender treatment provider did not consider him a child predator because there was no evidence of pedophilia, or \u201ca pattern of reoccurring interests for or behaviors with prepubescent children.\u201d Although he was not considered to be predatory and community notification was not required, he was still ordered not to have contact with minors. Father did have some contact with minors and violated some other conditions, such as viewing adult female pornography, during his post-prison supervision, which expired in 2005, several months after H was born. As required, father continues to register as a sex offender, but he has no ongoing limitations on the individuals with whom he may have contact or where he can live.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Father, it appears, has had a stable residence since 2004. Except for the call to father\u2019s probation officer in 2005, DHS did not contact or attempt to verify whether K. D. was the biological father of the children until 2009. At the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>time, he was aware that he was the father of the children and did not seek to establish paternity or request assistance from DHS in doing so until February 2009. Father, thus, was not legally identified or offered any services before 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">When the three children were removed from mother in February 2009, father was not allowed visitations until paternity could be established. DHS scheduled the paternity test for late April, but father then sought and completed a private paternity test that allowed his child visitations to start in April 2009. After his paternity was established, father was limited to solo supervised visits with the children. DHS denied the parents\u2019 request to have shared visits with the children because \u201call throughout the history of the case, we had told [mother] that she should not be having contact with him and we had no intention of them planning on visiting the children together, so we were not going to have their visits be together.\u201d DHS made it clear that it would not approve a plan that involved mother and father parenting together.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Father completed two psychological evaluations, one in 2009 and the second in 2010. In 2009, Colistro, a psychologist with experience evaluating and treating sex offenders, evaluated father at DHS\u2019s request. Colistro found father posed a \u201clow risk for sexual recidivism with respect to his children in particular or other children in general. There is no need to re[-]involve him in sex offender treatment at this time.\u201d Thus, both his sex offender treatment provider and a psychologist indicated that there was no need for father to have further sexual offender treatment. Father has not reof-fended or been arrested, charged, or convicted for any additional crimes since the 1999 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Colistro diagnosed father with a personality disorder with antisocial and narcissistic traits; although, as Colistro acknowledged, father had no juvenile record, had worked during high school, had served over five years in the military without any known problems, and then worked until suffering an injury. According to Colistro, father\u2019s primary risk to H, L, and K is due to his \u201cnegative attitudes toward external intervention,\u201d his personality disorder, and his relationship with mother because of her personality disorder. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>2009 evaluation report indicated that an antisocial lifestyle is a strong \u201cpredictor of violent recidivism\u201d and that father\u2019s \u201cpersonality disorder is a serious condition which has led him to make decisions of a self-destructive nature and to behave in ways that are harmful to others.\u201d Colistro recommended that father \u201cshould be allowed visitations only in a supervised setting,\u201d because father will probably continue to pursue a relationship with mother and \u201c[g]iven that conclusion, * * * the children could be at risk of being in the presence of two character disordered parental figures\u201d and \u201cthe likelihood that [father] will engage in some form of seriously self-destructive behavior that could be harmful to the children is substantial.\u201d At trial, Colistro testified that children in father\u2019s care would be at risk for becoming \u201cthe victim of some form of impulsive, neglectful behavior or perhaps more deliberate aggressive behavior if they were to say challenge\u201d father. But Colistro had never seen father interact with his children, and he was unaware of any conduct by father that was impulsive towards his children or otherwise detrimental to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">In 2010, psychologist Truhn diagnosed father with \u201cPersonality Disorder NOS with Antisocial, Narcissistic, and Paranoid Features.\u201d As to the additional element of \u201cparanoid features,\u201d not included in father\u2019s 2009 diagnosis, Truhn said at trial that those \u201cmight\u201d affect father\u2019s ability to care for his children due to his lack of insight as to how his behavior affects others and his difficulty in working with service providers. Truhn testified that father\u2019s diagnosis is based upon his history of deceitfulness and intimidation toward DHS and his \u201ccriminal types of behavior.\u201d He described father as being \u201cangry with DHS.\u201d Truhn said that \u201c[individuals with personality disorders have a tendency to meet their own needs rather than being able to place their children\u2019s needs above their own.\u201d Additionally, he said that father\u2019s prognosis was poor because he has \u201cchosen to enter into what seems to be a power struggle in the relationship with DHS.\u201d Truhn recommended that father attend group therapy regarding his personality traits. DHS described father as having an intimidating personality. Father expressed anger that the foster parents repeatedly brought children to visits late, and that children were allowed to call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>the foster parents \u201cmom\u201d and \u201cdad.\u201d Also, father expressed dissatisfaction with a school counselor in a derogatory manner and requested a different therapist become involved. Although father would use profanity, he never threatened anyone with physical harm. The record contains no evidence of father abusing any of the children, any violence by father, domestic or otherwise, or any substance abuse problem that required treatment or that was detrimental to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">On his own initiative, father completed an eight-week parenting class where the instructor described him as a \u201cgood participant [and demonstrated] some understanding of kids\u2019 developmental levels.\u201d Father also sought an evaluation for group therapy services, but it does not appear that treatment was prescribed. Father attended all visits allowed by DHS and acted appropriately during them.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">D. <em>The status of the children</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The record contains little information about the three children. A Comprehensive Mental Health Assessment for H was completed in May 2008 but there are no assessments for the two younger girls, L and K. From the evidence in the record, we know that all three children are bonded with both mother and father, and there are several third-party observations of positive interactions between both parents and with the children. As noted earlier, when DHS removed the children from mother for the final time, they did not appear neglected or abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">In 2009, DHS first placed all three children in a Spanish-speaking foster home where minimal English was spoken. While in this foster home, the children received various bruises, scratches, infections, and a couple of black eyes that mother and father alleged were evidence of abuse. Around five months later, DHS moved the children to a second foster home, and their current potential adoptive placement. When H and L arrived at the second foster home, they \u201cbarely spoke.\u201d L also had a severe diaper rash with a staph infection, but that was resolved as were K\u2019s acid reflux issues that she had as a baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">H has also resolved his previous speech delays and does not require special education going forward. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>expected, from his repeated removal from mother and foster homes, H previously experienced an adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety. Additionally, L is no longer considered overweight and has mostly resolved her speech delay, but may stutter when placed in a stressful situation. The foster mother reported at trial that all three children were \u201cnormal\u201d and doing very well developmentally.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">None of mother\u2019s and father\u2019s evaluators observed either parent interact with their children or observed the children themselves. Instead, the psychologists primarily described people with personality disorders, such as mother and father, generally, and their potential to have deleterious effects on their children as they parent, e.g., a parent with a narcissistic personality trait is more focused on the parent\u2019s own needs instead of the children\u2019s needs, and a parent\u2019s intimidation of children can blunt their emotional development and put them at risk for depression and anxiety. According to the evaluators, a parent with an antisocial personality disorder or antisocial trait can demonstrate a pattern of irresponsibility, rejection of conventional rules, increased conflict, and deceitfulness, all of which can create instability that may impact the children\u2019s access to support systems. In addition, the parent may teach the children to share the same behaviors or create anxiety, depression, or lack of trust in the children that can lead to oppositional defiance. Further, the parent may expose children to danger and not be willing to accept input from professionals about that danger. In sum, the evaluators recognized the <em>potential </em>that parent\u2019s conditions could cause harm to the children in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">None of the evaluators assessed both mother and father, but Colistro said in his report that the combination of their personality disorders was a \u201crecipe for disaster, both from a marital and parenting perspective.\u201d We could not find any evidence in the record, though, that the parents\u2019 conditions caused any actual harm to the children. The psychologist who evaluated father in 2010, for instance, said that the children did not show any characteristics that might occur from being around intimidating parents. Moreover, Sorensen testified that a diagnosis of personality disorder \u201cis not a measure of parenting.\u201d When asked whether his predictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>of future effects of mother\u2019s diagnosis on her parenting were \u201cmade to a reasonable medical certainty,\u201d Sorensen noted that he could not \u201csay for certain that future events will take place\u201d and that \u201creasonable medical sufficiency\u201d relates typically to \u201ca current diagnosis, current condition, current functioning\u201d and not to \u201cpredictions related to the future, which is inherently difficult to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">E. <em>The trial court\u2019s decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">After Colistro found that father was at low risk for sexually abusing his children or any children, DHS focused less on father\u2019s sexual offender status and more on mother\u2019s and father\u2019s personality disorders, mother\u2019s lies about father\u2019s paternity and his involvement with mother and the children, and father\u2019s failure to come forward as the children\u2019s father. DHS contended that these factors rendered them unfit to parent, especially when their personality disorders are considered in combination in a dual-parent relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The trial court found that the state had established by clear and convincing evidence that mother and father are unfit by reason of conduct or conditions seriously detrimental to the children and that integration into the home is improbable within a reasonable time. The trial court concluded mother was unfit due to her antisocial personality disorder, resistance to treatment, and because she lied about not having contact with father, a convicted sex offender. Because mother did not testify, the state\u2019s evidence from all three psychological evaluators regarding mother and their conclusions that \u201cpersonality disorders are essentially not a treatable condition\u201d were unrefuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">With regard to father, the trial court concluded that he was unfit due to his personality disorder with antisocial, narcissistic, and paranoid features. Also, as a convicted sex offender, in the past he had violated a condition of his probation by having contact with children and by failing to complete sex offender treatment. We also note that father did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The trial court concluded that available social agencies had provided reasonable services for both mother and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>father, but that the parents\u2019 emotional and mental disorders are of such nature and duration as to render them incapable of providing care for the children for extended periods of time; they failed to make efforts to adjust their circumstances, conduct, or conditions; they had failed to learn sufficient parenting skills to safely care for the children; and neither had provided a viable plan that would allow return of the children. The trial court then ruled that it was in the children\u2019s best interests to terminate mother\u2019s and father\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">A. <em>Legal standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The statute governing termination of parental rights for unfitness is ORS 419B.504. The Supreme Court has interpreted ORS 419B.504 and held that both parts of a two-part test must be met before the court orders termination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">\u201cFirst, the court must address a parent\u2019s fitness: The court must find that the parent is \u2018unfit by reason of conduct or condition seriously detrimental to the child.\u2019 That, in turn, requires a two-part inquiry: The court must find that: (1) the parent has engaged in some conduct or is characterized by some condition; and (2) the conduct or condition is \u2018seriously detrimental\u2019 to the child. Second \u2014 and only if the parent has met the foregoing criteria \u2014 the court also must find that the \u2018integration of the child into the home of the parent * * * is improbable within a reasonable time due to conduct or conditions not likely to change.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-9\"><em>State ex rel SOSCF v. Stillman, </em>333 Or 135, 145, 36 P3d 490 (2001); <em>see also State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Smith, </em>338 Or 58, 80-81, 106 P3d 627 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">The state must establish statutory grounds for termination by clear and convincing evidence, meaning that the record must disclose evidence that makes it highly probable that the parents are not presently able, and will not be able within a reasonable time, to meet their children\u2019s physical and emotional needs. ORS 419B.521(1); <em>Smith, </em>338 Or at 79-80. Evidence is clear and convincing when it makes the existence of a fact \u201chighly probable\u201d or when it is of \u201cextraordinary persuasiveness.\u201d <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Hinds, </em>191 Or App 78, 84, 81 P3d 99 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>We must focus on the detrimental effect of the parent\u2019s conduct or condition on the child, not the seriousness of the parent\u2019s conduct or condition in the abstract. <em>Stillman, </em>333 Or at 146. Thus, the state must prove that some combination of the parent\u2019s conduct or conditions is seriously detrimental to that particular child. <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Rodgers, </em>204 Or App 198, 217-18, 129 P3d 243 (2006) (citing <em>State ex rel SOSCF v. Mellor, </em>181 Or App 468, 476, 47 P3d 19 (2002), <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 217 (2003)). In other words, the inquiry is \u201cchild-specific\u201d and calls for \u201ctestimony in psychological and developmental terms regarding the particular child\u2019s requirements.\u201d <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Huston, </em>203 Or App 640, 657, 126 P3d 710 (2006). Further, clear and convincing evidence of unfitness must exist at the time of the termination hearing; past unfitness is insufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 654. After satisfaction of the above test, the court must also find that termination of the parental rights is in the best interests of the child. ORS 419B.500.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">B. <em>Conduct or conditions of the parents</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">On appeal, DHS combines their argument that both mother and father were unfit at the time of the termination trial due to antisocial personality disorders that are untreatable and unlikely to change. Additionally, DHS argues, mother cannot conform or adjust her circumstances because she repeatedly lied about her relationship with father. Further, by failing to come forward before February 2009, DHS contends that father demonstrated a lack of effort to adjust his circumstances to allow the return of the children. We conclude that mother and father have engaged in conduct or have conditions that must be examined for adverse effects on their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">1. <em>Mother\u2019s personality disorder and lying</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Mother did not rebut the expert evidence that she has a personality disorder. And, the state proved by clear and convincing evidence that mother lied to DHS about her ongoing contacts with father and father\u2019s contacts with the children. Thus, mother\u2019s conduct or conditions on at least those grounds are established by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>As to mother\u2019s failure to effect a lasting adjustment, ORS 419B.504(5), which DHS contends was caused by her dishonesty, we understand DHS to contend that (1) mother lied to cover up her persistent contact with father, presenting a danger to the children; and (2) mother\u2019s lies about father\u2019s paternity interfered with DHS\u2019s ability to investigate and involve father as a parental resource for the children. Because DHS identifies potentially detrimental conduct by or conditions of mother and not merely mother\u2019s failure to change, we need not reach mother\u2019s legal argument that failure to change cannot by itself be considered as conduct or a condition of the parent for purposes of unfitness under <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Rardin, </em>340 Or 436, 134 P3d 940 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">We agree that the state proved that mother lied to DHS repeatedly, both about her contact with father and about father\u2019s paternity. We discuss the effect of mother\u2019s lies and her personality disorder later in this opinion, in the analysis regarding detriment to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">2. <em>Father\u2019s personality disorder and failure to establish paternity until 2009</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Father, as he did at trial, questions his personality disorder and argues that the state did not prove this condition by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. L. S., </em>211 Or App 221, 242, 154 P3d 148 (2007) (father found not unfit when personality disorder was diagnosed for anger and distrust toward DHS following more than \u201ctwo years of participating in services required by DHS that did not seem to be bringing him any closer to reuniting with his child\u201d). The evaluators observed that the relationship between father and DHS has developed into a \u201cpower struggle,\u201d that father expressed anger and frustration regarding DHS involvement, and that he demonstrated a resistance to trust DHS and its agents, but father attempted to establish at trial that there were reasons for father\u2019s reactions. DHS made clear starting in 2005 that father was not to have contact with the children or mother, and when the state requested a paternity test for father in 2007, the admitted goal was not to \u201cwork with\u201d father, but to prove that mother was untruthful regarding her contact with father in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>continue jurisdiction over the children. When DHS removed the children from mother in 2009 because of contact with father, DHS refused to provide father with services or supervised visitation because a paternity test had not yet established that he was the legal father. Father was refused additional supervised visits and co-visits with mother after he was found to be a low risk for sexual abuse. He received no services from DHS other than supervised visits, but he sought services himself to establish that he was ready to parent. And, the evidence suggests that he had reason to believe that his children were physically abused in one of their foster homes. Father also notes that portions of Colistro\u2019s own report contradict his diagnosis. Colistro gave father a psychological test, the Million Clinical Multiaxial Inventory, in 2009 that showed \u201cno indications of major mental, emotional or characterologic disturbance\u201d and that \u201c[ajbsent from the profile are any indications of significant antisocial proclivities or predisposition to substance abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Father did not provide expert testimony to contravene the psychologists who testified for DHS, and neither psychologist retracted his diagnosis that father has a personality disorder or admitted doubt about the diagnosis. The trial court credited and relied on the testimony of the psychologists who evaluated and diagnosed father. Although it is a close question, given that testimony, we conclude that the state proved by clear and convincing evidence that father has a personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">On appeal, DHS also argues that father demonstrated a lack of effort to adjust his circumstances because he never came forward before 2009 to demand a paternity test and legal recognition of his relationship to the children. Although the state proved that father did not come forward to claim paternity before 2009, when mother admitted to DHS that he was the father of the children, we do not agree that his request for a paternity test in 2009 is conduct or a condition demonstrating unfitness under the facts of this case and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rardin, </em>340 Or 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">In this case, starting in 2005, DHS strongly suspected that mother and father were in an ongoing relationship and that father was the biological father of H, and subsequently also of L and K, following their respective births <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>and removals from mother. DHS at various points, particularly when DHS removed the children, believed that father was having contact with the children. The evidence at trial established that father had a parental relationship with his children before he established legal paternity in 2009. Father could have requested a paternity test before 2009 but does not appear to have done so. Rather, DHS for years had told mother directly, and let father know indirectly, that DHS did not consider father to be safe around any children, much less an appropriate parent for mother\u2019s children. Although the state blames mother and father for failing to involve father with DHS, we note that DHS in fact had sought and received a court order allowing paternity testing of father in 2007 and so could have done so itself. Yet there was no evidence that DHS contacted father for testing, offered services to him if he were proven to be the father, or that it established father as the biological father of any of the children until 2009, when mother admitted father\u2019s paternity and father arranged for a paternity test. DHS thus never obligated itself to provide father with services. Under these circumstances, we conclude based on <em>Rardin </em>that father\u2019s failure to establish a legal relationship to the children is not, in itself, a condition or conduct of father under ORS 419B.504 that would constitute grounds to establish his unfitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">In <em>Rardin, </em>the father signed a birth certificate indicating he was the father of a child born in 1995. 340 Or at 438. He was involved with the child during her infancy, but then his relationship with the mother ended. <em>Id. </em>at 439. Later, the child was placed in state custody at various points between 1997 and 2001 because of the mother\u2019s drug abuse. <em>Id. </em>In 1999, DHS contacted the father, but he declined to be involved absent a paternity test proving that he was the child\u2019s father after the mother had told him he was not. <em>Id. </em>Neither the father nor DHS paid for the expensive paternity test. <em>Id. </em>In 2002, DHS decided to terminate his parental rights, before it provided services to the father to enable him to take custody of the child, and then denied the father direct contact with the child. <em>Id. </em>at 440. The father then obtained his own paternity test, established his legal status as the father, and opposed the termination petition, which, among other things, was grounded on allegations of unfitness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>because he had failed to present a viable plan for the child\u2019s return to his care. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The trial court determined that the father\u2019s contact had come so late that the child was not prepared to accept bim as a parent and that the father\u2019s choices had resulted in the lack of a parent-child relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 441. That, in turn, made the father unable to present a viable plan for placement of the child in his care in the trial court\u2019s view. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, we agreed that the father\u2019s conduct had allowed the child to languish in an unsafe environment with the mother and that his voluntary absence from the child\u2019s life from 1996 to 2002 were conditions that made him unfit. <em>Id. </em>at 442. The Supreme Court reversed and held that the father\u2019s failure to establish a legal and parental relationship with his child absent a paternity test, which he did not obtain until DHS informed him that his parental rights would be terminated, was not the kind of directly harmful or threatening behavior that provides grounds for unfitness under ORS 419B.504. <em>Id. </em>at 445-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In this case, unlike the father in <em>Rardin, </em>father had an established parental relationship with his children, but DHS directed that father have nothing to do with mother and the children. As in <em>Rardin, </em>DHS was aware of the likelihood that father was the children\u2019s biological father. DHS was aware of father\u2019s contacts with mother and the children, suspected he was the biological father, and had obtained a court order for paternity testing of father. Father\u2019s failure to establish his legal relationship to the children in the face of DHS\u2019s opposition to his parental relationship does not establish legal grounds for unfitness under ORS 419B.504.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">C. <em>No serious detriment to the children</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">DHS admits that all three children were doing \u201creasonably well\u201d at the time of the termination trial and that the risk of father sexually abusing the children was low. However, DHS contends that the combination of mother\u2019s and father\u2019s personality disorders places the children at risk and that it is \u201chighly likely that they will end up back in foster care.\u201d Further, DHS argues that mother\u2019s dishonesty regarding father\u2019s paternity and her relationship with him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>and father\u2019s failure to become involved with DHS until 2009 is detrimental to the children. Under the totality of the circumstances, DHS argues, both mother and father are presently unfit. <em>See State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. J. A. C., </em>216 Or App 268, 277, 172 P3d 295 (2007) (\u201cAll proven conduct or conditions will be viewed in combination in determining whether a parent is unfit.\u201d). We do not find clear and convincing evidence of serious detriment to the children as a result of parents\u2019 conduct and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">With regard to mother\u2019s antisocial personality disorder diagnosis, such a condition does not make a parent automatically unfit. A parent can be \u201cinflexible, over-controlled, self-centered, and overly desirous of appearing in a positive light,\u201d but the state must still provide clear and convincing evidence that the disorder had a seriously detrimental effect on the child at the time of the hearing. <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Simmons, </em>342 Or 76, 100, 149 P3d 1124 (2006). Basham, one of the psychologists, also acknowledged that people with personality disorders can parent. In this case, there was no evidence that mother harmed her children, and Sorensen noted that he believed she would not harm the children. Rather, the focus was on mother\u2019s exposure of the children to their father.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The psychologists appeared to consider mother\u2019s judgment that father was not a threat to the children to be both a sign and a symptom of mother\u2019s personality disorder. In 2009, DHS completed an evaluation of father that proved mother\u2019s judgment to be correct. Assuming mother\u2019s antisocial personality disorder caused mother to disagree with DHS, as opposed to crediting mother with the means and ability to assess the risk father posed, mother\u2019s disagreement with DHS is insufficient to prove that her condition caused serious detriment to the children and rendered her unfit. Because DHS\u2019s belief that father posed a serious danger of sexually abusing the children was proven false, Basham testified that mother\u2019s reduced ability to protect them based on her diagnosis \u201cis much less relevant\u201d or is \u201cnot a relevant issue.\u201d And, as Basham testified, individuals with personality orders can and do change, particularly with age and maturity.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>DHS also contends that mother\u2019s lying and antagonism towards DHS was seriously detrimental to the children because it \u201cprevented them from settling into a permanent home.\u201d Boiled down, however, DHS\u2019s argument is that because mother lied to and defied DHS, DHS determined that the children should remain in the state\u2019s protective custody \u2014 not that mother had harmed the children. That argument is undercut by the Supreme Court\u2019s previous determination that hostility and untruthfulness toward DHS, without more, is not sufficient evidence of a conduct or condition detrimental to the children. <em>Smith, </em>338 Or at 85-87 (in absence of clear and convincing evidence that mother\u2019s tendency to lie and tell outrageous stories is seriously detrimental to child, mother\u2019s untruthfulness not grounds for termination). Upon examination, we find that mother\u2019s conduct or condition has had the direct effect of allowing the children to form a bond with their father, against DHS instructions, but that the state failed to establish that she had harmed the children. We do not find that DHS\u2019s concerns about mother\u2019s parenting abilities rise to the level of \u201cextraordinary persuasiveness\u201d that mother\u2019s condition or conduct is seriously detrimental to the children. Thus, the state failed to prove that mother was unfit at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">As for father, the state failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that his personality disorder had a direct detrimental effect on any of the children. The evidence suggests the contrary. The state admits that father has been involved with the children in a parental relationship, contrary to DHS\u2019s efforts to keep the children away from father, and evidence establishes that the children are all bonded with father. Although the evaluators predict that father\u2019s personality disorder will have a seriously detrimental effect on the children if he were to assume a parental relationship, especially with mother, father did parent the children, with mother\u2019s assistance, and the record contains no evidence that he had injured the children or that they had suffered harm due to his relationship with them. Instead, the evidence suggests that all three children are bonded with both father and mother, and third parties have observed positive interactions among them all. Father is not unfit without clear and convincing evidence that his conduct or condition is detrimental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>to the children. <em>L. S., </em>211 Or App at 242-43 (parent behaved appropriately with child and no evidence that child was affected by parent\u2019s emotional problems). Even though Colistro predicted that father, with his personality disorder, would impulsively harm the children, other psychologists testified that people with personality disorders can parent and that predictions of future behavior, to a reasonable medical certainty, based on a diagnosis of a personality disorder cannot be done. The most significant actual detriment to the children that we can find was directly related to DHS\u2019s removal of the children, but the children currently appear to be doing well.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">In response to the trial court\u2019s finding that father poses a risk to the children, father also argues that the state did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that his 1999 attempted sex abuse conviction created a detrimental risk to the children. On appeal, in light of Colistro\u2019s opinion, the state appears to abandon the argument that father\u2019s sex offender status presents a risk of harm to the children. That position is well taken. In the absence of \u201csome nexus between the nature of the offender\u2019s prior offense and a risk to the child at issue,\u201d father\u2019s status as a sex offender does not constitute conduct or a condition severely detrimental to his children. <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. N. S., </em>229 Or App 151, 158, 211 P3d 293 (2009) (contact with an untreated sex offender is not <em>per se </em>dangerous to children; additional evidence must establish a risk to the particular child at issue); <em>accord State ex rel SOSCF v. Burke, </em>164 Or App 178, 181-84, 188, 990 P2d 922 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>330 Or 138 (2000). Accordingly, we do not agree that DHS should continue to restrict contact between mother and father and the children simply because that is what they had instructed \u201cthroughout the history of the case.\u201d DHS\u2019s own evaluation of father established that he was not a sexual threat to the children, thereby eliminating the original reason DHS put the restriction into place.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The Supreme Court has repeatedly noted that ORS 419B.504 contains a legislative assumption that parents can change their conduct, and that if change is genuine and lasting, the state may not terminate their parental rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number><em>Simmons, </em>342 Or at 103 n 13; <em>Rardin, </em>340 Or at 447. We conclude that the state did not provide clear and convincing evidence that the conditions and conduct of mother and father were seriously detrimental to their children at the time of trial. Accordingly, the state failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that they are unfit under ORS 419B.504. The trial court\u2019s judgments terminating the parental rights of mother and of father were therefore error.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-10\"> \u201cUpon an appeal from a judgment in a proceeding for the termination of parental rights, the Court of Appeals shall try the cause anew upon the record[.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
