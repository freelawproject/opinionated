In denying claimant unemployment benefits, the administrative law judge (ALJ) had found that claimant was ineligible for unemployment benefits because she voluntarily left work without good cause. ORS 657.176(2)(c). The board affirmed the ALJ \u201cwithout opinion.\u201d Specifically, after recounting the procedural history of the claim, the board\u2019s order provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">\u201cClaimant submitted a written argument that contained information that was not part of the record. In accordance with ORS 657.275(2) and OAR 471-041-0090 (October 29,2006), we considered only information received into evidence at the hearing when reaching our decision in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">\u201cEAB reviewed the entire hearing record. On <em>de novo </em>review and pursuant to ORS 657.275(2), Hearing Decision 09-UIB-28933 is affirmed without opinion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">(Boldface in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">We recently reversed an order by the board that was substantially similar to the order in this case, explaining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">\u201cthe [board] made no findings of fact or conclusions of law and supplied no explanation whatsoever for its ruling. Although the [board] is entitled to adopt the findings and conclusions of the ALJ, <em>see </em>ORS 657.275[(2)] (\u2019The board may enter its own findings and conclusions or may adopt the findings and conclusions of the administrative law judge, or any part thereof.\u2019), it did not purport to do so here. Rather, it merely affirmed the ALJ\u2019s ultimate disposition of the case. That action made meaningful judicial review impossible. Moreover, if the [board] makes no findings, <em>ipso facto </em>its order cannot be supported by substantial reason.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-10\"><em>Opp v. Employment Dept., </em>242 Or App 673, 676, 259 P3d 15 (2011). Accordingly, we reversed and remanded to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>board for reconsideration. <em>Opp </em>is controlling. The board\u2019s order is not supported by substantial reason.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Reversed and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-5\"> Because the issue will likely arise on remand, we note that the AL J reasoned that, although claimant labored under a \u201ccorporate culture that was hostile to women employees,\u201d claimant did not have good cause for leaving work because two other women employees did not quit their jobs until they found other jobs. However, an employee is not required to sacrifice \u201call other than economic objectives and <em>* * * </em>endure racial, ethnic, or sexual slurs or personal abuse, for fear that abandoning an oppressive situation\u201d will disqualify the employee from unemployment benefits. <em>McPherson v. Employment Division, </em>285 Or 541, 557, 591 P2d 1381 <em>(1979);Londahl v. Employment Division, </em>72 Or App 366, 370, 695 P2d 1388 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
