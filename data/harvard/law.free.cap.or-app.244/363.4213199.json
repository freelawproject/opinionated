We agree with the trial court that it properly ordered visitation between the siblings and, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Father and his 15-year-old daughter D are within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court by reason of father having assaulted D. Father is facing criminal charges arising out of that conduct and is prohibited from having contact with D, and D does not want any contact with father. However, D, who is in foster care, would like to see her siblings and a step-sibling, ages 12, 5, and 2, who are in father\u2019s physical custody and not within the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">During a dispositional review hearing, the juvenile court heard evidence that D wanted to visit her siblings. The DHS caseworker\u2019s report stated that father was declining to make D\u2019s three siblings available to visit D so long as D did not want to see her father.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court expressed concern over father\u2019s interference with visits between D and her siblings and suggested that it could require father to allow those visits. Father\u2019s counsel expressed the view that the court lacked authority to order father to allow his three other children, who were not within the court\u2019s jurisdiction, to visit with D. The court rejected father\u2019s argument, explaining that father was within the court\u2019s authority and that the sibling visits were necessary for D\u2019s well-being. The judgment states that \u201c[fjather will not interfere or obstruct contact between [D] and siblings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">On appeal, father asserts that the juvenile court lacked statutory authority to enter a judgment affecting his care of the other children, because those children are not within the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Further, he asserts that the court\u2019s order violates ORS 419B.090(4) and his constitutional right under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to direct the upbringing of his children. <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 US 57, 65, 120 S Ct 2054, 147 L Ed 2d 49 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>(2000). Father has not requested <em>de novo </em>review; accordingly, we are bound by the juvenile court\u2019s factual findings unless there is no evidence in the record to support them, and we review the court\u2019s legal conclusions for errors of law. ORS 19.415(3)(b); <em>Dept. of Human Services v. C. Z., </em>236 Or App 436, 442, 236 P3d 791 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">We conclude that the juvenile court had statutory authority to order the visitation. There are several provisions of the Juvenile Code that govern the court\u2019s authority over the parent of a ward. For example, ORS 419B.385 provides that the parent is subject to the jurisdiction of the court and that \u201c[t]he court may order the parent or guardian to assist the court in any reasonable manner in providing appropriate education or counseling for the ward.\u201d ORS 419B.387 provides further that the court may order the parent to participate in \u201ctreatment or training\u201d if it is in the ward\u2019s best interest. Although none of those provisions speaks to the court\u2019s authority to direct a parent\u2019s conduct with respect to children who are not within the court\u2019s jurisdiction, ORS 419B.337(3) provides specifically that the juvenile court \u201cmay make an order regarding visitation by the ward\u2019s parents or siblings.\u201d We conclude that that statute provides authority for the court to make an order regarding visitation with siblings who are not wards of the court or within the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">ORS 419B.389 provides that a parent who believes or claims that \u201cfinancial, health or other problems will prevent or delay the parent\u2019s compliance with an order of the court must inform the court of the relevant circumstances as soon as reasonably possible and, if appropriate, seek relief from the order under ORS 419B.923.\u201d Although father asserted that the court lacked authority to require him to allow visits with D\u2019s siblings, he did not offer any reason at the hearing for being unable to comply with the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Father argues, for the first time on appeal, that the juvenile court\u2019s actions must not only comply with the Juvenile Code but with the constitutional limitations on state power. ORS 419B.090(4);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number><em>Smith, </em>205 Or App 152, 165-67, 133 P3d 924 (2006). Citing <em>Troxel, </em>father asserts that the juvenile court\u2019s order requiring him to make his children available for visitation with D violated ORS 419B.090(4), because that order interfered with his fundamental liberty interest under the Fourteenth Amendment to direct the upbringing of his three children who are not within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. Father asserts that, as a fit parent with respect to the children who are in his physical custody and not within the jurisdiction of the court, there is a presumption that he is acting in their best interests. <em>See O\u2019Donnell-Lamont and Lamont, </em>337 Or 86, 119-20, 91 P3d 721 (2004), <em>cert den, </em>543 US 1050 (2005). He asserts further that, in the absence of a finding that that presumption has been overcome, he cannot be directed by the court regarding his conduct with respect to those children or his decision not to allow D to visit them.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Preservation of error requirements apply in juvenile dependency cases. <em>See State v. R. H., </em>237 Or App 245, 251, 239 P3d 505 (2010) (applying preservation of error requirements in a juvenile dependency proceeding); <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. J. N., </em>225 Or App 139, 143-44, 200 P3d 615 (2009) (same). We have examined the record and, although, as noted, the parties discussed the question of the court\u2019s authority to require father to allow visitation, father did not raise to the juvenile court and, therefore, did not preserve for appeal, his constitutional argument under <em>Troxel. </em>Accordingly, we do not reach that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-8\"> Father did not attend the dispositional hearing, but his attorney was present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\"> The court\u2019s authority is circumscribed by ORS 409B. 190(4), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC7\">\u201cIt is the policy of the State of Oregon to guard the liberty interest of parents protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Constitution and to protect the rights and interests of children, as provided in subsection (2) of this section.
