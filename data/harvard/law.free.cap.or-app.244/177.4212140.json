J.</author>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Claimant seeks review of an order of the Employment Appeals Board (board) affirming without opinion the decision of an administrative law judge (ALJ) denying his claim for unemployment benefits because \u201c[cjlaimant voluntarily quit work without good cause.\u201d On review, claimant raises a number of contentions concerning purported procedural irregularities that we reject without discussion. We write only to address claimant\u2019s contentions that the board erred in affirming the ALJ\u2019s determination that he voluntarily quit work without good cause because that determination was not supported by substantial evidence or substantial reason and was legally erroneous. Because we conclude that the board\u2019s order is inadequate for judicial review, we reverse and remand for reconsideration without addressing the merits of whether claimant left work without good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We take the basic facts from the ALJ\u2019s order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\u201c(1) Salem-Keizer Public Schools employed claimant from May 19, 2008 to August 24, 2009. Claimant quit work on August 24, 2009, because he did not have housing in the Salem area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">\u201c(2) During employer\u2019s summer break, claimant moved from Salem to the Newport area because he had friends who were willing to provide him with housing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">\u201c(3) In August 2009, claimant contacted a church and friends for financial help so he could move back to Salem. None of those sources [was] willing to give claimant financial assistance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">In light of those facts, the ALJ concluded that claimant \u201cvoluntarily quit work without good cause.\u201d Specifically, the ALJ reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">\u201c[c]laimant failed to establish he faced a situation so grave that he had no reasonable alternative but to leave work. Claimant\u2019s friends, and the church he contacted, may not have been willing to financially assist claimant. However, <em>claimant did not present any affirmative </em>evidence,[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>beyond asking for financial assistance, that he tried to find suitable housing or transportation that would have allowed him to continue working for </em>employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Claimant appealed to the board. The board did not adopt the ALJ\u2019s findings and conclusion but, instead, simply affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order without opinion. Claimant sought reconsideration, which the board denied because claimant \u201cfailed to identify a material error of fact or law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">This case is materially indistinguishable from <em>Opp v. Employment Dept., </em>242 Or App 673, 259 P3d 15 (2011). In that case, we reasoned that, where the board affirms an ALJ\u2019s decision without opinion, \u201cmeaningful judicial review [is] impossible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676. Specifically, we held that, \u201c[b]ecause the EAB\u2019s order was entirely devoid of findings or conclusions, it [was] insufficient to meet the standards of ORS 183.470(2).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Here, as in <em>Opp, </em>the board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order without opinion. Further, in remanding, we note for the board\u2019s consideration claimant\u2019s assertion on review that the ALJ\u2019s characterization (emphasized above) that he had failed to present \u201caffirmative evidence\u201d regarding his efforts to secure suitable housing or transportation cannot be reconciled with claimant\u2019s testimony at the hearing. Accordingly, as in <em>Opp, </em>we remand this case to the board to make findings and explain how those findings support its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Reversed and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-11\"> During the hearing, claimant testified that he quit his position as a bus driver because he simply could not afford to live in Salem even if he continued working. Specifically, claimant testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u201cI was too far away to commute. I was several hours away. You know, I did not have a ride and also I had had to move out of Salem. I couldn\u2019t afford to live in Salem and I couldn\u2019t afford to come back, and my attempts to find temporary housing or emergency housing was rebuffed and I was put on multiple waiting lists. And I still haven\u2019t heard today from those waiting lists.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
