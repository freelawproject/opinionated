ORS 657.176(2)(c). Claimant contends that the EAB\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree with claimant and therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The following facts are taken from the unchallenged findings in the EAB\u2019s decision and the uncontroverted evidence in the record. The Canby School District hired claimant to work full-time as an elementary school Special Education Resource teacher during the 2008-09 school year. On May 1, 2009, the director of human resources for the school district, Hank Harris, met with claimant and notified her that, due to budget cuts, she would be reduced to working part-time hours and would be reassigned to a special education teaching position at \u201cParrott Creek.\u201d Parrott Creek is a residential treatment facility for juvenile offenders who would otherwise be placed in a youth correctional facility. The structured living program includes \u201con-site alternative education.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">During their May 1 meeting, Harris told claimant that Parrott Creek was a middle school for children who have been in trouble with the law but \u201chaven\u2019t done horrible crimes.\u201d Claimant expressed concerns about her safety working in that setting. Harris attempted to allay those fears, assuring her that she \u201cwould be just fine\u201d and that there were multiple ways in which she could get help if needed. Harris told her that the class size would be small \u2014 a group of five to six students \u2014 and that an instructional assistant would be with her in the classroom at all times. Claimant told Harris that she would take the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">On June 9, 2009, claimant toured Parrott Creek for three to four hours with its associate principal. She met and spoke with the departing teacher whose position she would be taking and that teacher\u2019s instructional assistant. During <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>the tour, claimant learned that Harris had provided inaccurate information about the school, the position, the students, and the classroom environment. She discovered that she would be teaching high school rather than middle school students, and that she would be teaching in a correctional setting. She learned that all the students were male, and that approximately 75 percent of them were at Parrott Creek because they had committed rape, sexual assault, or acts of physical violence. The classroom was located in a basement with small windows near the ceiling, had only one phone, and had no panic button. Although claimant had been told that she would be teaching five or six students, the class she observed had 12 students, and the departing teacher told her that she did not believe the class size was going to decrease the following year. Moreover, the instructional assistant explained to claimant that, depending on her clerical duties, the assistant would only be in the classroom for one or two hours per day, which meant that claimant would be alone in the classroom for much of the day. The departing teacher also told claimant that her life had been threatened on three occasions and that students had made \u201cnumerous\u201d sexual advances toward her.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Claimant met with Harris the same day, after the tour. Claimant, who was not trained or equipped to handle troubled youths, was concerned about the placement primarily because of safety concerns. She was also concerned because she \u201chad never taught high school before\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t have a certification to teach the \u2014 the core [high-school] subjects.\u201d Claimant discussed her concerns with Harris, including the 12-student class size and the basement classroom location. Harris did not indicate that anything would be or could be changed or addressed. Claimant specifically asked if she would get training or assistance, and Harris\u2019s only response was that \u201cthis job isn\u2019t for everyone.\u201d Harris gave claimant until July 15 to decide whether she would take the position at Parrott Creek. On July 14, claimant declined the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Claimant then sought unemployment insurance benefits, and her claim was initially allowed by the Employment Department. The school district requested a hearing, and, following that hearing, an administrative law judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>(ALJ) awarded benefits to claimant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The school district appealed that decision to the EAB, arguing that claimant had voluntarily left her employment without \u201cgood cause,\u201d thereby disqualifying her from receiving unemployment insurance benefits. ORS 657.176(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">The EAB reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision. The EAB found that claimant \u201cdid not ask Harris or any other representative of the employer to modify her working conditions to lessen her safety concerns or whether her other assumptions about the school were accurate.\u201d The EAB further found that \u201cemployer customarily provided training or mentoring for teachers, like claimant who, although certified to teach at a particular level, were not experienced in doing so.\u201d Based on those findings, the EAB concluded that claimant had not \u201cpursued her reasonable alternatives to quitting work\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">\u201cIn [the decision], the ALJ concluded that claimant\u2019s concerns for her physical safety combined with her lack of experience in teaching adjudicated youths constituted good cause for claimant to leave work. The ALJ failed to consider, however, whether claimant had demonstrated that she had no reasonable alternative but to leave work. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that claimant failed to establish good cause in that she did not pursue the options that a reasonable and prudent person would have explored before deciding to quit work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">\u201cClaimant acted on her fears, impressions, and assumptions in deciding to quit work rather than trying to explore whether her fears were legitimate and whether the employer could or had the capacity to take steps that would alleviate her concerns. Claimant had the option to ask the employer for information about the dangers associated with the Parrott Creek position, what types of security and assistance would be available to her in that position, and whether any accommodations could be made that would make her feel more secure teaching the special education class at Parrott Creek. Because claimant failed to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>that she pursued her reasonable alternatives to quitting work, she has therefore failed to establish that she left work for good cause. Claimant is disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">In her petition for judicial review, claimant argues that certain factual findings in the EAB\u2019s decision are not supported by substantial evidence, and that the EAB\u2019s conclusion does not logically follow from its factual findings. <em>See </em>ORS 183.482(8)(c) (\u201cSubstantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d); <em>Alcala v. Employment Dept., </em>235 Or App 32, 37-38, 230 P3d 59 (2010) (substantial evidence review requires us to ensure that the EAB\u2019s decision \u201c \u2018articulates the reasoning that leads from the facts found to the conclusions drawn\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Salosha, Inc. v. Lane County, </em>201 Or App 138, 143, 117 P3d 1047 (2005)). We agree that the EAB\u2019s reasoning in this case was flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">\u201cFor a voluntary quit, the focus is on whether the claimant left work with good cause.\u201d <em>McDowell v. Employment Dept. </em>348 Or 605, 612, 236 P3d 722 (2010). \u201cGood cause\u201d is a delegative term that the Employment Department has authority to refine by rulemaking. The general test for good cause under the department\u2019s rule, OAR 471-030-0038(4), is whether a \u201creasonable and prudent person of normal sensitivity, exercising ordinary common sense, would leave work.\u201d In other words, good cause is \u201can objective standard that asks whether a \u2018reasonable and prudent person\u2019 would consider the situation so grave that he or she had no reasonable alternative to quitting.\u201d <em>McDowell, </em>348 Or at 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Importantly, that \u201cobjective inquiry depends on what claimant <em>in fact knew and reasonably should have known </em>when [she] made [her] decision\u201d to quit her job. <em>Id. </em>at 619 (emphasis added). There is no dispute that, after her tour at Parrott Creek, claimant learned that she would be teaching (1) high-school classes (2) of male students (3) who had been convicted of sexual and violent offenses (4) and who had made sexual advances toward, and threatened the life of, their current teacher; and, further, that she would be teaching (5) mostly by herself (6) in a basement with small <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>windows, one phone, and no panic button. When claimant confronted the human resources director, Harris, with her safety concerns, including the class sizes and the location of the classroom, Harris told her only that \u201cthis job isn\u2019t for everyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">On those facts, a reasonable person in claimant\u2019s position would have had no reason to believe that the school district was willing or able to make further accommodations to the teaching position at Parrott Creek. That is, under the circumstances \u2014 where claimant presented specific safety concerns that were summarily dismissed by the school district\u2019s human resources director \u2014 she reasonably understood the conditions at Parrott Creek to be as she saw them on her tour, and reasonably believed that her only alternatives were to accept or decline the position as it existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The EAB\u2019s conclusion \u2014 that claimant \u201cacted on her fears, impressions, and assumptions in deciding to quit work rather than trying to explore whether her fears were legitimate and whether the employer could or had the capacity to take steps that would alleviate her concerns\u201d \u2014 imposed an unreasonable burden on claimant. Viewing the evidence as a whole, and contrary to the EAB\u2019s conclusion, there was no reason for claimant to have further pressed her human resources director about whether the district would take \u201csteps that would alleviate her concerns\u201d; Harris\u2019s response told her otherwise. And considering that most of what Harris initially told claimant about Parrott Creek was demonstrably false, she could reasonably assume that there was little to gain from eliciting his further assurances regarding safety accommodations. Furthermore, although the EAB found that \u201cemployer customarily provided training or mentoring for teachers\u201d who were inexperienced at \u201ca particular level,\u201d the EAB did not find (and there is no evidence in the record) that <em>claimant knew or had reason to know </em>that such training or mentoring was provided. As it was, claimant would not have been able to teach at Parrott Creek without risking her personal safety; a \u201creasonable and prudent person\u201d under those circumstances would have considered the situation \u201cso grave that he or she had no reasonable alternative to quitting.\u201d <em>McDowell, </em>348 Or at 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>In sum, the school district reassigned claimant, an elementary school teacher, to a position teaching high-school-age males in the basement of a residential treatment facility, where she would be alone with students with histories of violence and sexual offenses. She had no training or experience that would have prepared her for that environment, raised concerns about her safety with the school district, and was then simply given the choice to accept or reject the reassignment. She had good cause to decline the reassignment under the circumstances known to her, and the EAB erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-8\"> Neither the school district nor the Employment Department filed a response brief in this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b667-7\"> This was the second of two hearings that the ALJ conducted. After the first hearing, the ALJ determined that, because claimant remained on the school district\u2019s recall list, she had not been separated from her employment, a prerequisite to benefits. The district appealed that decision, and the EAB set it aside on the ground that claimant voluntarily left her employment. That determination is not in dispute; the only issue in this case is whether she left for \u201cgood cause.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
