He assigns error to, among other things, the trial court\u2019s admission of an expert\u2019s medical diagnosis that complainant had been sexually abused. That diagnosis was rendered in the absence of any physical evidence of abuse. Consistently with <em>State v. Lupoli, </em>348 Or 346, 234 P3d 117 (2010), we conclude that the trial court\u2019s admission of that diagnosis was error. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Defendant was charged with sexually abusing and sodomizing his granddaughter, C, over a period of years. At the time of the alleged abuse, C lived with her father and his girlfriend, Reaves, but would often stay with defendant and his wife on weekends. At some point, Reaves became suspicious of defendant\u2019s relationship with C. Reaves had been a victim of abuse herself, and she routinely asked C and her other children whether they had been treated inappropriately by anyone. One day, she asked C three times whether \u201canybody was doing anything to her\u201d that Reaves should know about. C denied each time that anything inappropriate was being done to her. After Reaves provided reassurances, C confided that defendant had sexually abused her. Reaves comforted C and told her that she, too, had experienced sexual abuse as a child. Reaves then called the police. An officer arrived at the family residence and interviewed C. Reaves was present for and participated in the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">C was later evaluated at \u201cThe Lighthouse,\u201d a child abuse assessment clinic. That evaluation was based on an interview with C, a review of her social and medical history as provided by her father and Reaves, and a physical examination. That examination, which was conducted by Dr. Little, revealed no physical evidence of abuse. Nonetheless, based on the interview with C and the history that had been provided, Little diagnosed C with sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Before trial, defendant filed a motion to limit or exclude the expert testimony of Little, citing \u201cOEC 104, OEC 401, OEC 403, [and] OEC 702.\u201d Defendant argued, among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>other things, that the \u201c[testimony concerning a \u2018diagnosis\u2019 of child sexual abuse\u201d should be excluded. More precisely, defendant argued that the expert testimony did not meet the foundational requirements for scientific evidence as articulated in <em>State v. O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or 285, 290, 899 P2d 663 (1995), and <em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 438, 687 P2d 751 (1984), and that the testimony, moreover, would constitute \u201can impermissible comment on the credibility of another witness.\u201d The trial court denied the motion in part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Defendant also filed a pretrial motion to exclude the testimony of the complainant, C, on the ground that it was inherently unreliable. Defendant argued that, during the initial questioning of C, Reaves and the police officer employed suggestive interviewing techniques that contaminated C\u2019s memory and tainted her subsequent testimony. Defendant also maintained that C\u2019s history of behavioral problems, mental illness, and lying \u2014 including a prior false accusation of abuse \u2014 further rendered her testimony \u201cwholly unreliable.\u201d The trial court denied that motion as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">At trial, the state presented the testimony of Little, who recounted his diagnosis of sexual abuse. The state also offered testimony from C, C\u2019s father, C\u2019s brother, Reaves, the interviewing officer, and various law enforcement or investigatory personnel. Additionally, the state presented evidence that defendant\u2019s semen was found on chair cushions in his basement, where the sexual abuse was alleged to have occurred, and that a videotape containing pornography, which defendant allegedly played for C, was found in the basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Defendant, on the other hand, offered the testimony of some of C\u2019s former teachers, psychiatrists who had evaluated her, and an expert psychologist. Defendant\u2019s case was, in large part, focused on C\u2019s tumultuous psychosocial history, the possibility that her memory had been corrupted by suggestive questioning, and her past difficulties with telling the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">At the close of the state\u2019s case, and again at the conclusion of all the evidence, defendant moved for a judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>acquittal on all charges. The trial court denied both motions, and the jury convicted defendant of 12 counts each of sodomy in the first degree and sexual abuse in the first degree, but acquitted him of the remaining 18 counts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">On appeal, defendant first assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to exclude the testimony of C. He argues that suggestive pretrial questioning rendered C\u2019s testimony unreliable and that the trial court therefore should have excluded it from evidence. Defendant analogizes C\u2019s testimony to other categories of evidence that may be excluded on the basis of unreliability. <em>See, e.g., State v. Classen, </em>285 Or 221, 226, 590 P2d 1198 (1979) (\u201cEvidence law has long provided for excluding certain evidence as a class when its questionable reliability vitiates the value of its possible truthfulness in the particular case, apart from any question of constitutional law. One familiar example is the exclusion of coerced confessions; others are the exclusion of evidence obtained by polygraph tests, hypnosis, or \u2018truth drugs.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We rejected an analogous argument in <em>State v. Bumgarner, </em>219 Or App 617, 184 P3d 1143, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 175 (2008), <em>cert den, </em>555 US 1101, 129 S Ct 927, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>229 Or App 92, 209 P3d 857 (2009). There, the defendant was convicted of various sex crimes involving a four-year-old child. On appeal, he challenged the propriety of admitting the victim\u2019s testimony, arguing that her memory had been tainted by suggestive pretrial questioning. <em>Id. </em>at 627. The defendant asserted that, where there is evidence that improper interrogations may have undermined the reliability of a child witness\u2019s memory, a \u201ctaint\u201d hearing was required to determine the admissibility of the child\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 629-32. We declined to adopt such an approach, reasoning that it \u201cconflated the competency of the witness with the reliability of potential testimony that the witness might give.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633. We concluded that \u201cthe trier of fact, rather than the judge, is in the best position to determine the effect, if any, of improper interviewing techniques on a witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, we held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the victim\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\">The same reasoning applies here. Defendant does not argue that C is not competent to testify but, instead, challenges the reliability of her testimony. That assessment is essentially a question of credibility for the trier of fact to weigh in its deliberations rather than a question of admissibility for the court to determine in the first instance. Thus, the trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion to exclude C\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Defendant next assigns error to the trial court\u2019s admission of Little\u2019s medical diagnosis of sexual abuse in the absence of any physical evidence of abuse. Defendant argues, among other things, that admission of Little\u2019s diagnosis constituted an impermissible comment on the credibility of another witness, namely, C. Although <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009) (expert\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse made in the absence of physical evidence is inadmissible under OEC 403), and <em>Lupoli, </em>348 Or 346 (expert\u2019s diagnosis of child sexual abuse made in the absence of physical evidence is inadmissible as a comment on the credibility of another witness), had not been decided when defendant filed his opening brief, defendant cited those cases at oral argument in support of his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The state responds that defendant did not preserve an argument that Little\u2019s diagnosis was unfairly prejudicial under OEC 403 and did not expressly assign that aspect of the trial court\u2019s decision as error. In any event, the state contends that any error in admitting the diagnosis was harmless in light of the other evidence presented at trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Regardless of whether defendant preserved an argument that the expert\u2019s diagnosis was unfairly prejudicial under OEC 403, we have held that the admission of an expert\u2019s diagnosis of sexual abuse in the absence of physical evidence constitutes plain error. <em>See, e.g., State v. Lovern, </em>234 Or App 502, 228 P3d 688 (2010); <em>State v. Merrimon, </em>234 Or App 515, 228 P3d 666 (2010). Nonetheless, we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>address whether defendant preserved his argument under OEC 403 because defendant unquestionably preserved his argument that Little\u2019s diagnosis constituted impermissible vouching for the credibility of another witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">In <em>Lupoli, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that an expert\u2019s diagnosis of child sexual abuse, in the absence of physical evidence of abuse, \u201cnecessarily was based on [the expert\u2019s] assessment of the child\u2019s believability. When [the expert] then was asked the basis for her diagnosis, she was implicitly declaring, with each statement and description, why she had found [the child] to be credible.\u201d 348 Or at 362. Consequently, the court held that the expert\u2019s testimony amounted to impermissible vouching.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In subsequent cases, we have held that, even where an expert does not explicitly vouch for the child victim\u2019s credibility, a diagnosis of sexual abuse made in the absence of physical evidence constitutes impermissible vouching. <em>State v. Bainbridge, </em>238 Or App 56, 59, 241 P3d 1186 (2010); <em>see also State v. Davilia, </em>239 Or App 468, 475-76, 244 P3d 855 (2010) (following <em>Bainbridge); State v. Cordova-Contreras, </em>239 Or App 279, 282-83, 245 P3d 147 (2010) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">This case fits squarely within that precedent. Although Little did not explicitly vouch for C\u2019s credibility, his diagnosis was made without any physical evidence of abuse and, therefore, was necessarily based on his assessment of C\u2019s credibility. Thus, it constituted impermissible vouching. The trial court erred in admitting the diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">We reject the state\u2019s contention that that error was harmless. \u201c[A] harmless error is one that has little likelihood\u2019 of affecting the verdict.\u201d <em>Lupoli, </em>348 Or at 366 n 11. Here, there was no physical evidence of abuse. The state\u2019s case was built around the believability of C\u2019s allegations. It offered no other direct evidence that the abuse occurred. Defendant\u2019s theory of the case, by contrast, was that C had fabricated the allegations in response to suggestive questioning and that, in light of her psychological and behavioral history, her testimony simply could not be believed. In sum, the outcome of the case hinged on the credibility of C. Under those circumstances, we cannot say that the diagnosis of sexual abuse was unlikely to have affected the verdict. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>(\u201cIn this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>case, there was no physical evidence of abuse; the children\u2019s credibility, therefore, was paramount. In that circumstance, we cannot conclude that there was \u2018little likelihood\u2019 that the experts\u2019 testimony affected the verdict.\u201d). Accordingly, defendant\u2019s convictions must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-8\"> The trial court granted part of the motion not relevant to the issues on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b129-6\"> Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal.
