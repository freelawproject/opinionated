Order entered May 14, 1959 modified by striking therefrom the word and figure \u201c Sixty ($60.00) \u201d and by substituting therefor the word and figure \u201c Forty ($40.00) \u201d, As so modified, order insofar as appealed from unanimously affirmed, without costs. In our opinion, there was no power in the court to increase the support payment for the minor children over and above the amount fixed in the separation agreement between the parties. <em>(People ex rel. Prior </em>v. <em>Prior, </em>112 Mise. 208; <em>People ex rel.

Sections 30 and 30-a of the Children\u2019s Court Act contain the only provisions for compeling future support of minor children where a nonmarital proceeding is brought for that purpose outside the City of New York. Appeal from order entered June 3, 1959 dismissed, without costs, as academic. Present\u2014 Wenzel, Acting P.
