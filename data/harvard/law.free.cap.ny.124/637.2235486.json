The Special Term decided in her favor, and as part of the final judgment, awarded her $300, for repayment of the sums expended by her for her support and maintenance since the commencement of the action. The General Term modified the judgment by striking out this allowance. Its order does not state the grounds for this modification.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-5\">The following is the opinion in full:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-6\">\u201c The case of <em>Beadleston </em>v. <em>Beadleston </em>(103 N. Y. 402), upon which the General Term seems to have relied in deducting $300 from the judgment of the Special Term, has no application to this appeal, because the subject there under review was an order made <em>pendente </em>lite, but after the referee had made his report which convicted the wife of adultery, although no judgment had been entered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-7\">\u201c This court held that the power of the Special Term, under those circumstances, was confined to such allowances as were necessary to enable the wife to \u2018 carry on or defend the action,\u2019 and that there could be no necessity for an allowance to make a defense that had already been made. In this case the Special Term, as part of its final judgment of separation from bed and board in favor of the wife, awarded her $300 \u2018 for repayment of the sums expended by her in her support and maintenance since the commencement of\u2019 the ac+ion. It was the duty of the defendant to support his wife, and as he failed to discharge that duty after suit was instituted against him, she was compelled to procure and expend money for that purpose. Upon the termination of the action, the court, in rendering judgment for the plaintiff, had the power to give \u2018such directions as the nature and circumstances of the case \u2019 required. The General Term had power to review the discretion exercised by the Special Term, and to strike out the $300 as improvidently allowed under all the circumstances, but it had no right to do so upon the ground that the lower court had no power to allow it. <em>(Tilton </em>v. Beecher, 59 N. Y. 176.) In the case cited the order stated that it was made \u2018 on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>ground that the court had no power to grant the same/ and, as we understand the rule, unless it appears in the record, of which the opinion forms no part, that the action of the court was based upon a want of power, we cannot reA-iew it. <em>(Titus </em>v. <em>Orvis, 16 </em>N. Y. 617, <em>618; Tolman </em>v. <em>S., B. &amp; </em>N. <em>Y. R. R. Co., </em>92 id. 353, 356.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-3\"><em>\u201c </em>It is a fundamental rule governing the review by one tribunal of the proceedings of another that orders or decisions resting in discretion are not revieAvable. (<em>Wavel </em>v. <em>Wiles, </em>24 N. Y. 635, 636.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-4\">\u201c The order of the General Term may have been made, so far as the record discloses, in the exercise of a conceded discretion, and if not, it was the duty of the appellant to procure it to be so settled as to show that it was not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-5\">\u201c We think that the judgment and all of the order's should be affirmed, Avithout costs in this court to either party.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b671-6\"><em>Wilder, Wilder da Lynch </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b671-7\"><em>Baphael J.
