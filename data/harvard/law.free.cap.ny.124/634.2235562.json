Hamsher, Respondent.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b666-9\">Certain town assessors,' not knowing of the repeal, by the act of 1872 (Chap. 855, Laws of 1872), of the provision of the Revised Statutes (1 R. S. 889, \u00a7 <em>4, </em>as amended by chap. 287; Laws of 1871) directing that a farm or lot lying in two towns or wards shall, if occupied, be assessed in the town or lot where the occupant resides, assessed a farm owned and occupied by plaintiff as so prescribed, and the commissioner of highways of the town, in making his assessment for highway labor, assessed plaintiff for highway labor on his whole farm in compliance with the provision of the statute (1 R. S. 506, \u00a7 24) requiring him to make his apportionment upon real estate \u201cas the same shall appear upon the last assessment-roll of the town.\u201d Plaintiff worked out the tax at the demand of the overseer of the highways, but protested against its legality. <em>Held, </em>that an action was not maintainable against the commissioner to recover the value of the labor so rendered by plaintiff; as that officer had jurisdiction to assess plaintiff and simply obeyed the command of a valid statute.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b666-10\">Reported below, 46 Hun, 144.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b666-11\">(Argued December 2, 1890;</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AHX\">decided January 22, 1891.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-12\">Appeal from judgment of the General Term of the Supreme Court in the fifth judicial department, entered upon an order made October 24, 1887, which reversed a judgment of the County Court of Livingston county, and affirmed a judgment of a justice of the peace.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-13\">This action was brought against defendant, who, as commissioner of highways, had apportioned highway labor upon the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s farm, only a portion of which lay in the town, to recover the value of the labor which plaintiff had performed under protest.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b667-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>The following is the opinion in full:</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-3\">\u201cSection 4 of. title 2 of chapter 13 of part 1 of the Revised Statutes was amended by chapter 287 of the Laws of 1871 so-that it read as follows: \u2018\u00a7 4. When the line between two towns or wards divides a farm or lot, the same shall be taxed, if occupied, in the town or ward where the occupant resides; except when such town lines shall also be a county line, in which case each part shall be assessed in the town in which the same shall be situated, in the same manner as unoccupied lands are now assessed.\u2019 This section was repealed by chapter 355 of the Laws of 1872, and from that time there was no statute on, this subject until 1886, when the section was re-enacted: \u00a7 4. When the line between two towns, wards or counties, divides a farm or lot, the same shall be taxed, if occupied, in the town, ward or county where the occupant resides; if unoccupied, each part shall be assessed in the town, ward, village or county where the same shall lie.\u2019 (Chap. 315, Laws of 1886.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-4\">\u201c In 1884 and 1885, the plaintiff was a resident of the town of Ossian, and owned and occupied a farm, one half of which was in that town and the other half in the town of Bunda.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-5\">\u201c In 1884, the assessors of the town of Ossian, not knowing of the repeal of section 4 by chapter 355 of the Laws of 1872, assessed the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s farm in that town for town, county and state taxes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-6\">\u201c Section 19 of title 1, chapter 16 of part 1 of the Revised Statutes provides: \u2018 \u00a7 19. Every person owning or occupying land in the town in which he or she resides, and every male inhabitant above the age of 21 years, residing in the town when the assessment is made, shall be assessed to work on the public highways of the town, and the lands of non-residents situated in such town shall be assessed for highway labor as hereinafter directed.\u2019 Section 24 of the same chapter provides : <em>\u2018 </em>\u00a7 24. In making such estimate and assessment, the commissioner shall proceed as follows: 1. The whole number of days\u2019 work to be assessed in each year shall be ascertained, and shall be at least three times the number of taxable inhabitants in such town. 2. Every male inhabitant above the age of twenty-one years (with certain exceptions) shall be assessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>at least one day. 3. The residue of such days' work shall be apportioned upon the estate, real and personal, of every inhabitant of such town, as the same shall appear upon the last assessment-roll of said town, and upon each tract or parcel of land, of which the owners are non-residents, contained in the lists made as aforesaid.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-4\">\u201cIn 1885, the defendant was the sole commissioner of highways of Ossian, and he assessed the plaintiff for highway labor on his whole farm \u2014\u2022 three and one-half days being the proportion of that part situated in Nunda \u2014\u25a0 and delivered the list to the overseer of the proper road district. This tax the plaintiff worked out at the demand of the overseer, but protested against its legality. It is agreed that the commissioner made the assessment, believing that he was bound to follow the town assessment-roll of the previous year, and also that he had jurisdiction to assess the plaintiff for highway labor, but it is asserted that the commissioner erred in apportioning any day\u2019s labor on account of that part of the farm situated in Nunda. The defendant having jurisdiction to assess the plaintiff and having apportioned the number of days\u2019 labor to be rendered according to the valuation' of his estate as it appeared on the last preceding assessment-roll, as commanded by the 24th section of the statute, he is not liable to the plaintiff for the value of the labor rendered by him in satisfaction of the assessment. <em>(People ex rel v. Pierce, </em>31 Barb. 138; <em>Trustees of the Village of Angelica </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>56 id. 380.) The cause of the alleged erroneous assessment was the mistake of the assessors of the town, but the commissioner having obeyed the command of a valid statute, is not liable to this plaintiff in damages for the error of the' assessors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-5\">\u201c The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b668-6\"><em>J.
