Y. 676).</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-9\">\u201cNo attempt was made by the learned counsel for the appellant to distinguish the two cases, and a careful examination of the appeal book in each enables us to say that no distinction in fact exists. As the same questions, arising out of substantially the same facts, are brought before the court a second time, it is our duty to pronounce the same judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-10\">\u201c This appeal was taken March 23, 1886, and the decision in the <em>Hooker </em>case was handed down December 20, 1887. As the defendant persisted in its appeal, and insisted upon arguing it after all the questions involved had been finally passed upon by this court, nearly three years before, we award to the plaintiff as damages by way of costs for the delay, pursuant to section 3251, subdivision 5, of the Code of Civil Procedure, ten per cent upon the amount of the original judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b656-11\">\u201cThe judgment should be affirmed, with costs, and an allowance of ten per cent upon the amount of the original judgment.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b656-12\"><em>Henry J.
