The blanks existed not only in the paper, but also in the minds of the parties, which had never met upon the subject. Eo general right purported to be granted to the plaintiff, but only a special, though exclusive, right of user, dependent wholly upon the weight of the fabric per yard, yet the blank for this vital particular was left unfilled. There was no agreement, verbal or written, express or implied, as to what that blank should contain. There was no evidence from which the court, even if it were otherwise practicable, could have filled the blank. Every right of the plaintiff rested upon this unadjusted matter, which was left blank in both places Avhere it occurred in the proposed agreement. Careful provision Avas made for a forfeiture of Ins right if the plaintiff used the machines in violation of the license, limited to an undetermined Aveiglit per yard of the material manufactured into gloves. The learned counsel for the plaintiff contends that the instrument, if signed, would he so construed as to mean\u2019 a reasonable Aveight per yard,\u2019 but the parties did not agree to this, and if they had there is no evidence to enable the court to determine Avliat a reasonable Aveight A\\ould be. Eo standard of comparison is disclosed. Far from agreeing upon that point, the parties did not even discuss it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b707-3\">\u00a3\u00a3 The proposed agreement Avas blank also as to its duration, to the extent at least of an entire year, a consideration of some importance AAdien it is home in mind that the amount of the royalties Avas guaranteed by the plaintiff to be less than $6,000 a year.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b707-4\">\u201cWe agree Avith the learned General Term in saying it is impossible to deduce from this unsigned instrument the terms of a contract sufficiently clear and definite to enable a court to enforce the specific performance thereof.\u2019 We do not think that the parties should be compelled to sign a Avriting so incomplete and indefinite as to be incapable of enforcement Avlien signed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b707-5\">\u201c The judgment should be affirmed, with costs to the defendants Jennings, but without costs to the defendants Arnold.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b707-6\"><em>A.
