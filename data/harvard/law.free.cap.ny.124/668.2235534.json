Appleton et al., Appellants.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b700-12\">Where incompetent evidence has been admitted on the trial of an action and it affirmatively appears from the opinion below that it was relied on in deciding a material issue, its admission cannot be regarded as a harmless error and will be sufficient ground for the reversal of a judgment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b700-13\">Defendants contracted to pay plaintiff for orders obtained for certain serial publications. In an action upon the contract, one H., who had been employed by plaintiff as an assistant under a contract expressed in the same terms, was permitted to testify, under objection, as to what he understood the language used entitled him to receive. A judgment in favor of plaintiff was rendered and the referee, in his opinion, referred to the evidence as corroborative of plaintiS\u2019s understanding of the contract. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was incompetent, and its reception error, requiring a reversal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b700-14\">Defendants claimed that the orders referred to meant orders given by persons accepting and paying for the whole or some part of the work subscribed for, and did not include those given by persons who refused to take and pay therefor in whole or in part. The referee allowed plaintifl to prove that many subscribers failed to perform their contracts by reason of defendants\u2019 delay in making delivery. <em>Held, </em>no error.</headnotes>\n<history data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b700-15\">-Reported on former appeals, 102 M.

Appleton &amp; Co. were the publishers \u2022 of Picturesque Europe, Picturesque America, Turner\u2019s Gallery, the American Cyclopedia and the Condensed Cyclopedia. The first two mentioned works were each issued in about sixty monthly parts at fifty cents a number. Turner\u2019s Gallery was issued in about fifty monthly parts at the same price per number. The American Cyclopedia consisted of sixteen, and the Condensed Cyclopedia of four volumes, the latter being sold, bound, at $7.50 per volume, and in parts at fifty cents a number.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b701-5\">\u201c Between December 20,1877, and May 20, 1878, the plaintiff was engaged under an oral contract with D. Appleton <em>&amp; </em>Co. in procuring subscribers for these works in the states of Louisiana and Texas. The plaintiff alleges that by the terms, of the oral contract he is entitled to receive $15 for every order obtained for the American Cyclopedia, $6 for every order for a bound set of the Condensed Cyclopedia and $4 for every order for the other publications. The defendants contend that, by the terms of their contract the plaintiff was entitled to receive $15 for every <em>bona fide </em>subscriber for the American Cyclopedia who should accept and pay for five volumes of that work, or $20 for each subscriber who should receive and pay for a whole set at one time, $6 an order for the Condensed Cyclopedia delivered in bound volumes or $3.50 when delivered in parts, and $4 each for every <em>bona fide </em>order for any one of the serials when ten parts had been accepted and paid for. The defendants also contended before the referee and asked him to find that the words <em>\u201c </em>order \u201d and \u201c subscription,\u201d as between publishers and canvassers, meant when used as a basis of the latter\u2019s compensation, orders or subscriptions given by persons accepting and paying for the whole or some part of the work subscribed for and did not include those given by irresponsible persons who refused to take and pay for a whole or any part of it. The referee found that the plaintiff obtained the following orders:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>18 for the American Cyclopedia, for which he was entitled to $15 each........................... $270</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b702-5\">6 for hound sets of the Condensed Cyclopedia, for which he was entitled to $6 each............... 36</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b702-7\">515 for Turner\u2019s Gallery, Picturesque Europe and Picturesque America, for which he was entitled to $4 each.................................... 2,060</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b702-8\">Total...................................... $2,366</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b702-9\">The plaintiff has been paid....................... 865</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b702-10\">Due plaintiff, with interest from June 1, 1878...... $1,501</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b702-11\">\u201cWhile prosecuting the business, the plaintiff employed one Holbrook as an assistant, under a contract expressed in the same words as the contract which the plaintiff claims to have made with the defendants. Holbrook was called as a witness \u25a0in behalf of plaintiff and permitted to testify over defendants\u2019 objection and exception that he understood the lan.guage employed to entitle him to receive $4 for every signature obtained by him to the serials above mentioned. By allowing this witness to declare his understanding of his rights under his contract with the plaintiff he was permitted to testify to the legal effect of the one between the parties to this action, which was clearly incompetent. Whether the plaintiff\u2019s or the defendants\u2019 version of the contract was correct was a sharply-litigated question of fact, upon the determination of which the learned referee rested his decision of the case, and in his opinion, he referred to this evidence of Holbrook as corroborative of that of the plaintiff. When it affirmatively \u2022appears by the opinion that incompetent evidence was relied on in deciding a material issue, its admission cannot be held to be a harmless error. <em>(Woodgate </em>v. Fleet, 44 N. Y. 1, 14, 20.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b702-12\">\u201c The refereee did not err in permitting the plaintiff to prove that many of the subscribers failed to perform their contracts by reason of the defendants\u2019 delay in making deliveries. This evidence was not relevant upon the issue as to what the contract was, nor -as to the meaning of the words \u201c order \u201d dr <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>\u201c subscription,\u201d but had the referee taken the defendants\u2019 view of the contract or of the meaning of those words, it would have become competent to show that many of the subscriptions which the plaintiff obtained and forwarded to the defendants became worthless by their neglect to deliver the works as agreed with the subscribers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b703-3\">\u201c The judgment should be reversed and a new trial granted, costs to abide the event.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b703-4\"><em>Edward Winslow Paige </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A6jH\"><em>Wm.
