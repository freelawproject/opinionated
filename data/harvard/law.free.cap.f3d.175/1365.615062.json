(\u201cAlfa Laval\u201d) appeals the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims, <em>Alfa Laval Separation, Inc. v. United States, </em>40 Fed.Cl. 215 (1998), denying injunctive relief in its post-award bid protest against the Department of the Navy (\u201cthe Navy\u201d) and Westfalia Separators, Inc. (\u201cWestfalia\u201d). Because Alfa Laval has demonstrated a significant, prejudicial error in the procurement process, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-19\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b931-20\">Alfa Laval has been the sole-source provider of centrifugal fuel oil purifiers to the Navy for over 20 years. After a 1996 maintenance inspection, Alfa Laval informed the Navy that certain purifiers on the Navy\u2019s DD963 class destroyers were beyond repair, and offered to supply updated models for a total cost of approximately $18.9 million, at a per-unit price of approximately $350,000. This price was lower than the $387,814.67 average unit price Alfa Laval had charged the Navy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>its two most recent procurements of the purifiers. Nevertheless, the Navy decided to open the procurement to competitive bidding, issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP) that contained certain mandatory requirements with which an offeror had to comply in order to be deemed responsive. The requirements addressed shock, Type I and Type II vibration, airborne noise, and performance testing. Additionally, the RFP defined four \u201cmarket acceptability criteria\u201d to verify the offerors\u2019 experience in supplying rehable purifiers. The offer- or was required to have: (1) produced the model being tendered or a generically similar model for at least ten years, (2) produced at least 300 generically similar or identical models, (3) produced at least 20 of the model being tendered, and (4) sold the item offered to the commercial market or to the government. The contract was to go to the lowest cost, technically acceptable proposal, as determined by a Navy technical evaluation panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Alfa Laval submitted three proposals ranging in price from $19.4 million to $23.6 million. Westfalia was the only other of-feror submitting a proposal, at $13.7 million, a price about $5 million less than Alfa Laval\u2019s lowest proposal and $10 million less than Alfa Laval\u2019s highest proposal. Because Westfalia had not yet manufactured the exact purifier it proposed to supply, the evaluation panel granted West-falia extensions under the RFP, allowing it to meet several of the testing requirements with extrapolated data from other purifiers it has manufactured. The panel lacked \u201ca set of measurements ... demonstrating [Westfalia\u2019s] compliance with the solicitation\u2019s Type II [vibration] testing requirements.\u201d <em>Alfa Laval, </em>40 Fed.Cl. at 232. The Navy nevertheless awarded the contract to Westfalia, and Alfa Laval filed a bid protest in the Court of Federal Claims, claiming that Westfalia\u2019s proposal did not comply with the RFP\u2019s mandatory requirements and market acceptability criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">After a three-day trial on the merits, the Court of Federal Claims entered judgment in favor of the government and Westfalia. The court found that the Navy violated the applicable procurement statute and regulation by awarding the contract to Westfalia, because Westfalia\u2019s proposal did not meet the Type II vibration testing requirement, but that the mistake was not sufficiently prejudicial to Alfa Laval to justify relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">Although we review legal conclusions of the Court of Federal Claims <em>de novo, </em>we disturb its factual findings only if they are \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>See Alger v. United States, </em>741 F.2d 391, 393 (Fed.Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">To prevail in a bid protest, a protester must show a significant, prejudicial error in the procurement process. <em>See Statistica, Inc. v. Christopher, </em>102 F.3d 1577, 1581 (Fed.Cir.1996); <em>Data Gen. Corp. v. Johnson, </em>78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir.1996). \u201cTo establish prejudice, a protester is not required to show that but for the alleged error, the protester would have been awarded the contract.\u201d <em>Data General, </em>78 F.3d at 1562 (citation omitted). Rather, the protester must show \u201cthat there was a substantial chance it would have received the contract award but for that error.\u201d <em>Statistica, </em>102 F.3d at 1582; <em>see CACI, Inc.-Fed. v. United States, </em>719 F.2d 1567, 1574-75 (Fed.Cir.1983) (to establish competitive prejudice, protester must demonstrate that but for the alleged error, \u201c \u2018there was a substantial chance that [it] would receive an award \u2014 that it was within the zone of active consideration\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">Westfalia and the government do not dispute that Westfalia\u2019s proposal was technically noncompliant in that it failed to comply \"with the Type II vibration test requirement. But this error was not insignificant. As the trial court held, \u201cregardless of the panel\u2019s view of the appropriateness of the standard [set out in the RFP], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>the Navy is strictly bound by its terms,\u201d and in waiving a portion of the standard for Westfalia, the Navy violated a clearly applicable procurement statute and regulation. 40 Fed.Cl. at 230; <em>see also </em>10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2305(b)(1) (1994) (\u201cThe head of an agency shall evaluate sealed bids and competitive proposals and make an award based solely on the factors specified in the solicitation.\u201d); 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.606(a), (c) (1996) (requiring the government to issue a written amendment to a solicitation when it \u201cchanges, relaxes, increases, or otherwise modifies its requirements,\u201d and to provide an opportunity for competitors to submit new or amended proposals when it prefers a proposal involving \u201ca departure from the stated requirements\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">Alfa Laval contends, and we agree, that the Navy\u2019s error was prejudicial. The only bid competing with Alfa Laval was unacceptable under the standards set out in the RFP. Thus, it was error to find that Alfa Laval, the incumbent, responsible supplier, had no \u201csubstantial chance\u201d to receive the contract award absent the Navy\u2019s error in awarding the contract to Westfalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">The trial court based its finding \u201con considerations of price,\u201d noting the \u201ccolossal price difference\u201d between Westfalia\u2019s offer ($13.7 million) and Alfa Laval\u2019s lowest priced offer ($19.4 million), as well as the difference between Alfa Laval\u2019s own sole-source proposal ($18.9 million) and the lowest bid Alfa Laval submitted in the competitive process ($19.4 million). <em>See </em>40 Fed.Cl. at 234. The court found that these price disparities precluded a finding of prejudice, relying on <em>Data General </em>for the proposition that, we have \u201capproved the use of price differential as a factor in determining the presence of prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235 (citing <em>Data General, </em>78 F.3d at 1564). But while price differential may be taken into account, it is not solely disposi-tive; we must consider all the surrounding circumstances in determining whether there was a substantial chance that a protester would have received an award but for a significant error in the procurement process. In issuing the RFP here, the government sought proposals that met certain requirements. Alfa Laval, an irrefutably competent supplier, submitted the only bid meeting all of the government\u2019s requirements, at a lower per-unit price than it had charged for the same purifiers in two recent procurements: it must have had a substantial chance to receive the contract award.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Westfalia\u2019s contention that Alfa Laval\u2019s own offer did not meet the requirements of the solicitation and therefore was not eligible for award is meritless. The trial court found that \u201c[h]ad the evaluators correctly analyzed the data,\u201d they would have found Alfa Laval\u2019s proposal \u201cirrefutably compliant.\u201d 40 Fed.Cl. at 234. We see no error in that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">Finally, appellees\u2019 suggestion that Alfa Laval was required to put on evidence demonstrating that Westfalia\u2019s lack of Type II vibration data accounted for the price differential between its offer and Westfalia\u2019s has no basis in law. A protester demonstrates prejudice by showing \u201cthat there was a substantial chance it would have received the contract award\u201d if the government had not violated the law. <em>Statistica, </em>102 F.3d at 1582. We decline to increase this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
