A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AY-\">We granted the State\u2019s application for leave to appeal from an order of the trial court which, following an evidential hearing, suppressed evidence. <em>R. </em>3:5-7. Pursuant to <em>R. 2:11 </em>\u2014 2 we elected to decide the merits of the appeal on the papers submitted by the respective parties with respect to the motion and such additional briefs as the parties desired to file. We have received no additional briefs or other communication from the parties, and the time within which the supplemental briefs could be filed has now elapsed. Accordingly, the case is ripe for our determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">The evidence of the State at the hearing, although controverted by defendant, tended to show that on January <em>22, </em>1978 State Trooper Steven Mihalow, while patrolling the New Jersey Turnpike in Edison Township, Middlesex County, observed a northbound motor vehicle weaving between the shoulder and the right lane. The vehicle was a 1978 Eord bearing New York registration license plates. He directed the driver (defendant) of the vehicle to pull over onto the right shoulder and then requested him to produce his driver\u2019s license and registration. Defendant exhibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>his driver\u2019s license and a rental agreement which was nine days overdue.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">In response to questions, defendant told the trooper that he had not been drinking and was enroute from Maryland to New York. We quote a portion of the trooper\u2019s testimony at the hearing as to the trooper\u2019s inquiry of defendant concerning whether the latter had any luggage in the car:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">A He stated he did. He had a briefcase with a OB radio and a gym bag with clothes in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">Q Then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">A At which point the subject exited the vehicle, went around and opened up the trunk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">Q Had you asked him to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">Q And when he opened up the trunk, where were you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-11\">A I followed behind him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-12\">Q And what, if anything, did you notice when he opened up the trunk ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-13\">A When he opened up the trunk he pointed out to his bag of clothes. He opened up the briefcase to point out the GB radio and he had another box in the trunk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-14\">The trooper uoticed \u201ca strong odor of marijuana coming out of tbe trunk\u201d and concluded from the appearance of a box in the trunk that the box contained marijuana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He then told defendant that he believed the box contained marijuana. Defendant replied: \u201cIt\u2019s not my pot.\u201d The trooper then arrested defendant. When opened it was disclosed that about 38 pounds of marijuana was contained in the box.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-15\">In a letter containing his conclusions, the trial judge, relying on <em>State v. </em>Johnson, 68 <em>N. J. </em>349 (1975), found the trooper\u2019s \u201cversion to be credible.\u201d However, he concluded that since the State failed to prove by clear and positive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>evidence that the \u201cconsent was knowingly, intelligently, voluntarily and unequivocally given to search the automobile trunk,\u201d the \u201csearch\u201d was made in violation of defendant\u2019s rights. Therefore he directed that the evidence taken from the trunk be suppressed. We disagree and, accordingly, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">We believe that the facts in the instant case are clearly distinguishable from those of <em>State v. </em>Johnson <em>supra. </em>In <em>Johnson </em>the police entered defendant\u2019s apartment, where contraband was found, ostensibly after consent to do so was given by defendant\u2019s fiancee, who occupied it. The court there held, primarily on the holding of <em>Schneckloth v. Bu</em>stamonte, 412 <em>U. S. </em>218, 93 <em>S. Ct. </em>2041, 36 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 854 (1973), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">* * * [T]he validity of a consent to a search, even in a noncustodial situation, must be measured in terms of waiver; <em>i.e., </em>where the State seeks to justify a search on the basis of consent it has the burden of showing that the consent was voluntary, an essential element of which is knowledge of the right to refuse consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">[68 <em>N. J. </em>at 353-354]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">There the police requested entrance into the apartment. In the case before us the trooper merely asked if defendant had any luggage in the car. This question is not tantamount to a request for the opening of the trunk. <em>Cf. State v. </em>Anglada, 144 <em>N. J. Super. </em>358 (App. Div. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">The issue of a knowing consent, or for that matter any consent, is not involved in the case at bar. If a person chooses to disclose contraband or evidence thereof as to which he ordinarily would be protected by virtue of his constitutional rights, without that course being initiated by the police, he does so at his peril. Here defendant failed to respond to the trooper\u2019s question as to whether he had luggage in the vehicle. Instead, he, for some reason known only to himself, chose to open the trunk. Once that occurred, the trooper was free to act on the basis of what his senses revealed. <em>Cf. State v. </em>Mason, 164 <em>N. J. Super. </em>1 (App. Div. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>To hold otherwise would give license to persons to rush to display evidence of crime and thereafter prevent the use thereof for the purposes of prosecution. Before there can be a question of consent, there must be an express or implied request to see or enter. Uo such request can be spelled out of the facts found by the trial judge in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-16\">The trooper had testified as to his expertise in narcotics investigations by reason of special training.- This included the appearance and odor of various narcotic drugs. From his experience as a general duty road trooper for four years, he also learned about \u201cthe packaging of marijuana.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
