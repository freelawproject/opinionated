A. </em>30:4-46.1, the chief executive or other officer in charge of the institution shall forthwith notify the Public Advocate of such admission. The Department of the Public Advocate would then be in a position to proceed, where the situation so warrants, to provide, or cause to be provided, to the person admitted to the institution (1) information regarding the availability of habeas corpus as a remedy for illegal confinement, (2) assistance in filing a habeas corpus petition, if such person so desires, and (3) such other assist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>anee as it may deem necessary in the circumstances. <em>Cf.
