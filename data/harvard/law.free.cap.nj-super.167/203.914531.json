A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AtS\">Defendant pleaded <em>non vult </em>to murder and was sentenced on July 3, 1973 to a term of not less than 14 nor more than 15 years in the New Jersey State Prison. In November 1974 he moved for a change of sentence pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:21-10. A different judge heard the motion and suspended the unserved time of the sentence and placed the defendant on probation for a period of five years. As a special condition of probation, the judge required defendant to enter an in-patient drug rehabilitation program and to remain there until he completed the program. The State appealed this order, and this court reversed the order as a mistaken exercise of discretion. <em>State v. Williams, </em>139 <em>N. J. Super. </em>290 (App. Div. 1976), aff\u2019d o.b. 75 <em>N. J. </em>1 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">During the pendency of the appeal defendant was released from prison and completed the in-patient drug rehabilitation program. BTe then continued as a probationer subject to the general rules of probation. After the decision of the Supreme Court he was returned to the New Jersey State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Upon his return to State Prison he filed a motion for a sentence credit for the time he spent on probation from November 20, 1974 until November 14, 1977, a little more than three years. After oral argument the judge who suspended the unserved portion of the original prison sentence denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">On appeal defendant asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">Point 1 Denial of defendant\u2019s motion for sentence credits violates his constitutional and statutory rights against double punishment for the same offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">Point II Denial of defendant\u2019s motion for sentence credits deprives him of equal protection of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">We are satisfied that the failure to credit defendant with the time he spent on probation from November 20, 1974 until November 14, 1977 constitutes multiple punishment for the same offense and is therefore in violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee against double jeopardy. <em>North </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number><em>Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 <em>U. S. </em>711, 89 <em>S. Ct. </em>2072, 23 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 656 (1969); <em>Oksanen v. United States, </em>362 <em>F. </em>3d 74 (8th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Without question, the double jeopardy clause of the Eifth Amendment not only protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal, or after conviction, but also against \u201cmultiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, supra, </em>395 <em>U. S. </em>at 717, 89 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 2076.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u201cAnd * * * there has never been any doubt of [this rule\u2019s] entire and complete protection of the party when a second punishment is proposed in the same court, on the same facts, for the same statutory offence.\u201d 395 <em>U. S. </em>at 717-718, 89 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 2076, 2077, quoting from <em>Ex parte Lange, </em>85 <em>U. S. </em>(18 Wall.) 163, 173, 21 <em>L. Ed. </em>872 (1873). Additionally, it is also clear that the Eifth Amendment\u2019s protection applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 <em>U. S. </em>784, 89 <em>S. Ct. </em>2056, 23 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 707 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">We believe it equally pertinent to point out that, contrary to the State\u2019s position, <em>B. </em>3:21 \u2014 8 has no application in this case. The rule deals with credit for confinement pending sentence and limits such credit to \u201ctime [defendant] has served in custody in jail or in a State hospital * * Thus, the State\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Smeen, </em>147 <em>N. J. Super. </em>229 (App. Div. 1977), certif. den. 74 <em>N. J. </em>263 (1977), is inappropriate. That case dealt with defendant\u2019s entitlement to credit on a custodial sentence for time spent between arrest and imposition of sentence in an in-patient drug abuse treatment program. We held he was not \u201cin custody\u201d within the intendment of the rule, and therefore not entitled to credit. We do not perceive our decision today to be in conflict with <em>Smeen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Nor are the facts in this case similar to <em>State v. Braeunig, </em>135 <em>N. J. Super. </em>89 (Law Div. 1975), mod. 140 <em>N. J. Super. </em>245 (App. Div. 1976), certif. den. 66 <em>N. J. </em>325 (1974). In <em>Braeunig </em>the court, in our judgment, properly denied defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>ant credit pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:21-8 for time spent under probationary supervision while on bail appealing a custodial sentence. Like <em>Smeen, </em>the court was dealing with an interpretation of what is \u201ccustody\u201d prior to execution of the actual custodial sentence, and therefore the case has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">In the case at hand we are dealing with additional punishment during service of a sentence previously imposed. In 1973 the defendant commenced serving a State Prison term of not less than 14 years nor more than 15 years in the New Jersey State Prison. When the balance of the original sentence was suspended and he was improperly placed on probation, defendant served an alternative disposition, <em>i. e., </em>probation. Unquestionably, probation is a form of punishment. In <em>Guides for Sentencing, </em>National Council on Crime and Delinquency (1957), reference is made to four dispositions : probation, imprisonment, fine and suspended sentence. In discussing probation the <em>Guides </em>state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">Probation is not granted out of a spirit of leniency. It involves placing an offender under the supervision of a probation officer for a specific period. The term \u201csupervision\u201d implies continuing control by the court through the agency of its probation officer. This control is manifestly of a different character from that present in a penal institution. During the period of supervision, the officer\u2019s guidance and direction continue to be exercised and the offender remains accountable to the court for his behavior. As the Wicker-sham Commission said, probation is not merely \u201cletting the offender off easily.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">I,at 13-14; footnote omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">In <em>Oksanen v. United States, supra </em>at 81, the court concluded :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">*\u2019 * * This probation is a punishment tantamount to imprisonment. <em>United States v. Rosenstreich, </em>204 <em>F. </em>2d 321 (2 Cir. 1953), * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">New Jersey has also recognized probation to be within the concept of punishment. Former Chief Justice Weintraub, in a strongly worded statement, underscored this point.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>\u25a0 </em>Probation assumes the offender can be rehabilitated without serving the suspended jail sentence. But this is not to say that probation is meant to be painless. Probation has an inherent sting, and restrictions upon the freedom of the probationer are realistically punitive in quality. Hence the trial court did not err in recognizing that probation involves punishment. Nor can it be maintained that probation may not be ordered to the end that others may be deterred from lawlessness. See Herlands, \u201cWhen and How Should a Sentencing Judge Use Probation?\u201d 35 <em>F. R. D. </em>487, 492-493 (1964). <em>* * </em>* <em>[In re Buehrer, </em>50 <em>N. J. </em>501, 509 (1967) ; footnote omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Therefore, -when the defendant was required to resume his original prison sentence without receiving credit for the probationary sentence, he was receiving a multiple punishment for the same offense. His original sentence was supplemented and extended. This is improper. A criminal sentence, while it may be reduced or corrected for legal and clerical errors pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:21 \u2014 10, cannot be so modified to impose a new and different sentence increasing a defendant\u2019s punishment. <em>State v. Matlack, </em>49 <em>N. J. </em>491 (1967), <em>cert. </em>den. 389 <em>U. S. </em>1009, 89 <em>S. Ct. </em>572, 19 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 606 (1967); <em>State v. Pratts, </em>145 <em>N. J. Super. </em>79 (App. Div. 1975), aff\u2019d o.b. 71 <em>N. J. </em>399 (1975); <em>State v. Laird, </em>25 <em>N. J. </em>298 (1957); <em>State in, the Interest of C. B., </em>163 <em>N. J. Super. </em>215 (Ctv. Ct. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, supra, </em>the Supreme Court concludes in broad and clear language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">We hold that the constitutional guarantee against multiple punishments for the same offense absolutely requires that punishment already exacted must be fully \u201ccredited\u201d in imposing sentence upon a new conviction for the same offense. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">[395 <em>U. </em>S. at 718-719, 89 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 2077; footnote omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">In sum, the effect of refusing defendant credit for the probationary period served after modification of his original sentence would be to impermissibly increase his sentence previously imposed, thus violating his basic Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy. That is, by failing to credit the defendant with the time of his proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>tionary sentence, the court is not only imposing a new and different sentence upon defendant, but also substantially increasing the original penalty imposed upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The mandate of the Pearce decision cannot, in any meaningful fashion, be distinguished from the instant case. We hold that defendant\u2019s guarantee against double jeopardy requires that his present custodial sentence receive credit for the time ho served the aforementioned probationary sentence. \"Under these circumstances, we need not examine defendant\u2019s argument invoking his constitutional right to \u201cequal protection of the law,\u201d <em>U. S. Const., </em>Amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. The order of February 28, 1978 is reversed and the matter remanded for the fixing of the appropriate credit and the advisement to the proper authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Eeversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
