J. S. A. </em>2A:42A-2 to 5, the Landowner\u2019s Liability Act, the provisions of which exonerate a landowner from any duty to maintain premises owned by him safe for entry or use by others for sport and recreational activities, and on the basis of undisputed facts, defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">The relevant undisputed facts are that defendant owned a 70.58-acre tract of undeveloped land in the Borough of Hopatcong, Pew Jersey. Neither he nor his associates had either encouraged or dissuaded others to trespass on this land. No warning signs were posted. Prior owners of this land had given drainage easements to surrounding property owners, with the result that several drainage pipes discharged water onto defendant\u2019s land, creating a swamp.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">The infant plaintiff lived in close proximity to defendant\u2019s land. A small swampy area on defendant\u2019s land provided the neighboring children, including the infant plaintiff, with a favored recreational area.- On December 22, 1976, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>the water in the swamp had frozen, the infant plaintiff and several other children were playing in the area, engaging in various forms of recreational activity such as running, jumping, ice skating and sleigh riding, during which plaintiff fell and injured herself. According to plaintiff, she was ice skating and engaging in horseplay when she fell on her back, landing on a tree stump.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Plaintiffs quarrel with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that in the given factual context the provision of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:42A-2 and 3 immunize the defendant landowner from liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically they argue that these immunizing provisions do not apply because defendant\u2019s land is zoned for residential use, is in close proximity or adjacent to residential developments, and the swampy condition of defendant\u2019s land was not a natural condition hut resulted from the pooling of waters directed to defendant\u2019s land .by drains.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>None of these undisputed facts concerning the location of defendant\u2019s land and the cause of its swampy condition renders <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :42-2 and 3 inapplicable. Defendant\u2019s 70-acre undeveloped tract qualifies for immunity under the act when used for the statutorily defined recreational purposes, despite its zoning classification as residential lands and its proximity to developed residential areas. Nothing in the statute suggests otherwise. Although the act was clearly not intended to apply to injuries sustained in a private swimming pool located on developed residential property, defendant\u2019s tract cannot legitimately be compared therewith. <em>Boileau v. DeCecco, </em>125 <em>N. J. Super. </em>263, 267 (App. Div. 1973), aff\u2019d o. b. 65 <em>N. J. </em>234 (1974). The reference in <em>Odar v. Chase Manhattan Bank, </em>138 <em>N. J. Super. </em>464, 468 (App. Div. 1976), certif. den. 70 <em>N. J. </em>525 (1976), to \u201cnonresidential land\u201d as a condition to immunity afforded by the act must be read as land not developed and used for residential purposes. In this case, it is uncontradicted that defendant\u2019s land was not so developed and used.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The fact that the ice on which plaintiff fell resulted from the freezing of waters diverted, by permission of prior owners, \u00b10 defendant\u2019s land by man-made drains does not remove defendant from the protection of the act. Again, nothing in the statute so suggests. <em>Harrison v. Middlesex Water Co., </em>158 <em>N. J. Super. </em>368 (App. Div. 1978), certif. granted 78 <em>N. J. </em>402 (1978), supports defendant\u2019s immunity. There, \u2022the injuries occurred on defendant water company\u2019s man-made reservoir; the water company was nonetheless held to be within the protection of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The act was designed to encourage the recreational use of privately held undeveloped lands; the inducement to the owners to permit such use is the legislative promise of immunity with respect to injuries arising therefrom. <em>Harrison v. Middlesex Water Co., supra </em>at 381. Clearly, plaintiff\u2019s recreational activities on defendant\u2019s undeveloped land represented the fulfillment of the legislative objective and, eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>sistent with the act\u2019s promise of immunity with respect to such use, defendant\u2019s immunity from liability should be recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-6\"> N. <em>J.
