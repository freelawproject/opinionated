He immediately filed for unemployment compensation and started receiving benefits of $104 a week as of November 13, 1977. On November 29, 1977 Yirden was in an automobile accident. The attending physician\u2019s report submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>to defendant Travelers Insurance Company on Virden\u2019s behalf indicated that he suffered auditory neuritis and shoulder strain as a result of injuries sustained in the accident. Notwithstanding his medical problems and treatments, Virden continued to collect unemployment benefits through the first part of May 1978 when he returned to the job market.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">On April 10, 1978 Virden filed a complaint seeking income continuation benefits from Travelers under a policy in effect at the time of the accident. In addition to the statutory minimum required by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:6A-4(b), Virden had purchased the additional coverage provided for in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:6A-10. Plaintiff\u2019s action also included a claim of negligence against the other driver involved in the accident, but that portion of the complaint was severed from the income continuation claim when the latter was accelerated by the trial court. In a written opinion dated September 21, 1978 the trial judge found that plaintiff had suffered no loss of income within the meaning of the statute and aecordingly he denied plaintiff\u2019s application for income continuation benefits, counsel fees and costs. We granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for leave to appeal from the order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Both parties agree that plaintiff qualified as an income producer within the statutory definition of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:6A-2(d) by virtue of his receiving unemployment compensation benefits at the time of the accident. <em>Clay v. N. J. Special Joint Underwriting Ass\u2019n, </em>160 <em>N. J. Super. </em>188 (App. Div. 1978). The dispute between the parties, however, centers around plaintiff\u2019s claim of income loss resulting from bodily injury disability, the other two mandatory elements for recovery of income continuation benefits. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:6A-4(b); <em>Greenberg v. Great American Ins. </em>Co., 146 <em>N. J. Super. </em>69 (Law Div. 1976), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 158 <em>N. J. Super. </em>223 (App. Div. 1978).<footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>As set forth above, plaintiff was \u201cearning\u201d $104 a week in unemployment benefits at the time the accident occurred and continued to receive that amount through the first half of May 1978 when he obtained a job. The fact that prior to his termination at Union Carbide which occurred before the accident, plaintiff had been earning $275.94 base pay a week, or $290.51 average including overtime, is of no significance. The injuries sustained in the accident did not result in a reduction of the income plaintiff was receiving at the time of said accident. <em>Cf. Greenberg v. Great American Ins. Co., supra, </em>158 <em>N. J. Super, </em>at 229. And see <em>Muschette v. Gateway Ins. Co., </em>149 <em>N. J. Super. </em>89, 94 (App. Div. 1977), aff\u2019d 76 <em>N.

J. </em>521 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The judgment of dismissal as to defendant Travelers Insurance Company is affirmed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings on plaintiff\u2019s action as to defendant Rose Marie McG-eary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\"> Appeal pending in New Jersey Supreme Court by virtue of a dissent in tiie Appellate Division.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
