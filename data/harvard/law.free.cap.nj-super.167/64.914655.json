Beatty, </em>128 <em>N. J. Super. </em>488, 491 (App. Div. 1974), we held that the State\u2019s public policy expressed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>R. </em>3:21-8 should be liberally construed. We held further that defendant was entitled to credit against his sentence in New Jersey for the time he was confined in a New York penal institution because of a detainer filed by the State of New Jersey. We adhere to that liberal construction in this case because a refusal to do so would chill his constitutional right to contest extradition. See <em>Keyishian v. Bd. of Regents of New </em>York, 385 <em>U. S. </em>589, 603-604, 87 <em>S. Ct. </em>675, 17 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 629 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">To the extent that <em>State v. Sinacore, </em>151 <em>N. J. Super. </em>106 (Law Div. 1977), is contrary to the rule expressed in <em>Beatty </em>and herein, it is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The sentence imposed below is modified to provide for the 61 days credit. In all other respects, the sentence is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
