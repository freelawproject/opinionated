It eventually came on for trial 19 months later. The parties had by then reached agreement on some aspects of a division of their marital property, but not on custody and support of their two small children, spousal support, and certain other issues. Pursuant to a stipulation between them, the trial court received extrinsic evidence on the unresolved issues, took them under submission, and entered an interlocutory judgment forthwith. The stipulated judgment ordered dissolution of the marriage, the agreed property division, and that \u201cthe Court hereby expressly reserves jurisdiction with respect to the issues of the determination of child custody, child visitation, spousal support, child support,\u201d and other matters upon which evidence had been received.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">The court subsequently filed a notice of intended decision announcing its disposition of the issues reserved. Appellant requested formal findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court signed and filed findings and conclusions, and entered a \u201cJudgment After Interlocutory Decree Re Issues Reserved To The Court,\u201d to both of which the parties had stipulated as to form.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">The second stipulated judgment, which is in effect an amended interlocutory judgment of dissolution, was entered on December 21, 1977. The wife\u2019s appeal is from its paragraphs 1, 12 and 17.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>paragraphs is quoted, and facts and other matters pertinent to it are recited, as we reach it in sequence below.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">\n<em>Paragraph 1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The parties\u2019 two children were bom on March 28, 1970, and April 6, 1975. They remained in appellant\u2019s custody during the 19 months between the commencement of the proceeding and the trial. This was with respondent\u2019s consent, but the parties were incessantly before the court, throughout the period, in continuing pretrial disputes over such issues as respondent\u2019s child visitation rights and the conduct of both parties in the presence of the children and as to each other. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Appellant requested in her petition for dissolution, and in a pretrial statement, that \u201ccustody\u201d of the children be awarded to her. In a pretrial statement filed by respondent, he requested that \u201ccustody\u201d of the children be awarded to him and flatly alleged that appellant was \u201cnot a fit and proper person to have thefir] custody\u201d for stated reasons. At a midpoint in the trial, his attorney told the court that he (respondent) desired \u201cjoint legal custody\u201d of the children. Appellant\u2019s counsel did not express approval of this request, and the issue of child custody was still in bitter dispute when it was taken under submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">In the notice of intended decision, the trial court announced its resolution of the custody issue by stating that \u201clegal custody\u201d of the children would be awarded to the parties \u201cjointly\u201d but that \u201cphysical custody\u201d would be awarded to appellant. Although the overlapping features of \u201cjoint\u201d and \u201cphysical\u201d custody had not been agreed upon by the parties, they were reiterated in the stipulated findings and conclusions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (See fn. 1, <em>ante.) </em>Similar language was used in the first two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>paragraphs of the amended interlocutory judgment. Paragraph 1 (from which the appeal is taken) and paragraph 2 (which must be read with it) successively provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\">\u201c1. <em>Legal custody </em>of the two minor children of the parties . . . shall be awarded <em>jointly </em>to petitioner [appellant] <em>and </em>respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">\u201c2. <em>Physical custody </em>of the minor children shall be awarded to petitioner.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Paragraph 2 is followed by elaborate provisions which spell out respondent\u2019s visitation rights in minute detail and control his conduct when the children are in his transient care. These provisions reflect the trial court\u2019s resolution of charges and countercharges exchanged by the parties in their acrimonious pretrial disputes on the issues of custody and visitation (see fn. 2, ante) and at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Challenging paragraph 1, appellant first contends that the trial court was without <em>jurisdiction </em>to award \u201clegal custody\u201d of the children to the parties, \u201cjointly,\u201d for the stated reason that section 4600 of the Civil Code authorizes an award of child custody to \u201ceither\u201d parent but not to both.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The reference to \u201ceither\u201d parent, in subdivision (a) of the statute, appears as the first element in the \u201corder of preference\u201d to be followed by the awarding court. (See fn. 4, <em>ante.) </em>Its statement as a factor of \u201cpreference\u201d does not diminish the court\u2019s <em>jurisdiction </em>to exercise the essential discretionary authority with which section 4600 invests it. That authority is conferred by the unqualified language which precedes the \u201corder of preference\u201d in the statute, and which empowers the court to \u201cmake such order\u201d for child custody \u201cas may seem necessary and proper.\u201d (See <em>ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">The substance of this broad language appeared in former section 138 of the Civil Code (the predecessor of \u00a7 4600) until the interparental Family Law Act was adopted effective January 1, 1970. (See Historical Note, 12A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>West\u2019s Ann. Civ. Code (1970 ed.) \u00a7 4600, pp. 319-320; 6 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Parent and Child, \u00a7\u00a7 69 [pp. 4590-4591]), 73 [pp. 4594-4595].) Throughout that period and since, the California decisions and other authorities have generally recognized that a trial court has <em>jurisdiction </em>to make an order awarding \u201cjoint\u201d custody of two separated parents and \u201cphysical\u201d custody to only one of them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>Gudelj </em>v. <em>Gudelj </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 202, 209 [259 P.2d 656]; <em>Burge </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 608, 611, 618 [262 P.2d 6]; <em>Holsinger </em>v. <em>Holsinger </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 132, 133 [279 P.2d 961]; <em>Winn </em>v. <em>Winn </em>(1956) 143 Cal.App.2d 184, 185, 187 [299 P.2d 721]; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1960) 186 Cal.App.2d 788, 790 [9 Cal.Rptr. 300]; <em>In re Marriage of Russo </em>(1971) 21 Cal.App.3d 72, 76, 84 [98 Cal.Rptr. 501]; <em>Adoption of Van Anda </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 189, 191, 194-195 [132 Cal.Rptr. 878]; 1 Cal. Family Lawyer, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 15.24, p. 564; 4 Goddard, Cal. Family Law Practice (2d ed. 1972) \u00a7 140, p. 233; 6 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>Parent and Child, \u00a7 79, pp. 4600-4601; Bodenheimer, <em>Progress Under The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act and Remaining Problems: Punitive Decrees, Joint Custody, and Excessive Modifications </em>(1977) 65 Cal.L.Rev. 978, 1009-1012.) There is no <em>jurisdictional </em>defect in the award made here.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Appellant further contends, however, that the trial court abused its discretion in overlapping its award of \u201cphysical custody\u201d of the children, to her, with the award of custody to the parties \u201cjointly.\u201d This contention requires an interpretation of the overlap, for which several of the decisions cited above provide no precedent. <em>Holsinger, Harris, </em>and <em>Russo </em>are distinguishable because a similarly overlapping award in each case was made pursuant to an agreement between the parties, which is conspicuously lacking here; because neither party appealed from the award when it was made; and because the appeal ultimately taken and decided, in each case, was from a subsequent order which modified only the \u201cphysical custody\u201d feature of the award. <em>(Holsinger </em>v. <em>Holsinger, supra, </em>44 Cal.2d 132 at pp. 133-136; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>186 Cal.App.2d 788 at pp. 790-792; <em>In re Marriage of Russo, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.3d 72 at pp. 75-76, 92-95.)</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>The appeal in <em>Gudelj </em>was taken from an overlapping award, but the question decided by the Supreme Court pertained to the terms of the \u201cphysical custody\u201d feature alone. <em>(Gudelj </em>v. <em>Gudelj, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d 202 at pp. 207, 209.) In <em>Winn, </em>the mother appealed from an interlocutory judgment which awarded custody of the parties\u2019 children \u201cjointly\u201d but made no clear provision for their \u201cphysical custody.\u201d <em>(Winn </em>v. <em>Winn, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.2d at pp. 186-187.) The Court of Appeal affirmed the award, but only after amending it to provide that the mother had \u201cphysical custody\u201d in keeping with the perceived intent of the trial court. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 187, 190.)</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">For the various reasons indicated, these decisions involved specific details of overlapping awards but not their interpretation. The <em>Burge </em>and <em>Van Anda </em>courts were required to interpret such awards in collateral litigation where they became involved by reason of intervening circumstances. The controversy in <em>Burge </em>was preceded by a judgment of divorce which awarded \u201cjoint custody and control\u201d of a child to both parents and his \u201cpersonal custody\u201d to the mother. <em>(Burge </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d 608 at p. 611.) The question before the <em>Burge </em>court was whether the mother had subsequently effected a valid compromise of a claim for damages held by the child, without the participation of the father who shared \u201cjoint custody and control\u201d with her, pursuant to a statute (Prob. Code, \u00a7 1431) which then authorized the execution of such compromise by a minor\u2019s \u201c \u2018father, or if. . . the parents of said minor are living separate and apart and his mother then has <em>care or custody </em>of said minor then his mother.\u2019 \u201d (41 Cal.2d at p. 615 [italics added].) The court validated the compromise on the basis of its analysis of the term \u201ccare or custody\u201d as used in the statute. Because the analysis addressed the situation presented here, it warrants quotation at some length. The court stated in pertinent part as follows (commencing at p. 617):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\"><em>\u201cCustody </em>embraces the sum of parental rights with respect to the rearing of a child, including its care. It includes the right to the child\u2019s services and earnings (Civ. Code, \u00a7 197) and the right to direct his activities and make decisions regarding his care and control, education, health, and religion. [Citations.]. . . When the parents are living separate or apart, . . . there are apt to be not only frequent differences of opinion with respect to any of the matters involved in custody, but frequent resort to courts for their settlement. In such cases a court may conclude that the best inter\u00e9sts of the child and due regard for the interests of the parents require that one or the other be given complete custody of the child. It may conclude that such action would be unjust, and unable like Solomon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>to carve the child, it may carve out of the sum of custodial rights, certain rights to be exercised by each parent. <em>Thus it is common practice in divorce cases for the court to award \u2018legal custody\u2019 to one or both parents and \u2018physical custody\u2019 to one </em>parent.... Decisions made in the exercise of the rights awarded are not necessarily final, for the court\u2019s orders are subject to modification. [Citations.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-4\">\u201cWe believe the Legislature had this practice in mind when it used the words \u2018care or custody\u2019 [in Probate Code section 1431], <em>By \u2018custody,\u2019 it meant complete custody or all the rights involved in custody. By \u2018care\u2019 it meant what has commonly been called \u2018physical custody\u2019 or the custodial rights involved in the physical care and control of the child. . . . </em>Thus, if the parents are living separate or apart, and the mother has the care or <em>physical custody </em>of the child, she may compromise his claims <em>even though she may or may not also have his complete custody.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">\u201cIn the present case, the parents were living apart and the child lived with his mother. Under the divorce decree the parents had \u2018joint custody and control\u2019 but the mother had \u2018personal custody.\u2019 There can be no doubt that the award of personal custody gave her the physical custody and care of the child. Having the care of the child, she had authority under section 1431 of the Probate Code to compromise the claim in question.\u201d <em>(Burge </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d 608 at pp. 617-619 [italics added].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">In <em>Van Anda, </em>a prior judgment of divorce had awarded \u201cjoint custody\u201d of the parties\u2019 children to both of them and \u201cactual physical custody\u201d to the mother. <em>(Adoption of Van Anda, supra, 62 </em>Cal.App.3d 189 at p. 191.) The mother\u2019s second husband undertook to adopt the children pursuant to Civil Code section 224, which then permitted adoption of a child by a stepparent, with the sole consent of the mother \u201c \u2018to whom custody has been given,\u2019 \u201d if the father \u201c \u2018for a period of one year shall willfully fail to pay for the care, support and education of such child when able to do so ....\u2019\u201d (62 Cal.App.3d at p. 192.) After determining that the father had irrevocably brought himself within the one-year provision of the statute <em>(id., </em>at pp. 192-194), the Court of Appeal followed the above-quoted language of the <em>Burge </em>court and held in effect that the consent of the mother alone would validate the proposed stepparent adoption because the prior award of \u201cactual physical custody\u201d of the children to her had invested her with their sole \u201ccustody\u201d for purposes of Civil Code section 224. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 194-196.)</p>\n<p id=\"b755-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>The holdings in <em>Burge </em>and <em>Van Anda </em>tend to indicate that the award of \u201cphysical custody\u201d of the children to appellant invests her with their sole \u201ccustody\u201d for such purposes as were presented in those cases, but no such issue is presented here. The persisting question is whether the trial court abused its discretion, as she contends, by adding the overlapping feature purporting to award \u201cjoint custody\u201d to both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The writers have widely criticized awards of \u201cjoint custody,\u201d as such, on the grounds that they serve no real purpose except to placate the parent deprived of de facto \u201ccustody\u201d (see 1 Cal. Family Lawyer, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 15.24, p. 564); that they are inevitably detrimental to the interests of the affected children (Bodenheimer, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>65 Cal.L.Rev. 978 at p. 1010); and that they invite such post-award controversies as materialized in <em>Burge </em>and <em>Van Anda. </em>(See 4 Goddard, Cal. Family Law Practice, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 140, p. 233.) A leading writer expresses the view that \u201cjoint custody\u201d awards are anachronistic because the Legislature has now eliminated the former order of interparental preference from the custodial provisions of the Family Law Act. (6 Witkin, Summaiy of Cal. Law, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>Parent and Child, \u00a7 79, pp. 4600-4601.) In all events, there is prevailing opinion among the legal writers to the effect that an award of \u201cjoint custody\u201d is unworkable unless the parents agree to it. (See 1 Cal. Family Lawyer, <em>loc. cit.; </em>Bodenheimer, <em>loc. cit., </em>pp. 1010-1011.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">There is no semblance of any such agreement in this record, which supports only the inference that none may be reached. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em>To the contrary, it suggests the likelihood of recurrent disputes over such aspects of the ostensibly shared \u201ccustody\u201d as the right to the \u201cservices and earnings\u201d of each child (Civ. Code, \u00a7 197) and \u201cthe right to direct his activities and make decisions regarding his care and control, education, health, and religion.\u201d <em>(Burge </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d 608 at p. 617.) The so-called \u201cjoint custody\u201d may produce parental disagreement, or other problems, if various statutes involving \u201ccustody,\u201d as such, come into play as the children grow older.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As in the past (see fn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>2), such disputes between these parents are likely to bring about \u201cfrequent resort to courts for their settlement.\u201d <em>(Burge </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco, supra, </em>at p. 618.) These prospects do not portend that the \u201cjoint custody\u201d feature of the award will serve the best interests of the children, which is the paramount consideration controlling any custody award. (\u00a7 4600, subd. (a); <em>Gudelj v. Gudelj, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d 202 at p. 208; <em>Ferreira </em>v. <em>Ferreira </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 824, 833-834 [109 Cal.Rptr. 80, 512 P.2d 304].) There is also no finding of fact that it will serve their interests now (see fn. 3, <em>ante), </em>and we perceive no evidence permitting such finding to be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">We accordingly conclude that the overlapping \u201cjoint custody\u201d feature of the award constitutes an abuse of discretion as appellant contends. We are not required to reverse the award with directions to redetermine the matter of \u201cjoint custody\u201d because the award of \u201cphysical custody\u201d to appellant gives her \u201ccustody\u201d which is real, and which is supported by the findings (see fn. 3, <em>ante) </em>and the evidence. Its qualification as \u201cphysical,\u201d and the overlapping feature of \u201cjoint custody\u201d in both parties, are ephemeral and essentially meaningless. We dispose of them by striking them in the modification ordered below. This disposition is without prejudice to respondent\u2019s right to pursue the objective of \u201cjoint custody,\u201d by way of further modification at the hands of the trial court, if he is so inclined. Our modification means only that he will bear the burden of proof in any such future proceeding. From our examination of the full record, we conclude that the burden properly rests upon him at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">\n<em>Paragraph 12</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The facts pertinent to the appeal in this regard are as follows: The parties were married in 1968. Respondent attended law school, and appellant worked as a medical secretary, during the early years of the marriage. Respondent has been a certified public accountant since 1969 and a member of the State Bar of California since 1972. Appellant has had three years of college. She had not been employed for five years before the trial, but was at that time seeking admission to a training program which could permit her to obtain certification as a registered nurse after two years. She had previously been denied admission to this program on two occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>Appellant had stopped working because of her responsibilities with the small children and problems with her health. She described the health problems as a \u201cspastic colon\u201d and malnutrition resulting from her consequent inability to eat properly due to colonic pain. She also had a \u201cbleeding problem\u201d which is manifested by frequent hemorrhaging. She was under medical treatment for these ailments at the time of trial. She was 34 years old, and respondent was 35, at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Consistent with the notice of intended decision and the findings and conclusions (see fn. 1, <em>ante), </em>paragraph 12 of the judgment provides in pertinent part: \u201cRespondent shall pay to petitioner [appellant], . . . commencing September, 1977, the sum of Six Hundred Dollars ($600) per month as and for spousal support. Said support shall terminate on the death of either party, remarriage of petitioner, or December 31, 1980, whichever occurs first.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering termination of the spousal support obligation, \u201cwithout reserving jurisdiction\u201d of the subject pursuant to section 4801, subdivision (d),. upon the stated ground that \u201cthere is no evidence in the record to show that . . . [she] . . . will be self-supporting at the termination date\u201d of December 31, 1980.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the decision principally cited for this argument, the Supreme Court sustained a similar contention, upon comparable facts, where the trial court had failed to reserve jurisdiction of spousal support in providing for its termination, after 11 years, in a judgment dissolving a marriage of 28 years\u2019 duration. <em>(In re Marriage of Morrison </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 437, 440, 441-454 [143 Cal.Rptr. 139, 573 P.2d 41].) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>court has recently reached the same result, quoting and following <em>Morrison, </em>where a judgment dissolving an 18-year marriage provided for spousal support but ordered its termination in a few years without reserving jurisdiction of the subject. <em>(In re Marriage of Epstein </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 76, 90-91 [154 Cal.Rptr. 413, 592 P.2d 1165].)</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">\u201cA trial court should not terminate jurisdiction to extend a future support order after a lengthy marriage, unless the record clearly indicates that the supported spouse will be able to adequately meet his or her financial needs at the time selected for termination of jurisdiction. In making its decision concerning the retention of jurisdiction, the court must rely only on the evidence in the record and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. It must not engage in speculation. If the record does not contain evidence of the supported spouse\u2019s ability to meet his or her future needs, the court should not \u2018burn its bridges\u2019 and fail to retain jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Morrison, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at p. 453; <em>In re Marriage of Epstein, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at pp. 90-91.)</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The present marriage had subsisted for only seven years when the parties separated, and for approximately nine years when the proceeding was tried, but neither time span made its duration other than \u201clengthy\u201d as a matter of law. The \u201cduration of the marriage,\u201d moreover, was only one of the several circumstances which the trial court was required to consider in \u201cmaking the award\u201d of spousal support. (See \u00a7 4801, subd. (a), quoted in fn. 8, <em>ante] </em>see, particularly, subds. (a)(1), (4), (5) and (6), <em>ibid.) </em>Nothing in the record reasonably supports the inference that appellant will be self-supporting when her spousal support terminates on December 31, 1980 (which will occur only 42 months after the trial and 36 months after the judgment was entered). The following language from <em>Morrison </em>may be squarely applied with the indicated paraphrasing: \u201cIn the present case, no showing was made that the wife would be self-supporting at the end of [three] years. All the evidence in the record is to the contrary. The wife has no significant job skills or work history .... Further, the record indicates the wife\u2019s ability to obtain full-time employment may be hampered by medical problems. . . . [K] The trial court abused its discretion by divesting itself of jurisdiction to award future spousal support after [three] years without any evidence in the record that the wife would be able to provide for herself at that time. Accordingly, the portion of the judgment which fails to retain jurisdiction after [three] years must be reversed.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Morrison, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at p. 454.)</p>\n<p id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>Reversal is not required here because we hold only that the trial court erred in not reserving jurisdiction to award spousal support after December 31, 1980; the portion of the paragraph 12 award terminating spousal support on that date remains valid; and our disposition need require only that the trial court \u201cretain jurisdiction to modify that award if economic circumstances warrant.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Epstein, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 91, fn. 15.) We effect the necessary disposition in the modification ordered below.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">\n<em>Paragraph 17</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Paragraph 9 of the judgment provides that respondent shall pay appellant $150 per month \u201cfor the support of each minor child, until each of said minor children reaches the age of majority, dies, marries, or becomes emancipated or further order of the court.\u201d Paragraphs 10 and 11 provide that he shall maintain a $15,000 life insurance policy, on his own life, \u201cfor the benefit of\u201d each child \u201cso long as he has an obligation to support said child.\u201d In this context, paragraph 17 states: \u201cRespondent shall claim the two minor children as dependents for income tax purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Appellant contends that the trial court was without jurisdiction to make the paragraph 17 order because neither party requested it. \u201cA party is entitled to \u2018any and all relief which may be appropriate under the scope of his pleadings and within the facts alleged and proved, irrespective of the theory upon which they might be alleged.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Estrin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1939) 14 Cal.2d 670, 678 [96 P.2d 340]; <em>Potrero Homes </em>v. <em>Western Orbis Co. </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 450, 456 [104 Cal.Rptr. 633].) The present parties raised the issue of child support in the pleadings and in the extensive pretrial proceedings. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em> \u201cCircumstances to be considered by the trial judge in awarding . . . child support are the needs of the parties and the ability to meet those needs, including property owned, obligations to be met, ability to earn and actual earnings.\u201d <em>(Van Diest </em>v. <em>Van Diest </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 541, 545 [72 Cal.Rptr. 304].)  Respondent\u2019s income tax liability was an \u201cobligation to be met\u201d which was subject to consideration by the court. In all events, the issue of child support was contested throughout the proceedings. There is accordingly no merit to the contention that the trial court exceeded its <em>jurisdiction </em>in making the paragraph 17 order on that issue. (1 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>Jurisdiction, \u00a7 185, pp. 714-715.)</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>The trial court has thus validly granted respondent the right to \u201cclaim the two minor children as dependents for income tax purposes,\u201d but whether he may qualify to do this depends upon pertinent provisions of the federal and state income tax laws. (See, e.g., Int. Rev. Code, \u00a7 152, subd. (e); Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 17059.5, subds. (a), (b); Representing Clients in Spousal and Child Support Proceedings: A Major Update (Cont.Ed.Bar 1978) \u00a7\u00a7 3.35-3.37, pp. 129-133.) That prospect is not before us, and we reach no questions pertaining to the implementation or enforcement of paragraph 17. The just-cited income tax statutes themselves bear mentioning only because appellant has undertaken to challenge them on constitutional grounds. It is by no means clear that she may do this on the present appeal, the challenge is unclear in itself, and its premises are not supported by the record. We need not discuss it further; for any and all of the reasons mentioned, we deem it without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The judgment entered on December 21, 1977, is modified (1) by striking paragraphs 1 and 2 therefrom and inserting in their place a single paragraph reading: \u201c1. Custody of the two minor children of the parties, Gregory M. Neal, bom March 28, 1970, and Taylor S. Neal, born April 6, 1975, is hereby awarded to petitioner.\u201d The judgment is further modified (2) by renumbering its successive paragraphs in sequence following new paragraph 1 and (3) by amending the second sentence to new paragraph 11 (formerly par. 12) to read: \u201cSaid support shall terminate on the death of either party, remarriage of petitioner, or December 31, 1980, whichever first occurs; provided, however, that the court expressly reserves jurisdiction to make any and all appropriate orders relative to spousal support before, on or after December 31, 1980.\u201d As so modified, the judgment is affirmed in all respects reached by the appeal. Appellant shall recover her costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Caldecott, P. J., and Drummond, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-10\">We immediately perceived a problem because she thus appealed from portions of a judgment to which she had <em>stipulated. </em>(See 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7\u00a7 133-134 [p. 4129], 266-267 [pp. 4257-4258], 270-272 [pp. 4260-4261].) When queried about her standing to do this, her attorney informed us that the intent of the stipulation had been (1) to produce findings and a judgment conforming with the trial court\u2019s notice of intended decision, but (2) to reserve to either party the right to challenge the findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>and conclusions, or the judgment, in any respect. Respondent\u2019s counsel does not dispute this statement. We accept it accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b750-9\">These issues, and temporary spousal support, were the subjects of a continuing order to show cause obtained by appellant, at least four orders pendente lite, and proceedings in which respondent was held in contempt of court and given a suspended jail sentence. The full pretrial record need not be otherwise summarized, but it unmistakably demonstrates acute and ongoing bitterness between the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b750-10\">The findings included an additional statement that \u201c[t]he minor children of the parties have been in the <em>custody </em>of petitioner [appellant] since the date of separation, and it is necessary and proper that said minor children remain in the <em>custody </em>of petitioner.\u201d (Italics added.) The afterpart of this language amounts to a finding that the best interests of the children would be served if they were to remain in appellant\u2019s \u201ccustody.\u201d There was no equivalent finding relative to their custody being awarded to the parties \u201cjointly.\u201d This concept turned up in the conclusions of law, where the trial court stated: \u201cI. <em>Legal custody </em>of the two minor children .. . should be awarded <em>jointly </em>to petitioner and respondent. [H] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>II. <em>Physical custody </em>of said minor children should be awarded to petitioner.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b751-11\">Except where otherwise indicated, statutory references herein are to sections of the Civil Code which appear in the Family Law Act (div. fourth, pt. 5, commencing with \u00a7 4000). Section 4600 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">\u201c4600. In any proceeding where there is at issue the custody of a minor child, the court <em>may, </em>during the pendency of the proceeding or, at any time thereafter, <em>make such order </em>for the custody of such child during his minority <em>as may seem necessary or proper. Custody should be awarded in the following order of preference:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">\u201c(a) To <em>either </em>parent according to the best interests of the child.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b752-5\">This type of order is to be distinguished from one in which unqualified \u201ccustody\u201d is awarded to each parent, but on a periodic back-and-forth basis which is usually calendared. (See, e.g., <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Clarke </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 259, 260 [217 P.2d 401]; <em>Priest </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1949) 90 Cal.App.2d 185, 186 [202 P.2d 561].) Custody thus awarded is not \u201cjoint,\u201d but has been called \u201cdivided.\u201d (1 Cal. Family Lawyer (Cont.Ed.Bar 1961) \u00a7 15.25, p. 564.) The distinction is significant and clear, although some writers have interchanged the terms \u201cjoint\u201d and \u201cdivided\u201d in referring to such arrangement. (See, e.g., Note, <em>The California Custody Decree </em>(1960) 13 Stan.L.Rev. 108, 112.) The custody awarded in the present case is \u201cjoint,\u201d in part, but not \u201cdivided.\u201d (See paragraphs 1 and 2 of the judgment, quoted in the text <em>ante.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Nonlegal writers tend to be more supportive of the \u201cjoint custody\u201d concept in general, but they share the view that agreement between the parents is crucial. (See, e.g., Victor &amp; Winkler, Fathers and Custody (1977) 136-137, 144; Levine, Who Will Raise The Children? New Options for Fathers (and Mothers) (1976) 62-63.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\">See, e.g., Civil Code, section 1714.1 (liability for \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d of a minor imputed \u201cto the parents having custody or control of the minor for all purposes of civil damages\u201d); Civil Code, section 1714.3 (liability for injury caused by the discharge of a firearm similarly \u201cimputed to a parent . . . having custody or control of the minor\u201d); Education Code, section 49061 (certain rights involving public school records granted to \u201conly the parent having legal custody of the pupil\u201d if the parents are \u201cdivorced or legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>separated\u201d); Vehicle Code, section 17701 (requiring that a minor\u2019s application for a driver\u2019s license be signed and verified by both parents who \u201chave custody of the minor\u201d or by the \u201cone parent\u201d who \u201chas custody\u201d).
