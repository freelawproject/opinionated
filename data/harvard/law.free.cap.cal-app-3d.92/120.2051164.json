J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIJ\">Doris Althea West appeals the judgment after a court trial established her British divorce decree as a California judgment and then terminated spousal support and reduced child support to $250 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Doris and John Burnard West were divorced September 6, 1967, after a marriage lasting about four years; they had been separated about two years. There was one child who remained with the mother. Support orders were made and modified several times without complaint. John moved to California and discharged his English solicitors in order to represent himself in propria persona. Doris sought modification of the support decree; John received notice Doris was asking for more money; but he claims he never got notice of the date of the hearing. At the hearing spousal support was raised from 2,000 to 4,000 pounds per year and child support from 500 to 2,000 pounds per year. John has continued to pay support at the lower levels claiming the English courts had no jurisdiction to change the support allowances; Doris argues the increases were properly granted and John is greatly in arrears.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">Service of process in British divorce cases is governed by Matrimonial Causes Rules 1973. Rule 117, Service out of England and Wales, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-11\">\u201c(1) Any document in matrimonial proceedings may be served out of England and Wales without leave either in the manner prescribed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>these Rules or\u2014(a) where the proceedings are pending in the High Court, in accordance with R.S.C. Order 11, rules 5 and 6 (which relate to the service of a writ abroad);\u201d This rule permits alternative means of service, either under other Matrimonial Causes Rules 1973 such as rules 118 and 14 <em>infra </em>or if the proceedings are pending in the high court, as they are here, under Supreme Court Practice 1976, Rules of the Supreme Court, Order 11, rule 5. In the present proceeding for ancillary relief it does not matter which procedure is followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Under the Matrimonial Causes Rules 118: \u201cWhere a document is required by these rules to be sent to any person, it shall, unless otherwise directed, be sent by post\u2014(a) ...(b) if he is acting in person, to the address for service given by him. . . .\u201d There is no requirement that notice be sent by certified mail or with a return receipt requested. However, notice must be filed and served in the prescribed way. For service by mail the Registrar must endorse the copy of the notice with the date of the proceedings, the date of posting and the address used. (13 Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England (4th ed. 1975) Divorce, \u00a7\u00a7 522, 1169, 1068, 743, 742; Matrimonial Causes Rules 1973, SI 2016, r. 68(3), 70, 121 (1)(2), 118(b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In addition, rule 14 of the Matrimonial Causes Rules 1973 requires that the respondent acknowledge receipt of service or the court assure itself in some other manner that service, in fact, was made. The rule in pertinent part states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">\u201c14. (1) Subject to the provisions of this rule and ... 117, a copy of every petition shall be served personally or by post on every respondent...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">\u201c(5) For the purposes of the foregoing paragraphs, a copy of a petition shall be deemed to be duly served if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">\u201c(a) an acknowledgment of service in Form 6 is signed by the party to be served or by a solicitor on his behalf and is returned to the court office, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">\u201c(b) where the form purports to be signed by the respondent, his signature is proved at the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">\u201c(6) Where a copy of a petition has been sent to a party and no acknowledgment of service has been returned to the court office,- the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>registrar, if satisfied by affidavit or otherwise that the party has nevertheless <em>received </em>the document, may direct that the document shall be deemed to have been duly served on him.\u201d (Italics added.) The form giving notice of the hearing states \u201cthe Registrar will require to be satisfied that the respondent . . . has been served.\u201d These requirements are designed to assure the court that in the ordinary course of events, the notice would have been actually received. The procedure comports with or exceeds our due process requirements. (See <em>Julen </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>25 Cal.App.3d 325, 328 [101 Cal.Rptr. 796].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">The alternative mode of service can be effected under Rules of the Supreme Court, Order 11, rule 5 which in part provides: \u201c5 (2) Nothing in this rule or in any order or direction of the court made by virtue of it shall authorize or require the doing of anything in a countiy in which service is to be effected which is contrary to the law of that country. (3) A writ, or notice of a writ, which is to be served out of the jurisdiction (a) need not be served personally on the person required to be served so long as it is served on him in accordance with the law of the country in which service is effected.\u201d  Looking then to California law it is necessary to serve notice on the party himself in order to modify a judgment or order after the final decree of dissolution has been entered (Civ. Code, \u00a7 4809). Such notice may be by mail under Code of Civil Procedure section 1013 which does not require the mail be certified or sent with return receipt requested. However, it does require proof of service including an affidavit detailing how and when service was attempted (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1013a). The courts require strict compliance with these sections and failure to comply deprives the court of jurisdiction <em>(Forslund </em>v. <em>Forslund, </em>225 Cal.App.2d 476, 485 [37 Cal.Rptr. 489]).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Here the only question is whether the procedural requirements with regard to service were met. The fact he may not have received notice is of no legal import as long as the procedures implementing the constitutional requirements of due process were followed giving assurance that service really had been made. (Rest., Judgments, \u00a7 6, com. (c); see <em>McKeon </em>v. <em>Sambrano, </em>200 Cal. 739, 741 [255 P. 178]; cf. Matrimonial Causes Rules, rule 59(3)). Here there is no allegation service was acknowledged or the Registrar made inquiry as required by British law, nor is there evidence notice was accompanied by an affidavit as required by California law. Doris attempts to remedy this deficiency by two letters from the Registrar\u2019s office saying notice of the hearing was sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>to John. The first<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is clearly insufficient since it does not refer to the date on which the hearing was to be held. The second letter dated September 28, 1976, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">\u201cWhereas Mr. Registrar Newton a Registrar of this Division appointed the 17th day of October 1975 for the hearing of an application by the Petitioner for ancillary relief</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">\u201cIt Is Hereby Certified on perusal of the Court file that Notice of such hearing was sent to the Respondent at his address:\u20149626 Blackgold Road, La Jolla, California 92037, U.S.A. by air mail by the proper officer of this Court on the 22nd September 1975.\u201d This certification satisfies neither alternative. The Registrar did not make inquiry to satisfy himself that respondent received the document (cf. <em>Spendley </em>v. <em>Spendley and </em>Goard[1920] P. 40; <em>Gilberts. Gilbert and Brooks </em>[1948] P. 314, 321; <em>Heath </em>v. <em>Heath </em>[1950] 1 All E.R. 877, 878). Nor is this after the fact certification in accordance with the law of California. Where service is made by mail strict compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 1013a is required <em>(Forslund </em>v. <em>Forslund, supra, 225 </em>Cal.App.2d 476, 485-486). That section requires that if the affidavit is not completely and correctly filled out, service is defective and the resulting default judgment must be dismissed because the court lacked jurisdiction <em>(Hogs Back Co. </em>v. <em>New Basil Co., </em>63 Cal. 121, 122; see <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Warnekey, </em>61 Cal. 507, 508). Since the case must be dismissed if the affidavit is improper, the conclusion is inescapable that the case must be dismissed if there is no affidavit at all. Under California law service was fatally deficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The last valid order is the one dated December 29, 1970, which directs John to pay 2,000 pounds per year spousal support and 500 pounds per year in child support.  This order may be enforced in the courts of California and modified by them as well as long as the decree can be modified in the court where the decree was originally rendered. (See <em>Biewendv. Biewend, </em>17 Cal.2d 108, 114 [109 P.2d 701, 132 A.L.R. 1264]; <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>10 Cal.App.3d 525, 532 [89 Cal.Rptr. 195].) Here in Doris\u2019 English maintenance decree, spousal support is \u201cfor their joint lives\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>subject to modification. Such a decree may be terminated or discharged by the court (Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, \u00a7\u00a7 28(1), 31(a)). Thus the court here can legitimately terminate Doris\u2019 support award under English or California law. The factors to be considered in making an award of support are similar under British and California law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the major difference being the attempt under British law to place the parties in the financial position each would have been in had the marriage not broken down. However, in either jurisdiction the court should take all the criteria into account in determining support. (See <em>In re Marriage of Morrison, </em>20 Cal.3d 437, 454-455 [143 Cal.Rptr. 139, 573 P.2d 41]; 13 Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England (4th ed. 1975) Divorce, \u00a7 1060.)  Under California law it is not an abuse of discretion to terminate spousal support after 15 years when the marriage lasted only four years and the wife is able to work. (See <em>In re Marriage of Andreen, 76 </em>Cal.App.3d 667, 672 [143 Cal.Rptr. 94].) Under British law the husband will not be required to make any financial provision or will be ordered to pay only nominal support where the marriage is short or the wife is able to work and there are no children. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>(See <em>Krystman </em>v. <em>Krystman </em>[1973] 3 All E.R. 247; <em>Wachtel </em>v. <em>Wachtel </em>[1973] 1 All E.R. 829, 840; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>[1974] 119 Sol Jo 30; <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Graves </em>[1973] 117 Sol Jo 679; 13 Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England (4th ed. 1975) Divorce, \u00a7 1060.) Here John has provided support for his former wife for fifteen years following a four-year marriage during which they cohabited for two years. Neither made any extraordinary contribution to the capital assets of the community during the marriage. (Cf. <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>[1975] 2 All E.R. 993.) The child of this union is approaching the age of 16 and no longer needs constant care and attention, thus freeing Doris for more employment opportunities. It was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to order termination of spousal support on the payment of $5,000. Such a proposal meets \u201cthe justice of the case\u201d <em>(Wachtel </em>v. <em>Wachtel, supra, </em>1 All E.R. 829, 842).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Cologne, J., and Welsh, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 19, 1979/</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The text of the letter is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">\u201cDear Sirs</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">\u201cWEST v.
