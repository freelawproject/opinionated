L. Lipscomb Engineering, Inc. (Lipscomb), Smith\u2019s former client, is plaintiff. Lipscomb\u2019s action seeks damages from the Title Companies for \u201cfraudulently or negligently\u201d preparing and issuing an incorrect \u201clot book\u201d guaranty which Lipscomb relied upon to its damage. Lipscomb charges the lot book guaranty omitted a $750,000 trust deed of which the Title Companies had knowledge. Attorney Smith represented Lipscomb in the property exchange transactions wherein Lipscomb was given the defective lot book guaranty. The Title Companies, by their proposed cross-complaint, seek \u201cindemnification\u201d from Smith under principles announced in <em>American Motorcycle Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court (20 </em>Cal.3d 578 [146 Cal.Rptr. 182, 578 P.2d 899]) <em>(AMA).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The trial court sustained Smith\u2019s general demurrer to the Title Companies\u2019 amended cross-complaint. This mandamus proceeding followed. This court has stayed the trial in the underlying action and directed Smith to show cause why the relief prayed for should not be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">The Title Companies allege (and we accept these allegations as true for the purposes of these proceedings) Attorney Smith represented Lipscomb in connection with the negotiations and consummation of a land exchange transaction between Lipscomb and Saratoga Development Corporation (Saratoga). An agreement was reached whereby Lipscomb would convey 9.3 acres (Quest parcel) to Saratoga and Saratoga would convey 9.3 acres (Scripps-Mesa parcel) to Lipscomb. Escrow instructions were prepared and submitted to Louisville Title Insurance Co. Saratoga\u2019s agent represented to Attorney Smith that the Scripps-Mesa parcel was free and clear of all encumbrances and that the Title Companies had prepared a title report so indicating that pristine status. A representative of Saratoga delivered a \u201clot book\u201d guaranty to Attorney Smith issued by the Title Companies and dated the morning the escrow was to close on the exchange of parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>The properties were exchanged without an escrow. Lipscomb received a parcel of property subject to a $750,000 trust deed for which it had not bargained.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The Title Companies charge Smith with negligently advising Lipscomb to proceed with the exchange of properties without first obtaining a policy of title insurance and in relying upon the representations of the Saratoga agent and the lot book guaranty. The lot book guaranty protection was limited to $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">In sum the Title Companies would charge their current opponent\u2019s former lawyer with legal malpractice in connection with the transaction, subject of the underlying lawsuit, and seek indemnification under <em>AMA </em>principles in proportion to the lawyer\u2019s fault, for any judgment obtained by Lipscomb against the Title Companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">It was with \u201cextreme reluctance\u201d that this court stayed the proceeding below and authorized the use of the prerogative writ to review a ruling on pleadings. \u201cHowever, upon occasion our attention is drawn to instances of such grave nature or of such significant legal impact that we feel compelled to intervene through the issuance of an extraordinaiy writ.\u201d <em>(Babb </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>3 Cal.3d 841, 851 [92 Cal.Rptr. 179, 479 P.2d 379].) Such a case is here. We are called upon to consider the effect of the rules announced in <em>AMA </em>upon the court\u2019s denying a cross-complaint for comparative indemnity. Considering the novelty of the fact setting, the absolute lack of precedent, the number of cases to which it could apply, and the need to give the superior court guidance at the earliest possible time, we deemed the issue of sufficient legal impact to justify granting of the order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\"><em>American Motorcycle Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d 578, is the claimed basis for a cause of action against Attorney Smith. We examine it with care. <em>AMA </em>involved an action for personal injuries brought against the sponsor of a motorcycle race by a youthful participant in the race. The sponsor <em>(AMA) </em>cross-complained for partial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>indemnity against the boy\u2019s parents, charging their negligent supervision was a concurrent cause of the boy\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">After concluding \u201cthat a concurrent tortfeasor enjoys a common law right to obtain partial indemnification from other concurrent tortfeasors on a comparative fault basis,\u201d the Supreme Court found that the governing provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure section 428.10 et seq. clearly authorize the sponsor to seek indemnification from a previously unnamed party through such a cross-complaint. <em>(AMA, supra, </em>at pp. 604-605.) The Supreme Court, accordingly, held the trial court\u2019s decision to deny defendant leave to file its pleading to be in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">In adopting the principle of partial indemnity between concurrent tortfeasors on a comparative fault basis, the Supreme Court modified the harsh all-or-nothing common law doctrine. This new doctrine followed upon, conformed to the objectives of <em>Li </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co., </em>13 Cal.3d 804, 813 [119 Cal.Rptr. 858, 532 P.2d 1226, 78 A.L.R.3d 393], establishing \u201ca system, under which liability for damage will be borne by those whose negligence caused it in direct proportion to their respective fault.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 813.) Prior to <em>Li, </em>a negligent tortfeasor\u2019s liability was ignored by the \u201cdraconian contributory negligence doctrine.\u201d <em>(AMA, supra, </em>at p. 587.) <em>Li </em>examined and abandoned the \u201ctimeworn\u201d contributory negligence rule. The Supreme Court in <em>AMA </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">\u201c[T]he force of <em>Li\u2019s </em>rationale applies equally to the allocation of responsibility between two or more negligent defendants and requires a modification of this state\u2019s traditional all-or-nothing common law equitable indemnity doctrine. Again, we concur with Dean Prosser\u2019s observation in a related context that \u2018[t]here is obvious lack of sense and justice in a rule which permits the entire burden of a loss, for which two defendants were . . . unintentionally responsible, to be shouldered onto one alone, . . . while the latter goes scot free.\u2019 [Citation.] From the crude all- or-nothing rule of traditional indemnity doctrine, and the similarly inflexible per capita division of the narrowly circumscribed contribution statute, we have progressed to the more refined stage of permitting the jury to apportion liability in accordance with the tortfeasors\u2019 comparative fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-8\">\u201cAccordingly, we hold that under the common law equitable indemnity doctrine a concurrent tortfeasor may obtain partial indemnity from cotortfeasors on a comparative fault basis.\u201d <em>(AMA, supra, </em>at pp. 607-608.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\"><em>AMA, </em>however, does not purport to make a rule for all seasons. It applies only to \u201cappropriate\u201d cases. The precise language of <em>AMA </em>is: \u201cThe long-recognized common law equitable indemnity doctrine should be modified to permit, in appropriate cases, a right of partial indemnity, under which liability among multiple tortfeasors may be apportioned on a comparative negligence basis.\u201d <em>(AMA, supra, </em>at p. 583.) And while concluding \u201cthat under the governing statutory provisions a defendant is generally authorized to file a cross-complaint against a concurrent tortfeasor for partial indemnity on a comparative fault basis, even when such concurrent tortfeasor has not been named a defendant in the original complaint\u201d <em>(AMA, supra, </em>at p. 607), a footnote points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-6\">\u201cThere are, of course, a number of significant exceptions to this general rule. For example, when an employee is injured in the scope of his employment, Labor Code section 3864 would normally preclude a third party tortfeasor from obtaining indemnification from the employer, even if the employer\u2019s negligence was a concurrent cause of the injury. [Citations.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-7\">\u201cSimilarly, as we have noted above such a partial indemnification claim cannot properly be brought against a concurrent tortfeasor who has entered a good faith settlement with the plaintiff, because permitting such a cross-complaint would obviously undermine the explicit statutory policy to encourage settlements reflected by the provisions of section 877 of the Code of Civil Procedure. . . .\u201d <em>(AMA, supra, </em>at p. 607, fn. 9.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">And in <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>87 Cal.App.3d 626, 676 [151 Cal.Rptr. 399], the appeal court set forth yet another variant: \u201cIn adopting a principle of partial indemnity between concurrent tortfeasors on a comparative fault basis, <em>American Motorcycle </em>was modifying the all-or-nothing common law doctrine of <em>equitable indemnity. </em>As the court explained in <em>Peters </em>v. <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco </em>. . . , \u2018a right of indemnification may arise as a result of <em>contract </em>or <em>equitable considerations </em>. . . .\u2019 (Italics added.) None of the discussion in <em>American Motorcycle </em>leads to the slightest suggestion that the court was addressing itself to the all-or-nothing right of indemnification that is created by the parties to an indemnity contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>And in <em>Held </em>v. <em>Arant, 61 </em>Cal.App.3d 748, 750 [134 Cal.Rptr. 422], the court stated <em>(pxe-AMA):</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cBecause reasons of policy peculiar to the tripartite relationship of attorney-client-adversary override the principle of equitable indemnity enunciated in cases such as <em>Herrero </em>v. <em>Atkinson . . . </em>and <em>Niles </em>v. <em>City of San </em>Rafael. . ., we conclude that the first lawyer has no right of indemnity from the second.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">Thus, <em>AMA </em>makes not a rule of general application but a rule riddled with exceptions. Partial indemnity is permitted only in appropriate cases. It is with this precise holding and the rationale underpinning <em>AMA </em>in mind that the facts, the circumstances of this case must be viewed. We need only to count the gross differences, factual, legal, equitable, and of public policy, to distinguish, to make the <em>AMA </em>rule inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">We examine first the factual matrix of this cross-complaint. A charged wrongdoer seeks to compel his victim\u2019s lawyer to shoulder a portion of the damages on the premise the lawyer, guilty of malpractice in advising his former client, is a <em>joint tortfeasor </em>joinable, required to contribute under <em>AMA </em>principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">In discussing the liability of a joint tortfeasor, <em>AMA </em>(p. 588) points out \u201ca concurrent tortfeasor is liable for the whole of an indivisible injury whenever his negligence is a proximate cause of that injury.\u201d  Thus the liability for a wrongful act attaches for all the damages ensuing from the wrong regardless of the degree of participation by the tortfeasor in that wrong. <em>(Tuman </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>59 Cal.App.2d 16, 25 [138 P.2d 363]; <em>Hughey </em>v. <em>Candoli, </em>159 Cal.App.2d 231, 240 [323 P.2d 779]; <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>Schloss, </em>93 Cal. 194 [29 P. 31]; Prosser, Law of Torts (4th ed.) pp. 291, 293, 297-298; 14 Cal.Jur.3d, Contribution and Indemnification, \u00a7 73, p. 740.)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">This essential characteristic of a joint tortfeasor is <em>not </em>shared by the attorney charged with legal malpractice with respect to a client.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">The lawyer\u2019s duty to his client arises from his contractual obligation as well as ethical demands. When a lawyer negligently advises his client, a violation of his duty occurs. The resultant legal malpractice constitutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>both a tort and breach of contract. <em>(Neel </em>v. <em>Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart &amp; Gelfand, </em>6 Cal.3d 176, 181 [98 Cal.Rptr. 837, 491 P.2d 421].) However, for an actionable legal liability of the lawyer to his client to arise further elements must be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">As set out in <em>Budd </em>v. <em>Nixen, </em>6 Cal.3d 195, 200 [98 Cal.Rptr. 849, 491 P.2d 433], the elements of legal malpractice, like those of any other action for negligence, are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-6\">\u201c(1) the duty of the professional to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of his profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage resulting from the professional\u2019s negligence. [Citations.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-7\">\u201cIf the allegedly negligent conduct does not cause damage, it generates no cause of action in tort. [Citation.] The mere breach of a professional duty, causing only nominal damages, speculative harm, or the threat of future harm\u2014not yet realized\u2014does not suffice to create a cause of action for negligence. [Citations.] Hence, <em>until the client suffers appreciable harm as a consequence of his attorney\u2019s negligence, the client cannot establish a cause of action for malpractice. </em>\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">It is black letter law that damages\u2014\u201cappreciable harm\u201d\u2014may not be based on speculation or surmise; mere possibility or even probability that damage will result from wrongful conduct does not render it actionable. <em>(Ventura County Humane Society </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>40 Cal.App.3d 897, 907 [115 Cal.Rptr. 464].) Thus until Lipscomb\u2019s action against the Title Companies evidences <em>damages </em>actually sustained, no cause of action exists for the lawyer\u2019s misadvice. If Lipscomb recovers from Title Companies, despite negligence of the lawyer, such amount would reduce \u201cthe damages proximately resulting from respondents\u2019 [lawyers\u2019] negligence.\u201d <em>(Theobald </em>v. <em>Byers, </em>193 Cal.App.2d 147, 153 [13 Cal.Rptr. 864]; <em>Kirtland &amp; Packard </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>59 Cal.App.3d 140 [131 Cal.Rptr. 418].) Furthermore, if we assume again that lawyer negligence has been established, the defense of the client\u2019s contributory negligence may properly be raised. The attorney may show that the client has disregarded the legal advice given by the attorney. <em>(Theobald </em>v. <em>Byers, supra, </em>at p. 150; <em>Ishmael </em>v. <em>Millington, </em>241 Cal.App.2d 520, 530 [50 Cal.Rptr. 592]; 7 Cal.Jur.3d, Attorneys at Law, \u00a7 283, p. 621.)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>In light of the foregoing well-established rules, the language of <em>McGregor </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>117 Cal.App. 186, 196 [3 P.2d 624], becomes clothed with legal rectitude. \u201cUnder the laws of negligence, it became necessary for plaintiff to prove, not merely that his action upon the advice of the defendants contributed to his removal, but it must be established that the reliance upon erroneous advice was the sole and proximate cause of such removal and the loss sustained. [Citation.] It is likewise established that before a client can recover for alleged negligence of his attorneys he must establish that any loss suffered was caused solely by the negligence of the attorney. [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">By definition, joint tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for the <em>entire </em>damage proximately resulting. (14 Cal.Jur.3d, Contribution and Indemnifications, \u00a7 73, p. 740, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The negligent lawyer simply does not fit into the true joint tortfeasor status present in <em>AMA </em>or <em>Safeway Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Nest-Kart, </em>21 Cal.3d 322 [146 Cal.Rptr. 550, 579 P.2d 441], for he is not <em>responsible </em>for the entire damage when he is joined as a joint tortfeasor with his client\u2019s legal opponent.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">A second set of circumstances distinguishes this case, removes it from the penumbral effect of <em>AMA. </em>Ordinarily independent tortfeasors who do not act in concert are not jointly liable even though their acts have united to produce one injury. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Highland Ditch Co., </em>87 Cal. 430, 431 [25 P. 550]; <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Kerrigan, </em>109 Cal.App.2d 637, 640 [241 P.2d 296].) Each is responsible only for the part of the damage resulting from his own acts. <em>(Slater </em>v. <em>Pacific American Oil Co., </em>212 Cal. 648, 651-652 [300 P. 31]; <em>Summers </em>v. <em>Tice, </em>33 Cal.2d 80, 87 [199 P.2d 1, 5 A.L.R.2d 91].)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">As discussed above, the negligent lawyer\u2019s liability proceeds from a totally different source, factually and legally, from that of his client\u2019s opponent. The lawyer certainly does not act in \u201cconcert\u201d with the opposition to produce the injuries to his client. Elis wrong arises from the failure to exercise the reasonable lawyer skill in performance of his task. <em>(Lucas </em>v. <em>Hamm, </em>56 Cal.2d 583, 591 [15 Cal.Rptr. 821, 364 P.2d 685].) The Title Companies are charged with negligent misrepresentation in connection with a lot book guaranty. These are independent wrongs. They do not arise from violation of a common duty as in <em>American Motorcycle </em>or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number><em>Safeway </em>v. <em>Nest-Kart. </em>Each of these independent wrongdoers is responsible for only his own damage. (14 Cal.Jur.3d, Contribution and Indemnity, \u00a7 73, p. 741.)</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Therefore, when we examine this particular fact matrix through the eyes of the legal technician, it may be reasonably concluded the acts of Title Companies are in the nature of an independent intervening cause. (See <em>Zalta </em>v. <em>Billips, </em>81 Cal.App.3d 183, 191 [144 Cal.Rptr. 888].) The lawyer\u2019s damage responsibility ended\u2014as a matter of law\u2014where the negligence of Title Companies began. The negligence of Title Companies operated factually independent of the lawyer neglect to cause damage. It cut the causal connection between lawyer negligence and his client\u2019s damage. <em>(Werkman </em>v. <em>Howard Zink Corp., </em>97 Cal.App.2d 418 [218 P.2d 43].) If the act of the third party is not reasonably foreseeable, not a normal consequence in the situation, it is a superseding cause. <em>(Schrimscher </em>v. <em>Bryson, </em>58 Cal.App.3d 660 [130 Cal.Rptr. 125]; <em>Jimison </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 F.Supp. 674, 678; <em>Ewart </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Gas Co., </em>237 Cal.App.2d 163 [46 Cal.Rptr. 631].)</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">But enough of these technical perseverations. We turn now to the most disturbing aspect of the Title Companies\u2019 pleadings. The Title Companies are charged wrongdoers. They seek to sue their victim\u2019s former lawyer, charging him in effect with negligence in failing to disbelieve the Title Companies, to intuit third parties\u2019 wrongdoings.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The public policy, the equitable considerations underpinning <em>Li </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab, supra, </em>and <em>AMA, </em>do not fit, do not stretch so far as to cover this specie of relationship. Authorizing suit against the lawyer could cause these immediate repercussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">In the first place, if the lawyer is to be joined, then his former client, the <em>plaintiff, </em>can be properly cross-sued on a contributory neglect concept. <em>(Theobald </em>v. <em>Byers, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.2d 147.) And if plaintiff\u2019s attorney, or former attorney, can be sued by defendant on a theory of negligent advice to his client causing damage, then too in fairness, defendant\u2019s lawyer on the same legal theory\u2014negligent advice to his client causing contingent damage\u2014could be brought in on the same flying carpet of legal unreality.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">But to return to solid legal firmament, reasons of public policy peculiar to the attorney-client relationship vis-\u00e1-vis an adversary make the application of equitable indemnity principles enunciated in <em>American </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number><em>Motorcycle </em>untenable. The lawyer has the duty of undivided loyalty. He may not acquire an adverse interest to his client. He should not be forced to choose between conflicting interests. The attorney is under an obligation to preserve the secrets of his client \u201cat every peril to himself.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6068, subd. (e).) This duty is owed both <em>present </em>and <em>former </em>clients. (ABA Code of Prof. Responsibility, EC 4-6). Only the <em>client </em>can release the attorney from the obligation. <em>(Earl Scheib, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>253 Cal.App.2d 703 [61 Cal.Rptr. 386].) It is the policy of the court to encourage confidence and to preserve inviolate this relationship of client-lawyer. <em>(In re Ochse, </em>38 Cal.2d 230 [238 P.2d 561].)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">This limited review of but a few of the ethical, public policy considerations affecting the lawyer-client relationship must be placed in the context of authorization of cross-suit in this action against the former attorney. If suit were to be permitted against the current acting attorney for plaintiff, such rule would effectively allow a defendant to require plaintiff\u2019s now-sued attorney for multiple reasons to recuse himself. The present or past attorney has his mouth sealed\u2014he must preserve his client\u2019s secrets inviolate at all peril to himself. Further, the chilling effect of such a threat of suit by a potential or actual adversary\u2014for negligent advice to the client\u2014is ever present. The lawyer\u2019s duty in re full and frank discussion and disclosure could not help but be affected by this overhanging threat of a lawsuit brought by a person about whom the lawyer is advising his client. There is inherent in proposed extension of the <em>AMA </em>rule the seeds of irresponsible cross-lawsuits motivated by naught but spite and a desire to spread confusion, dissention in the opponent\u2019s camp. As was said in <em>Held </em>v. <em>Arant, supra, 61 </em>Cal.App.3d 748, 752:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-5\">\u201cWhere, however, an attorney is retained to represent the interests of his client against persons who are actual or potential adversaries, the possibility that one of those adversaries may seek indemnity from the attorney if he is held liable to the client can impinge upon the undivided loyalty owed by counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-6\">\u201c. . . MM&amp;H [the lawyers] owed an undivided loyalty to Held to use its best judgment to extricate him from the situation created by Arant\u2019s advice. Extrication involved consideration both of resistance of the claim of Nova-Tech and of the assertion of an affirmative claim against Arant. MM&amp;H\u2019s ability to choose between courses of conduct best designed to protect the interests of its client cannot be inhibited by the proposition that if it chooses the course of resistance of the claim it will be immune <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>from liability to the one adversary absent malicious prosecution [citation] while if it chooses the course of prosecuting the client\u2019s claim for malpractice against a prior attorney it may be subject to a claim to indemnify that attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The Supreme Court reasoned in <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>18 Cal.3d 335, 344 [134 Cal.Rptr. 375, 556 P.2d 737]: \u201cTo make an attorney liable for negligent confidential advice not only to the client who enters into a transaction in reliance upon the advice but also to the other parties to the transaction with whom the client deals at arm\u2019s length would inject undesirable self-protective reservations into the attorney\u2019s counselling role. The attorney\u2019s preoccupation or concern with the possibility of claims based on mere negligence (as distinct from fraud or malice) by any with whom his client might deal \u2018would prevent him from devoting his entire energies to his client\u2019s interests\u2019 [citation]. The result would be both \u2018an undue burden on the profession\u2019 [citation] and a diminution in the quality of the legal services received by the client. [Citation.]\u201d (Fn. omitted.)

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhS\">I concur with the majority opinion which holds this is a proper case for the issuance of an extraordinary writ under the authority of <em>Babb </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>3 Cal.3d 841, 851 [92 Cal.Rptr. 179, 479 P.2d 379], but I must respectfully dissent from the opinion in its refusal to extend the principles of <em>American Motorcycle Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>20 Cal.3d 578 [146 Cal.Rptr. 182, 578 P.2d 899], to the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">We are called upon to apply the principles set forth in <em>American Motorcycle Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d 578, to allow a cross-complaint seeking partial indemnity by a joint tortfeasor so that liability may be apportioned on a comparative negligence basis. The fact the joint tortfeasor is an attorney should not deter the court from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>exercising its responsibility to impose equitable indemnity especially where, as here, the client has waived the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">The holding in <em>American Motorcycle </em>generally eliminates a trial court\u2019s discretion to deny filing of a cross-complaint for indemnity if it can withstand a demurrer. No discretion is permitted in the case at bar since under <em>American Motorcycle </em>the cross-complaint against the joint tortfeasors must be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The facts of <em>American Motorcycle </em>are analogous to those of the present case. That case involved a personal injury action against the sponsor of a motorcycle race by a youthful participant in the race. The American Motorcycle Association (AMA) sought to cross-complain for partial indemnity against the boy\u2019s parents, claiming their negligent supervision was a concurrent cause of the boy\u2019s injuries. The trial court denied AMA leave to file the cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">After concluding \u201cthat a concurrent tortfeasor enjoys a common law right to obtain partial indemnification from other concurrent tortfeasors on a comparative fault basis,\u201d the court found that the governing provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure (\u00a7 428.10 et seq.) authorize a defendant to seek indemnification from a previously unnamed party through such a cross-complaint. <em>(American Motorcycle Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior </em>Court, <em>supra, 20 </em>Cal.3d 578, 605-607.) The court, accordingly, held the trial court\u2019s decision to deny defendant leave to file its pleading to be in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">In commenting on the trial court\u2019s authority to order a separate trial of <em>any </em>cause of action (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1048), the court recognized that in the context of the facts presented on a comparative indemnity claim, \u201cseverance may at times not be an attractive alternative,\u201d given the \u201cfact that when the plaintiff is alleged to have been partially at fault for the injury, each of the third party defendants will have the right to litigate the question of the plaintiff\u2019s proportionate fault for the accident,\u201d thus raising the specter of inconsistent findings regarding the plaintiff\u2019s proportionate fault <em>(American Motorcycle, supra, </em>at p. 606).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Although thereby purporting to give the trial court some, albeit small, degree of discretion in determining whether to order a separate trial of the cause of action alleged in the cross-complaint, the court proceeded to effectively withdraw even that degree of discretion. The court stated: \u201cNonetheless, having already noted that under the comparative negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>gence doctrine a plaintiff\u2019s recovery should be diminished only by that proportion which the plaintiff\u2019s negligence bears to that of all tortfeasors . . ., we think it only fair that a defendant who may be jointly and severally liable for all of the plaintiff\u2019s damages be permitted to bring other concurrent tortfeasors into the suit. Thus, we conclude that the interaction of the partial indemnity doctrine with California\u2019s existing cross-complaint procedures works no undue prejudice to the rights of plaintiffs.\u201d <em>(American Motorcycle Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d 578, 606.) The court thus concluded: \u201c[U]nder the governing statutory provisions a defendant is <em>generally authorized </em>to file a cross-complaint against a concurrent tortfeasor for partial indemnity on a comparative fault basis, even when such concurrent tortfeasor has not been named a defendant in the original complaint.\u201d <em>(American Motorcycle, supra, </em>at p. 607; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The court explains the qualification of the rule suggested by the phrase \u201cgenerally authorized\u201d to be those cases where the statutory law, e.g., Labor Code section 3864, does not allow indemnification or where a concurrent tortfeasor has made a good faith settlement (see <em>American Motorcycle, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d 578, at p. 607, fn. 9). There appears to be no substantial reason why this \u201cgeneral authorization\u201d should not apply to the case at hand, leaving only the question of whether the allegations of petitioners\u2019 cross-complaint are sufficient to suggest that plaintiff\u2019s attorney in the transaction in question may have been negligent toward Lipscomb and that his negligence may have been a concurrent cause of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Smith takes the position that the court below was correct in denying permission to file the subject pleading since it was insufficient to state a cause of action (see <em>Dunzweiler </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>267 Cal.App.2d 569 [73 Cal.Rptr. 331]). While I agree that the trial judge has discretion to deny permission to file such a pleading if it states no cause of action, that is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">The Title Companies need only allege the same basic elements of duty, breach of duty, proximate cause, damages<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to show actionable negligence of an attorney toward his client as in any other actionable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>negligence <em>(Ishmael </em>v. <em>Millington, </em>241 Cal.App.2d 520, 523 [50 Cal.Rptr. 592]). Then they must show that this negligence toward the client may have been a concurrent cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury. (See <em>American Motorcycle, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d 578, 607.) This minimal standard is met by the allegations in the cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">The majority holds public policy considerations preclude an adversary from pursuing a cause of action for equitable indemnity against an opponent\u2019s attorney arising from an attorney\u2019s allegedly negligent advice to the opponent. The opinion relies heavily on <em>Held </em>v. <em>Arant, </em>67 Cal.App.3d 748 [134 Cal.Rptr. 422], for this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">In <em>Held, </em>the defendant attorney in a malpractice action sought indemnification from the attorney who had been retained to represent the plaintiff, his former client. The alleged negligence of plaintiff\u2019s present attorney was in settling with third parties in such a manner as to expose the defendant attorney to damages for malpractice. The appellate court upheld the sustaining of the demurrer to this cross-complaint for indemnity on policy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The court reasoned that allowing such an indemnity action to be filed would be detrimental to the attorney-client relationship. When an attorney knows he may have to indemnify an adversary if he pursues one course for his client and that he will not have to indemnify anyone if he pursues a different course, his own self-interest interferes with his objectivity in making decisions for his client. To avoid this possibility, the court would not allow the indemnity action to be brought in that particular situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">The present case, however, presents no considerations of interference with the attorney-client relationship. Assuming there is proof of the allegations, Smith\u2019s judgment in relying upon the lot book guarantee and the representations of the other parties to the exchange contract was not detrimentally affected by the potential of having to indemnify the petitioners. If anything, such a threat would encourage Smith to use even greater care in protecting his client. Thus the policy considerations of <em>Held </em>are lacking here.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Smith relies on <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>18 Cal.3d 335 [134 Cal.Rptr. 375, 556 P.2d 737], asserting he owed the Title Companies no duty of due care. I believe his reliance on <em>Goodman, supra, </em>is misplaced since the Title Companies do not contend he breached a duty to them. They only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>contend that he breached his duty of care <em>to his client </em>which, along with their alleged negligence, makes him a concurrent tortfeasor who must indemnify them if they are found liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">I do not believe the language of <em>McGregor </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>117 Cal.App. 186, 196 [3 P.2d 624], was intended to mean, as the majority apparently asserts, that only when the attorney is the <em>sole </em>cause of the damages may he be held liable for his negligence (see <em>Modica </em>v. <em>Crist, </em>129 Cal.App.2d 144, 147 [276 P.2d 614]). The cases relied on<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> deal with special fact situations. Most of the cases involved possible concurrent negligence of the client and the rule that contributory negligence would bar recovery, a doctrine no longer in use <em>(Li </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co., </em>13 Cal.3d 804, 812-813, 829 [119 Cal.Rptr. 858, 532 P.2d 1226]). In such cases under the former law it is apparent the client\u2019s negligence would be a bar to liability under the contributory negligence doctrine and it was essential the attorney\u2019s negligence be the \u201csole and proximate cause!\u201d In addition, where the attorney failed to assert a <em>nonmeritorious </em>defense, his \u201cnegligence\u201d would result in no liability (see <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Hanscome, </em>198 Cal. 550 [246 P. 53]).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">This issue is well covered in <em>Modica </em>v. <em>Crist, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.2d 144, 147-148: \u201cDefendants contend a complaint against an attorney for alleged negligence in the giving of advice must allege facts which show that any loss was <em>caused solely </em>by the attorney\u2019s negligence and must <em>negative any other probable cause </em>for the loss. We know of no such requirement. Defendants\u2019 authorities do not support their contention.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-7\"><em>\u201cLally </em>v. <em>Kuster, </em>177 Cal. 783 [171 P. 961], was an action for an attorney\u2019s negligence in not bringing a certain debt collection suit to trial, a suit which had been dismissed for delay. Judgment was given the defendant upon the ground that there was no debt to collect, that it had been relinquished by the life beneficiary of the note. It was reversed because the life beneficiary had no right to relinquish the principal. Defendants invoke a few words, out of context, to the effect that the client must allege and prove facts showing that \u2018but for such negligence, the debt could, or would, have been collected.\u2019 This \u2018but for\u2019 clause is merely one way of expressing the requirement that negligence to be actionable must be a proximate cause of the injury. [Citations.] The words quoted by defendant do not connote a requirement that the attorney\u2019s negligence be the sole cause or that the complaint must negative any other cause. This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>doubly apparent from the court\u2019s discussion of the measure of damages on page 791 of 177 Cal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-4\">\u201cNor does <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>203 Cal. 351 [264 P.2d 478], support defendants\u2019 contention. It merely held insufficient a complaint which upon its face showed no damage had occurred from a failure to give notice of intended sale under section 3440 of the Civil Code. The only \u2018loss\u2019 which ensued was a creditor\u2019s execution sale which was void upon its face and could give no title to the purchaser at the sale. That was a case of \u2018no injury,\u2019 not a case of failure to show \u2018sole cause\u2019 or to negative any other cause, whether concurrent, joint or intervening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-5\">\u201cIn <em>McGregor </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>117 Cal.App. 186 [3 P.2d 624], the statement does appear that it must be established that reliance upon the attorney\u2019s advice was the \u2018sole and proximate cause\u2019 and that any loss suffered was \u2018caused solely\u2019 by the negligence of the attorney. We should not attach undue significance to the words \u2018sole\u2019 and \u2018solely.\u2019 The real holding in the case was a lack of causal connection between the asserted erroneous legal advice and the claimed injury, and the uncertain and speculative quality of the asserted financial loss \u2018not only as to amount but as to character.\u2019 Also, those findings and conclusions were based upon the evidence introduced at a trial, not drawn as conclusions of law from the allegations of a complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-6\"><em>\u201cFeldesman </em>v. <em>McGovern, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.2d 566 [112 P.2d 645], held merely that when a cause of action is predicated upon an attorney\u2019s negligent failure to perform some act in behalf of the client, the complaint must state facts showing that if the attorney had acted it would have resulted beneficially to the client. In that case the attorney allegedly failed to file a petition for the discharge of the client as a bankrupt. There was no allegation which directly or by implication stated that if such a petition had been filed the client would have been entitled to have it granted. This was a fatal defect because the granting of such a petition is not mandatory. A bankrupt is entitled to a discharge only if he has complied with the Bankruptcy Act and has not committed any of the offenses listed in the statute. Hence, the Feldesman case was one of failure sufficiently to plead proximate cause, not at all a holding that an attorney is liable to a client only when his negligence is the sole cause of the resultant injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-7\">\u201cA complete answer to defendants\u2019 contention is furnished by two cases in which, though not attorney-client cases, the question of \u2018sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>cause\u2019 was <em>directly </em>raised and answered. The law does not require that negligence of the defendant must be the sole cause of the injury complained of in order to entitle the plaintiff to damages therefor. All that is required in either respect is that the negligence in question shall be <em>a </em>proximate cause of the injury complained of. . .\u2019 <em>(Griffith </em>v. <em>Oak Ridge Oil Co., </em>190 Cal. 389, 392 [212 P. 913].) This was followed in <em>Condon </em>v. <em>Ansaldi, </em>203 Cal. 180, 183 [263 P. 198], which held prejudicially erroneous an instruction that \u2018 \u201cunless the defendant is solely responsible for the occurrence of the accident complained of, your verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d \u2019 These rulings would furnish support for the formula suggested by Prosser in \u2018Proximate Cause in California,\u2019 38 Cal.L.Rev. 369, 378: The defendant\u2019s conduct is a cause of the event if it was a material element and a substantial factor in bringing it about. Whether it is such a substantial factor is for the jury to determine, unless the issue is so clear that reasonable men cannot differ.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">This doctrine was reaffirmed in <em>Ishmael </em>v. <em>Millington, supra, </em>241 Cal.App.2d 520, 529, where the court said: \u201cLegal malpractice may consist of a negligent failure to act. <em>(Feldesman </em>v. <em>McGovern, </em>44 Cal.App.2d 566, 568 [112 P.2d 645]; see <em>Gambert </em>v. <em>Hart, supra, </em>44 Cal. at p. 552; <em>Hege </em>v. <em>Worthington, Park &amp; Worthington, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.2d at pp. 676-678 [26 Cal.Rptr. 132]; <em>Pete </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>124 Cal.App.2d 487-489 [269 P.2d 78].) <em>The .attorney\u2019s negligence, </em>whether consisting of active conduct or a failure to act, <em>need not be the sole cause of the client\u2019s loss. (Modica </em>v. <em>Crist, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.2d at p. 146; see 2 Witkin, Summary <em>of </em>Cal. Law (1960) p. 1485; Prosser, <em>Proximate Cause in California, </em>38 Cal.L.Rev. 369, 378.) Here the attorney is charged not with erroneous advice, but with failure to advise, failure to investigate, failure to disclose. The wife\u2019s reliance on her husband\u2019s alleged misrepresentations is not at all inconsistent with the claim that her loss was the result of the attorney\u2019s negligent failure. A jury might find that the husband\u2019s misrepresentations were a realizable likelihood which made the attorney\u2019s inaction negligent, thus forming a concurrent (and not superseding) cause of harm. <em>(Richardson </em>v. <em>Ham, </em>44 Cal.2d 772, <em>777 </em>[285 P.2d 269]; <em>Mosley </em>v. <em>Arden Farms Co., supra, 26 </em>Cal.2d at pp. 218-219 [157 P.2d 372, 158 A.L.R. 872]; Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 449.)\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Certainly the attorney\u2019s allegedly negligent advice could make him a <em>joint </em>tortfeasor liable for some portion of the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The public policy of preserving inviolate the attorney-client relationship is not in issue in this case since Lipscomb has already served its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>attorney, Smith,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> making him a party and thereby waiving any such privilege, (cf. former Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1881, subd. (4), dealing with physicians and <em>San Francisco </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>37 Cal.2d 227, 232 [231 P.2d 26, 25 A.L.R.2d 1418].) In any event, the violation of the privilege is not yet in issue. The privilege only is in issue as it relates to admission of evidence by the attorney revealing confidential communication (see Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 952, 954, 955), a matter totally unrelated to the issue here, namely, joinder as a party for indemnity. How the Title Companies intend to prove Smith\u2019s negligence is not yet before us. The importance of having all tortfeasors before the court to secure a defendant\u2019s right of indemnity overrides the plaintiff\u2019s right to shield his attorney and, incidentally, his own behavior, on the issues he has raised by the lawsuit. I find the sanctity of their relationship in this regard no more sacred than the public policy calling for family harmony that was involved in <em>American Motorcycle </em>(at p. 607; see also <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>3 Cal.3d 914 [92 Cal.Rptr. 288, 479 P.2d 648]) where a parent was allowed to be joined as a tortfeasor for purposes of indemnity in his own child\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">I would order the trial court to permit the filing of the second proposed first amended cross-complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 25, 1979, and petitioners\u2019 application for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 19, 1979.
