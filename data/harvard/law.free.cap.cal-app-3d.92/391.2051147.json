J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYJ\">Defendant Jeffery Ray Ross and codefendant Lanny Atkins were charged by information with crimes of murder, robbery, burglary and arson; the murder count included a penalty enhancement allegation that it had been committed by means of torture with intent to kill. An arming clause as to defendant Ross was stricken and the cases were severed for trial. A jury returned a verdict of guilty as to all counts, fixing the degree at first degree on the three crimes first mentioned and finding the murder penalty enhancement allegation true. On appeal from the judgment, defendant claims a number of errors related to sufficiency of the evidence, instructions, use of the codefendant\u2019s extrajudicial statements, prosecutorial misconduct, and penalty. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Our review of those claims in light of the whole record requires reversal of the arson conviction and affirmance of the remainder of the judgment as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The essential facts may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">During the afternoon of February 1, 1977, the Berkeley Fire Department responded to a fire at the scene of the crime where they discovered the body of the 90-year-old victim, Remi L. Dufau, lying next to a smoldering bedroom mattress; the victim\u2019s hands and feet were trussed together behind his back with a piece of electric cord and a knotted cloth was found next to the victim\u2019s neck. Their investigation revealed that the fire, which began in the area of the victim\u2019s head and shoulders, was of incendiary origin. Police investigation disclosed that the apartment had been thoroughly ransacked; the widow (who arrived later) provided a list of items missing from the apartment, including the victim\u2019s wallet, his Mastercharge card, several bottles of liquor and some jewelry. Upon defendant\u2019s arrest two days later, a search of his room uncovered the victim\u2019s wallet and identification. The next day the director of Harper House<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> delivered to the police a bottle of Christian Brothers brandy taken from the defendant\u2019s room as well as a bottle of Courvoisier cognac found in the codefendant\u2019s room; the brands matched those taken from the Dufau household.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">At trial, forensic evidence established that the victim sustained (1) multiple rib fractures and associated hemorrhaging, and hemorrhage of the brain consistent with the infliction of blows, (2) a contused laiynx caused by an attempted ligature strangulation and (3) extensive burns in the skull region. In the opinion of the pathologist the victim was still alive during the burning and that the cause of death was cardiorespiratory failure due to thermal burns and blunt trauma. In a recorded statement following his arrest, defendant confessed to his complicity in the planned burglary and robbery and in assisting Atkins in tying the victim and carrying him into the bedroom. Defendant denied any culpability for the arson and murder contending that codefendant Atkins alone administered the beating with a pipe and undertook preparations with the announced intention to set afire the blindfolded and gagged victim; that despite his protestation, codefendant Atkins continued his grisly preparations prompting the defendant to leave (with some of the loot) before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Atkins lit the match in order to avoid involvement in the anticipated murder. When Atkins later rejoined him outside, he informed the defendant that he had \u201cburned him up\u201d and that the event should prove newsworthy. Upon their return to their place of residence, they divided the stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Defendant did not testify, relying on the testimony of the only witness called by the defense, Anthony Deloney, a roommate to whom Atkins confessed his guilt of the charged crimes without mention of another\u2019s involvement or participation. Proof of Atkins\u2019 earlier convictions for the same crimes and torture allegation was offered into evidence by the defense pursuant to stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">On rebuttal, the prosecution introduced impeachment testimony\u2014over objection\u2014consisting of two in-custody statements by Atkins to the authorities wherein he admitted guilt in the burglary and robbery incidents but denied any complicity in the arson and homicide or any such admission to Deloney. The net effect of Atkins\u2019 statements was to reciprocally shift the blame for the arson and torture-murder onto his confederate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">We consider defendant\u2019s claims in an order and context promoting convenience of discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">Defendant severally contends that the record is barren of any substantial evidence linking him to the crimes of arson and murder by means of torture.  Upon review of such contentions the applicable test on appeal is whether substantial evidence exists to support the verdict, viewing the evidence and its inferences in a light favorable to the respondent. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Redmond </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 745, 755 [79 Cal.Rptr. 529, 457 P.2d 321].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Defendant first contends, relying chiefly on what defendant terms the <em>Toledo </em>doctrine <em>(People </em>v. <em>Toledo </em>(1948) 85 Cal.App.2d 577 [193 P.2d 953]), that since his exculpatory statements were introduced during the People\u2019s case in chief, \u201c \u2018[t]he prosecution ... is bound by the evidence in the absence of proof to the contraiy.\u2019 \u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Toledo, supra, </em>at p. 581.) The argument is flawed in many particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">First, the so-called <em>Toledo </em>doctrine (whose genesis seems to have been merely an argument offered on appeal)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> actually refers to a principle of judicial review invoked in homicide prosecutions obviating a defendant\u2019s burden of showing mitigation or justification where the prosecution\u2019s proof itself tends to show same or a lesser unlawful homicide. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1105; see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 149, 177 [67 Cal.Rptr. 601]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mercer </em>(1962) 210 Cal.App.2d 153, 159 [26 Cal.Rptr. 502]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Salaz </em>(1924) 66 Cal.App. 173, 181 [225 P. 777]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Estrada </em>(1923) 60 Cal.App. 477, 482-483 [213 P. 67].) The rule in its amended form is properly restricted to those cases where \u201call the prosecution evidence points to <em>excuse or mitigation. </em>If there is substantial evidence incompatible with the theory of <em>excuse or mitigation, </em>the jury may consider all the evidence and determine whether the act amounted to unlawful homicide. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chapman, supra, </em>261 Cal.App.2d 149, 177; italics ours.) To the extent that the doctrine is founded upon a notion that the prosecution is bound by their witnesses\u2019 statements (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 648, 655 [47 Cal.Rptr. 801, 408 P.2d 129]) on the antiquated theory of vouchsafing one\u2019s own witnesses (see Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) \u00a7 1270, pp. 1176-1177), that theory has long since been discarded in favor of the modem rule allowing impeachment of a witness by any party, \u201cincluding the party calling him.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 785; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chacon </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 765, 779 [73 Cal.Rptr. 10, 447 P.2d 106, 34 A.L.R.3d 454].) In the final analysis the question of defendant\u2019s guilt must be resolved from <em>all </em>the evidence considered by the jury. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 655; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chapman, supra, </em>261 Cal.App.2d at p. 177.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Herein, in addition to his confessed participation in the crimes of burglary and robbery, defendant admitted his active participation in hog-tying the victim and carrying him into the bedroom where he watched Atkins\u2014whose propensity for committing arson crimes was known\u2014heap clothing and debris upon the victim\u2019s upper body and douse them with a combustible toilet lotion. Under such circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the jury was entitled to find that the defendant knew of Atkins\u2019 maniacal purpose and that his conduct actively aided and promoted its commission; conversely, it was likewise entitled to reject defendant\u2019s claim that he had left the premises after his futile remonstrance but before the actual arson and killing.  Under established principles defining the derivative liability of an aider and abettor, the issue of whether upon such evidence the defendant knowingly aided and abetted Atkins in the depraved act, with resultant liability for its natural consequences, presented questions of fact for the jury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Durham </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 171, 181 [74 Cal.Rptr. 262, 449 P.2d 198] [cert, den., 395 U.S. 968 (23 L.Ed.2d 755, 89 S.Ct. 2116) and 406 U.S. 971 (32 L.Ed.2d 671, 92 S.Ct. 2416)]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Villa </em>(1957) 156 Cal.App.2d 128, 134 [318 P.2d 828]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Standifer </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 733, 743-744 [113 Cal.Rptr. 653].) Such determination based upon substantial evidence, as here, may not be disturbed on appeal. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Redmond, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 745, 755.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Defendant next contends that since death resulted solely from an act in which he did not participate (arson), the evidence cannot support his conviction for the crime of murder by torture. The record refutes his contention. Expert testimony disclosed that the terminal cardiorespiratory failure was caused by <em>both </em>the inflicted trauma and thermal burning.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Where concurring causes contribute to the fatal result, one may be criminally liable by reason of his own conduct which directly contributes to such result. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1899) 124 Cal. 551, 559 [57 P. 470]; 1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes, \u00a7\u00a7 80, 82, pp. 80-82.) Defendant\u2019s participation in the brutal beating inflicted by Atkins during the course of the burglary and robbery clearly established his equal culpability for the resulting death due to combined causes.  Evidence of repeated beating of the victim with the intention of inflicting grievous pain and suffering for purposes of extortion (of money) constitutes murder by torture. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turville </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 620, 632 [335 P.2d 678] [disapproved on other grounds, <em>People </em>v. <em>Morse </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 631, 649 (36 Cal.Rptr. 201, 388 P.2d 33, 12 A.L.R.3d 810)]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Daugherty </em>(1953) 40 Cal.2d 876, 886 [256 P.2d 911]; accord <em>People </em>v. <em>Wiley </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 162, 168, 173 [133 Cal.Rptr. 135, 554 P.2d 881].)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Moreover, the evidence supported the first degree murder conviction not only on a theory of murder by torture but also under the felony-murder doctrine (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 189), a theory likewise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>advanced by the prosecution and upon which the jury was instructed. Any unlawful killing, intentional or otherwise, committed in the perpetration of robbery or burglary for the intended purpose of theft constitutes the crime of first degree murder. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Burton </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 375, 387-388 [99 Cal.Rptr. 1, 491 P.2d 793]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ireland </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 522, 538 [75 Cal.Rptr. 188, 450 P.2d 580, 40 A.L.R.3d 1323]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Turville, supra, </em>51 Cal.2d 620, 631-632.) The record persuasively demonstrates that the victim was killed during the course of the robbery as a part of a continuing criminal transaction; the jury\u2019s implied finding that the killing occurred during and before completion of the crime of robbery is amply supported by the evidence justifying a guilty verdict under the felony-murder rule. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Manson </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 102, 207-209 [132 Cal.Rptr. 265] [cert, den., 430 U.S. 986 (52 L.Ed.2d 382, 97 S.Ct. 1686)]; see also 1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1978 supp.) \u00a7 312, pp. <em>292-298passim.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Defendant\u2019s parallel contention that his conviction of murder by torture with intent to kill is unsupported by the evidence and contrary to law is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\"> Although a specific intent to kill is not required in order to prove first degree murder by torture <em>(People </em>v. <em>Steger </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 539, 546 [128 Cal.Rptr. 161, 546 P.2d 665, 83 A.L.R.3d 1206]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mattison </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 177, 183 [93 Cal.Rptr. 185, 481 P.2d 193]), such state of mind must be proved in order to invoke the greater penalty of life imprisonment without possibility of parole then mandated by the statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Herein, the jury was properly instructed on the principles of first degree murder by torture<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as approved by our highest court (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Wiley, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 162, 168, 173, and fn. 4; <em>People </em>v. <em>Steger, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 546) and also on the necessity to find a specific intent to kill in conjunction with the \u201ctorture clause\u201d allegation<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> bearing upon the issue of greater punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Defendant strenuously argues that the enhanced punishment of life imprisonment without parole requires a finding that the defendant <em>personally </em>committed the torturous conduct with the necessary homicidal intent. While we are aware of no authority squarely on point, the logic of defendant\u2019s argument by analogy is compelling. Typically, penal provisions imposing added punishment do not purport to define a criminal offense but simply relate to the penalty to be imposed under certain circumstances. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 232, 242-243 [133 Cal.Rptr. 520, 555 P.2d 306]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Strickland </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 946, 961 [114 Cal.Rptr. 632, 523 P.2d 672] [enhancement due to personal use of a firearm during commission of any enumerated felony].)  Any reasonable doubt as to the meaning of a penal statute must be construed favorably to the defendant as appears reasonable. <em>(Keeler </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 619, 631 [87 Cal.Rptr. 481, 470 P.2d 617, 40 A.L.R.3d 420].)  Under the 1976 amendment to former section 190 (Stats. 1976, ch. 1124, \u00a7 1; see also Stats. 1976, ch. 1139, \u00a7 133) the Legislature, in denying eligibility for parole to those convicted of first degree murder by means of torture with intent to kill, in effect enhanced the penalty of life imprisonment otherwise provided.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In light of our analysis, a defendant could not be subjected to such additional punishment on a theory of derivative liability but must have <em>actually committed </em>the proscribed conduct <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 232, 241-242) with the necessary animus. Such conclusion is fortified by the Legislature\u2019s subsequent action in deleting that special penalty provision as part of its comprehensive revision of the death penalty statutes and incorporating it as an alternative penalty upon charging and proving such murder by torture allegations as a special circumstance. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 190, 190.1, 190.2, subd. (c)(4) added by Stats. 1977, ch. 316, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 7 and 9, effective Aug. 11, 1977, repealed by initiative measure approved Nov. 7, 1978; see new Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(18).)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Our search of the record discloses no substantial evidence of defendant\u2019s actual commission of the torture-murder <em>or </em>in support of the requisite state of mind. Accordingly, the jury\u2019s added finding that the first degree murder conviction was perpetrated by means of torture with intent to kill cannot stand and must be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\n<em>Instructional Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Defendant next complains that the failure of the trial court to submit proffered instructions on proximate cause, supervening cause and conspiracy constituted reversible error. The complaint is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">It is, of course, settled that a trial court must instruct the jury, even without request, on the general principles of law relating to the issues raised by the evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sedeno </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 703, 714 [112 Cal.Rptr. 1, 518 P.2d 913].)  In the case at bench, the court was under a duty to instruct on the issue of proximate causation. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Bernhardt </em>(1963) 222 Cal.App.2d 567, 590-591 [35 Cal.Rptr. 401].) In submitting a standard instruction on proximate cause (CALJIC No. 8.55), the trial court adequately fulfilled that duty and was under no obligation to give further instructions covering the same issue. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Welch </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 106, 119-120 [104 Cal.Rptr. 217, 501 P.2d 225].) Moreover, there was no credible evidence of an independent supervening or superseding cause warranting the requested instruction. (See generally 1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes, \u00a7\u00a7 83-84, p. 82.) As noted, the instruction given provided adequate guidance for the jury in resolving the issue whether defendant\u2019s conduct contributed as a proximate cause of death. Error\u2014if any\u2014resulting from the failure to submit the requested instruction was clearly harmless in light of the uncontradicted evidence that death occurred during the course of the admitted burglary and robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Nor was any duty manifested to submit instructions on conspiracy as requested by defendant. Not only did the prosecution disclaim any theory of uncharged conspiracy, but the defense did not rely on evidence suggesting such a theory. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Carmen </em>(1951) 36 Cal.2d 768, 773 [228 P.2d 281].) Defendant\u2019s unusual argument in requesting such instructions (to show termination of and withdrawal from the completed agreement to commit burglary and robbery before the murder) is fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>answered by the additional instruction given on the prosecution\u2019s theory of aiding and abetting (CALJIC No. 3.02 (1974 rev.)). Thus, the jury was adequately informed that no criminal liability attached where an accomplice notifies the other party \u201cof his intention to withdraw from the commission of the crime and . . . [does] . . . everything in his power to prevent its commission.\u201d Apart from the defendant\u2019s verbal rebuke of Atkins\u2019 contemplated act of arson before leaving the apartment in order to avoid witnessing the murder, no competent evidence was presented tending to suggest a theory of withdrawal or abandonment warranting \u201ccautionary\u201d instructions on conspiracy. In such circumstances, no error is committed in failing to instruct on the law of conspiracy (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1170, 1174 [81 Cal.Rptr. 5, 459 P.2d 259, 39 A.L.R.3d 541]) nor does the dictum found in <em>People </em>v. <em>Joines </em>(1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 259, 268-269 [89 Cal.Rptr. 661], otherwise persuade us.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\n<em>Admission of codefendant\u2019s statements for impeachment; prosecutorial misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Defendant next argues prejudicial error was committed through introduction\u2014over objection\u2014of Atkins\u2019 in-custody statements for purpose of impeachment and in the misuse of such evidence during the prosecutor\u2019s summation to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Defendant\u2019s initial challenge upon constitutional grounds rests upon the assertion that the use of his accomplice\u2019s out-of-court statements inculpating him in the arson and torture-murder deprived him of his right to confrontation and cross-examination resulting in a denial of due process of law. (U.S. Const., 6th and 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15; see <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1973) 410 U.S. 284 [35 L.Ed.2d 297, 93 S.Ct. 1038]; <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 400 [13 L.Ed.2d 923, 85 S.Ct. 1065].) Defendant\u2019s argument is four-fold: (1) the admission of such damaging statements to attack the credibility of Atkins\u2019 statement received in evidence, pursuant to Evidence Code section 1202, violated his Sixth Amendment rights; (2) the trial court\u2019s limiting instructions failed to cure the devastating effect of such evidence; (3) there was no sufficient foundation of \u201cunavailability\u201d and \u201cdue diligence\u201d as required by the relevant statutes (see Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 240, subd. (a)(1), 1202); (4) the evidence should have been excluded under the provisions of Evidence Code section 352. Only the final ground has merit and, coupled with counsel\u2019s misconduct, resulted in prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Evidence of a declarant\u2019s statement inconsistent with his statement received in evidence is admissible for the purpose of impeachment. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1202; <em>Am-Cal Investment Co. </em>v. <em>Sharlyn Estates, Inc. </em>(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 526, 542 [63 Cal.Rptr. 518].) The purpose of the evidentiary rule is one of fairness to the party <em>against whom </em>the hearsay evidence was admitted without opportunity to cross-examine or impeach the unavailable hearsay declarant. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 542; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Beyea </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 176, 193 [113 Cal.Rptr. 254].)  Atkins\u2019 confession to Deloney, which tended to exonerate the defendant of arson and murder by torture, was introduced by the defense as a declaration against penal interest (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1230); the showing of unavailability as a witness was based upon Fifth Amendment considerations due to Atkins\u2019 earlier conviction and pending appeal. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 240, subd. (a)(1).) Under such circumstances, the only means available to the People to attack Atkins\u2019 credibility was through the process of impeachment afforded by the statute. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Marquez </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 993, 998 [152 Cal.Rptr. 200].) Since such evidence was not received for the truth of the matter asserted, no Sixth Amendment guarantees were abridged.9 (Cf. <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Evans </em>(1970) 400 U.S. 74, 88 [27 L.Ed.2d 213, 226-227, 91 S.Ct. 210]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Preston </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 308, 315-316 [107 Cal.Rptr. 300, 508 P.2d 300]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1159, 1164 [80 Cal.Rptr. 920, 459 P.2d 248]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Eaglin </em>(9th Cir. 1977) 571 F.2d 1069, 1078-1081 [cert den., 435 U.S. 906 (55 L.Ed.2d 497, 98 S.Ct. 1453)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Nor does section 1202 require a preliminary showing of unavailablity; it merely permits impeaching evidence without the necessity that the <em>declarant </em>be given an opportunity to explain or deny the inconsistency.  Moreover, it seems specious for defendant to first argue unavailability on grounds of constitutional privilege and thereafter to deny its existence when similarly relied upon by the prosecution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">9We are mindful that a related but different question is presently pending review by the California Supreme Court. (See <em>In re Johnny G., </em>Crim. No. 20519, hg. granted May 18, 1978.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Yet, while such evidence was admissible for the limited purpose intended, its probative value herein was substantially outweighed by its \u201csubstantial danger of undue prejudice . . . [and of] . . . misleading the juiy.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 352.) While we fully recognize the trial court\u2019s broad discretion under that statute, it is not unlimited. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Montgomery </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 718, 730-731 [132 Cal.Rptr. 558].) Not only did such evidence intrinsically possess a high probability to mislead and confuse the juiy to the defendant\u2019s prejudice but the prosecutor consistently compounded that probability for error through his repeated and misleading closing remarks to the jury as to the <em>substantive effect </em>of such limited evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In urging the jury to consider <em>Atkins\u2019 statements in contrast to defendant\u2019s denials </em>in his own confession, the former were forcefully argued as evidence of the truth of the matter stated contrary to their limited probative use. Failure to exclude such evidence because of its demonstrably strong likelihood of misleading the jury constituted an abuse of discretion. Furthermore, the prosecutor\u2019s repeated misstatements of the <em>effect </em>of such evidence constituted misconduct. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Strickland, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 946, 955.)  The combined effect of such error undoubtedly contributed to the jury\u2019s verdict on the arson count upon which the evidence of defendant\u2019s participation was close; under such circumstances, we are not convinced that such error was harmless under either state or federal standards. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Strickland, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 955; <em>People </em>v. <em>Coleman, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1159, 1165.)  But as to the remaining counts, the error was harmless. The evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt in the perpetrated burglary and robbery, during which the killing occurred, was overwhelming; no reasonable possibility or probability exists that a different or more favorable verdict on the murder, burglary or robbeiy charges would have resulted had such error not occurred. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>at p. 24 [17 L.Ed.2d at pp. <em>710-711]; People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>In view of our decisions above, it is unnecessary to discuss the remaining issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Judgment of conviction of arson is reversed.
