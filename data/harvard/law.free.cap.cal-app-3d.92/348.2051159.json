J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeZZ\">Jacqueline Asvitt, the former wife of the decedent, Clyde J. Asvitt, appeals from a judgment decreeing that pursuant to their property settlement on dissolution, she and the testator held the family home as tenants in common and not as joint tenants and, therefore, his interest in the home passed to Florisca M. Gangamie, an unrelated person who was the sole beneficiary and named executrix of his will. The former wife contends that: 1) there was no proof of intent to sever joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>tenancy in the family home; 2) the presumption of joint tenancy was not rebutted; and 3) the joint tenancy could not be terminated by the subsequent property settlement agreement on dissolution. For the reasons set forth below, we have concluded that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The record reveals the following pertinent facts: Jacqueline and Clyde were married in 1953; their two children, David and Darcy, were bom in 1955 and 1957, respectively. The family home at 1850 Vining Drive, San Leandro was acquired in joint tenancy by a grant deed dated January 24, 1957. The interlocutory decree of dissolution dated 1971 became final in 1972. The parties executed a property settlement agreement, which was incorporated into the decree of dissolution. The pertinent portions of the property settlement agreement are set forth below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In 1974, Clyde executed a will naming the children who were then 16 and 18, respectively. The will further provided, so far as pertinent, as set forth below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After Clyde\u2019s death, his will was admitted to probate on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>February 17, 1977. On September 6, 1977, Jacqueline filed a petition alleging that pursuant to article Fourth of the will, quoted below at footnote 2, as the surviving joint tenant, she was entitled to the family home. Her petition also set forth an April 28, 1976, order denying Clyde\u2019s motion to force the sale of the family home after the youngest child reached 18 and modifying the decree of dissolution, as set forth below.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">In December 1977, the court in the instant matter found that the intent of the decedent and his former wife was to hold the family home as tenants in common as a direct result of their property settlement agreement on dissolution and entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">As the former wife correctly contends, we review the entire cause to determine whether it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of error <em>(Downing </em>v. <em>Barrett Mobile Home Transport, Inc., </em>38 Cal.App.3d 519, 525 [113 Cal.Rptr. 277]; <em>Aldabe </em>v. <em>Aldabe, </em>209 Cal.App.2d 453, 457 [26 Cal.Rptr. 208]; <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>Easter, </em>203 Cal.App.2d 845, 858 [21 Cal.Rptr. 905]; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Atchison T. &amp; S.F. Railway, </em>162 Cal.App.2d 818, 823 [329 P.2d 75]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>46 Cal.2d 818 [299 P.2d 243]).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">A joint tenancy may be terminated either by mutual agreement between the parties or by any conduct or course of dealings sufficient to indicate that all parties have mutually treated the joint tenancy as terminated <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>29 Cal.App.3d 616, 621 [106 Cal.Rptr. 52]; <em>Hiltbrand </em>v. <em>Hiltbrand, </em>13 Cal.App.2d 330, 333 [56 P.2d 1292]). An agreement between the tenants which while it does not expressly terminate the tenancy, is inconsistent by its terms with one or more of the four essential unities of a joint tenancy, will also be adjudged to be a severance thereof. Thus, interference with the right of survivorship by the terms of an agreement will sever the joint tenancy relationship <em>(Wardlow </em>v. <em>Pozzi, </em>170 Cal.App.2d 208, 210 [338 P.2d 564]).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Contrary to the former wife\u2019s argument, <em>Wardlow, supra, </em>supports the trial court\u2019s judgment in the instant case. In <em>Wardlow, </em>the husband and wife were the joint tenancy owners of land under lease to a third party. In the property settlement agreement attending their divorce action, they agreed that \u201c \u2018... each of the parties shall have the option to purchase the other\u2019s one-half interest <em>... or that the said property shall be sold and the net proceeds divided equally between the said </em>parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wardlow, </em>p. 210; (italics added.) As the agreement had not been executed at the time the husband died, the question of whether the agreement terminated the joint tenancy was raised in subsequent litigation and resolved as follows by the appellate court: \u201cThus, prior to the agreement, neither party had an absolute right to purchase from the other, nor did either have the right to insist that the property be sold and the proceeds divided. Hence by the agreement they surrendered some of those rights; that is, each was bound <em>to </em>sell to the other or both to a third party. And certainly <em>the right of either party to insist upon a sale ... to .. . the other . . . was wholly inconsistent with the continuance of the joint tenancy relationship. Likewise such a provision would appear to negate any intent of the survivor to succeed to the other\u2019s interest\u201d (Wardlow, supra, </em>pp. 210-211). (Italics added.)  Similarly here, the joint tenancy created by the grant deed executed by the parties on January 24, 1957, was effectively destroyed by the subsequent 1971 property settlement agreement which provided that the family home \u201cwill be sold\u201d on occurrence of one of three stated conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Nevertheless, relying on <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Suhy,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>378 Ill. 104 [37 N.Ed.2d 826], and <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>81 Cal.App.2d 61 [183 P.2d 61], the former wife argues that a joint tenancy cannot be severed by a property settlement agreement. In <em>Miranda, </em>as in the Illinois case, <em>supra, </em>the agreement there in issue provided that the property \u201c \u2018. . . shall remain in the name of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>parties hereto as joint tenancy, <em>so long as </em>the first party does not remarry and <em>so long as </em>said property is kept by first party as a home for herself and the children. . .\u2019 \u201d (Italics added; <em>Miranda, supra, </em>p. 65). The phrase \u201cso long as\u201d bespeaks a condition subsequent, while the language of the property settlement agreement in the instant case unconditionally provided that the family home <em>\u201cwill be sold upon \u201d </em>the happening of any one of three specifically named events: the remarriage of the former wife, majority of the younger child, or the mutual agreement of the parties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, by the property settlement agreement incorporated into the dissolution agreement, the parties terminated a joint tenancy. An agreement to sever operates to effect a severance, and the intervening death of one of the joint tenants will not defeat the severance even though the agreement is not performed (cf. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>at pp. 714-715). The former wife argues that there is insufficient indication of an intent to terminate the joint tenancy, as article Fourth of the subsequently executed 1974 will specifically referred to joint tenancy property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, Clyde\u2019s subsequent attempt to force a sale of the home in 1976 when the youngest child reached 18, clearly indicates that he regarded the family home as community property. The trial court properly and reasonably construed paragraph 10 of the property settlement agreement (quoted above at fn. 2) pertaining to the sale of the home as one intended to permit the wife and minor children to remain in the family home until one of the three specified conditions occurred. This interpretation is also supported by paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of the agreement quoted above at footnote 1 on page 350, which indicate that the agreement was to settle all of the property rights of the parties, as well as paragraph 13 of the property settlement agreement (pertaining to custody), which expressly refers to the parties\u2019 love and affection for their children and concern for the best interest of their children. Thus, the language of the property settlement agreement and the subsequent conduct of the parties fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the joint tenancy was terminated at the time of the dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">In any event, pursuant to the modification of the property settlement agreement, during the pendency of this appeal the youngest child of the parties reached the age of majority on August 24, 1978<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (1957 + 21), a matter of which we may take judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Kane, J., and Miller, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u201c2.

In <em>Teutenberg </em>v. <em>Schiller, </em>138 Cal.App.2d 18, 22 [291 P.2d 53], there was no agreement as to a settlement of the property rights of the parties, and the court held that the mere filing of a partition action did not sever a joint tenancy, and that termination of a joint tenancy is effectuated only by final judgment. The instant record indicates that a final judgment of dissolution of marriage, incorporating the property settlement agreement was entered on May 18, 1972, and was modified in 1976, as indicated above at footnote 3 on page 351. In <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Morley, </em>15 Cal.2d 409 [101 P.2d 690, 129 A.L.R. 810], the property settlement agreement provided that the property shall \u201c \u2018be and remain in Joint Tenancy, <em>as it now stands, until such property can be sold. </em>.
