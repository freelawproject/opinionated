The court therein specifically found that Landlord had breached the warranty of habitability, that his \u201cdominant purpose\u201d in seeking to evict Tenant was retaliation for her complaints about said breach to Landlord and to the county health services department, and that as an offset for damages suffered from this breach, Tenant was not obligated to pay rent for the month of August.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">On September 8, 1977, seven days after the first judgment, Landlord served Tenant with a thirty-day notice to quit. Tenant\u2019s tender of rent for the month of September was refused. On October 12, 1977, the new unlawful detainer complaint in this action was filed. Neither the 30-day notice nor the complaint stated any ground upon which Landlord, in good faith, sought to recover possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">Tenant demurred to the complaint on the ground that (taking judicial notice of the prior finding) \u201c[b]ased on [Civil Code]<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> Sec. 1942.5(a)(4)<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>and public policy behind it, [Landlord] is precluded from evicting [Tenant] for 60 days from the date of the judgment handed down on September 1, 1977, unless he pleads the grounds upon which he, in good faith, seeks to recover possession, pursuant to California Civil Code section 1942.5(d).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Landlord filed points and authorities in opposition, asserting, \u201cThe subject Code Section does not prohibit the serving of a notice, does not prohibit the filing of a lawsuit, but, if anything at all, prohibits the recovery of possession in an action or proceeding within the 60-day period,\u201d and pointing out that the 60-day period would expire before the matter came to trial. On November 7, the court overruled the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Tenant\u2019s answer, filed November 8, raised affirmative defenses of breach of the warranty of habitability and of retaliatory eviction in violation of section 1942.5 and \u201ccase law.\u201d A court trial was held November 30. As the engrossed statement on appeal states: \u201c[Tenant] objected to any evidence regarding good cause to evict on the grounds that Civ. Code \u00a7 1942.5(d) precludes evidence of good cause to rebut a claim of retaliatory eviction unless the facts alleged constituting good cause were first in the 30 (or 3) day notice and pleaded in [Landlord\u2019s] complaint, which had not been done here. This objection was overruled on the grounds that Civ. Code \u00a7 1942.5(a) allows a landlord to give notice within sixty days and only prevents the court from awarding possession to [Landlord] within said period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Thereafter, Landlord presented evidence that Tenant\u2019s pets created a nuisance of which other tenants complained.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">At the end of Landlord\u2019s case, Tenant moved for judgment (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 631.8) in her favor on the ground that Landlord\u2019s action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>constituted a per se retaliatory eviction \u201cin violation of Civil Code \u00a7 1942.5 and of common law rule against retaliatory eviction announced in <em>Schweiger </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>[(1970) 3 Cal.3d 507 (90 Cal.Rptr. 729, 476 P.2d 97)].\u201d The motion was denied. Tenant then testified in her own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">No findings of fact were requested or made.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On December 6, 1977, the court entered judgment for Landlord awarding him $371 and restitution of the premises. On December 22, 1977, Tenant filed her notice of appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Tenant\u2019s engrossed settled statement was filed February 28, 1978. No objection thereto was made by Landlord and on July 25, 1978, it was settled as filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">One month after the judgment was entered, Tenant vacated the premises and Landlord filed a complete satisfaction of judgment, though the monetary award was not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\n<em>Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Tenant contends that (1) the appeal should not be dismissed as moot, and (2) the judgment must be reversed because section 1942.5, subdivision (a), prohibits serving eviction notices during the 60-day period unless they meet the requirements of subdivision (d) thereof by stating the ground upon which the lessor, in good faith, seeks to recover possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Landlord contends that (1) the appeal should be dismissed as moot, and (2) section 1942.5, subdivision (a), prohibits only the actual entry of judgment evicting the tenant within the 60-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">\n<em>Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">Since the construction of the retaliatory eviction statute<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is a recurring issue, we decline to dismiss the appeal, though it is moot. In view of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>prior judgment and finding, retaliation must be deemed the dominant purpose of Landlord in attempting to terminate the tenancy. The 60-day provision of section 1942.5 is therefore applicable. Landlord\u2019s interpretation that he can serve such a retaliatory notice immediately so long as he does not recover possession within 60 days would substantially frustrate the statutory purpose that \u201cthe lessor may not. . . cause the lessee to quit involuntarily.\u201d On the other hand, the language in the statute does not support Tenant insofar as she claims that the service of a notice within such 60-day period is prohibited even if the resultant termination date falls after the end of the 60-day period. The date of termination of the tenancy is the critical date since the tenant who quits on or after such date does so \u201cinvoluntarily.\u201d The 30-day notice herein resulted in the termination of the tenancy 37 days after the prior judgment. It stated no grounds upon which the lessor, in good faith, sought to recover possession. Therefore, it was ineffective to terminate Tenant\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\n<em>The Appeal Should Not</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AU8\">\n<em>Be Dismissed as Moot</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Preliminarily, we reject Landlord\u2019s contention that the appeal should be dismissed as moot because Tenant has vacated the premises and Landlord has filed a complete satisfaction of judgment.  As our Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fales </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 712, 715-716 [106 Cal.Rptr. 21, 505 P.2d 213]: \u201cIf an action involves a matter of continuing public interest and the issue is likely to recur, a court may exercise an inherent discretion to resolve that issue, even though an event occurring during its pendency would normally render the matter moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">It is evident that the question of the applicability of section 1942.5 \u201cinvolves a matter of continuing public interest\u201d <em>(id, </em>at p. 715) which may evade review because the time periods involved in this statute are relatively short. Furthermore, as in <em>Liberty, </em>\u201cappellate review has been and may continue to be thwarted by the filing of a notice of satisfaction of judgment....\u201d <em>(Id, </em>atp. 716.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">\n<em>Landlord\u2019s Dominant Purpose Was</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AgD\">\n<em>Retaliation Against Tenant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">On September 1, 1977, the municipal court, in the prior unlawful detainer proceeding, made its finding that Landlord\u2019s \u201cdominant purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>in seeking to evict [Tenant] is retaliation against [Tenant] because [Tenant] complained to plaintiff and to the County Health Services Department concerning breach of the warranty of habitability and sought to secure rectification of that breach.\u201d A week later, Landlord served a 30-day notice to quit. Though, as noted by our Supreme Court in <em>Schweiger </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d 507, a landlord\u2019s illegal purpose found to exist one week previously is not deemed to exist \u201cin perpetuity\u201d and may be \u201c \u2018dissipated\u2019 \u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 517), there was no evidence presented in the trial court from which any such dissipation could be inferred here. Considerable evidence was offered tending to impugn Tenant\u2019s desirability as a tenant but no attempt was made to show that any new circumstances arose after the finding in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We, therefore, treat the case as one in which the dominant purpose of Landlord in terminating the tenancy, effective October 8, 1977, was retaliation against Tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\n<em>Termination of the Tenancy \u201cCause[s] the Lessee to Quit Involuntarily\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The full text of the retaliatory eviction statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">\u201c(a) If the lessor has as his dominant purpose retaliation against the lessee because of the exercise by the lessee of his rights under this chapter or because of his complaint to an appropriate governmental agency as to tenantability of a dwelling, and if the lessee of a dwelling is not in default as to the payment of his rent, the lessor may not recover possession of a dwelling in any action or proceeding, cause the lessee to quit involuntarily, increase the rent, or decrease any services, within 60 days:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">\u201c(1) After the date upon which the lessee, in good faith, has given notice pursuant to Section 1942; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">\u201c(2) After the date upon which the lessee, in good faith, has filed a written complaint, with an appropriate governmental agency, of which the lessor has notice, for the purpose of obtaining correction of a condition relating to tenantability; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">\u201c(3) After the date of an inspection or issuance of a citation, resulting from a written complaint described in paragraph (2) of which the lessor did not have notice; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\u201c(4) After entry of judgment or the signing of an arbitration award, if any, when in the judicial proceeding or arbitration the issue of tenantability is determined adversely to the lessor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\">\u201cIn each instance, the 60-day period shall run from the latest applicable date referred to in paragraphs (1) to (4), inclusive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">\u201c(b) A lessee may not invoke the provisions of this section more than once in any 12-month period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">\u201c(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting in any way the exercise by the lessor of his rights under any lease or agreement or any law pertaining to the hiring of property or his right to do any of the acts described in subdivision (a) for any lawful cause. Any waiver by a lessee of his rights under this section shall be void as contrary to public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">\u201c(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions (a) to (c), inclusive, a lessor may recover possession of a dwelling and do any of the other acts described in subdivision (a) within the period or periods prescribed therein if the notice of termination, rent increase, or other act, and any pleading or statement of issues in an arbitration, if any, states the ground upon which the lessor, in good faith, seeks to recover possession, increase rent, or do any of the other acts described in subdivision (a). If such statement be controverted, the lessor shall establish its truth at the trial or other hearing.\u201d (\u00a7 1942.5.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Landlord claims that the section does not impose any limitation upon when he may serve a 30-day notice terminating a month-to-month tenancy so long as the actual judgment evicting the tenant and the recovery of possession do not occur within 60 days of an event specified in subdivisions (a)(1) to (a)(4). Thus, Landlord contends that since Tenant was still in possession of the premises 60 days after the prior judgment was rendered against Landlord on the issue of tenantability, subdivision (a)(4) was not violated. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Section 1942.5 was enacted into law as part of comprehensive landlord-tenant reform legislation. Assembly Bill No. 2033, 1970 Regular Session (Stats. 1970, ch. 1280) amended section 1942 and added sections 1941.1, 1941.2, 1942.1 and 1942.5. This bill, which established the statutory retaliatory eviction defense (\u00a7 1942.5) also specified the conditions which rendered a dwelling \u201cuntenantable\u201d (\u00a7 1941.1), enunciated tenants\u2019 responsibilities (\u00a7 1941.2), clarified tenants\u2019 rights to make repairs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>themselves and deduct the cost from their rent (\u00a7 1942), and prohibited the waiver of tenants\u2019 statutory rights (\u00a7\u00a7 1942.1; 1942.5, subd. (c)). \u201c[A] specific provision should be construed with reference to the entire statutory system of which it is a part, in such a way that the various elements of the overall scheme are harmonized.\u201d <em>(Bowland </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 479, 489 [134 Cal.Rptr. 630, 556 P.2d 1081].) Where, as here, all these provisions were passed on the same day, relate to the same subject matter and indeed were part of the same statute (Stats. 1970, ch. 1280), they are \u201cto be read together, as if parts of the same Act\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1866) 30 Cal. 427, 430; <em>People </em>v. <em>McGuire </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 4 [145 Cal.Rptr. 514]).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Landlord\u2019s interpretation would completely frustrate the obvious intent of this statutory scheme to encourage private initiative to enforce tenantability standards and would make a mockery of the remedies provided by statute. Indeed, it would nullify exercise of the remedy to \u201crepair and deduct.\u201d To illustrate: When section 1942.5 was added to prohibit retaliatory eviction for 60 days after the date upon which a tenant, in good faith, has given \u201cnotice pursuant to Section 1942\u201d (Stats. 1970, ch. 1280, \u00a7 5) of \u201cdilapidations\u201d requiring repair, section 1942 <em>{id., </em>at \u00a7 3) was amended at the same time to provide that if the tenant waits 30 days after notifying the landlord, he is presumed to have waited a \u201creasonable\u201d time so that he can make the repairs himself and deduct up to a month\u2019s rent for the cost. If landlords can immediately serve tenants with 30-day notices to quit upon receiving the tenants\u2019 complaints, tenants cannot effectively use the statutory remedy since as soon as they have the presumed right to make the repairs on the premises, they lose the right to even be on the premises. We cannot ascribe to the Legislature such \u201ca devious legislative intent to render section 1942 ineffective as a protective measure.\u201d <em>(Schweiger </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>3 Cal.3d at p. 513.)  As remedial legislation, section 1942.5 should be liberally construed to effect its objectives and to suppress, not encourage, the mischief at which it was directed. <em>(Buchwald </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 347, 354 [62 Cal.Rptr. 364].)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">In addition, it is a cardinal rule of construction that eveiy word of the statute is presumably intended to have some meaning and that \u201c \u2018a construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224].) Where there are several provisions or particulars, the construction should, if possible, give effect to all. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858.) Subdivision (a) of section 1942.5 provides that the lessor may not \u201crecover possession\u201d or \u201ccause the lessee to quit involuntarily.\u201d Land<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>lord\u2019s claim that the statute is not violated so long as possession is not recovered by judgment within 60 days would render the latter provision \u201ccause ... to quit involuntarily\u201d mere surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">On the other hand, though we agree with Tenant that Landlord cannot immediately serve a retaliatory 30-day notice to quit, we disagree with Tenant insofar as she claims the service of a notice within that 60-day period is prohibited even if the expiration date falls after the end of that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The language of the statute does not support such a claim. The notice to quit does not immediately \u201ccause the lessee to quit involuntarily\u201d (\u00a7 1942.5, subd. (a)). It is only a \u201cnotice of the intention to terminate\u201d (\u00a7 1946). As we stated in <em>Nicolaysen </em>v. <em>Pacific Home </em>(1944) 65 Cal.App.2d 769, 773 [151 P.2d 567], \u201cThe tenancy is not terminated upon the giving of the notice but upon the expiration of the period therein specified....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Moreover, if the Legislature had wanted to prohibit notices per se, it could easily have done so explicitly. (See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 186, \u00a7 18 (Supp. 1975); Minn. Stats. Ann., \u00a7 566.03 (Supp. 1975-76). Elsewhere in section 1942.5 the Legislature expressly refers to \u201cnotice of termination\u201d (subd. (d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Nor does the legislative history support Tenant\u2019s interpretation of the statute. She has provided us with a declaration by Pete Wilson, the author of Assembly Bill No. 2033, in which he stated that he \u201cmeant to give tenants a 60-day period of respite in which they could not be bothered in any way by their landlords except for good cause,\u201d and that this included suffering a \u201cnotice to quit.\u201d  The understanding of former Assemblyman Wilson does not per se expose the Legislature\u2019s intent in the passage of the final bill. \u201cIn construing a statute we do not consider the motives or understandings of individual legislators who cast their votes in favor of it. <em>(In re Lavine </em>(1935) 2 Cal.2d 324, 327 [41 P.2d 161, 42 P.2d 311]; <em>Bragg </em>v. <em>City of Auburn </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 50, 54 [61 Cal.Rptr. 284].) Nor do we carve an exception to this principle simply because the legislator whose motives are proferred actually authored the bill in controversy. <em>(Epstein </em>v. <em>Resor </em>(N.D.Cal., 1969) 296 F.Supp. 214, 216); no guarantee can issue that those who supported his proposal shared his view of its compass.\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Bouquet </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 583, 589-590 [128 Cal.Rptr. 427, 546 P.2d 1371]; see also <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 127, 135 [137 Cal.Rptr. 834].)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>We recognize that the expression of the individual intent of the author of the bill, even though noncontemporaneous, can have some weight because \u201che is the one who normally presents the bill for consideration at all legislative committee hearings and on the floor of his own house.\u201d <em>(Campbell </em>v. <em>Board of Dental Examiners </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 283, 286 [125 Cal.Rptr. 694].) Here, however, the language in subdivision (a) was substantially changed after it had passed the Assembly and had gone to the Senate. Whereas the bill originally had provided that, among other things, the lessor could not \u201cdemand an increase in rent\u201d within the 60-day period, the Senate amended it on August 6, 1970, to provide that the lessor could not \u201cincrease the rent\u201d during that period.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We have been unable to find any legislative history which purports to explain this modification made by the Senate. It is, however, apparent that by changing the wording from prohibiting a \u201cdemand\u201d for an increase to prohibiting only the actual \u201cincrease\u201d itself, the Legislature was specifically rejecting the view that the service of notice was, per se, a prohibited act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Though we realize that the statute\u2019s effectiveness to protect tenants\u2019 exercise of their statutory rights and promote better housing conditions by private enforcement of \u201ctenantability\u201d standards is severely limited by its failure to give tenants a more realistic<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> period of respite, we cannot \u201cunder the guise of construction, rewrite a statute.\u201d <em>(Mount Vernon Memorial Park </em>v. <em>Board of Funeral Directors &amp; Embalmers </em>(1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 874, 885 [145 Cal.Rptr. 275].)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The event which \u201ccauses the lessee to quit involuntarily\u201d is not the initial service of the notice but the termination of the tenancy by the expiration of the notice. The tenant who quits on or after that date does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>so \u201cinvoluntarily.\u201d The tenant no longer has a right to remain on the premises (\u00a7 1946; <em>Nicolaysen </em>v. <em>Pacific Home, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.2d at p. 773) and must vacate or incur the risk of being found guilty of unlawful detainer and assessed treble damages (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1174).  Since the termination of the tenancy \u201ccausefs] the lessee to quit involuntarily\u201d or suffer detrimental consequences, a landlord cannot serve a retaliatory notice which expires within the 60-day period. Landlord herein served such a notice which resulted in the termination of the tenancy 37 days after the prior judgment adverse to Landlord. The termination of the tenancy violated section 1942.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Klein, P.

The California Supreme Court has left open the question whether the common law retaliatory eviction defense announced in <em>Schweiger </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number><em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 507 [90 Cal.Rptr. 729, 476 P.2d 97], is preempted by or supplements the section 1942.5 defense. (See <em>S. P. Growers Assn. </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 719, 729, fn. 4 [131 Cal.Rptr. 761, 552 P.2d 721]; cf. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 616, 620, 631 [111 Cal.Rptr. 704, 517 P.2d 1168].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\">As introduced by its author, Assemblyman Wilson, on April 1, 1970, the bill originally provided: \u201cNo action or proceeding to recover possession of a dwelling unit may be maintained against a lessee, nor shall a lessor otherwise cause his lessee to quit a dwelling unit involuntarily, nor demand an increase in rent from such lessee, nor decrease the services to which the lessee has been entitled, within 60 days . . ..\u201d (Assem. Bill No. 2033 (1970 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 4.) The bill passed the Assembly with essentially this same language. It was amended in the Senate on August 6, 1970, to provide that \u201cthe lessor may not recover possession of a dwelling in any action or proceeding, cause the lessee to quit involuntarily, increase the rent, or decrease any services, within 60 days . . . .\u201d (Assem. Bill, No. 2033 (1970 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 5.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\">A demand for an increase in rent must be made by written notice (\u00a7 827). The notice requirements for changing the terms of a tenancy (such as increasing rent) and terminating the tenancy are the same. (Compare \u00a7 827 with \u00a7 1946.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b277-9\">See, for example, section 2-407 of the Model Residential Landlord-Tenant Code (American Bar Foundation, Tent. Draft, 1969) which absolutely prohibits retaliatory evictions for six months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
