Dinkins. The judgment, entered upon the jury\u2019s special verdicts, awarded plaintiff (1) $1,000\u2014the face amount of the subject insurance policy; (2) $25,000\u2014as damages for emotional and mental distress; and (3) $25,000\u2014in punitive damages. The judgment further reflected the jury\u2019s special finding exonerating defendant from allegations of fraud and also included an award to plaintiff of $2,750 for attorney fees, that award pursuant to a stipulation that the trial judge would determine whether attorney fees were to be awarded and, if so, the reasonable amount thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">The policy in question was a family life policy naming as insureds plaintiff and five of his eleven children, including his daughter Glinda Ann. The policy provided for payment to plaintiff in the amount of $1,000 upon Glinda Ann\u2019s death. Glenda Ann died of gunshot wounds during the contestable period of the policy term. Plaintiff\u2019s claim on the policy was denied, the company contending it was entitled to rescind the policy because of concealment or misrepresentation of material fact by plaintiff with respect to the state of Glinda Ann\u2019s health at the time the policy application was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">Plaintiff George Dinkins, approximately 50 years of age, had been a scrap dealer since 1963. In addition to his earnings from that occupation, his only other income was a government disability pension received because of injuries incurred in the service. He had fathered eleven children, and in May 1974, the time of application for the subject insurance policy, six or seven of them were living with him. Five were under the age of eighteen, and thus qualified for coverage under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>children\u2019s term rider offered by defendant. The premium for the policy insuring the life of plaintiff for $3,000 was $13.63 a month. The additional premium for the children\u2019s term rider was $1 per month. The policy was issued June 5, 1974, and was based on an application signed by plaintiff on May 2, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The application around which this dispute centers was completed in the course of at least two meetings between plaintiff and various of defendant\u2019s agents. Mrs. Wilma Salamone, the agent of defendant who signed plaintiff\u2019s application form as witness and soliciting agent, testified that the information on the form had been previously written in by defendant\u2019s agent Leonard Palaca. On May 2, 1974, when she went to plaintiff\u2019s home with John Carmichael, another agent, Carmichael handed her the virtually complete application for her to finish, have signed, and witness. The application had not yet been signed by plaintiff nor accepted by defendant\u2019s agent because plaintiff did not earlier have money for the premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Questions 19 through 22 of the application deal with the medical history and health of the proposed insureds under the policy. Question 19 specifically asked whether any proposed insured [had]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">\u201c(a) Any abnormality, deformity, disease or disorder, or is any proposed insured presently receiving treatment or taking medicine of any kind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">\u201c(b) Ever had a surgical operation or been advised to have an operation which was not performed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">\u201c(c) Ever made claim for or received any insurance benefit, compensation or pension, governmental or otherwise, on account of an injury or sickness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">\u201c(d) Ever had an x-ray, electrocardiogram, blood or urine test, or other laboratory tests? If \u2018Yes\u2019, state why, when, where and by whom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">\u201c(e) Any impairment of sight or hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-11\">\u201c(f) Ever been under observation or treatment in any hospital, sanitarium, clinic or rest home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-12\">\u201c(g) Ever received treatment or joined an organization for alcoholism or drug addiction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>\u201c(h) Ever, for physical or mental reason, been rejected or discharged from any branch of military service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">\u201c(i) Ever had or been treated for high or low blood pressure, chest pain or for sugar in the urine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201c(j) Consulted or been treated or examined by any physician or practitioner for any cause not previously mentioned in the application?\u201d The completed application contains a negative response to every subsection of question 19.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The testimony of those of defendant\u2019s agents involved in the elicitation of answers for the application was uniformly to the effect that plaintiff was specifically asked every question with respect to each proposed insured, and that his answer to each question was an unqualified negative. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony, on the other hand, is riddled with inconsistencies and contradictions. On direct examination plaintiff testified that he was not told that the health questions were to be answered with reference to each of the proposed insureds. He testified, however, that he asked Mr. Carmichael, the agent present at that time, whether Glinda would have to have a physical because she had been in the hospital for the birth of her two children, and was told that it would be unnecessary since she was under the age of eighteen. He further stated that with respect to his own health, he told Carmichael he had just had an operation to remove a cyst and was receiving a government disability pension. The application form signed by him reflects none of the information he claimed to have given Carmichael.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">When asked whether he knew that Glinda Ann had been taken to the Sacramento Medical Center emergency room shortly before the time of application, plaintiff recalled that his wife mentioned to him that Glinda had had some sort of stomach trouble. On cross-examination, plaintiff denied being asked any questions by defendant\u2019s agents about the health of his children. In an earlier deposition, however, he had stated that he was specifically asked these questions as to each of his children, and had replied that each was in good health. When faced with his deposition testimony he responded that he had been asked about his children\u2019s health, and had answered that only one had been in the hospital\u2014and that was Glinda Ann who was hospitalized for childbirth. He was then asked whether he had said anything about Glinda Ann having been taken to the medical center; his reply was \u201cI couldn\u2019t say what I don\u2019t know.\u201d Upon being asked whether that meant he had disclosed that Glinda Ann <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>had been seen in the emergency room, he replied \u201cIf they asked that question, I told them.\u201d He was then asked specifically whether he had told anyone of Glinda Ann\u2019s visit to the hospital. He again replied that if they asked him he had told them, and when the question once again was put to him, he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">As his cross-examination continued, plaintiff reiterated his earlier statement that he had never been asked health questions with respect to the children. He also retreated somewhat from his earlier testimony that he had told defendant\u2019s agents of <em>his own </em>medical problems, taking the position that he had only told them if they had asked him, and that he couldn\u2019t recall whether he had been asked. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Returning to Glinda Ann\u2019s emergency treatment shortly before the policy application was completed, plaintiff testified at trial that he knew she had been taken to the hospital but understood that there was nothing wrong with her. Again, his deposition testimony was introduced where, in reply to questions about Glinda\u2019s emergency treatment, he stated that he knew she had gone both to Community Hospital and to the medical center in connection with her complaints of dizzy spells. He insisted that he didn\u2019t know that Glinda Ann had been taken to the emergency room 3 times in a period of less than 24 hours, but admitted that his wife had told him Glinda Ann was sick and that she had taken her to the hospital around midnight. He testified that he talked to the doctor the day after she was taken to the hospital and was told nothing was wrong with Glinda Ann.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Continuing on the subject of Glinda Aim, on further cross-examination, he did know that she had been taken to the hospital from juvenile \u25a0 hall on one occasion, possibly in early 1974, because of stomach trouble. He reiterated his awareness that his wife\u2019s trip to the medical center with Glinda Ann involved dizzy spells. The stomach pains previously referred to, he later stated, related to the juvenile hall episode rather than the midnight hospital visit. When specifically asked whether he disclosed to anybody that Glinda Ann had been taken to the hospital in 1974 because of stomach problems, he replied, \u201cMaybe I said that. I\u2019m not for sure.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>When pressed further, he replied that he \u201cprobably\u201d made that statement. Further attempts by counsel to clarify plaintiff\u2019s testimony reveal that if he had told anyone of hospital treatment of Glinda Ann, it could only have been with reference to her two childbirth confinements.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Because of the policy amount and plaintiff\u2019s age, defendant\u2019s rules required that plaintiff have a medical examination. At defendant\u2019s request, a biomedical technician visited plaintiff, examined him and questioned him concerning his medical history. In addition to his medical history, plaintiff informed the technician also of his disability pension from the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In connection with the information about Glinda Ann\u2019s two childbirths, not reflected on the policy application for the policy presently in issue, defendant\u2019s agents had available to them a computerized \u201clife register\u201d record which, had it been checked, would have revealed policies earlier issued by the company to Glinda Ann. The applications for those policies disclosed at least one childbirth confinement. Defendant does not contend that confinement for normal childbirth would have affected Glinda Ann\u2019s insurability.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">After Glinda Ann\u2019s death, plaintiff submitted a claim for the policy proceeds. This form, in evidence at trial, reveals that he answered \u201cnone\u201d to a question which called for the \u201c[n]ames and addresses of all physicians or practitioners who attended or prescribed for the deceased and all hospitals and institutions where [she] was treated during last illness and during the five years prior thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Defendant requested an investigation by the Retail Credit Company in Sacramento of any medical history relating to Glinda Ann. Records of the Sacramento Medical Center establish that Glinda Ann was received for emergency treatment 3 times in less than 24 hours in late March 1974. She complained at that time of extreme drowsiness and \u201cfalling out spells.\u201d The information given was that she would slump over and become unresponsive for several minutes and that she suffered incontinence and cyanosis at those times. A tentative diagnosis was made of a possible seizure disorder. The treating physicians ordered an electroencephalogram to be taken to evaluate the possible seizure condition. As far as the records show, Glinda Ann never submitted to the EEG that had been ordered and no further diagnosis was made with respect to the suspected disorder. Her medical records show many other visits for apparently unrelated conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>John Hathorn, defendant\u2019s underwriter, called by plaintiff as an adverse witness, testified that an underwriter would have legitimate concern about fainting and dizzy spells, and moreover, would find Glinda Ann unsuitable for insurance under the family term rider pending satisfactory resolution of the doubt created by the tentative diagnosis. An expert witness called by defendant, retired Cal-West Insurance Company underwriter Walter Kennedy, testified that any underwriter who reviewed Glinda Ann\u2019s medical records would decline to issue her life insurance coverage until the questions raised by her medical records were definitively resolved. No evidence was presented to contradict the testimony that coverage would have been denied Glinda Ann under the family term rider had her March 1974 medical history been disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Defendant contends on appeal that; (1) the award of the policy benefit to plaintiff was fatally infected by errors in the court\u2019s instructions; (2) the award of compensatory damages for emotional distress caused by defendant\u2019s breach of the implied covenant of good faith must be reversed because of insufficiency of the evidence and because of the absence of any authority for recovery of such damages where the insurance policy is one providing a lump sum death benefit; (3) the evidence is insufficient to support the award of punitive damages; and (4) no legal authority supports the award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Our review reveals that the court did in fact err in its instructions to the jury on the principal issue in this case, and that those errors were prejudicial in that, inter alia, defendant\u2019s burden of proof was so altered that it was denied a fair trial. Since reversal of the judgment is required on that basis, we reach only defendant\u2019s further claim that the trial court erred in its award of attorney fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Defendant submitted to the court a full set of instructions covering the correlative issues of plaintiff\u2019s right to receive the policy proceeds and defendant\u2019s right to withhold such proceeds had a misrepresentation or concealment of material fact occurred. No instructions on the issue of material misrepresentation or concealment were proposed by plaintiff. Rather than using the instructions submitted by defendant, however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>court composed its own instruction on the critical issues. We necessarily set out this omnibus instruction, in its full length:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">\u201cThis action has been brought by George R. Dinkins, Plaintiff, against the American National Insurance Company, Defendant, to recover the proceeds of a policy of life insurance issued by the defendant insurance company on the life of Glinda Ann Dinkins, daughter of the Plaintiff, who was killed October 14, 1974.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">\u201cDefendant contends that George R. Dinkins made <em>material misrepresentations </em>[italics added] in the application for insurance and [that it] thus rightly cancelled the contract of insurance and is relieved of the obligation to pay the benefits of the policy upon the return of the premiums paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">\u201cThe first determination you must make is whether there was a <em>material misrepresentation </em>[italics added] by the plaintiff, George R. Dinkins, in the application for life insurance. It is the burden of the defendant American National Insurance Company to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the application contained a <em>misrepresentation </em>[italics added] of a material fact which misled the insurer in accepting the risk of insuring the life of the deceased, Glinda Ann Dinkins.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">\u201cAn insurer has the right to know all that an applicant knows regarding the state of the proposed insureds\u2019 health and medical history.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\">\u201cMaterial misrepresentation <em>and/or </em>[italics added] concealment of such facts are grounds for cancellation of the policy and an actual intent to deceive need not be shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-10\">\u201cMateriality is determined solely by the probable and reasonable effect which truthful answers would have had on the insurer in forming its estimate of the disadvantages of the proposed contract or in making its inquiries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-11\">\u201cThe fact that the insurer has demanded answers to specific questions in an application for insurance is, in itself, usually sufficient to establish materiality as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-12\">\u201cHowever, if an applicant for insurance had no <em>present </em>knowledge of the facts sought or failed to appreciate the significance of information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>related to him, his incorrect or incomplete responses would not constitute grounds for cancellation of the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\">\u201cMoreover, questions concerning illnesses or disease do not relate to minor indispositions but are to be construed as relating to serious ailments which undermine the general health.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">\u201cAn applicant for insurance, except in answer to the questions of the insurance company, is not bound to communicate information which the insurance company knows or information which, in the exercise of ordinary care, the insurance company ought to know and of which the applicant has no reason to suspect the insurance company of being ignorant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201cThe right to information of material facts may be waived by the insurance company by its neglect in making inquiries as to such facts where they are distinctly implied in other facts of which information is communicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">\u201cIf such distinct implication does not exist, there will be no waiver by the insurer in not making further inquiry. A waiver of a misstatement also occurs if an insurer had at its disposal the source from which it could obtain the material information which it later claimed was withheld from it and it made no investigation before issuing the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">\u201cSince the <em>misrepresentation </em>[italics added] must be a material one, an incorrect answer on an insurance application does not allow cancellation of the policy by the insurer where the true facts, if known, would not have made the contract less desirable to the insurer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">\u201cYou are not required to believe either the postmortem testimony of the insurance company\u2019s employees that insurance would have been refused had the true facts been disclosed, or the postmortem testimony of the party seeking recovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">\u201cThe fact that death resulted from a cause unrelated to a <em>material misrepresentation </em>[italics added] has no effect on the right of the insurance company to cancel the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-11\">\u201cIf you find that defendant American National Insurance Company improperly cancelled the policy, it is liable for $1,000 to the plaintiff George R. Dinkins.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>\u201cIf, and only if, you determine that there was improper cancellation of the policy, you may then consider whether defendant American National Insurance Company acted unreasonably and in bad faith in withholding payment of the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">\u201cIn every insurance contract there is an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Accordingly, when the insurer unreasonably and in bad faith withholds payment of the claim of the insured, it is not liable not only for the amount of the policy, but for pecuniary loss and, if such existed, also for the consequential emotional and mental distress suffered by the insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201cWith respect to this issue, plaintiff has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence as contrasted to the issue of <em>material misrepresentation </em>[italics added] where the burden of proof must be carried by the defendant insurance company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Comparison of the court\u2019s instruction with those proposed by defendant and with the authorities which support defendant\u2019s proposed instructions discloses that the court virtually omitted from the case the issue of <em>concealment </em>on the part of plaintiff. Instead, the court\u2019s instruction\u2014read in its entirety\u2014placed upon defendant the burden to prove an <em>affirmative misrepresentation </em>by plaintiff.  The law, on the other hand, permits rescission of an insurance contract where the insured has simply negligently or inadvertently failed to reveal certain facts which, if known to the insurer, would have caused it to refuse to issue the policy in question. (See, e.g., Deering\u2019s Ann. Ins. Code (1976 ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 331, 359, and cases cited therein.)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The reference in the fifth paragraph of the court\u2019s instruction to \u201cmaterial misrepresentation and/or concealment\u201d does not cure the error of which defendant complains. The use of \u201cand/or\u201d gives rise to multiple meanings; specifically, it can mean either or it can mean both. <em>(Powers Farms </em>v. <em>Consolidated Irr. Dist. </em>(1941) 19 Cal.2d 123, 128 [119 P.2d 717]; Webster\u2019s Third New Intenat. Dict. (1969) p. 80.)  Misrepresentation and concealment are not synonymous. If they were, there would be no reason for the Legislature to treat them separately. (See <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 104, 111-112 [65 Cal.Rptr. 315, 436 P.2d 315]; <em>Disabled &amp; Blind Action Committee of Cal. </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1974) 44 Cal.App.3d 74, 79 [118 Cal.Rptr. 536].) In Insurance Code sections 330 through 339, the Legislature deals with concealment as intentional, unintentional, or merely negligent\u2014each type of conceal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>ment having a different effect. In sections 350 through 361 of that code, the Legislature deals separately with representations and the effect of their falsity upon a party\u2019s right to rescind.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Moreover, California courts have consistently treated misrepresentation and concealment as distinct alternative defenses in the context of insurance coverage. (See <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Occidental Life Ins. Co. </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 904, 916 [109 Cal.Rptr. 473, 513 P.2d 353]; <em>Telford v. New Life Ins. Co. </em>(1937) 9 Cal.2d 103, 105 [69 P.2d 835].) In the case at bench, the court\u2019s failure to relate to the jury the possible alternate bases for defendant\u2019s refusal to pay under the contract was compounded by several of the instructions given on plaintiff\u2019s theory asserting fraud on the part of defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nowhere in the instructions were the terms misrepresentation and concealment defined for the jury in a manner which would have aided its understanding of the distinction given these terms in the Insurance Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The next impact of the court-created instruction was to raise defendant\u2019s burden of proof from that of merely establishing to the juiy\u2019s satisfaction that plaintiff failed to disclose an indisputedly material fact (that his daughter Glinda Ann had been seen and treated in the emergency room of Sacramento Medical Center just a short time before the policy application was completed) to a requirement that defendant establish an affirmative act of misrepresentation by plaintiff. The record is uncontradicted that plaintiff was aware that Glinda Ann\u2019s undiagnosed condition required her to be taken to the hospital emergency room in the middle of the night and that he did not disclose those events to defendant\u2019s representatives. The most that can be said of plaintiff\u2019s testimony is that he <em>may </em>have told defendant\u2019s agents that Glinda had given birth to two children, provided they had asked him any questions about her. On the state of the record before us, and reviewing the evidence in light of the relevant factors to be considered (see <em>LeMons </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 869, 876 [148 Cal.Rptr. 355, 582 P.2d 946]) we hold that the trial court\u2019s omnibus instruction, minimizing almost to the point of omission the issue of possible concealment by plaintiff\u2014an alternative justification for defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>ant\u2019s refusal to pay\u2014was necessarily prejudicial in that it put defendant to a burden of proof greater than that imposed by law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">For the purpose of providing guidance to the court on retrial, we review defendant\u2019s claim that the court erred in awarding attorney fees with respect to that part of the judgment granting plaintiff contractual relief under the policy and damages for emotional distress. The parties had stipulated at trial that the question whether attorney fees were to be awarded, and if so, the amount thereof, would be decided by the trial court, not the jury. The court determined the issue in plaintiff\u2019s favor, held that $4,500 would be an appropriate fee for plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, and subtracted from that an amount which it allocated to the recovery of punitive damages, reaching a final figure of $2,750 to be paid by defendant for plaintiff\u2019s attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Those bad faith cases which touch upon an insured\u2019s right to attorney fees compel the conclusion that fees were improperly awarded with respect to legal services attributable to any portion of plaintiff\u2019s recoveiy which exceeded the amount due under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The only California case relied on in support of the award is <em>Mustachio </em>v. <em>Ohio Farmers Ins. Co. </em>(1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 358 [118 Cal.Rptr. 581]. <em>Mustachio </em>was an action brought by an insured against his insurer seeking both general and punitive damages, and alleging bad faith by the insurer which resulted in emotional distress. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 362.) The insured there had suffered a fire loss and was told by his insurer that if he did not accept its first settlement offer it would retire his claim without payment. As a result he was forced to retain counsel to compel the insurer to make payment, in a more appropriate amount, under the policy. It is quite clear from the opinion in <em>Mustachio </em>that the only attorney fees to which the insured was entitled were those relating to recoveiy of the fire loss, not those incurred in connection with the action for emotional distress. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 362, fn. 4; to same effect, see <em>Neal </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 910, 920 [148 Cal.Rptr. 389, 582 P.2d 980]; <em>Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. </em>v. <em>Harbor Ins. Co. </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 105, 112-115 [149 Cal.Rptr. 313].) This limitation is consistent with the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>rationale of bad faith cases. (See, e.g., <em>Crisci </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co. </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 425, 434 [58 Cal.Rptr. 13, 426 P.2d 173]; <em>Gruenberg </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co. </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 566, 574-575 [108 Cal.Rptr. 480, 510 P.2d 1032].)</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Puglia, P.
