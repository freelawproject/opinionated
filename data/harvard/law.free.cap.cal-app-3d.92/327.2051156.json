On December 17, 1976, Berth 46 was partially destroyed when the <em>S. S. Sansinema </em>exploded while moored at this berth. The damage rendered Berth 46 incapable of serving as a tanker terminal pending its being rebuilt. (We use the word rebuilt advisedly in view of the issue presented on appeal.) Union prepared and submitted plans and specifications to the harbor department for the rebuilding which consisted of \u201crestoration to essentially original specifications without any addition to, enlargement of or expansion of Berth 46 and wherever possible utilizing or retaining undamaged or salvageable portions thereof. Within such physical repair will be included partial replacement and modernization.\u201d The department determined this activity to be exempt from the permit requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act because it was found to be an \u201c[ejmergency repair to a public service facility necessary to maintain service\u201d under Public Resources Code section 21080, subdivision (b)(2); and, because the activity was found to be categorically exempt under Public Resources Code section 21084, California Administrative Code, title 14, section 15102, subdivision (b) and class 2 of the Los Angeles City CEQA Guidelines. Union then sought a determination from the South Coast Regional Commission (Commission) that the work necessary to put Berth 46 back into operation was a \u201crepair\u201d within the meaning of Public Resources Code section 30610, subdivision (c) and hence was excluded from permit requirements of the California Coastal Act of 1976. Commission thereafter met and without notice to Union determined that the project was not a repair and sent notice that a coastal development permit would be required. Union then filed the instant petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the Commission to order that Union\u2019s activity in restoring Berth 46 was excluded from the permit requirements of the act under Public Resources Code section 30610, subdivision (c) or that the Board\u2019s action be declared void and that Union\u2019s activities be deemed as a matter of law \u201crepairs\u201d excluded from the permit requirements. From the foregoing and other findings of fact, the trial court concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">\u201c1) This action is governed by CCP \u00a71085 (\u2018traditional\u2019 mandamus) rather than CCP \u00a71094.5 (\u2018administrative\u2019 mandamus).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">\u201c2) Because the activities at Berth 46 proposed by Union will only restore the Berth and related facilities to its former capabilities and will not result in any expansion, enlargement or addition, Public Resources Code \u00a7 30610(c) applies and no coastal zone development permit is required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u201c3) The actions of respondent Regional Commission were unreasonable, arbitrary and a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">\u201cAs a matter of law, the work contemplated is a \u2018repair\u2019 within the meaning of Public Resources Code \u00a7 30610(c) and thus excluded from the permit requirements of the Coastal Act of 1976.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">\u201c(b) The respondent Regional Commission had a clear mandatory duty to determine that the work at Berth 46 was a \u2018repair\u2019 within the meaning of Public Resources Code \u00a7 30610(c) and the respondent Commission has therefore failed to proceed in a manner prescribed by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">\u201c(c) Failure to proceed in a manner prescribed by law is unreasonable, arbitrary and an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">\u201c4) Judgment should be entered ordering a peremptory writ of mandate to issue from this court, commanding respondent Regional Commission, its members, officers and agents to vacate its order of April 11, 1977, and to issue its determination that petitioner\u2019s activities in restoring Berth 46 to its prior condition are excluded from the permit provisions of the California Coastal Act of 1976 under Public Resources Code \u00a730610(c).\u201d Judgment was entered accordingly. Commission appeals from the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">\n<em>Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">It is contended on appeal that neither facts nor law support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the proposed activity constituted repair or maintenance within the meaning of Public Resources Code section 30610, subdivision (c) and that Commission\u2019s determination to the contrary should be upheld because it was not \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>(REA Enterprises </em>v. <em>California Coastal Zone Com. </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 596, 611 [125 Cal.Rptr. 201].) We do not agree and for reasons to follow will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">While it is contended that the \u201crecord\u201d in general does not support the conclusion reached below, no claim is made that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are not supported by substantial evidence and in any event the Commission has not complied with established principles of appellate procedure if such a claim is advanced. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>World Church </em>(1969) 272 Cal.App.2d 684, 690-691 [77 Cal.Rptr. 669, 45 A.L.R.3d 622].) Under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>circumstances we deem all findings to be supported by substantial evidence and conclude that any argument to the contrary is without merit. <em>(Grand </em>v. <em>Griesinger </em>(1958) 160 Cal.App.2d 397, 403 [325 P.2d 475].)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">We now turn to consideration of the legal propriety of the trial court\u2019s action in ordering judgment for Union. Public Resources Code section 30610, subdivision (c) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[r]epair or maintenance activities that do not result in an addition to, or enlargement or expansion of, the object of such repair and maintenance activities\u201d are exempt from permit requirements. The trial court found the subject activities \u201cwill not result in an addition to or enlargement or expansion of the Berth or related facilities and will only result in restoring the dock to its former capabilities.\u201d It also found that no evidence was presented to either the Commission or the court to the contrary. In support of these findings is evidence supplied by the Commission itself. Exhibit \u201cB\u201d to the Commission\u2019s memorandum of points and authorities in opposition to petition for writ of mandate is the declaration of George Wakayama, a professional engineer employed by the State Lands Division of the State of California, wherein the declarant concludes: \u201cAlthough the reconstruction will replace seventy five percent of existing wharf structure, it would appear that the new facility including those portions retained from the original facilities will be functionally the same as the original.\u201d Thus, by its own admission the proposed work would \u201cnot result in an addition to, or enlargement or expansion of, the object of such repair. ...\u201d Under the circumstances the Commission\u2019s ruling was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d and it was not error to conclude that no Commission permit was required for this activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Cobey, Acting P. J., and Potter, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
