He pleaded \u201cnot guilty\u201d and \u201cnot guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d A theory of the prosecution was that the homicide was premeditated and deliberate. On trial of the issues posed by his not guilty plea, his only defense was that of <em>\u201cdiminished </em>capacity.\u201d He was found \u201cguilty of first degree murder,\u201d and \u201csane,\u201d by a jury and he appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">As is now well known, under the <em>Wells-Gorshen </em>concept of diminished capacity even though a defendant be legally sane under the recently rejected M\u2019Naghten test, or the now apposite American Law Institute criteria (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>22 Cal.3d 333 [149 Cal.Rptr. 275, 583 P.2d 1318]), if he suffers from a mental illness that prevents him from acting with malice he may not be convicted of murder, and if so prevented from acting with premeditation or deliberation, he may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>under that theory be found guilty of murder, first degree. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>60 Cal.2d 482, 490-491 [35 Cal.Rptr. 77, 386 P.2d 667]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Poddar, </em>10 Cal.3d 750, 758 [111 Cal.Rptr. 910, 518 P.2d 342]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sedeno, </em>10 Cal.3d 703, 723 [112 Cal.Rptr. 1, 518 P.2d 913]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>63 Cal.2d 351, 365 [46 Cal.Rptr. 763, 406 P.2d 43].)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Under this rule, if a mental illness precluded Lee from entertaining malice at the time of his criminal act he could not be found guilty of, or punished for, murder; his offense would be no greater than manslaughter. And under such circumstances, assuming malice, were he unable to premeditate or deliberate, his crime under such a theory was not murder, first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">We recognize that the defense of diminished capacity, although it has many supporters, has often been criticized as illogical and disregardful of the public safety and welfare. Some point out that it confers a lesser punishment upon otherwise sane and legally responsible criminals because of mental aberrations predisposing them to violence, thus allowing them sooner to resume their antisocial depradations. On the other hand, they argue, one who is not mentally so predisposed, and is therefore a lesser threat to the community, will suffer the full measure of punishment for a similar crime. We decline to enter upon the debate. The concept of diminished capacity is ingrained in the law of this state, and we as a lesser reviewing court are bound to apply it. (See <em>Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">We need not dwell upon the details of the offense which brought about Lee\u2019s conviction. It is sufficient to say that he assaulted a young college student and dragged her behind some bushes where in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, a sexual offense, he crushed her skull and killed her by repeated blows with a heavy pipe and rock. The crime was accompanied by nearly unbelievable viciousness and depravity.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">The Attorney General\u2019s brief correctly describes the testimony of Lee\u2019s psychiatrist witness in this manner: \u201cDr. Satten testified during both phases of the trial. He found appellant to be paranoid and schizophrenic. .. . During the course of five interviews, the doctor found appellant to be withdrawn, autistic and preoccupied with his own thoughts, hallucinations or delusions. . . . Appellant\u2019s general delusional system focused on a belief people were trying to kill him. . . . Appellant thought the victim was part of an ambush set up for him so he had to do something to protect himself. . . . Dr. Satten felt appellant\u2019s failure to react to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>warnings that police were coming indicated he was wrapped up in his own thoughts, and sex, particularly with persons of other races, was a preoccupation with him. . . . Based upon the doctor\u2019s contacts with appellant, Dr. Satten felt appellant could neither premeditate, deliberate or harbor malice.\u201d Dr. Satten\u2019s testimony concerning Lee\u2019s mental condition was corroborated by other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">During the guilt phase of the trial, Lee\u2019s attorney on direct examination, when educing testimony of Dr. Satten tending to establish Lee\u2019s inability to entertain the necessary malice, and the premeditation and deliberation of one theory of the murder charge, and thus his diminished capacity, was interrupted by the trial court and, in the jury\u2019s presence, the following comments were made (the italics are ours);</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">\u201cThe Court: Yes. Doctor, let me\u2014you understand, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. <em>So basically if A kills B, and that is all you know, that is murder of the second degree. </em>Now, that is one type, which is in line with [defense attorney] Mr. Beaupre\u2019s questions. If you find out that A premeditated and deliberated, you take the second degree murder and push it up to first degree. [If] The word deliberate means formed or arrived at or determined upon as a result of careful thought and weighing of considerations for and against the proposed course of action. [1f] The legal definition of the word premeditated means considered beforehand. <em>So that if you know that A kills B, in order to make it murder of the first degree, A must have arrived at or determined as a result of careful thought and weighing of considerations for and against, and then decided to kill. </em>If you don\u2019t find premeditation, then you cannot find first degree murder. And again the word deliberation; if you don\u2019t find deliberation you can\u2019t find murder of the first degree. You must consider it beforehand, and you must deliberate, which means formed as a result of careful thought and weighing of considerations for and against\u2014which is not, unfortunately, the clinical definition. [U] <em>So if all you know is that A kills B, that is second degree murder. To make it first degree, you must premeditate, </em>think about it beforehand, and deliberate, think about it, and after thinking about it, then do it. [\u00dc] Now let me ask you the question Mr. Beaupre was trying to ask.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">\u201cMr. Beaupre: Thank you, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">\u201cThe Court: As a result of this schizophrenia, in your opinion, could Mr. Lee deliberate and premeditate, as I have just defined it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>\u201cThe Witness: As you have defined it, I do not believe he could have deliberated or premeditated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Beaupre.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">\u201cMr. Beaupre: Q. Do you believe he could harbor malice toward the victim? A. I do not believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">\u201cThe Court: Well, Doctor, do you know what malice is, as Mr. Beaupre uses it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">\u201cMr. Beaupre: Would you like to explain that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">\u201cThe Witness: Well, the instruction form tells what malice is not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">\u201cThe Court: <em>Let me tell you what malice is. There are two kinds of malice. Kind number one is called express malice. I\u2019m going to kill you\u2014bang. I point the gun, that\u2019s it. Then you have implied malice. Implied malice is the doing of an act involving a high degree of probability it will result in death. </em>I shoot the gun, done for a base, antisocial purpose, which means that I know what I am doing, and knowing the consequences of shooting the gun, I shoot it anyway; knowing it is for a base, antisocial purpose, I shoot anyway, knowing what is going to happen. So if I shoot him and kill him, it is for a base, antisocial purpose. <em>If I know that I have the gun and know that if I fire it it may result in death, and I go ahead and do it anyway, that is implied malice. </em>[f| Okay, so that when you know that A kills B, if that is all you know, the implied malice is there, because you know that if somebody kills somebody in our society, you assume the base, antisocial purpose, which is the killing. The act is a base, antisocial purpose. But you need another thing for malice, you have to know what will happen when you kill, and knowing what will happen, which means somebody else will die, knowing that, you kill anyway. [If] Now, let me read it to you just the way I am going to tell you later. Malice is implied when the killing results from an act involving a high degree of probability that it will result in death. <em>If you fire a gun at somebody, or take a pipe and hit somebody over the head with the pipe and keep on beating him, </em>there is a degree of probability it will result in death, which act is done for a base, antisocial purpose, which is to assault or kill the person, by which is meant an awareness of the duty by law not to commit the act, <em>and knowing the law says not to commit the act, you go ahead and do it anyway, </em>or, in other words, a wanton disregard for human life, by which is meant an awareness of a duty imposed by law not to commit such acts, followed by the commission of the forbidden act despite that awareness. <em>So if I </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number><em>have the gun and I shoot it and it results in death, which is an antisocial purpose, but I know when I have that gun the law says you are not supposed to kill, I go ahead and rid the world of Dr. Satten anyway, then that is malice. </em>In other words, I point the gun at Dr. Satten and kill him, that is a base, antisocial purpose, to get rid of Dr. Satten. <em>If I know when I kill Dr. Satten it is against the law, that the law says I should not kill him, and I go ahead and kill him anyway, that is implied malice. Or express malice is, Satten, I don\u2019t like you, goodbye\u2014bang. </em>Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">\u201cMr. Beaupre: Did you want to ask the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">\u201cThe Court: Am I going to get your salary? [*[f] Do you feel, in your opinion, as a result of his schizophrenia, he was unable to harbor implied malice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">\u201cThe Witness: I do believe so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">It will be remembered that the trial court was purportedly instructing the doctor, and thus the seated jury, on the elements of <em>malice, </em>and <em>premeditation </em>and <em>deliberation </em>in the context of Lee\u2019s diminished capacity defense in support of which the doctor had taken the witness stand. Yet the court avoided any mention of that defense, or its relation to the malice, and premeditation and deliberation, so discussed,  And the above stated remarks of the court to the witness and jury were misleading and in greater part erroneous. They seriously prejudiced Lee in the presentation of his only defense, and they denied him that fair and impartial trial guaranteed by the state and federal Constitutions. (See <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45 [77 L.Ed. 158, 53 S.Ct. 55, 84 A.L.R. 527]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>47 Cal.2d 311, 319 [303 P.2d 329]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sarazzawski, </em>27 Cal.2d 7, 11 [161 P.2d 934]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>201 Cal. 618, 627 [258 P. 607].)</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The trial court\u2019s unelaborated and repetitious statements, such as \u201cif all you know is that A kills B, that is . . . murder,\u201d were undoubtedly founded upon the rule reiterated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lines, </em>13 Cal.3d 500, 506 [119 Cal.Rptr. 225, 531 P.2d 793]: \u201c \u2018[w]hen the killing is proved to have been committed by the defendant, and nothing further is shown, the presumption of law is that it was malicious and an act of murder; . . .\u2019 \u201d But the trial court here neglected to state the balance of <em>People </em>v. <em>Lines\u2019 </em>rule that such \u201c \u2018 \u201cmalice is implied ... in the absence of justifying or mitigating circumstances,\u201d \u2019 \u201d although there was copious evidence of such mitigating circumstances, i.e., diminished capacity, before the court and jury. (It is unreasonable to assume that from the words, if that is <em>\u201call </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number><em>you know,\u201d </em>the lay jury would have gleaned the meaning\u2014\u201cif there is no evidence of mitigating circumstances or diminished capacity.\u201d) <em>The jury were thus effectively, but erroneously, informed that if Lee killed his victim his offense was necessarily murder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\"> Even more serious error, we conclude, is the trial court\u2019s handling of the concept of malice in a case where the defense theory was and, a quantum of substantial evidence tended to establish, diminished capacity. Such definitions of <em>express </em>malice\u2014\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you\u2014 bang. I point the gun, that\u2019s it,\u201d and, \u201cexpress malice is, Satten, I don\u2019t like you, goodbye\u2014bang\u201d\u2014were clearly improper. Equally invalid under the circumstances here were those of <em>implied malice, </em>such as the following: \u201cIf I know when I kill Dr. Satten it is against the law, that the law says I should not kill him, and I go ahead and kill him anyway, that is implied malice\u201d; and that it also exists \u201cIf you . . . take a pipe and hit somebody over the head with the pipe and keep on beating him, [and] there is a degree of probability it will result in death, which act is done for a base, antisocial purpose, ... So if I have the gun and I shoot it and it results in death, which is an antisocial purpose, but I know when I have that gun the law says you are not supposed to kill, I go ahead and rid the world of Dr. Satten anyway, then that is [implied] malice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Indeed, the latter definition of implied malice, closely adapted to the factual context of Lee\u2019s case, <em>\u201cIf you. . . take a pipe and hit somebody over the head with the pipe and keep on beating him,\u201d </em>etc. (italics added), rather conclusively told the jury that Lee\u2019s crime was murder, and his only defense, invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">It requires little imagination to appreciate the jury\u2019s undoubted lack of consideration of Dr. Satten\u2019s opinion that Lee acted <em>without malice, </em>when the judge had just finished telling them that, by his admitted use of the pipe upon the victim, Lee had acted <em>with malice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">We are unpersuaded that the trial court\u2019s later jury instructions on diminished capacity erased the prejudicial effect of its earlier and dramatic, but nonetheless erroneous and prejudicial, remarks to the witness and jury. The least that may be said is (1) that the applicable law, as imparted to the jury on Lee\u2019s diminished capacity issue, was so inconsistent and confusing as to constitute prejudicial, and thus reversible, error (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Cornett, </em>33 Cal.2d 33, 41 [198 P.2d 877]), and (2) that the credibility of Lee\u2019s only witness on that issue was drastically and improperly impaired. \u201cJurors rely with great confidence on the fairness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>judges, and upon the correctness of their views expressed during trials.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mahoney, supra, </em>201 Cal. 618, 626-627.)</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The jury\u2019s guilty verdict on the issue presented by Lee\u2019s not guilty plea will accordingly be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Trial courts will be well advised to avoid, or at least to exercise great care in, extemporaneous or \u201coff the cuff\u201d comments to juries and witnesses relating to crucial defenses of the criminally accused. Doing so would be in the interest of justice, and would render unnecessary the retrial of actions such as we are now obliged, under our oath, to order.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Under the compulsion of <em>People </em>v. <em>Drew, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 333, discarding the M\u2019Naghten and substituting the American Law Institute criteria on a not guilty by reason of insanity plea, and applying the new rule retroactively to cases as are \u201cnot yet final,\u201d the juiy\u2019s verdict on the not guilty by reason of insanity plea will also be set aside. We have found such error, also, to be prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Lee\u2019s contention that \u201cEvidence Code section 522 placing the burden of proof on the appellant to prove himself insane is unconstitutional\u201d is meritless. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Drew, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 333, 348-349.) And as the circumstances giving rise to other of Lee\u2019s contentions of error will probably not recur, we make no determination as to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Racanelli, P. J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied June 1, 1979, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 5, 1979.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
