Respondents had been appointed as guardians of the person of the minor child on August 31, 1973, by the Superior Court for Mendocino County.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">A closed hearing was held on June 24 and 30, 1977, and the court filed its memorandum of intended decision on July 1, 1977. No objections to the proposed findings of fact were filed, and on September 14, 1977, the court signed and filed its findings of fact and judgment freeing Lynna from the custody and control of her natural parents. Notice of entry of judgment was mailed to each of the natural parents on November 3, 1977. Gloradon\u2019s notice of appeal was timely filed on December 21, 1977. The default of Delbert C., the natural father, was taken, and he does not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>The report of the probation department, prepared pursuant to Gvil Code section 233, recommends that the petition be granted and has been made part of the record. Lynna\u2019s school report and letters from Dr. Sidney Ganzler, Ph.D., Dr. Richard A. Martin, M.D., and Jean Sullivan are attached to the probation report. Also part of the record are a letter from Elaine Jersild, R.N., public health nurse from Sonoma County, and a letter from Ronald S. Nesset, deputy probation officer from Sonoma County.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Appellant assigns as error (1) the insufficiency of the evidence to support the judgment; (2) the failure of the court to consider less drastic alternatives; and (3) the admission into evidence of privileged and irrelevant information and records.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Lynna and her twin sister, Dawn, were born prematurely on December 6, 1970; the birth certificates indicate that the father was unknown. At the time, Gloradon was living in Mendocino County with her mother and a brother. Lynna was born with a congenital heart defect, and Gloradon became overwhelmed by caring for this sick infant along with Dawn and an older child, Eric, born on December 7, 1968. After discussing her problems with Dr. Waring, Gloradon suggested a temporary placement of Lynna in another home. Dr. Waring contacted Jean Sullivan, a social worker with the Mendocino County Department of Social Services, Child Protective Services Division. Sullivan arranged for a voluntary placement of Lynna with respondents, who \u201chad a special talent with children who had physical disabilities.\u201d Respondents had been licensed since 1964 as foster parents to have a maximum of six children; they have three children of their own, the youngest of whom is fifteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">On May 26, 1971, Lynna was released from the hospital to the respondents. She was to remain with them until she had developed sufficient stamina to undergo corrective heart surgery and had recuperated. Gloradon visited Lynna on June 4, 1971, for the first time, for about an hour and a half. Mrs. H. kept a diary on each of her foster children and regularly logged the contacts by Gloradon, who was authorized by Jean Sullivan to visit Lynna once a week. In 1971, Gloradon further visited Lynna on June 11, June 26, July 9, July 16-19, August 13, September 24, October 12 and December 24. With the exception of the three days, all the visits were in the home of the respondents, who accommodated Gloradon\u2019s plans for visitation \u201cday or night.\u201d Jean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Sullivan supervised the placement of Lynna with the respondents by regular visits, usually two or three times a month, during the entire time that Lynna has been with them. In the latter part of 1971, Gloradon moved to Sonoma County to live in her brother\u2019s house, about an hour\u2019s drive from the respondents\u2019 residence. Respondents and Jean Sullivan had a difficult time trying to contact Gloradon, particularly after she moved to Sonoma County. Gloradon testified that even though she would go away for a few days at a time, she always left a number where she could be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In 1972, Gloradon visited Lynna three times: May 31, August 5, and October 9; she called on March 20 and on November 24. On December 9, when Lynna was ready for surgery, Mrs. H. tried to reach Gloradon through her mother, who finally located Gloradon through the sheriff\u2019s office. Gloradon returned the call and, as agreed, she came to Mendocino County on January 12, 1973, to sign the necessary medical consents.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">On January 25, 1973, Lynna\u2019s heart surgery was performed at Stanford Hospital. Gloradon chose not to be present, and Mrs. H. had a message left with her mother when the surgery had been successfully completed. Respondents stayed in Palo Alto for about two weeks to be near Lynna during this period. There was no contact by Gloradon until April 9, 1973, when she visited Lynna at respondents\u2019 home. Gloradon telephoned on April 13, May 11, and on May 20 at which time Mrs. H. told her that Lynna was ready to go with her. Gloradon denies that she was told Lynna could go with her. Gloradon telephoned on July 18, and October 15; she visited on September 3 and on September 20, with friends, for about five minutes. On August 31, 1973, respondents were appointed guardians of the person of Lynna; they wanted the appointment because of their inability to reach Gloradon for medical consents when Lynna needed treatment. Gloradon gave her consent which was motivated, at least in part, by her fear that Lynna would be made a dependent ward of the Sonoma County Juvenile Court as Eric and Dawn had been in July 1973. Gloradon testified that she had had no legal advice and did not understand the import of the guardianship proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">There is some conflict about the reasons for the 1973 dependency proceedings for Eric and Dawn. Tension among Gloradon\u2019s family members had mounted as a result of the terminal illness and funeral of a brother. Wanda, a sister, testified. She was \u201cangry at\u201d her mother, brothers and sisters for not providing proper care for the ill brother. Gloradon had left Eric and Dawn for a few days, and Wanda called the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>welfare department to obtain medication for Dawn, who suffered from epileptic seizures; Gloradon was \u201crunning around\u201d and had left the children without proper medication and without a number where she could be reached. The welfare department worker questioned Wanda about Gloradon\u2019s \u201cneglect of the children,\u201d and the dependency proceedings resulted. Gloradon testified that \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand the pressure of attending the funeral, . . . [s]o I hired a baby sitter to stay with my children, and I was going to go and think about it. . . . [M]y sister called and said that I deserted the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">On November 23, 1973, the Sonoma County Juvenile Court placed Eric and Dawn with the respondents after the placement with the grandmother did not work out. Eric remained with respondents until June 20, 1975; Dawn remained with them until January 23, 1976. Lynna and Dawn fought with each other for about two months; thereafter the three children adjusted well with each other. Gloradon spent Christmas 1973 with the three children at respondents\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">During 1974, Gloradon visited the children 26 times which complied with the twice-a-month visitation schedule allowed by Sonoma County; she usually took them out of respondents\u2019 home. Gloradon moved in with the parents of Jim M. around January 1974, and in February, she and Jim were married. Their first child, David, was born in October 1974. Gloradon and Jim took Eric, Dawn and Lynna for a two-week visit during Christmas 1974. Respondents were again considering the return of Lynna to her mother, but the bruises on Dawn after the children were returned from Christmas vacation changed their thinking. The physician who examined Dawn reported the abuse to the child protective services, and termination of dependency for Eric and Dawn was postponed.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">From January 1, 1975, until June 20 when Eric was returned to his mother, there were five visits and four calls from Gloradon. After Eric left, Lynna refused to go out with her mother, apparently out of fear that she would not be returned to the respondents. Respondents sought professional counseling from several sources about Lynna\u2019s refusal to go with her mother and were advised by each not to force the child. From June 1975 until January 23, 1976, when Dawn was returned to her mother, Gloradon had nine visits out of the home with Dawn; she saw Lynna on each of these occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">In 1976, from January 23 when Dawn was returned until December 31, Gloradon telephoned Lynna five times and visited twice: On December 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>when Mrs. H. had a birthday party for Eric, Dawn and Lynna, and on Christmas when Lynna spent the day with Gloradon\u2019s relatives. Gloradon testified that she and Jim were having financial problems in 1976. He was out of work and being supported by Social Security; their car was \u201clousy\u201d and she had no transportation. She was upset by visiting Lynna in respondents\u2019 home with the other children running around; Mrs. H. would not force Lynna to go with her, and she was told that she couldn\u2019t take Lynna if the child didn\u2019t want to go. Gloradon and Jim\u2019s second child, Jacob, was born on April 13, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In 1977, Gloradon called on April 11, when she was served with \u201cthe papers.\u201d She also testified that she had telephoned a number of times during the years, but that messages were taken by the mother of Mrs. H. and the calls weren\u2019t returned. Mrs. H. refuted this.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Respondents filed the petition to free Lynna because \u201cthey wanted what was best for Lynna\u201d and were worried about the lack of stability in the arrangement. Their action was triggered by a conversation between Mrs. H. and Gloradon in December 1976 when Gloradon stated that \u201cshe had heard if she could find a couple that wanted to adopt Lynna she could sign papers and there would be nothing I could do about it. ... I might never see her again. . . .\u201d Gloradon testified that she was discussing the possibility of having her husband adopt all three children.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Respondents love Lynna and want to take care of her as their own. They would continue to allow her to visit with her mother and natural family. Gloradon testified that she had always wanted Lynna to be returned to her and that she had delayed at first because of her concern for Lynna\u2019s health and later because of her financial inability to retain counsel. Gloradon\u2019s sister, Wanda, testified that Gloradon had settled down and was a fine mother. Jim M. testified that he does not distinguish Eric and Dawn from his natural children, David and Jacob, and that he would feel comfortable with Lynna. He believes that Gloradon is capable of being a good mother to all five children. He has been employed since April 1977 and is grossing $711 per month. They receive AFDC benefits for Eric and Dawn of $56 a month. The Sonoma County probation officer reported that Jim and Gloradon have lived in a rented home since October 1975 and that the home is small, but adequate to accommodate another child.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The judgment is based on Civil Code section 232, subdivision (a)(7)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which specifically requires that (1) the child must have been in a foster home under the supervision of certain described agencies for two consecutive years; (2) there must be clear and convincing evidence<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that a return of the child to the parents would be detrimental to the child; and (3) there must be clear and convincing evidence that the parents are unable to provide a suitable home and family relationship. (See <em>In re Norma M. </em>(1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 110, 115 [143 Cal.Rptr. 412]; cf. <em>In re Carmaleta B. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 482, 491 [146 Cal.Rptr. 623, 579 P.2d 514]; and <em>In re Marcos S. </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 768, 783 [140 Cal.Rptr. 912], which do not specifically apply the clear and convincing evidence standard to the third requirements.)</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\"> Civil Code section 4600, which governs \u201cany proceeding where there is at issue the custody of a minor child,\u201d is also applicable. The doctrine preferring parental custody was not affected by the enactment of section 4600 except to focus \u201cattention not on the unfitness of the parent but the detriment to the child.\u201d <em>(In re B. G. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 679, 698 [114 Cal.Rptr. 444, 523 P.2d 244].)</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Appellant asserts that there is not substantial evidence to support the findings of the trial court and the judgment must be reversed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>The rules of appellate review of judgments in proceedings to free minors from parental custody and control have been restated, recently in <em>In re Marcos S., supra, </em>73 Cal.App.3d 768, 781: \u201c \u2018 \u201cIt is neither the duty nor the right of this court to resolve conflicts in the evidence, pass on the credibility of the witnesses, or determine where the preponderance of the evidence lies. These are all matters to be decided by the trier of fact in the court below. The power of any appellate court commences and terminates with a determination as to whether or not there is any substantial evidence, whether or not contradicted, which will support the conclusion of the trier of fact. All conflicts must be resolved in favor of respondent on appeal and all legitimate and reasonable inferences indulged in to uphold the verdict if possible. Where there is more than one inference which can reasonably be deduced from the facts, the appellate court is without power to substitute its deductions for those of the trier of fact. All evidence favorable to respondent is assumed true and the unfavorable is discarded. If the evidence so viewed is sufficient as a matter of law, the judgment must be affirmed.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d  Substantial evidence is defined in <em>Estate of Teed </em>(1952) 112 Cal.App.2d 638, 644 [247 P.2d 54]: \u201c[I]f the word \u2018substantial\u2019 means anything at all, it clearly implies that-such evidence must be of ponderable legal significance. Obviously the word cannot be deemed synonymous with \u2018any\u2019 evidence. It must be reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value; it must actually be \u2018substantial\u2019 proof of the essentials which the law requires in a particular case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is that Lynna, at the time of trial, had not \u201cbeen cared for in [a] foster [home] under the supervision of the juvenile court, the county welfare department or other public or private licensed child-placing agency for two or more consecutive years.\u201d She contends that the order appointing respondents as guardians of the person of Lynna on August 31, 1973, terminated the foster placement and substituted probate court supervision for that of the juvenile court and the welfare department.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">A petition under Welfare and Institutions Code section 300 to declare Lynna a dependent ward of the juvenile court was never filed, and her voluntary placement with the foster parents continued until the order for guardianship. Although the guardianship technically placed Lynna under the supervision of the probate court, she continued to be supervised, as appellant concedes, by the department of social services (DSS) in the person of Jean Sullivan, a social worker with the child protective services division. The DSS is an agency of the \u201cwelfare department\u201d (see Welf. &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Inst. Code, \u00a7 272) and qualifies under Civil Code section 232 as a supervising agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Appellant has cited no cases, and we can find none, holding that appointment as guardian terminates the status of the petitioner as a foster parent. We have determined that guardianship does not change the nonbiological relationship between foster parent and child any more than it would change the blood relationship between a relative and the child.  A foster parent has been defined as \u201cone who, although not legally related to the child by direct parental blood ties, nor decreed a parent in formal adoption proceedings, assumes the role of parent.\u201d (Katz, <em>Legal Aspects of Foster Care </em>(1971) 5 Family L.Q. 283, 285 (ABA Section of Family Law); cf. <em>In re Antonio F. </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 440, 453 [144 Cal.Rptr. 466], holding that placement of the children in the home of an aunt does not qualify as foster care under Civ. Code, \u00a7 232, subd. (a)(7).)  From reading various statutes, it appears that a foster parent can wear two hats, e.g., Probate Code section 1440 provides that the petition for appointment of a guardian of the person of a minor by a \u201cnonrelative not named in a will as guardian shall contain ... an allegation as to whether or not the petitioner\u2019s home is licensed as a foster family home.\u201d  Guardianship grants legal rights, such as the right to custody, and imposes duties, such as the duty to support and educate the child. (Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1500, 1512.)  A guardian can be removed on the grounds specified in Probate Code section 1580. Custody of the child can also be removed from the guardian under Welfare and Institutions Code section 300, and the jurisdiction of the juvenile court supersedes that of the probate court. <em>(In re Carr </em>(1944) 65 Cal.App.2d 681, 685 [151 P.2d 164].) In <em>In re B. G., supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 679, 693, the court referred to this dual role: \u201c[D]e facto parents, such as the foster parents in this case, should be permitted to appear as parties in juvenile court proceedings. Their standing should not depend upon the filing of a petition for guardianship, although the filing of such petition may aid in attesting to their interest in the custody of the child; . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">We conclude that the trial court properly found that Lynna had been in foster care since May 26, 1971, and impliedly found that she had been supervised by a specified agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Appellant next argues that the evidence is insufficient to support the court\u2019s finding that placement of Lynna with her natural mother would be detrimental to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Dr. Richard Martin, a child psychiatrist who saw and tested Lynna about five times in the year and a half before the hearing, testified that separation of Lynna from the respondents would lead to grief and withdrawal of love and trust and would interfere with her capacity to form relationships in the future. Dr. Martin detailed his indirect testing methods such as \u201cDraw a Person,\u201d \u201cMake Up a Story,\u201d etc., in which there was ample opportunity for the child to include meaningful persons; Lynna never mentioned her biological mother or father and clearly considered the respondents her parents. He pointed out that Lynna had been with respondents continuously for 74 of her 79 months and had developed a wanted child-psychological parent relationship<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with them. He had never seen the severance of such a relationship without detriment to the child. As examples of detriment, he cited the incidence of school problems, bed wetting, sleep disturbance, and juvenile delinquency in children whose ties had been severed. He had seen a great number of children who look back with melancholy, grief and depression over what happened to them earlier. When asked about Lynna\u2019s best interests, he replied: \u201cLynna is prospering. She had deep attachments to her psychological parents. The least harmful alternatives [s/c] would be to leave well enough alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Appellant seeks to annul Dr. Martin\u2019s testimony by pointing out that he had advanced similar considerations about Dawn on the final review of her dependency proceedings. Dr. Martin indicated that he had not resisted Dawn\u2019s return as vigorously because \u201cher attachments had been broken for a long period of time. She had suffered many untoward things <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>prior to that and had a deeper symbolic tie to the biological mother .... Dawn was truly in limbo.\u201d Unlike Lynna, Dawn had been with her mother for her first two and a half years. Appellant\u2019s objections go to the weight and credibility of Dr. Martin\u2019s testimony, which were for the trial court to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The report of the Mendocino County Probation Department recommended that the petition freeing Lynna be granted. Jean Sullivan, Dorothea Proctor, and each of the respondents testified about Lynna\u2019s relationship with the respondents, her adjustment in their home and her relationship with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The court had substantial evidence on which to base its findings that it would be detrimental to Lynna to sever her relationship with respondents and to return her to appellant. (See <em>In re Marcos S., supra, </em>73 Cal.App.3d at p. 782; <em>In re D. L. C. </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 840, 849 [126 Cal.Rptr. 863].)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Because the concepts and the evidence overlap, we will treat as one the compound third requirement in Civil Code section 232, subdivision (a)(7), \u201cthat the parent or parents have failed during such period [two years preceding the filing of the petition], and are likely to fail in the future, to [H] (i) Provide a home for said child; [H] (ii) Provide care and control for the child; [1] (iii) Maintain an adequate parental relationship with the child; and [f] (iv) Maintain continuous contact with the child, unless unable to do so.\u201d  Appellant insists that a finding on each of the four conditions must be supported by clear and convincing evidence on that condition and that the evidence is insufficient to support the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">In specifying certain attributes of the parent-child relationship that the court must consider, the Legislature has indicated the seriousness of an irrevocable order depriving a parent of the custody and control of a child.  The onditions for a freeing order are more onerous than the one condition of \u201cdetriment to the child\u201d required by Civil Code section 4600 when a modifiable order for custody to a nonparent is involved. The courts, too, have viewed the termination of the parent-child relationship \u201cas a drastic remedy which should be resorted to only in extreme cases of neglect or abandonment.\u201d (See <em>In re T. M. R. </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 694, 703 [116 Cal.Rptr. 292]; <em>In re Carmaleta B., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 482, 489.)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The legislative intent is equally clear that \u201c \u2018The purpose of the statute is to protect children. . . . The interest sought to be protected is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>that of the welfare of the child. Its need to be raised with love, emotional security and physical safety is paramount to any right of a neglectful parent to have the custody and physical proximity of its child. . . \u201d <em>(In re D. L. C., supra, </em>54 Cal.App.3d 840, 851; see also <em>In re Eugene W. </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 623, 629 [105 Cal.Rptr. 736].) The Legislature has mandated that provisions for freeing a child \u201cshall be liberally construed to serve and protect the interests and welfare of the child.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 232.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Appellant did not request special findings in the trial court. She now requests the reviewing court to segregate and classify the evidence on which the trial court made its findings in the statutory language on each of the four conditions. It is not our province to do so. We do not think that the Legislature intended a strict and rigid adherence to the formula set forth in Civil Code section 232, subdivision (a)(7). (Cf. <em>In re Zimmerman </em>(1962) 206 Cal.App.2d 835, 844 [24 Cal.Rptr. 329]: \u201c \u2018. . . \u201cBecause human relationships and human conduct are so variable and complex it probably is impossible, and certainly undesirable, to state or to try to state a fixed formula applicable to all cases.\u201d \u2019 \u201d) In reviewing the evidence that supports the court\u2019s finding on the third requirement, we will look to the overall quality of the relationship between appellant and Lynna.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Ronald S. Nesset, deputy probation officer from Sonoma County, submitted a report on the mother\u2019s circumstances and concluded that he could \u201cdiscern no relevant reason why [appellant] could not perform in an adequate parental role to young Lynna. . . .\u201d Elaine Jersild, a public health nurse for Sonoma County, submitted a letter on appellant\u2019s behalf. Both she and Audrey Gunther, a psychiatric social worker with the Sonoma County Mental Elealth Services, testified in favor of Lynna\u2019s return to appellant. They confirm that appellant has made commendable progress in overcoming earlier emotional inadequacies and that Gloradon and Jim are apparently providing a stable home for the other four children. Nesset, Jersild and Gunther did not personally interview Lynna or observe the interaction between appellant and Lynna.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Appellant is now able to provide a \u201chouse\u201d for Lynna, but it would be paradoxical to require the child\u2019s return for this reason in spite of the finding that it would be detrimental to her. In using the word \u201chome,\u201d the Legislature intended a broader meaning: A place where one lives with his or her family, a place where one feels secure with its familiar conditions, circumstances and associations. The record does not reflect that Lynna has been in appellant\u2019s present house; Dr. Martin\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>tests reveal that Lynna has put down deep roots with respondents and that she considers them her family. Both Jersild and Gunther acknowledge that a \u201creadjustment\u201d period would be necessary if Lynna were returned to appellant.  All this was for the trial court to weigh and consider along with the evidence relating to appellant\u2019s relationship with Lynna.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Appellant visited Lynna regularly only during the period that Eric and Dawn were with respondents. For two and a half years prior to that period her contacts had been minimal, even during the time that Lynna underwent heart surgery. After Eric\u2019s return to appellant in June 1975, Lynna would not accompany her mother away from respondents\u2019 residence. Appellant offered no evidence to show that she had made any efforts to overcome the child\u2019s reluctance or to gain the child\u2019s confidence. From January 1976 when Dawn was returned to appellant until the time of the hearing in July 1977, appellant had visited Lynna twice, both visits being in December 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">There is no evidence that appellant ever sent Lynna a letter or a postcard to assure her of appellant\u2019s affection and concern. Except for the presumption of gifts at the December 1976 birthday party and Christmas celebrations, the record is devoid of any mention of gifts from appellant to Lynna. Appellant did make one $25 payment through the district attorney\u2019s office in April 1975. Appellant protests that it would \u201chave indicated a gross mismanagement of her limited resources, resulting in deprivation to the children residing with her\u201d to have sent clothing and gifts to Lynna. From the child\u2019s point of view, appellant\u2019s failure to provide such contacts might very well be interpreted as a lack of concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">As stated in <em>In re Norma M., supra, </em>77 Cal.App.3d 110, 116: \u201cThe statute requires a finding that the parents <em>have failed </em>and are <em>likely to fail in the future </em>to provide such a home and family relationship. Of course, no one can predict the future with absolute certainty. The trial judge is called upon, in these cases, to simply determine the <em>likelihood </em>of whether the parent will in the future make a marked change in his or her behavior pattern in relation to the child. Unquestionably the parents\u2019 \u2018track record\u2019 prior to the hearing is the best indication of such a likelihood.\u201d (Italics in original.) As reflected in the record below, appellant\u2019s inability to evoke in Lynna any of the \u201cnatural\u201d child-to-mother responses is indicative of the flaw in their relationship. Although appellant is Lynna\u2019s biological mother, she is a stranger to Lynna. The trial court could properly conclude that there was little likelihood that the relationship would be reestablished.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Both parties discuss the case of <em>In re D. L. C., supra, </em>54 Cal.App.3d 840, in which this court affirmed the judgment freeing the minor from parental custody and control under Civil Code section 232, subdivisions (a)(2) and (7) . Except for the reasons for the initial placement, the facts are similar. In that case, as in this, the mother had \u201cdemonstrated encouraging success in her own rehabilitation\u201d <em>(id., </em>p. 847); two other children who had been removed from her custody had been regained at the time of trial, and they were \u201creasonably happy and well adjusted in their present home environment.\u201d <em>(Ibid. </em>) In affirming, this court quoted from <em>In re Morrow </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 39, 57 [88 Cal.Rptr. 142] (overruled on other grounds in <em>Hollister Convalescent Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Rico </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 660, 674 [125 Cal.Rptr. 757, 542 P.2d 1349]): \u201cThe weight to be given to the rehabilitation of appellant and her excuses for past conduct was for the trial court.\u201d We do not find that the differences in <em>D. L. C. </em>as pointed out by appellant are significant. Appellant relies on <em>In re Zimmerman, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.2d 835, in which the <em>denial </em>of a petition to free the child was affirmed. There, too, we emphasized that the trial court has the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and to weigh the evidence; the existence or nonexistence of conditions compelling an order freeing the child is a determination \u201cproperly exercisable within the broad discretion invested in the trial court.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 847.)</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Although the standard of proof for the trial court is clear and convincing evidence, the appellate court need only determine whether there was substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings,  In the case before us, there is substantial evidence to support the court\u2019s findings that appellant has failed and is likely to fail to provide a home for the minor, to provide care and control for the minor, to maintain an adequate parental relationship with the minor, and to maintain continuous contact with the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Use of Child Protective Services for Reuniting Family</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">This court has recently reiterated the principle advanced by appellant \u201cthat before state action may be undertaken to involuntarily terminate the natural relationship of parent and child, less drastic alternatives, such as provision for child protection services, must first be explored.\u201d (See <em>In re Heidi T. </em>(1979) 87 Cal.App.3d 864, 874 [151 Cal.Rptr. 263].) The failure to consider or offer such services before instituting a section 232 proceeding, however, does not automatically deprive the court of jurisdiction to entertain or grant the petition. (See <em>In re Susan M. </em>(1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 300, 310-312 [125 Cal.Rptr. 707], in which the court fully explores the place of child protective services in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>\u00a7 232 proceedings; <em>In re Heidi T., supra.) </em>The requirements applicable where a county welfare department initiates the proceeding are: (1) the department must consider the propriety of child protective services and offer them if appropriate to qualified parents; and (2) if the department fails such consideration, the court must consider the propriety of ordering the services and, if necessary, must delay the proceedings for such purpose. The court may consider mitigating circumstances for the department\u2019s failure to offer the services. The requirements are equally applicable where persons other than the county welfare department initiate the section 232 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Although appellant did not raise the issue in the court below, she urges on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to consider such services and that the efforts at reunification must be properly evaluated in the probation report prepared in accordance with Civil Code section 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Appellant did not request a finding on the issue, and no finding was made. There is, however, substantial evidence to support the implied findings that services were considered and offered and that further efforts at reunification would be unproductive. Jean Sullivan, the social worker with the child protective services, testified that services were offered to appellant, but that she was unable or unwilling, or both, to utilize them. The dependency proceedings for Eric and Dawn were not terminated until January 23, 1976, which gives some indication that efforts at reunification of Lynna with appellant until that time would have been fruitless. After that date, appellant\u2019s contacts with Lynna were meager and sporadic. Appellant did seek counseling to aid in securing the return of Eric and Dawn to her custody and to help them readjust. The record reflects a passivity, if not disinterest, on her part toward working for Lynna\u2019s return. The services are voluntary <em>(In re Jeannie Q. </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 288, 298-300 [107 Cal.Rptr. 646]), and should not be forced on an unwilling or disinterested parent. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to order such services and in failing to postpone the proceedings to explore the possibility of Lynna\u2019s return to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Although not contending that the probation report with its attachments was inadmissible, appellant argues that it was \u201cinadequate\u201d to support the court\u2019s judgment. Appellant\u2019s objection goes to the weight of the evidence which is in the province of the trial court. <em>(In re Heidi T, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.3d at p. 875.) There was substantial evidence apart from the report to support the court\u2019s findings and implied finding on services.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Privileged Communications</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Appellant contends that the trial court committed reversible error in allowing Dorothea Proctor, a social services practitioner for the County of Sonoma, to testify. Mrs. Proctor was the caseworker for Eric and Dawn in the Sonoma County Juvenile Court dependency proceedings during the period that the children were placed with respondents. The court sustained appellant\u2019s objection to testimony concerning Eric and Dawn, on the grounds that information obtained by Mrs. Proctor in the course of her supervision was not relevant and was privileged. Mrs. Proctor was allowed to testify about her discussions with appellant concerning Lynna and about her observations of Lynna during her supervision of Eric and Dawn. She observed that Lynna stayed very close to Mrs. H. on a visit in August 1974, yet spent most of her time with Mrs. Proctor on a visit to appellant\u2019s home in January 1975 when Lynna was visiting her mother. She further testified that appellant had asked for Mrs. Proctor\u2019s removal as the caseworker and that appellant was \u201cdifficult to get hold of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Appellant claims that the evidence was not relevant and therefore inadmissible under Evidence Code section 350 and that it was confidential and privileged under Welfare and Institutions Code section 10850. These claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Mrs. Proctor, using her notes made at the time of the interviews, testified about the interpersonal relations between Lynna and her foster parents and between Lynna and her natural mother\u2019s family. Her observations reveal the quality of those relations and assist the trier of fact in determining the issues raised under Civil Code section 232. The evidence was relevant and was admissible under Evidence Code section 351, unless privileged. We can only speculate on what Mrs. Proctor\u2019s testimony about Eric and Dawn might have been, but the court had discretion to exclude the evidence under Evidence Code section 352. The error, if any, related to the exclusion of testimony about Eric and Dawn and was not prejudicial to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Appellant cited no authority for her claim of privilege during the trial. On appeal, she relies on Welfare and Institutions Code section 10850. No reversal may be granted for the erroneous admission of evidence unless: (1) a timely objection is made and so stated as to make clear the specific ground of the objection; and (2) the evidence should have been excluded on the ground stated and the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 353; <em>People </em>v. <em>Welch </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 106, 114-115 [104 Cal.Rptr. 217, 501 P.2d 225].) Mrs. Proctor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>testimony corroborated that of respondents, Dr. Martin, and Jean Sullivan, and the admission of her testimony about Lynna did not result in a miscarriage of justice. Although appellant did not make clear the ground for her objection, some examination of \u201cthe privilege\u201d relating to Mrs. Proctor\u2019s testimony is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">At the time of the hearing, Eric and Dawn were receiving benefits under the aid to families with dependent children program (AFDC), which is partly funded by the federal government. (See 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 601 et seq.) Welfare and Institutions Code section 10850 provides that \u201capplications and records concerning any individual made or kept by any public officer or agency in connection with the administration of any provision of this code relating to any form of public social services for which grants-in-aid are received by this state from the United States government shall be confidential, and shall not be open to examination for any purpose not directly connected with the administration of such program . . . .\u201d The statutes relating to \u201cPublic Social Services\u201d are contained in division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, section 1000 et seq. The record below does not clearly indicate that Mrs. Proctor had supervised or was supervising the family under the AFDC program or that she was using notes or records prepared in connection with that program; she was supervising Eric and Dawn in their placement during the juvenile court dependency proceedings. Therefore, Welfare and Institutions Code section 10850 arguably is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Generally, the privilege for official information (\u201cinformation acquired in confidence by a public employee in the course of his [or her] duty,\u201d Evid. Code, \u00a7 1040, subd. (a)) must be claimed by the public entity who is the holder of the privilege. Evidence Code section 1040 \u201c \u2018represents <em>the exclusive means </em>by which a public entity may assert a claim of governmental privilege based on the necessity for secrecy.\u2019 \u201d (Italics in original, <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 107, 123 [130 Cal.Rptr. 257, 550 P.2d 161], involving a claim of privilege under Gov. Code, \u00a7 6254, subd. (f).) It follows that a private person asserting the claim of privilege for official information must do so pursuant to Evidence Code section 1040, unless another means is provided by statute. In determining whether the proffered evidence is privileged, a trial court is called upon to decide a number of preliminary facts: (1) was the information acquired in confidence; (2) is the privilege absolute, i.e., disclosure is forbidden by a federal or state statute (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1040, subd. (F)(1)), or conditional (\u00a7 1040, subd. (b)(2)); (3) if the privilege is conditional, does the necessity for preserving the confidentiality outweigh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>\u201cthe necessity for disclosure in the interest of justice\u201d (\u00a7 1040, subd. (b)(2)); and (4) in such cases as the one before us, can a private person assert the claim of privilege for official information. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 405.) The trial court may conduct an <em>in camera </em>hearing when necessary to rule on a claim of privilege. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 915.)</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 10850 refers to confidential \u201capplications and records concerning any individual\u201d relating to any form of public social service received. The testimony of Dorothea Proctor related to observations of Lynna, her difficulty in reaching appellant, and her differences with appellant. Such information was not \u201cacquired in confidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The legislative purpose in providing for confidentiality of public social service records is to protect the right of privacy of the recipient of such benefits. (Cf. Gov. Code, \u00a7 6254, \u201cnothing in this chapter shall be construed to require disclosure of records that are: ...(c) Personnel, medical, or similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy . . . .\u201d) The privilege for confidential records under Welfare and Institutions Code section 10850 is a conditional one. The section itself provides for release of records for specified purposes. Certainly when the best interests of a minor child are at stake, the need for disclosure of relevant information \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d for the minor child outweighs the need for confidentiality. The records were held to be absolutely privileged in <em>Sinacore </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 223, 225 [146 Cal.Rptr. 302], where a minor, in an action for the wrongful death of her mother, objected to an order granting defendants\u2019 motion for production of the county welfare department\u2019s records on the issue of damages. However, in <em>In re Jeannie Q., supra, 32 </em>Cal.App.3d 288, 305, the AFDC caseworker was allowed to testify in a dependency proceeding about the physical and emotional condition of the minor children. The court stated at page 305: \u201cThe physical welfare of the children is of prime interest to the state and to the DPSS [Department of Public Social Services] in its administration of the program. That program requires that the social worker responsible for a family see that the minors are in good physical and mental condition. Insofar as this case is concerned no privilege existed under section 10850.\u201d (Cf. <em>Wyman </em>v. <em>James </em>(1971) 400 U.S. 309 [27 L.Ed.2d 408, 91 S.Ct. 381], holding that an AFDC caseworker\u2019s home visit is not unreasonable because the public\u2019s interest is protection and aid for the child; the dependent child\u2019s needs are paramount and the mother\u2019s claim under the Fourth Amendment is secondary.)</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>For the reasons stated, the claim of privilege was properly denied. Therefore the admission of Dorothea Proctor\u2019s testimony was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The judgment freeing the minor child from the custody and control of her natural parents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Racanelli, P. J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 24, 1979, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 19, 1979.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b621-11\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">This statute, in effect from January 1, 1977, through July 1, 1978, read in pertinent part: \u201c(a) An action may be brought for the purpose of having any person under the age of 18 years declared free from the custody and control of either or both of his [or her] parents when such person comes within any of the following descriptions: ...

(Stats. 1978, ch. 429, \u00a7 23; ch. 1269, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Dr. Martin indicated that the concept of the \u201cwanted child-psychological parent relationship\u201d was first advanced in the book, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973) by Goldstein et al., which is also cited in <em>In re Carmaleta B., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 482, 489. The authors compare the biological and psychological parents: \u201cNormally, the physical facts of having begotten a child or given birth to it have far-reaching psychological meaning for the parents as confirmation of their respective sexual identities, their potency and intactness. Derived from this is the inclusion of the newborn and infant in the parents\u2019 self-love. The overflow of this self-love to the child leads to the common parental overvaluation of their offspring. Biological parents are credited with an invariable, instinctively based positive tie to the child, although this is frequently belied by evidence to the contrary, in cases of infanticide, infant-battering, child neglect, abuse, and abandonment. [If] The biological parent\u2019s relationship to the child is seriously interfered with in instances where the adults in question reject their own male or female identity. When the newborn is defective, his very existence may become a reason for shame and guilt instead of pride, and for the father a discredit to his potency. [H] By contrast, for the child, the physical realities of his conception and birth are not the direct cause of his emotional attachment. This attachment results from day-to-day attention to his needs for physical care, nourishment, comfort, affection, and stimulation. Only a parent who provides for these needs will build a psychological relationship to the child on the basis of the biological one and will become nis \u2018psychological parent\u2019 in whose care the child can feel valued and \u2018wanted.\u2019 An absent biological parent will remain, or tend to become a stranger.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 17.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
