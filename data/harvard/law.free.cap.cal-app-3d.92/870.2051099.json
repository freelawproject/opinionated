Engel appeals from an order of dismissal entered following the sustaining of respondents\u2019 demurrers without leave to amend. Appellant, an attorney who formerly practiced in New York, and who has since been admitted to practice in California, seeks damages from the State Bar of California, the Committee of Bar Examiners of the State Bar of California, and two named employees of the committee, for an allegedly unlawful delay in his admission to the California bar while his moral character was being investigated. The trial court held no cause of action was stated by the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">According to the allegations of the complaint: from 1959 to 1975 appellant was a practicing attorney in New York and was at all times a member in good standing in the bars of the courts located in New York and at all times was of good moral character and scrupulously observed the canons of ethics and all moral and ethical considerations applicable to attorneys. In late 1975 he moved to California and applied as an attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>applicant for admission to practice law in California. He successfully completed the attorney\u2019s examination and professional responsibility examination, with the results of his success thereon being published on April 13, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">On May 25, 1976, appellant learned that the Committee of Bar Examiners had received information from one George Galland which was delaying appellant\u2019s admission to the bar. After speaking with Galland, appellant sent to the committee an extensive affidavit dated June 2, 1976, which contained a detailed explanation of all the facts known to appellant about what he had gleaned to be the nature of the problem, including numerous exhibits. Appellant received no communication from the committee. On June 18, 1976, appellant sent a cable to respondent Kenneth McCloskey, the administrator of the Committee of Bar Examiners in San Francisco, requesting information on the status of his application, but received no reply. Appellant thereafter secured a copy of a letter of April 30, 1976, from Galland to the committee \u201cwhich contained a patently misleading reference to \u2018trust property.\u2019 \u201d After repeated unsuccessful attempts to reach respondent Patricia Lobello, the. associate administrator of the Committee of Bar Examiners in Los Angeles, appellant wrote to her on July 12, 1976, with a copy to respondent McCloskey, complaining of the delay and supplying additional information in response to the contents of Galland\u2019s letter. On July 14, 1976, appellant telephoned respondent McCloskey and learned that the committee had received appellant\u2019s affidavit of June 2 and letter of July 12. McCloskey stated that it was his responsibility together with respondent Lobello to make a preliminary determination whether appellant was to be admitted forthwith or whether a hearing by the committee would be necessary. Appellant supplied additional information to McCloskey by letter of July 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Having heard nothing for another month, appellant telephoned McCloskey on August 13, 1976, and was told McCloskey would get to the matter within the week. On August 24 appellant again telephoned McCloskey and was told there would be further delay. McCloskey told appellant he had spoken with Galland on the telephone and McCloskey explained to appellant Galland\u2019s theories of wrongdoing by appellant. McCloskey related to appellant what he thought would \u201csatisfy\u201d Galland and suggested that appellant call Galland. Appellant refused, saying he would not be \u201cblackmailed\u201d into paying money to Galland.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Having heard nothing further about his application, appellant commenced a mandamus action against respondents on September 2, 1976. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>Appellant alleges on information and belief that in retaliation for appellant\u2019s filing of a mandamus action, respondent McCloskey decided not to recommend that appellant be admitted forthwith but instead to convene a hearing before a subcommittee of the Committee of Bar Examiners.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">On October 14, 1976, said hearing was commenced before a three-member subcommittee of the Committee of Bar Examiners. The examiner appointed by the committee to present evidence introduced into evidence only two informal unsworn letters from Galland, the affidavits and exhibits provided by appellant on June 2, and appellant\u2019s letter of July 16 with two enclosures. Appellant introduced into evidence approximately 30 documents consisting for the most part of the aforementioned affidavit and letter and enclosures plus other documents which had previously been presented to counsel for the committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">At the hearing, the subcommittee members unanimously decided that the letters written by Galland did not contain allegations which, even if proved, would be sufficient to cause appellant to be denied admission to practice law, and that the allegations related only to a commercial dispute between appellant and Galland based on a previous relationship in the practice of law. The subcommittee members were of the opinion that appellant\u2019s admission had been inordinately delayed, and were critical of the staff for being less than diligent in clarifying the nature of the complaint, for having taken six months, and for not having the case prepared even after that length of time. Nevertheless, the subcommittee granted the examiner a three-week adjournment to secure additional evidence by deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Two days before the scheduled adjournment date (presumably, early November), appellant learned that the examiner had notified the chairman of the subcommittee he had no further evidence and that the chairman had canceled the adjourned hearing. The subcommittee \u201cthereafter\u201d issued its findings, based on information available since July of 1976, concluding \u201c \u2018The allegations made do not appear to involve any violation of trust, but seem to be a dispute between former law partners in the state of New York over allocation of fees and reimbursement for costs advanced by one of them or the other on behalf of clients of one or the other, and in no way involved trust funds\u2019 \u201d and recommending appellant\u2019s admission to the California bar. Appellant was finally admitted to the California bar on January 25, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>Appellant seeks damages<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for his delayed admission to the bar from McCloskey, Lobello, the Committee of Bar Examiners, and the State Bar, based on five asserted causes of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-4\"><em>First Cause of Action (\u201cFailure to Discharge Statutory Duty\u201d). </em>Respondents violated a mandatoiy duty imposed by rule X, section 102, of the State Bar rules regulating admission to practice law in California, adopted pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 6047.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-5\"><em>Second Cause of Action (\u201cBreach of Contract). </em>Respondents violated a contract arising out of appellant\u2019s executed application for admission and payment of the required fee, by which respondents were impliedly obliged to process appellant\u2019s application with reasonable diligence and competence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-6\"><em>Third Cause of Action </em>(\u201cNegligence\u201d). McCloskey and Lobello negligently and incompetently failed to perform a duty promptly to complete the initial investigation and make a recommendation to the committee whether appellant should be admitted forthwith or a hearing should be held. Specifically they failed to make an appropriate investigation, failed to perceive that the charge even if true would not be grounds for denying admission, failed to perceive that the overwhelming weight of evidence proved the charge false, scheduled a hearing where there was no probable cause for such a hearing, failed to make rudimentary effort to secure competent evidence, and failed to act with reasonable dispatch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-7\"><em>Fourth Cause of Action (\u201cViolation of Constitutional Rights\u201d). </em>Respondents failed and refused adequately to inform appellant of the charges, to supply appellant with copies of the evidence on which the investigation was based, and to afford appellant the right of confrontation and cross-examination, and respondents scheduled a hearing while having no competent evidence of any kind. This deprived appellant of due process and equal protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-8\"><em>Fifth Cause of Action </em>(\u201cBlackmail' <em>Coercion and Intentional Infliction of Emotional Harm\u201d). </em>McCloskey and Lobello intentionally delayed the initial investigation and intentionally convened the hearing in retaliation for appellant\u2019s commencement of a mandamus action. McCloskey and Lobello wilfully colluded with Galland to blackmail and coerce appellant to pay money to Galland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>We hold the trial court correctly determined that no valid cause of action was stated in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">First Cause of Action\u2014No Breach of Mandatory Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Government Code section 815.6 provides: \u201cWhere a public entity is under a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment that is designed to protect against a risk of a particular kind of injury, the public entity is liable for an injury of that kind proximately caused by its failure to discharge the duty unless the public entity establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence to discharge the duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Appellant contends that rule X of the State Bar Rules Regulating Admission to Practice Law in California<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> imposes a mandatory duty upon the Committee of Bar Examiners, within the meaning of Government Code section 815.6, to complete its investigation of an applicant\u2019s moral character and to make a recommendation on certification within certain time limits, and that appellant has a cause of action for breach of that mandatory duty. Our analysis of rule X shows that it was not breached in this case and that it does not impose a mandatory duty within the meaning of Government Code section 815.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Rule X (which is composed of \u00a7\u00a7 101 to 110) deals with the procedures for establishing that an applicant has good moral character, a prerequisite to admission to the bar. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6060, subd. (b), 6062, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sections 102, 105, 107, 108, and 110 set forth the times in which various steps in this procedure shall be completed. Relevant portions of those sections are described in the footnote.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>To determine whether it was the intent of the framers of rule X to impose a mandatory duty within the meaning of Government Code section 815.6 we must look at the entire substance of the rule. <em>(Tripp </em>v. <em>Swoap, </em>17 Cal.3d 671, 679 [131 Cal.Rptr. 789, 552 P.2d 749]; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>30 Cal.App.3d 219, 224 [106 Cal.Rptr. 299]. See <em>Morris </em>v. <em>County of Marin, </em>18 Cal.3d 901, 910-911 fn. 6 [136 Cal.Rptr. 251, 559 P.2d 606].)</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">Section 110 of rule X provides: \u201cFor good cause shown the chairperson or acting chairperson of the committee may extend any of the time limitations specified in Rule X. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Section 110 shows that the various time limits in rule X are not inflexible or mandatory. They may be extended for <em>discretionary </em>reasons. The existence of such discretion prevents the duty from being a mandatory (nondiscretionary) one.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">In any event, it does not appear that the time limits in rule X were actually violated in this case. Appellant\u2019s bar examination results were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>published on April 13, 1976, and appellant was apparently certified for admission in November 1976, about seven months later. The final decision was well within the limits provided by rule X, even without allowing for any extensions of time. This is shown by the following table.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><em>Procedural Step Number of Days Allowed Section Number of Rule X </em>Initial investigation <em>60 </em>102(a) Completion of hearing <em>90 </em>102(b), 105 Subcommittee report to committee 60 108(a) Notice of subcommittee report <em>7 </em>108(b) Decision of committee based on subcommittee report <em>60 </em>108(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Total allowable days from bar examination results to committee decision based on subcommittee report<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 277</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Appellant argues that the \u201cinitial investigation\u201d took over 60 days and that this must have delayed the subsequent steps in the process, but the fact remains that the final decision was well within the time allowed by the rule. Appellant\u2019s argument that his case <em>could </em>have been determined sooner may well have relevance to his other causes of action, but he has failed to establish an actual violation of rule X.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">There was no failure to discharge a mandatory duty within the meaning of Government Code section 815.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Third Cause of Action\u2014Negligence\u2014Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">In his third cause of action appellant alleges that the employees, McCloskey and Lobello, negligently and incompetently handled the investigation of appellant\u2019s good character.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>The gathering and preliminary analysis of evidence concerning appellant\u2019s moral character are integral parts of the process leading to the grant or denial of appellant\u2019s certification to the California Supreme Court to be admitted to the bar. Government Code section 818.4 provides; \u201cA public entity is not liable for an injury caused by the issuance, denial, suspension or revocation of, or by the failure or refusal to issue, deny, suspend or revoke, any permit, license, certificate, approval, order, or similar authorization where the public entity or an employee of the public entity is authorized by enactment to determine whether or not such authorization should be issued, denied, suspended or revoked.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">If the employees negligently performed the investigation, they and the committee and State Bar are nevertheless immune from liability under these specific statutes. In conducting investigations of the moral character of applicants, the committee necessarily operates through employees. The gathering of evidence is an integral part of the committee\u2019s determination to certify to the Supreme Court that the applicant is of good moral character. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6046, 6049, 6060, subd. (b), 6062, subd. m_</p>\n<p id=\"b794-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>An analogous case is <em>Whitcombe </em>v. <em>County of Yolo, </em>73 Cal.App.3d 698 [141 Cal.Rptr. 189]. In <em>Whitcombe, </em>the plaintiffs were assaulted and severely injured by one Gibson while Gibson was free on bail after his arrest for a second offense occurring while he was on probation for a prior offense. Plaintiffs sought damages from Gibson\u2019s probation officers for failure or neglect to conduct an adequate investigation following the second arrest to determine whether Gibson was a danger to society and whether his probation should be revoked. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 703.) The court held the employees were immune under Government Code section 845.8, subdivision (a), for \u201c[a]ny injury resulting from determining whether to parole or release a prisoner or from determining the terms and conditions of his parole or release or from determining whether to revoke his parole or release.\u201d As to the allegedly inadequate investigation, the court stated: \u201c[I]t appears to us patent that the acts complained of are integral to the ultimate basic policy decision not to revoke Gibson\u2019s probation.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 713.)</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Appellant contends the immunity is inapplicable to the employees because it is the committee (ultimately, the Supreme Court), not these employees, which is \u201cauthorized by enactment to determine whether or not such authorization should be issued, denied, suspended or revoked.\u201d He argues as if the immunity attaches only to the committee\u2019s evaluation of whatever evidence is placed before it by the staff, and contends the staff function is only ministerial. This argument is not persuasive. The same could have been said in <em>Whitcombe, </em>since the court, not the probation officer, determines whether probation shall be revoked. <em>Whitcombe </em>nevertheless held the specific statutory immunity applicable because conducting the investigation was an integral part of that process. In this case also, the committee\u2019s determination must be based on its investigation and its investigation can only be conducted through its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Appellant\u2019s own complaint alleges that McCloskey stated that it was his and Lobello\u2019s function to make a preliminary determination whether the investigation showed appellant should be certified forthwith or whether a hearing was necessary. This accords with what would reasonably be inferred even in the absence of such allegation, since in processing the thousands of applications for admission to the bar the committee would necessarily rely upon its staff to make a preliminary decision and recommendation as to which cases were routine and which cases required further study. We think that in such circumstances the immunity of sections 818.4 and 821.2 necessarily applies not merely to the final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>recommendation to the Supreme Court but also to the earlier stages of the investigation conducted by the staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">This case does not fall within the principle that the immunity of Government Code section 818.4 is inapplicable to <em>ministerial, nondiscretionary steps </em>in the licensing process <em>which steps themselves involve a mandatory duty within the meaning of Government Code section 815.6 (Morris </em>v. <em>County of Marin, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 901, 915). <em>Morris </em>involved the requirement of Labor Code section 3800 that a county, as a mandatory prerequisite of issuing a building permit, must obtain from the employer or contractor a certificate that he carriers workers\u2019 compensation insurance. No discretion whatsoever was involved in requiring or not requiring that certificate. Here, on the other hand, the manner in which the investigation was conducted and the conclusion whether further investigation or hearing was required involved substantial exercise of judgment. (See <em>Wyatt </em>v. <em>Arnot, </em>7 Cal.App. 221, 228 [94 P. 86] [the decision as to when a case is ready to be decided involves as much judgment as how it is to be decided].)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Our determination that the investigation is an integral part of the licensing process makes it unnecessary to engage in any analysis under <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>State of California, 69 </em>Cal.2d 782 [73 Cal.Rptr. 240, 447 P.2d 352], of whether the investigation involved the \u201cexercise of discretion\u201d vested in McCloskey and Lob ello for purposes of the <em>general </em>immunity for discretionary acts in Government Code section 820.2. <em>(Whitcombe </em>v. <em>County of Yolo, supra, </em>73 Cal.App.3d at pp. 712-713.) Instead, the <em>specific </em>immunity, section 818.4, controls. (Id.; <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>275 Cal.App.2d 134, 136 [79 Cal.Rptr. 757].)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Second Cause of Action\u2014No Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">In his second cause of action appellant alleges that when he filed the forms supplied by the committee and paid the required fee, a contract between him and the committee arose, an implied obligation of which was that the committee would process his application in a timely and competent manner. There is no merit to this cause of action. If an application for a license or permit and payment of the required fee created a contract that the application be handled in a certain manner, the immunity provided by Government Code sections 818.4 and 821.2 would be nullified. In receiving such an application, the public entity obviously lacks contractual intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>Fourth Cause of Action\u2014No Violation of Federal Constitutional Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Citing <em>Willner </em>v. <em>Committee on Character, </em>373 U.S. 96 [10 L.Ed.2d 224, 83 S.Ct. 1175], appellant contends his fourth cause of action states a valid complaint for violation of his federal constitutional rights in alleging that he was not adequately informed of the charges, or given copies of the evidence available to the committee, or given the right to confront Galland. <em>Willner </em>stands for the proposition that before a person may be deprived of the opportunity to practice law on the basis of charges by a person whose reliability and veracity is brought into question by the applicant, he must <em>at some stage of the proceedings </em>be given adequate notice of the reason for rejection, a hearing, and adequate opportunity to rebiit the charges, including the right of confrontation and cross-examination where appropriate. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 105 [10 L.Ed.2d at pp. 230-231] [opinion of the court], pp. 107-108 [10 L.Ed.2d at pp. 231-233] [cone. opn. of Goldberg, J.]; cf. <em>Walter </em>v. <em>State Bar, </em>2 Cal.3d 880, 890-891 [87 Cal.Rptr. 833, 471 P.2d 481].)</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">In this case, appellant had a hearing before a subcommittee of the State Bar which resulted in the favorable determination that appellant was of good moral character and should be certified for admission. Nothing in <em>Willner </em>suggests that information as to the nature of the charges or the right of confrontation must be granted <em>while the investigation is still being conducted. </em>Disguising the complaint as a federal civil rights action only obscures the real gravamen of appellant\u2019s claim, which is that the committee violated a mandatory duty to complete the investigation within a certain amount of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Fifth Cause of Action\u2014No \u201cBlackmail\u201d\u2014 Institution of Administrative Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">In his fifth cause of action appellant attempts to allege more than negligence and that the employees intentionally wronged him in two respects: (1) by attempting to \u201cblackmail\u201d appellant to pay money to Galland and (2) by convening an unnecessary hearing before the subcommittee in \u201cretaliation\u201d for appellant\u2019s filing of a mandamus action on September 2, 1976. Neither theory is valid in the particular circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Appellant\u2019s allegations of \u201cblackmail\u201d are entirely conclusionary and lack the showing of specific facts from which McCloskey\u2019s intent to blackmail appellant could reasonably be inferred. <em>Kapellas </em>v. <em>Kofman, </em>1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>Cal.3d 20, 29 [81 Cal.Rptr. 360, 459 P.2d 912], and <em>Maidman </em>v. <em>Jewish Publications, Inc., </em>54 Cal.2d 643, 653-654 [7 Cal.Rptr. 617, 335 P.2d 265, 87 A.L.R.2d 439], stand for the proposition that where a defendant\u2019s immunity or privilege is apparent from the face of the complaint, the plaintiff\u2019s allegations of actual malice to overcome the privilege must be supported by specific facts from which the trier of facts could reasonably conclude that the defendant acted for an improper motive unrelated to the privilege. (See also <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>State Bar, </em>268 Cal.App.2d 437, 444 [74 Cal.Rptr. 11] [facts constituting \u201cfraud\u201d must be alleged specifically]; <em>Selby Realty Co. </em>v. <em>City of San Buenaventura, </em>10 Cal.3d 110, 127 [109 Cal.Rptr. 799, 514 P.2d 111] [allegations of collusion unsupported by specific facts showing any actionable wrong add nothing to a complaint].) In <em>Kapellas </em>and <em>Maidman, </em>the plaintiffs alleged detailed facts showing a long history of animosity between the parties from which an improper motive for the publication of privileged defamatory matter could reasonably be deduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">Here the only specific fact remotely suggestive of the \u201cblackmail\u201d theory is that on August 24, 1976, when appellant telephoned McCloskey, \u201cDefendant McCloskey told plaintiff that he had spoken with Galland on the telephone and explained to plaintiff Galland\u2019s theories of wrongdoing by plaintiff. Defendant McCloskey then related to plaintiff what he thought would \u2018satisfy\u2019 Galland and suggested that plaintiff telephone Galland. Plaintiff refused, stating that, as important as his admission was, he would not be blackmailed into paying money to Galland and asked if the Committee was acting as a collection agency for Galland. Defendant McCloskey denied that he intended that result and suggested that defendant forward to Galland some inconsequential documents.\u201d The facts alleged show that McCloskey denied any improper intent and do not reasonably justify appellant\u2019s characterization of them as \u201cblackmail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">With respect to the \u201cretaliation\u201d theory, the complaint alleges the following facts: Appellant filed a mandamus action on September 2, 1976, and McCloskey was served with the petition on September 3. Later that day McCloskey telephoned appellant and \u201cmade statements substantially as follows: [If] (a) He (defendant McCloskey) had not read the Petition to avoid prejudicing him against plaintiff about whom he had to make some decision. [If] (b) After his discussion with [a certain witness], he was of the opinion that he could probably get the matter of plaintiff\u2019s admission resolved rather readily. [If] (c) He contemplated not even calling plaintiff because plaintiff brought an action he did not have to bring. He would play the litigation game though he did not want to, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>plaintiff was welcome to do so.\u201d The complaint further alleges on information and belief that after having been served with the petition McCloskey made the decision \u201cto recommend that plaintiff not be admitted forthwith but, instead, to convene a hearing before a subcommittee of the Committee\u201d and \u201cdecided to conduct a hearing in retaliation for the exercise by plaintiff of his right to bring a mandamus action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">The facts labeled (a) and (b) contradict any improper intent. On the other hand, an adverse inference as to McCloskey\u2019s intent might <em>possibly </em>be drawn from his statement that he \u201cwould play the litigation game\u201d and the fact that the matter was not \u201cresolved rather readily\u201d as stated in the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Even assuming, for purposes of discussion only, that a retaliatory motive might reasonably be inferred, the conduct involved is that McCloskey convened, or caused to be convened, a hearing before a subcommittee of the Committee of Bar Examiners. In other words, McCloskey instituted an administrative proceeding against appellant. Such conduct is specifically immunized by Government Code section 821.6, which provides: \u201cA public employee is not liable for injury caused by his <em>instituting </em>or prosecuting any judicial or <em>administrative proceeding </em>within the scope of his employment, <em>even if he acts maliciously and without probable cause.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The legislative committee comment to section 821.6 provides: \u201cThe California courts have repeatedly held public entities and public employees immune from liability for this sort of conduct. Dawson v. Martin, 150 Cal.App.2d 379, 309 P.2d 915 (1957) (public entities). White v. Towers, 37 Cal.2d 727, 235 P.2d 209 (1951); Coverstone v. Davies, 38 Cal.2d 315, 239 P.2d 876 (1952); Hardy v. Vial, 48 Cal.2d 577, 311 P.2d 494 (1957) (public employees). This section continues the existing immunity of public employees; and, because no statute imposes liability on public entities for malicious prosecution, public entities likewise are immune from liability.\u201d (Legis. com. comment\u2014Senate; <em>Blackburn </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>42 Cal.App.3d 175, 177-178 [116 Cal.Rptr. 622].)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">As expressly stated in the statute, this immunity applies to administrative as well as judicial proceedings. <em>(Hardy </em>v. <em>Vial, </em>48 Cal.2d 577, 580-583 [311 P.2d 494].) The theory supporting such immunity is obviously that the administrative agencies regulating businesses and the professions in the public interest must be protected against suit in order to encourage fearless enforcement of their duties. <em>(Hardy </em>v. <em>Vial, supra, </em>48 Cal.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>pp. 582-583. See also <em>Imig </em>v. <em>Ferrar, </em>70 Cal.App.3d 48, 55-56 [138 Cal.Rptr. 540] [absolute privilege for defamation in instituting administrative proceedings].) The wisdom of the determination that the individual interest must give way to the public interest in law enforcement in such cases is not before us, since the Legislature has clearly made that choice in section 821.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">We conclude no valid cause of action is stated in the complaint.
