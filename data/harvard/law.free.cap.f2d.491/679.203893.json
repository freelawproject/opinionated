United States v. White, 483 F.2d 71 (5th Cir. 1973) ; United States v. Frontero, 452 F.2d 406, 416 (5th Cir. 1971); <em>see </em>McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-21\">At the time of sentencing on October 29, 1973, however, upon inquiry from the Court, the District Attorney recited the facts and evidence in a procedure that we have held to fully comply with Rule 11. United States v. Bethany, 489 F.2d 91 (5th Cir. 1974). Warren v. United States, 488 F.2d 862 (5th Cir. 1974) . The defendants were given an opportunity at that time to withdraw their pleas, but declined to do so. A few days later on November 2, 1973, the judgment was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-23\">The record shows, therefore, that prior to entering judgment, the Court satisfied itself as to the factual basis for the plea by an acceptable method in compliance with Rule 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-24\">Rule 11 provides that \u201cthe Court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
