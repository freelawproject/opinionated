Although the evidence does not satisfactorily show that the plaintiff would have received more for his property,\" had he dealt directly with the parties to whom the defendants eventually caused part of the plaintiff\u2019s property to be conveyed, it nevertheless shows that the defendants secretly obtained an interest in the transaction which was hostile to that of their principal. The judgment herein, which in effect directs the return of the commission which the defendants received as agents for the plaintiff, ,is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-16\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
