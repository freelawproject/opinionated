By an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>order of the City Court, the defendant was directed to make her counterclaim more definite and certain by alleging that the proposed sale was legal under the laws of Missouri, by alleging whether the proposed customer was ready, able, and willing to' buy the property free and clear of all liens, or otherwise, and by stating in detail the reasons which caused the proposed customer to refuse to purchase the property. Appeal is taken from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"AlA\">The legality of the proposed sale is not relevant to the cause of action set up in the counterclaim. The cause of action there alleged is not a contract of sale, but a contract to give a legal opinion, and the correctness of the opinion is irrelevant to the issue. The direction that the defendant state whether the proposed customer was ready, willing, and able to buy the property free and clear of all liens requires an unnecessary particularity in the counterclaim, unless, as the learned court below apparently believed, the legality of a sale free from liens was relevant to the cause of action. From what has already been stated, it is clear that this fact is irrelevant. The reasons which caused the proposed customer to refuse to complete his sale have already been sufficiently stated in the counterclaim, and greater detail in stating these reasons seems unnecessary in pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">For these reasons, therefore, the order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. s All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
