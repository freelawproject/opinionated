New York, and the wife of H. L. Liebmann (of a given address), but at times living separate from him, and recently residing at 501 West 115th street, \u201cbut she has removed her things from the said address,\u201d and that he had made diligent effort to locate her, but the place of her sojourn could not be found, and, if she is in the city of New York, she avoids service, so that personal service could not be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Obviously, these assertions, based upon assurance, rather than known facts, were a scanty substitute for the particulars required by section 32 of the Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, p. 1500, c. 580), and upon scrutiny would hardly have satisfied the learned justice who granted the order. The motion resulting in the order here appealed from rested,. however, not merely upon the infirmities of the original papers, but also upon an affidavit by the defendant\u2019s trustee, deposing upon knowledge that the defendant is not a resident of New York, but that she for a year has been a resident of Berlin, Germany, information of which he had given the plaintiff\u2019s attorney two months ago. Manifestly enough, the judgment should not stand. It might not, however, be set aside in such fashion; the remedy respecting the judgment being by appeal. Sections 310, 311, Municipal Court Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u25a0In so far as the motion was for opening the default, it was cognizable by the learned justice. But an order opening a default is not appeal-able, and this appeal must be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Appeal dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
