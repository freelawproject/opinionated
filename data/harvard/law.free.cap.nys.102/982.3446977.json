The learned counsel for the appellant then excepted to that part of the charge wherein the court said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-27\">\u201cIf the plaintiff received an electrical shock when he stepped on the tracks, he is entitled to recover.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>The court then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-5\">\u201cI will modify that to the extent that, if he was injured by an electrical shock which he received by stepping upon the tracks, he is entitled to recover.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">The defendant then excepted to the charge as given and to the modification. I think that the exceptions were well taken. The action was for negligence; that is, for a breach of the legal duty to use the care due under the circumstances. The defendant offered evidence, described by the learned court in its charge, <em>\u201cto </em>the conditions of the track there, and the opinions of their experts as to the impossibility of an electrical shock being transmitted, except under certain conditions which must have been present, and which they claim were not present.\u201d And yet the court charged, \u201cwhether the defendant has exonerated itself or not,\u201d if the jury believed that the plaintiff received the shock he is entitled to recover, or, in other words, that the defendant was an insurer, and that the sole question was whether the accident had resulted from the shock. It had not ruled as matter of law that there was no evidence that exonerated or tended to exonerate the defendant, and then but left'to the jury as questions of fact the happening of the accident from the cause alleged, and of the damages, but had submitted the entire case, charging as the law that, even if the testimony did exonerate the defendant, it was liable. It is quite true that the doctrine of \u201cres ipsa loquitur\u201d was applicable. Clarke v. Nassau Electric R. R. Co., 9 App. Div. 51, 41 N. Y. Supp. 78. But as we said in that case, per Willard Bartlett, J.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-7\">\u201cThe doctrine of \u2018res ipsa loquitur\u2019 simply calls upon the defendant, after proof of the accident, to give such evidence as will exonerate him, if any there be, and relieves the plaintiff from the burden of proving the nonexistence of an adequate explanation or excuse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">See, too, Rudwig v. Metropolitan St. R. Co., 174 N. Y. 546, 67 N. E. 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">The learned counsel for the appellant insists that in any event the error was cured or waived in that thereafter the defendant requested the court to charge, and the court in effect charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-10\">\u201cThat the plaintiff has got to prove by satisfactory evidence that any injury he received was due <em>to </em>an electrical shock, * * * and that the jury have no right to theorize or speculate, and that the evidence must be positive evidence, and not probable or theorizing evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-11\">These instructions related to the cause of the injury and the requisite proof thereof, and in no way affected the question which I have discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">I advise that a new trial be ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
