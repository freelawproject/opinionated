The learned trial judge, however, charged the juryMhat the allegation in the defendant\u2019s answer that the charge is true may be considered by the jury as an aggravation of damages. This charge should have been qualified by a direction that the reiteration of the slander in the answer shall be considered in aggravation of damages, provided that \u201cthe circumstances evince that the reiteration of the slander in the answer was done maliciously and without probable cause for believing it true.\u201d Distin v. Rose, 69 N. Y. <em>122. </em>Since the slander was uttered only to the plaintiff\u2019s employer, who continued to employ the plaintiff as a furniture salesman after the slander was uttered, the verdict of $1,000 which the jury awarded to the plaintiff seems to have been influenced, as to its amount, by the error in the charge of the learned trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">GILDERSLEEVE,'J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b596-12\">DAYTON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASlZ\">(dissenting). Assuming-that the trial judge was technically in error in charging the jury that the defendant\u2019s answer, alleging the truth of the slander, might be considered by them in aggravation of damages, I do not discover that the exception taken relates to the use of these words, or of the word \u201caggravation.\u201d ^ It seems to me, also, that the discussion of the charge before the retirement of the jury, taken in connection with the entire charge, resulted in a fair submission of the only question at issue, viz., the amount of exemplary damages for a practically admitted slander. I do not consider the verdict excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
