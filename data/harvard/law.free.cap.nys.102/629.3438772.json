There was evidence which would have sustained a finding that both parties agreed upon a sale on the basis testified to by the defendant, and that the amount which defendant, in form, agreed to pay was the result of an error of calculation. If this should be found to be the case, since the position of plaintiff has not been changed in consequence of the error, there is no reason why the mistake should not now be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. *</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
