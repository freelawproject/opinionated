The agreement was kept a secret, and to all outward appearances there was no change in the relations of the parties, who continued to live together the same as they had done before. The learned justice presiding at the trial has found upon sufficient evidence that it was not the purpose of either spouse at the time of executing the agreement to live separate and apart. Under these circumstances such a contract cannot be enforced in equity. Westmeath v. Salisbury, 5 Bligh, 338; Zimmer v. Settle, 124 N. Y. 37, 36 N. E. 341, 31 Am. St. Rep. 638; Carson v. Murray, 3 Paige, 483-501; Hughes v. Cuming, 36 App. Div. 307, 55 N. Y. Supp. 356. It is urged, however, by the learned counsel for the plaintiff that, in view of another finding that \u201cthe sole purpose of the execution of the agreement was to secure to the wife a legal division of the property of the husband,\u201d the case of a valid and enforceable agreement between the parties is presented. We are unable to concur in this view. The domestic relations law (section 31, c. 373, p. 330, Laws 1896), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">\u201cA married woman has all the rights in respect to property, real or personal, and the acquisition, use, enjoyment and disposition, thereof, and to make contracts in respect thereto with any person including her husband, * * * but a husband and wife cannot contract to alter or dissolve the marriage or to relieve the husband from his liability to support his wife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">This is precisely what the parties to this agreement sought to do. In consideration of certain payments proposed to be made by the husband, his wife agreed to accept the same in full satisfaction for her support and maintenance, and to relieve him from any and all claims she may have upon his personal property, and the trustee on his part agreed to save the husband free from all debts due or payments incurred by the wife. Such an agreement under the guise of a separation agreement is in contravention of the statute and void. I am not unmindful of the recent decision of this court (Reardon v. Woerner, 111 App. Div. 359, 97 N. Y. Supp. 747) in which it was held that an action would lie to enforce the condition of a contract of separation, but that case is distinguishable from this, in that the husband and wife had actually separated and the contract was made to insure the support and protection of the wife, while in the case at bar there was no separation and none was contemplated when the contract was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
