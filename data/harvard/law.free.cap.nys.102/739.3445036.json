Although the plaintiff may also have been influenced by certain false promises as to future transactions, which the defendant made, it is evident that the controlling considerations which induced the plaintiff to part with his money were the defendant\u2019s fraudulent' representations regarding existent facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-21\">The judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
