This was unimpeached, and might not be disregarded. Nor could it be offset by the testimony of the defendant, which, if credited, would evidence a theft of the note from the defendant maker; for the taker of a negotiable instrument, complete and regular upon its face, before it be overdue; in good .faith and for value, and having no notice of any infirmity in the instrument or defect in the title of the person negotiating it, has good title in the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>from whom he takes it, even though that person may have acquired it by fraud, theft, or robbery. The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
