H. Munroe, deceased, confers upon her executors an implied power to sell her real estate; for it is obvious and conceded that the will contains no express power of sale. Upon the determination of that question depends the other which is whether or not the defendant shall be required to accept the deed tendered him by the plaintiffs in fullfilment of their contract to convey to him a piece of real estate in the city of New York. The general rule is not questioned that a power of sale will be implied when the manifest intent of the testator requires that the real estate should be sold and converted into money in order to carry into effect the provisions of the will. Although the question has been presented and discussed in many cases, no real advantage is to be derived from citing and comparing them, because in each case the application of the established rule must depend upon the particular provisions of the will under examination.</p>\n<p id=\"A6Jt\">Mrs. Munroe\u2019s will gives all of her estate, real and personal, to plaintiffs as trustees, with instructions to divide the same into as many equal portions or parts as there may be children of hers living at her decease, or who, having predeceased her, shall have left lawful issue remaining at the time of her decease, setting apart for such issue of each child so deceased the share or shares to which its or their parents would have been entitled if living. The disposition of the several shares by the trustees is thus provided for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">\u201cThat they shall pay over to each of m'y sons other than John Munroe, his part or portion to be held in each case by him, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns to his and their use and behoof forever. * * * -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\">\u201cThe part or portion of my son John Munroe my trustees under this my will shall hold and manage in such manner as they shall judge beneficial for him. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-10\">\u201cThe portion or parts of such sum set apart for the use and benefit of my daughters my trustees under this my will shall hold and m\u00e1nage in such manner as they shall judge beneficial for my said daughters. * * * And upon the. death of each of my said daughters my said trustees shall pay over in each case the portion or part of said fund then held by them for the benefit of my said daughter so dying to such person or persons as my said-daughter, so dying, may by her last will and testament in writing direct and appoint to receive the same, and in case of failure of my daughter so to direct and appoint then my said trustees shall pay over such portion or part of said fund so held by them. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">In case of issue of testatrix\u2019s children who predecease her, the direction is that, when such issue shall arrive at the age of 21 years, the trustees \u201cshall pay over to such grandchild its proportion of all the fund held by my trustees in trust for the benefit of such lawful issue so surviving at said age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">Finally, in the fourth clause of the will, is to be found this significant paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>\u201cUpon all sales which may be made by me (sic) -trustees I will and declare that the receipts o\u00a3 my trustees shall exempt the purchaser or purchasers from being answerable for the misapplication or nonapplication of the purchase money, or being concerned to see the application thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-3\">An examination and analysis of the will discloses as the clear, controlling scheme adopted by the testator that the estate shall be divided into separate parts or portions, one for each child, and throughout the instrument she uses words which are aptly used if her intention is found to be that her estate shall be converted into money, but are in many instances quite inconsistent with the idea that any part of it should be retained in the form of real estate. Where she provides that certain of her sons shall take their shares outright, her direction is that her trustees shall \u201cpay over\u201d to each son his part or portion. These words are peculiarly applicable where the subject of transfer is money, and would be entirely inapplicable to a transfer or conveyance of real estate. So, in case of a daughter who dies, the direction is that the trustees shall \u201cpay over\u201d the portion or part of said \u201cfund\u201d then held by them for the benefit of the daughter, and a similar provision is made with respect to grandchildren, to whom, on the attainment of their majority, are to be \u201cpaid over\u201d their respective proportions of \u201call the fund\u201d then held by the trustees for their benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"AjN\">It is thus found that throughout the entire will the part or portion allotted to a beneficiary is designated as a \u201cfund,\u201d and whenever the trustees are to transfer any part of the estate to a beneficiary the invariable mandate is to \u201cpay over.\u201d The will is conventional in form, is couched in well-chosen language, and seems to be an instrument to which may well be applied that rule of testamentary construction which requires that words shall be taken in their primary and customary sense. A \u201cfund,\u201d as generally understood and defined, means a sum of money, and as has already been said we commonly use the words \u201cpay over\u201d with reference to money, and never as the equivalent of the conveyance or transfer of real estate. We thus find that the will uniformly uses words which are applicable to money, and seldom or never uses words which are applicable to the transfer of real estate. The conclusion is irresistible that it was the intention of the testatrix that her estate should be converted into money, or its equivalent in personal property, and that is was no part of her intention that so much of her estate as consisted of real estate should be retained as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">It follows that to carry out this intention the real estate must be sold, and an implied power of sale, therefore, rests in the trustees. We do not consider that the existence of this implied power is involved in any such doubt as would impose upon a purchaser a clouded title, or one which is unmarketable.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">The plaintiffs are entitled to judgment that the defendant perform his contract of purchase. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
