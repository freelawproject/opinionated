His contention must be sustained, for such receiver, under subdivision 1 of section 2468 of the Code of Civil Procedure, acquires no title to real property nor power to sell and convey (Nat. Bank v. Bussing, 147 N. Y. 665, 670, 42 N. E. 345; Chadeayne v. Gwyer, 83 App. Div. 403, 82 N. Y. Supp. 198, while it was the duty of the plaintiff, the judgment creditor, to exhaust his remedy by execution before resorting to these proceedings (First Nat. Bank of Canandaigua v. Martin, 49 Hun, 571, 2 N. Y. Supp. 315) otherwise \u201cit would be a practical repeal of the statutes providing for the sale of real estate under a judgment.\u201d (Albany City Nat. Bank v.
