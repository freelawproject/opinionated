The action is for an assault by the defendant\u2019s servants upon the plaintiff when a passenger on one of defendant\u2019s cars. I think a bill of particulars is proper in this case to reach justice and to afford the defendant fair opportunity for preparation to m'eet the issue. Dwight v. Germania Life Ins. Co., 84 N. Y. 493. The defendant is a corporation which works many cars and employs a large number of men. An allegation that on or about a certain day, when the plaintiff was a passenger on a car on a specified line on a specified street, he was assaulted by the defendant, its conductor, agents, servants, and employ\u00e9s in charge of said car, is indefinite to the extent that it leaves the defendant in the dark as to the day, the time of day, the car, or the servants, and requires a minute, searching, and laborious investigation by the defendant before it can throw any light upon the alleged occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">The bill requires the plaintiff to name \u201cthe.place and exact time of day that the accident (sic) happened, and also direction the car was going.\u201d There is nothing unreasonable in these requirements. The information not only serves to locate and specify the occurrence, but also the car, and consequently those in charge of it, as it is common \u2022knowledge that the defendant keeps a record of its cars, their trips, and the particular servants in charge of each of them. See Kerch v. Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg R. R. Co., 14 N. Y. St. Rep. 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-16\">The bill also requires the number of the car, line, and badge number \u2022of the motorman and conductor. This is but to specify the car among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>the many worked by the defendant, and to identify the servants out of the many employed by it. In Shepard v. Wood, 102 N. Y. Supp. 306, decided in this court January 25, 1907, Gaynor, J., for the court, says in discrimination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">\u201cThis is not like the case of a street car accident, where the company may require the hour of the day in order to identify the car out of many cars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">If the plaintiff knew the names of the servants, he could be required to give them. See Causullo v. Lenox Construction Co., 106 App. Div. 575, 576, 94 N. Y. Supp. 639. Of course, it is not essential to complaint or recovery that the plaintiff should give the numbers of the servants, or their names; but that is not the question. If he knew the numbers, there is no good reason why he should not furnish the information, and there are many reasons which I have indicated why he should do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">I think that the plaintiff should not be required to give the \u201cexact statement of injuries claimed to have been sustained\u201d by him, or \u201cthe nature, extent, and effects of same\u201d; for there is no allegation of permanent injuries. English v. Westchester Electric R. Co., 69 App. Div. 576, 75 N. Y. Supp. 45; Steinau v. Metropolitan Street R. Co., 63 App. Div. 126, 71 N. Y. Supp. 256. The requirements of a setting forth of the length of time the plaintiff was confined to bed and house, the amounts paid for doctor\u2019s bills and medicines, the nature of his business, average earnings, and the time of his detention from work, are proper. Steinau v. Metropolitan St. R. Co., supra; O\u2019Neill v. Interurban St. Ry. Co., 87 App. Div. 556, 84 N. Y. Supp. 505; Ziadi v. Interurban St. Ry. Co., 97 App. Div. 137, 89 N. Y. Supp. 606, and cases cited. In the case last cited we said, per Hooker, J.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">\u201cIf the plaintiff should be unable to furnish any of this information, or to furnish it completely, he should be directed to state such lack of knowledge or inability as a substitute for the information requested by \u2022 the demand, Schwartz v. Green (Sup.) 14 N. Y. Supp. 833.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">The order must be modified as indicated, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
