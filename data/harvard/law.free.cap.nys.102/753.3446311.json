Whether the plaintiff had agreed to make and deliver the garments or return the skins on or before November 29th, so that his failure so to do worked breach, and thus liability upon contract for damages therefor, was a fact to be determined, and determined as it has been by the trial justice warrants no interference by this court, liable though the plaintiff may be in a proper action for the return of the skins or their value upon demand made.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
