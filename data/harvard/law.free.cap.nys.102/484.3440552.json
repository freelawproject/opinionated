Bonner\u2019s Sons,\u201d and that the plaintiff delivered to the copartnership certain goods, and that the copartnership, although requested, has refused to redeliver these goods. The plaintiff obtained the order appealed from for the purpose of determining what person \"or persons should be joined with Bonner as codefendants in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The complaint states a cause of action sounding in tort. Section 723 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which authorizes the court, in certain circumstances, to add the name of a party or to correct a mistake in such name, applies only ,to cases where such party is necessary or interested in the event of the action, which is not the case where two or more joint tort-feasors are severally liable. Heff\u00e9rn v. Hunt, 8 App. Div. 585, 40 N. Y. Supp. 914; Ten Eyck v. Keller, 99 App. Div. 106, 91 N. Y. Supp. 169. Since the information sought by the order appealed from would be unavailing to the plaintiff, it follows that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
