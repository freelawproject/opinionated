Kohler, 41 N. Y. <em>42, </em>45), aided in no small measure by proof that the defendant at the time was there engaged under contract in regulating and grading Walton avenue. Furthermore, being an interested witness, denial of authority by the defendant was by no means conclusive, and of knowledge particularly ; his foreman and timekeeper, who he said would not permit, and who would inform him of the fact, being present, but not called. In view of the evidence and of justice, the cause should be retried.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
