At the time he was struck by an engine of the defendant \"he was obviously not acting in the performance of his dutjq which, as appears from the evidence, might and could have been performed from a position of safety. That through negligence or negligent ignorance he stood at the time of the accident in a position of danger, without any emergency or exigency therefor, does not entitle him to recover from the defendant, even if it were negligent, because he was himself at fault. Keeler v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co. (Sup.) 100 N. Y. Supp. 235. The verdict in favor of the plaintiff was therefore properly set aside, and the order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-19\">Order affirmed, with costs.
