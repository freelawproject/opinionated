Defendant admits that it entered \"into possession, but denies the agreement. On the trial this \u2022singular attitude was revealed by defendant\u2019s objection to. the lease in \u2022evidence on the ground\u2014that, having described themselves in the lease as. a corporation, plaintiffs cannot claim to be otherwise. The trial justice in. substance excluded the lease and found for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-16\">That- unusual instrument does say, \u201cJay,-Morris &amp; Co.,' Incorporated,;\u201d\u2018but ut is not signed by a corporation, but by each of the part<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>ners forming the copartnership of Jay, Morris &amp; vo., and by the defendant, a corporation. It is so clear that none of the parties has been misled by the word \u201cIncorporated\u201d inserted after the lessors\u2019 names, it is so manifest that for about two years- this defendant has understood that it was not dealing with an incorporated landlord, and it is so well settled that the defendant has been and will continue to be absolutely protected in paying rent to its landlord, that we feel impelled to reverse the judgment, with costs to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Judgment reversed, with costs to the appellant, and judgment absolute for the sum of $210 and costs in the court below given for the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
