The action is brought on a promissory note made by the defendant to the order of one McCuaig, which note was indorsed to the Sovereign Bank of Canada for value before maturity. This much is conceded, and the bank thus became the owner in due course of business, and the note was unquestionably a valid obligation in the hands of the bank, regardless of equities between the maker and McCuaig. The answer alleges that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-19\">The \u201cdefendant is informed and believes that the said Samuel Ludlow, ,Tr, the plaintiff in the above-entitled action, is not a bona fide owner and holder of said note, the subject of this action: that the said note, after maturity and payment, was delivered to the plaintiff by the Sovereign Bank of Canada for no value; and that the said plaintiff is maintaining this action for the benefit of said McCuaig, and is not the real party in interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-20\">The allegation that the plaintiff \u201cis not a bona fide owner and holder of said note\u201d is clearly a conclusion of law not admitted by the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>murrer, and the further allegation \u201cthat the plaintiff is maintaining this action for the benefit of said McCuaig, and is not the real party in interest,\u201d is subject to the same comment. Twelfth Ward Bank v. Brooks, 63 App. Div. 220, 71 N. Y. Supp. 388. The Code of Civil Procedure requires (section 500) that the answer must contain a \u201cstatement of any new matter constituting a defense or counterclaim, in ordinary and concise language without repetition\u201d; and the mere affirmative allegation of conclusions of law does not meet this requirement. And the very vague and indefinite allegation \u201cthat the said note after maturity and payment was delivered to the plaintiff by the Sovereign Bank of Canada for- no value\u201d is not stating new matter constituting a defense in that \u201cordinary and concise language\u201d which common fairness and good pleading demand. There is no allegation as to who made the payment, or that any 8ne in fact made a payment, and the fact that the note may have been transferred to the plaintiff, without consideration, by the bank which had come into possession of the same in due course, is not a defense to this action, in the absence of some allegation that the plaintiff was a party to the alleged fraudulent inception of the note. The bank, as the owner and holder of the note in due course, as between the plaintiff and defendant, had a perfect right to transfer the same without consideration. The plaintiff merely stands in the shoes of the Sovereign Bank of Canada, and the latter concededly came into possession of the note in such a manner as to be relieved of the equities between the maker of the note and Mc-Cuaig. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The interlocutory judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">MCLAUGHLIN and SCOTT, JJ., concur. PATTERSON, P. J., and HOUGHTON,i J., dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
