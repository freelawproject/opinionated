The pleadings were oral; the plaintiff complaining for \u201cbalance for wages, $65.\u201d The defendant offered no proof upon the trial, and at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case moved for a dismissal of the complaint, upon the ground that the same was prematurely brought. This motion was granted, and the complaint dismissed, without prejudice to a new action.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s testimony showed that he was employed on March 17, 1906, at the agreed monthly wages of $70, and that he was discharged on March <em>22, </em>1906; the defendant paying him the amount of wages earned up to that time. The plaintiff claims that the action was brought for breach of contract, and that therefore, although the action was begun prior to the termination of the plaintiff\u2019s term of employment, the case not having been tried until after such termination, recovery could be had. Everson v. Powers, 89 N. Y. 527,. <em>42 </em>Am. Rep. 319. This would be true, if the cause of action set up was a breach of contract, as the contract of hiring was broken at the time the defendant was discharged; but the complaint set up a claim for \u201cbalance for wages, $65,\u201d and the testimony of the plaintiff was that he was hired by the month, and that there remained due him as wages at the agreed price for his services the sum. of $65.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">It is claimed that the plaintiff\u2019s bill of particulars indicates that the cause of action is for a breach of contract; but a bill of particulars does not constitute a cause of action, nor can it change it, and, if we could regard a bill of particulars as part of a complaint, the one in the case at bar is as susceptible of a construction in support of a claim for balance due on wages as for a breach of contract, and, as before stated, the theory of the trial was to recover for a balance due as wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">The plaintiff had no cause of action for wages when the action was begun, and the dismissal of the complaint was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
