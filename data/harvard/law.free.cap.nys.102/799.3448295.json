The plaintiff testified that, when he reached Third avenue, <em>\u201cI </em>crossed right through and got knocked by the car.\u201d Upon being asked if he saw anything, he said, \u201cI did not see anything.\u201d Upon cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>he testified that he \u201cdid not see anything,\u201d that he did not see the car before it struck him, that it was in bright daylight, and that he could see a distance of at least 10 blocks north and south at that point on the avenue. Under such circumstances it cannot be said that the plaintiff absolved himself from the charge of negligence. It has frequently been held under such circumstances that, even if a plaintiff has looked for a car, but failed to observe one, he is not, therefore, free from negligence. In the case at bar there is no evidence that he made the slightest effort to look for an approaching car, and he swears that he did not at any time see the car until it struck him.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The case of Duffy v. Int. St. Ry. Co., 101 N. Y. Supp. 767, referred to by respondent, has no application, in that there the plaintiff was a pedestrian at a crossing, and the complaint had been dismissed, in which case the testimony of the plaintiff is to be taken as true, and Mr. Justice Fitzgerald very properly said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-6\">\u201cIt floes not seem * * * it can be held, that a person who attempts to cross a street * * * with but 15 feet to pass over in order to reach a place of safety at a time when a car is approaching at a distance of 125 feet is as a matter of law guilty of contributory negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">DOWLING, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
