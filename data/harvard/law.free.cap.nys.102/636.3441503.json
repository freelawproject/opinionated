Meantime, however, defendant had changed attorneys and moved to be relieved from this stipulation and order, to which motion plaintiff replied by asking that the order stand or that a new order for inspection be made. The court set aside the former stipulation and order and denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The action is for services rendered by the plaintiff to defendant as its general manager in.the music publishing business. The answer, in addition to the denials, sets up a counterclaim of 50 odd items of money, specific dates and amounts of which are given, which it is alleged the plaintiff misappropriated, aggregating in all the sum of $2,745.81. The particularity with which these items are set forth indicates that presumably they must appear upon defendant\u2019s books of account, and such is claimed to be the fact. The consent of defendant\u2019s former counsel that plaintiff might examine defendant\u2019s books would seem to have been entirely proper. Such inspection would necessarily facilitate the trial by determining what could be admitted and what would be controverted. There are a large number of items and an inspection under such circumstances is as much for the benefit of the trial court as for the party himself, for it tends to eliminate uncontested issues. The fact that there have been two mistrials without inspection is not a reason for now withholding it. On the contrary,' it may tend toward the bringing about of a trial which will finally settle the controversy. It is possible that the consent of counsel for defendant ro an order for inspection, he not being the attorney of record, was not binding, and that for that reason the order entered after he had ceased to be counsel should have been set aside. The court, however, should have granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for inspection of the defendant\u2019s books mentioned in and according to the form of the order which was set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements,, and plaintiff\u2019s motion for inspection granted as indicated. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
