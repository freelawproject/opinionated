Section 872 prescribes what the affidavit on which an order for such an examination is asked for must contain. Subdivision 4 thereof requires that the affidavit \u201cset forth\u201d that the testimony of the person to be examined \u201cis material. and necessary for the party making such application or the prosecution, and if the action is to recover damages for personal injuries, that the defendant is ignorant of the nature and extent of such personal injuries.\u201d . This is supplemented by rule 82 of the General Rules of Practice, which requires that the affidavit \u201cspecify the facts and circumstances\u201d which show, the examination to be \u201cmaterial and necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">When the affidavit fulfills these requirements, as it does in this case, the party is entitled to have tire examination; the order for it \u201cmust\u201d be granted (section 873). The courts have no power or right to set up other requirements. The code provisions are plain. They were designed for a useful and sometimes necessary purpose which should not be frustrated but served. The administration of justice is best served by revelation of the truth, not by concealment and surprise. A lawsuit is not a game for sharp advantages. Only good can come from bringing out the facts. It is not these provisions that are complex, but varying and contrary judicial opinions which have construed them and assumed to' curtail them. These decisions are no longer precedents. We have come back to the simple proposition that a party to an action is entitled to and should have this examination of another party thereto who has knowledge of facts material to the issue, for use on the trial.

Supp. 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and stay vacated. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
