In performance the plaintiff contractor put the drills down to the very level required \u201cand by blastings blowed below the drilling and broke it up.\u201d The rock thus loosened, although below the level required by the drawings and specifications, the architect required cleaned off in the trenches, in order to build the foundations upon solid rock, as plaintiff knew it must be \u201cas a result of his experience as an excavator for 16 years.\u201d For the removal, cleaning off, or excavation of the loose rock which came by blasting to a depth uncalled for, the plaintiff charged, and has recovered compensation as for extra work.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">This was error. That by the method of doing the work he broke up, and so had to remove, more material than was required or desired, is no ground for extra compensation; but in this case the reverse. The ingenious and ingeniously argued contentions that he could not do the work otherwise than he did, that he did it according to custom, and that performance substantially as agreed would have cost him more, or even too much, avail the plaintiff nothing\". It is matter of common observation in this town that rock, seamy and solid, is' excavated to depths and lines with noticeable, nicety. No custom obtains in derogation of express covenant. What performance according to his undertaking would cost was his lookout before he undertook performance. By providing for its reduction to the amount of really extra work, and some there was, ordered by the architect, the judgment might be modified, and be allowed to stand as modified, but for a counterclaim interposed by the defendants for additional expense to which they were subjected in building the greater amount of foundation wall made necessary by the unnecessary excavation. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.
