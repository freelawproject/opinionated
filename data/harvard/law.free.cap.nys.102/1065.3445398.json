The original order was defective, and the learned justice at Special Term sought to remedy the defect by an order providing that a commission issue in which no person was named as commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-20\">Authority to take the testimony of a witness upon interrogatories is found in section 887 of the Code of Civil Procedure. That section provides that the person to whom it is issued shall be named therein. Because of .the failure to do this, the order from yzhich, thq appeal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>taken is dearly defective. Hemenway v. Knudson, 73 Hun, 337, 35 N. Y. Supp. 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">The order must therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and plaintiff\u2019s motion to vacate and set aside the order for a commission granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
