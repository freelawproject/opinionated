But, even if the covenant be construed as an entire one against nuisances, it did prevent the erection of stores and tenements, because it prevented the erection of a store or tenement one story in height, and it prevented the erection of a building without a cellar, and it restricted the cost to not less than $3,500. The contract provided that the premises should be free and clear, except as to existing covenants as to nuisances, if any there might be, which did not, however, prevent the erection of stores or tenements.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The owner contracted to give a clear title, except as specified. The title which he tendered was not clear, but was burdened with a covenant which prevented the free use of the property for stores or tenements. This was contrary to the agreement, and the respondent was justified in rejecting the title, unless the fact of the deed containing the objectionable covenant being on record precludes him from so doing. I do not think it does. The contract of sale did not specify a covenant in any particular deed. It speaks generally of covenants against nuisances, if any there are. The owner took the responsibility of contracting absolutely for a clear title, except that, if there were any covenants against nuisances, they should not operate against the building of stores or tenements. If the contract had provided that the premises were to be taken subject to'a covenant against nuisances in a specified deed, then the purchaser at his peril must have examined the deed. Such was the situation in Feltenstein v. Ernst, 49 Misc. Rep. 262, 97 N. Y. Supp. 376, affirmed 113 App. Div. 903, 98 N. Y. Supp. 1101, and in Blanck v. Sadlier, 153 N. Y. 551, 47 N. E. 920, 40 L. R. A. 666. In each of those cases the premises were to be taken subject to a specified mortgage, and it was held that, the mortgages being recorded, it was incumbent upon the vendee, in the absence of fraud or deceit, to acquaint himself with the particular terms of the specified incumbrance. In the present case no particular covenant in any specified deed is mentioned, but it is simply provided in general terms that, if there be any covenant, it shall be of a specified kind. The owner knew what the covenant was, and carelessly contracted as to its terms. The vendee had no actual knowledge, and it does not seem to me that he had constructive notice, or that he was put upon his inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">I think the judgment was right, and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>MCLAUGHLIN, SCOTT, and LAMBERT, JJ\u201e concur. PATTERSON, P. J., concurs, on the ground that the covenant is more than one against nuisances, and therefore the purchaser should not be compelled to take.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
