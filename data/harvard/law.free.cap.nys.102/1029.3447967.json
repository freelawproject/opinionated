On the contrary, the only proof bearing on that subject is that the defendant received for dues from August, 1893, to December, 1895, both inclusive, the sum of $41,027.38, of which the 40 per cent, applicable for withdrawals under the articles of association amounted to $16,410.94. Out of this fund 31 shareholders who had filed notices prior to the plaintiff, and whose claims aggregated $7,423.-73, first had to be paid; and it is impossible to determine from the record when the fund was sufficient to pay the plaintiff, and in the absence of proof bearing on that subject it must be assumed to be at the end of the period during which it is stipulated the sum was accumulated, viz., December, 1895. Therefore we think interest did not commence to run until January 1, 1896.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">The judgment, therefore, should be modified, by allowing interest on the principal sum which the plaintiff was entitled to withdraw\u2014 $840\u2014from January 1, 1896; and, as thus modified, the same should be affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
