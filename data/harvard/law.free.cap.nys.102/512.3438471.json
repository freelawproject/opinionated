The jury in the court below rendered a verdict in favor of plaintiff, and from the judgment entered thereon, and the order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"AP-q\">The principal act of negligence charged by the plaintiff was the starting of the car while the plaintiff was in the act of alighting therefrom, and before she had been given a reasonable opportunity to get safely to the street. It appears that the car in question was being operated upon the Avenue C Division of the defendant. The alleged accident occurred on November 17, 1903, at which time one Avery Sickles was the accident clerk in the employ of defendant. Having been called as a witness for defendant, he stated that he had charge of the records of the company, which contained all reports from all conductors and motormen who had accidents on cars, and that he was unable to find any record of any accident whatever occurring to plaintiff, or any one else, at the time and place alleged in the complaint. To refresh the witness' memory as- to a date, a written requisition of the claim agent to the superintendent of the Avenue C. Division for information in regard to the alleged accident in question was placed by defendant\u2019s counsel in the hands of the witness, whereupon plaintiff\u2019s counsel offered said requisition in evidence. Defendant\u2019s counsel objected, upon the ground that it was incompetent, irrelevant,, and immaterial. The' court overruled the objection, to which ruling an exception was duly taken, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>the paper was admitted in evidence and marked \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Exhibit A.\u201d The said paper bears date of December 28, 1903, and reads in substance as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">\u201cMetropolitan Street Railroad Company. To the Superintendent of the Avenue C Division\u2014Dear Sir: I am advised that an accident has occurred on Nov. 17, 1903, as follows: Mrs. Weinstein; location, Bowery and Prince; car No. 7; about 6 p. m.; getting off, sudden start, conductor rang bell too quickly. Please forward report and oblige. W. A. Dibbs, Claim Agent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The judge below in his charge to the jury directed attention to this exhibit and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">\u201cYou have a right to say, from the complaint in this action and from all the surrounding circumstances, whether that was a statement which came to the defendant by reason of information derived from the plaintiff, or by reason of information received from the conductor or motorman of the car. The defendant is not absolutely bound, so far as the manner in which this accident occurred, by this statement in writing; but you have a right to adduce whatever just inferences you can from the .evidence in consideration, taking into consideration ail the facts in the case at the time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">If any admission of fact contained in the requisition is to be considered as a declaration of some employ\u00e9 of defendant, it would not be binding on defendant. Subsequent to the happening of the accident, the employ\u00e9s of defendant were without authority to make declarations that might constitute admissions tending to establish defendant\u2019s liability. Such declarations cannot be said to be res gestae, and would not be binding on defendant. Kay v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 163 N. Y. ,447, 57 N. E. 751; Goetz v. Same, 54 App. Div. 365, 66 N. Y. Supp. 666. Moreover, it appears on the face of the requisition (Exhibit A) that the declaration, if one, \u201cgetting off, sudden start, conductor rang bell too quickly,\u201d was hearsay. The exhibit in question, for the reasons above stated, was improperly received in evidence. It was clearly of a nature calculated to prejudice the jury against defendant, especially in view of the portion of the charge to the jury above quoted, and its admission constitutes an error that demands a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, w.ith costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">BLANCHARD, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b534-12\">DAYTON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Auo\">(dissenting). I do not concur in the opinion of my associates. At the time of the accident, Sickles, called by the defendant, was the accident clerk of the Avenue C Division of the Interurban Street Railway Company. He testified on direct examination as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-13\">\u201cI had the driver and conductor up on the case, and inquired of all who passed at that time. * * * I was accident cleric there at the time that requisition was put in to see if there was any accident happened at that time. * * * What first called my attention to an accident happening there was that I received a blank when I was down there, asking if any accident had happened\u2014if the conductor or driver had made any report on the case. * * * i cannot remember the date of the requisition now. Q. Do you know how the authorities of your company knew it was car No. 7 [when] they directed \u2018your attention to investigate? A. I do not know about that, as I had all I could do to attend to my business. Q. Will that paper refresh your recollec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>tion as to the date when you looked up the accident? A. That refreshes my recollection as to the time when it was brought to my attention. The date was December 28,1903. I have signed that. It is my signature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Upon the offer of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, under defendant\u2019s objection and exception, the paper was marked in evidence and read to the jury. Referring to said exhibit, the court charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">\u201cSubsequent to the receipt of that complaint, and on the 28th day of December, six days after the receipt of the complaint, this requisition is dated and sent to the superintendent of the Avenue C Division, for information as to an accident to \u2018R. Weinstein\u2019; and it states in there, \u2018Getting off; sudden starting; conductor rang bell too quick.\u2019 You have a right to say, from the complaint in this action and from all the surrounding circumstances, whether that was a statement which came to the defendant by reason of information received from the conductor or motorman of the car. The defendant is not absolutely bound, so far as the manner in which the accident occurred, by this statement in writing; but you have a right to adduce whatever just inferences you can from the evidence in consideration, taking into consideration all the facts in the case at the time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">This exhibit was an official document of the defendant, signed by its claim agent, giving the date of the accident, the name of the plaintiff, the location and time of the accident, and the number of the car and containing the words referred to in the charge of the judge. Sickles\u2019 report thereon is, \u201cPlease note attached statement of driver and conductor,\u201d which statement was not produced. The testimony of the driver and conductor is negative. Neither one of them denied the occurrence of the accident. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony is positive and substantially uncontradicted, so that Exhibit A might well have been disregarded by the jury. I think, however, that this official document, made by the servants and agents of the defendant, was properly received in evidence. In White v. Miller, <em>71 </em>N. Y., at page 135, <em>27 </em>Am. Rep. 13, the court says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">\u201cThe general rule is that what a person says out of court is not admissible to charge or hind another. The exception is in cases of agency; and, in cases of agency, the declarations of the agent are not competent to charge the principal upon proof merely that the relation of principal and agent existed when the declarations were made. It must further appear that the agent, at the time the declarations were made, was engaged in executing the authority conferred upon him, and that the declarations related to and were connected with the business then depending, so that they constituted a part of the res gestae.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Were Claim Agent Dibbs and Accident Clerk Sickles engaged in anything else than in executing the authority conferred upon them? Did the declarations they made relate to the business then depending? Both questions must be answered in the affirmative, and, as these declarations relate to this controversy, they constitute a part of the res gestae. To the suggestion that these declarations were hearsay, it may be inferred that they might have come from the driver and conductor. The complaint does not contain them, and the defendant did not attempt to enlighten the court or jury as to their source.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">The cases cited in opposition to these views, are Kay v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 163 N. Y. 447, 57 N. E. 751, where the conductor denied on cross-examination that he had made certain statements after the accident to a third party. Said third party was called and gave the statement. Held error, on the ground that plaintiff\u2019s attorney could not, on</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>cross-examination, lay the foundation for impeaching the witness on matters not brought out on cross-examination. Also Goetz v, Met. St. Ry. Co., 54 App. Div. 365, 66 N. Y. Supp. 666, where a witness had testified that defendant\u2019s officers had said that defendant was in control of certain apparatus. Held error, as it was not shown that at the time the declaration was made the agent was engaged in executing the authority conferred upon him. It seems to me that these authorities do not meet the facts here, nor the rule laid down in Rogers v. Brooklyn Bridge, 11 App. Div. 141, 42 N. Y. Supp. 1046, where the court says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al6-\">\u201cHaving required this report, and it having been made and brought to their attention, they are chargeable with knowledge o\u00a3 its contents, and it becomes evidence against them for any legal purpose as an admission on their part of what it contains, and it is also admissible as an admission of the agent acting within the scope of his authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Also Reed v. McCord, 160 N. Y., at page 344, 54 N. E. 737:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">\u201cIn a civil action, the admissions of a party of any fact material to the issue are always competent evidence against him, wherever, whenever, and to whomsoever made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
