He received back the duplicate of the contract signed by the purchaser and kept it.

The judgment is correct, for the contract when delivered gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>.lotice to the plaintiff that the agent had no authority to collect the monthly installments. The defendant never waived this. Instead of returning to the defendant the duplicate of the contract signed by the purchaser, the agent kept it without authority and collected and embezzled 28 installments in addition to the $50 paid on delivery. Besides, there was no evidence of knowledge in the purchaser that the agent had possession of the defendant\u2019s duplicate when he collected the installments. Crane v. Gruenewald, 120 N.
