He may only try, but not as a court, charges of those lesser things which do not amount to misdemeanors, of which vagrancy, or being a disorderly person, or that a child begs, or is without proper guardianship, and the like, are examples. Code Cr. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 887, 889; Pen. Code, \u00a7i 291. These are not crimes but only conditions. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>Courts of Special Sessions have to be held by justices specially appointed for that purpose, and three must sit to make a court. Laws 1897, p. 500, c. 378, tit. 3, \u00a7 1405 et seq. And appeals from such courts are the same as from judgments on indictments, viz., to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (section 1414).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">By subsequent sections of this same title of the charter, which came in as amendments or additions after the charter was in effect, the justices of Special Sessions of the First division (Manhattan and Bronx boroughs), and those of the Second division (Brooklyn, Queens and Richmond boroughs), are respectively required to assign \u201ca separate part for the hearing and disposition of cases heretofore within the jurisdiction of city magistrates involving the trial or commitment of children, which part shall be called a children\u2019s court.\u201d The children are to be under 16 years of age. It is then provided that the \u201cjustice or justices\u201d holding such a court shall \u201chave all the powers, duties and jurisdiction now possessed by the city magistrates in such cases\u201d and shall \u201csupersede\u201d such magistrates therein.. This, be it observed, relates only to magisterial powers and duties, which it confers on the justices of the Special Sessions Courts, whereas theretofore they could not act as magistrates, but only as a Court of Special Sessions. It is also provided that in. the trial of such children on charges of misdemeanors one of such justices instead of three may constitute such children\u2019s court of Special Sessions unless the defendant objects thereto. Laws 1903, pp. 361, 363, c. 159, \u00a7\u00a7 1418, 1419.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">In the foregoing system no appeals are provided for by the city charter except by section 1414, and that only provides for appeals from convictions by courts of Special Sessions. Other appeals, i. e., from orders or judgments of magistrates are left as they were. The transfer of the trial of those lesser charges not amounting to crimes against such children from the city magistrates, who theretofore tried them, to the justices of the children\u2019s court of Special Sessions, as magistrates\u2014i. e., from one set of magistrates to another set\u2014did not change the method of appeal in such cases. Section 749 of the Code of Criminal Procedure regulates appeals from magistrates, and requires them to be to the County Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">The order should be reversed, and the appeal heard in the County Court. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
