J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1YI\">I think the order appealed from is reviewable, and that it was improperly granted. The action was commenced by personal service of the summons on the defendant in the month of June, 1906, and the time to answer expired on July 11, 1906. More than two months after the time to answer had expired, viz., on September 17, 1906, the defendant caused a notice of appearance to be served by his attorneys on the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys. In this notice of appearance a demand for a copy of the complaint was included. The copy was not served,'however, as the defendant was concededly in default, but the. notice of appearance was retained by the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys on the theory that a defendant could appear in an action at any stage, and that such appearance would entitle his attorneys to notice of all subsequent proceedings. On this state of facts, the defendant\u2019s attorneys moved for an order, requiring a service of the complaint upon them within, five days, and, in default thereof, that the action be dismissed, with costs. The motion was granted, and the order, appealed from requires a service of the\" complaint on the defendant\u2019s attorneys within five days, with $10 costs to' the defendant to abide the action, and, in default of such service, that the action be dismissed, with costs. The papers \u00f3n appeal do not disclose the nature of the cause of action. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the defendant has any defense to the cause of action, whatever it may be, or that he failed to appear within the time required by the Code of Civil Procedure, in consequence of any oversight, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. If the order appealed from is to be regarded as in effect, one opening a default, merits and some excuse would needs be shown, and the favor, if granted, should be on terms imposed On the delinquent litigant, and not on the one who was wholly blameless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-10\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs, and disbursements, and the motion denied, with'costs, but without prejudice to the right of the defendant to make a timely motion to Open his default on proper papers. -. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
