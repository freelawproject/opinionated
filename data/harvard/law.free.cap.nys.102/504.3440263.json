The situation of the parties tends to show that actual cost was the meaning intended by the word \u201ccost\u201d used in the agreement; and the negotiations of the parties, which were properly admitted in evidence to explain the written agreement, confirm this view. Accordingly, judgment could not properly be awarded for an amount which included profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
