A second cause of action is that the plaintiff overpaid the defendant $190.50 on the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-20\">Instead of meeting the complaint with a denial or denials, as the simple rules of pleading require (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 500), so that the issue could be readily seen, the answer is a long statement of facts, which has to be compared critically and patiently with the complaint to ascertain in what particular, if any, it differs therefrom. Near the end of the answer to the first cause of action the defendant \u201cdenies each and every statement\u201d (meaning allegation) \u201ccontained in the first cause of action set forth in the complaint\u201d (as though it could be set forth anywhere else) \u201cnot herein specifically admitted or denied,\u201d and there is a similar denial to the second cause. These are the only denials, except of any damage,, or sum owing. The defendant\u2019s attorney evidently regards every allegation of fact -which differs with the allegations of the complaint as a \u201cspecific\u201d denial, and throws upon the court the work of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>picking out such allegations, pen in hand. The learned judge below must have been in much doubt in respect of what issues the defendant understands are to be tried and intends to try, and of course he could not see whether proposed witnesses were material without understanding this. In addition to this there is a so-called counterclaim which is not complete in itself, and is no counterclaim, which the defendant\u2019s list of witnesses or some of them are to be called to prove. As the defendant can serve their convenience by leaving them at home, the venue does not need to be changed on their account.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur; HIRSGHBERG, P. J., and RICH, J., In result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
