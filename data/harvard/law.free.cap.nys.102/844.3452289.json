Union Railway Co., 106 App. Div. 397, 399, 94 N. Y. Supp. 635, 636), it is to be said that the issue of contributory negligence, under the evidence in the case, was erroneously withdrawn, or too much withdrawn, from the jury by the instruction of the learned justice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-13\">\u201cI ain going to charge you here that if Ii.j was proceeding down thgt track, and a car was coming behind him, it was not his business to look around unless he heard a noise. * * *\u2022 Unless his attention is called by a bell, or shout, or something of that .kind to turn around, particularly on a bicycle, his eyes are supposed to be ahead, and only ahead, and if the car strikes him behind it is for you to show it is not your negligence in striking him.\u201d Maher v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 102 App. Div. 517, 519, 92 N. X. Supp. 826.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-14\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"AX0\">Judgment reversed, and hew trial, ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
