On the 8th day of October, 1906, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney served a notice of trial for the November term following, together with a notice of motion for a preference, returnable on the first Monday of that term. The defendant also noticed the cause for trial for the same term. The plaintiff did not appear upon the return of his motion, and it was dismissed on defendant\u2019s motion for default. According to the provisions of section 793 of the Code of Civil Procedure applicable to the county of New York, a motion to place a cause upon the preferred calendar must be made at the commencement of the term for which the notice of trial is served.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">The excuse which plaintiff gives for not appearing on his motion is that he discovered that his office had failed to file a note of issue for the November term, and therefore he abandoned his motion. The record does not disclose whether or not the defendant filed a note of issue; but he did appear in opposition to the motion for preference and took its dismissal. Presumably the cause was on the calendar, and presumptively the court properly dismissed the motion for failure of plaintiff to appear. If the plaintiff desired to save his rights, he should have appeared and withdrawn his motion, rather than let it be dismissed. Bazure v. Johnson, 71 App. Div. <em>255, </em>75 N. Y. Supp. 822. Concededly the cause was noticed by both parties for the November term, and, the motion for preference having been passed upon by dismissal, the plaintiff had exhausted his right to move at the December term as he did. A failure to make a motion for preference at the commencement of the term for which notice of trial is served operates as a waiver of the statutory right of preference, and a subsequent notice of trial for another term is futile, either to avoid the effect of the waiver or to support a new application to obtain such preference as a matter of right. Marks v. Murphy, 27 App. Div. 160, 50 N. Y. Supp. 116. A renewal of the motion at the December term, although a new notice of trial was served, was therefore ineffectual.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">In view of the large number of causes upon the calendar, in which the law gives no preference, the question as to whether a cause shall be preferred or not is one of importance to litigants, and the practice with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>respect to preference should be strictly followed. In our view the plaintiff had lost his right to put his cause on the preferred calendar, and the order granting his motion to that effect was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the \"motion denied, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
