The summons was issued out of and n-turnable to the First District Court, borough of Manhattan. Upon the return day the defendant Hardenburg appeared and filed an affidavit setting forth that the defendant resided in the borough of Brooklyn, Seventh district, and that the plaintiff also resided in Brooklyn, and asked that the cause be removed from said First district to the Seventh district of Brooklyn for trial. This motion was opposed by the plaintiff, and time was given him to file an affidavit, and the case &gt;was adjourned until .June 26, 1906. Upon that day the plaintiff submitted an affidavit, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>which he testified that he \u201cresides at 3787 Boulevard, in the city of Hoboken, state of New Jersey, and works at 117-119 Prince street, which is in the First district, borough of Manhattan. The court thereupon denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a removal of the cause, and an order to that effect was entered. The defendant made no further appearance in the action, and on the 3d day of July, 1906, judgment was rendered against the defendant Hardenburg, from which judgment he appeals, and states in his notice of appeal that he brings up for review the order denying his motion for a removal of the cause from the First district of the borough of Manhattan to the Seventh district, borough of Brooklyn.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The refusal of the court to make 'the transfer .of the action was undoubtedly error. Clearly the plaintiff was not a resident of the city of New York. His affidavit so states, and the fact, therein stated, that he \u201cworks at 117-119 Prince street, borough of Manhattan, which is in the First district,\u201d in no way gives the court- a right to retain the cause for trial in said First district. The place of trial of an action depends solely upon the residence of the parties thereto, and section <em>25, </em>subd. 3, Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, p. 1497, c. 580), declares that an action in the Municipal Court must, when brought by a plaintiff not residing in the city of New York, be \u201cbrought in the district in which the defendant or one of the defendants resides.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Jt is true that said subdivision also declares that :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">\u201cNo person who shall have a place in said city for the transaction of business shall be deemed a nonresident under the provisions of this act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">But this clause cannot be construed as intending to give a person who is merely \u201cworking\u201d at a place in a certain district, and is actually a nonresident of the state, a right to name the place of trial of an action brought by him fixed in that district as against a defendant who actually resides in another district within the city. Subdivision 4 of section 25 requires the court .to make an order removing the cause when the district in which the action is brought is not the proper one, upon demand therefor made at the joinder of issue and stating the proper district in which the cause must be tried, and the defendant has complied with the provisions of the section in those respects. It Hollows, therefore, that the order removing the cause to the Seventh disvict, borough of Brooklyn, should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">The defendant, however, cannot-be relieved under this appeal. The appearla \u00a3&lt;-om a judgment taken by default, and from such a -judgment, taken unddi the circumstances in this case, no appeal will lie. All the cases cited -%\u25a0 the appellant relative to the right to appeal from judgments taken by default were decided prior to the passage of the Municipal Court act and are not now applicable. Where personal serviue of the summons is not made, and the defendant has not appeared, an appeal will lie under section 311, Municipal Court Act. So, also, an appeal will lie from a judgment rendered without jurisdiction. \u2022 Risley v. Bank,'83 N. Y. 318, 38 Am. Rep. 421; Catlin v. Rundell, 1 App. Div. 157, 37,N. Y. Supp. 979; McMahon v. Rauhr, 47 N. Y. 67. But in the case/at bar the court had jurisdiction both of the person and subject-matter/ and merely erred in a matter of practice. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>statute (section 25 of the .Municipal Court act) expressly declares that, notwithstanding the action is not brought in the proper district, it may be tried there if no demand for transfer is made, and, in case demand is made there, the action is not dismissed, but removed to the proper district; The defendant should apply to the court below to open his default, and, if defeated upon the trial of the issues, upon appeal from the judgment can then have the order complained of reversed, and the case sent to the proper district for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Appeal dismissed, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
