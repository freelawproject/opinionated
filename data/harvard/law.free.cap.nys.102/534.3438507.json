The plaintiff was called, and, after he had testified to his residence, counsel for the defendant moved to transfer the cause to the proper district. This was denied, and an exception taken. \u201cAs it frequently occurs in the Municipal Court that issue is joined in open court, not in writing, or by written pleadings, the proper, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>struction of that section (Mun. Ct. Act, Laws 1902, p. 1497, c. 580, \u00a7 25, subd. .4) is that the defendant must demand that the change of the place of trial be made upon or before joinder of issue in writing, or upon or before joinder of issue in open court.\u201d Fischer v. Brooklyn Heights R. Co. (Sup.) 84 N. Y. Supp. 254; 256. This the defendant did not do, as he also failed to sp\u00e9cify the district to which the transfer was requested to be made.
