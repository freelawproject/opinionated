The action may be regarded as one in rem. The summons and complaint were served, as required by the Code of Civil Procedure, and the decision of the court, in so far as it relates to the purpose for which the action was brought, is binding and conclusive between the parties, and is not attacked in this proceeding. We are unable, however, to find any authority in this state for rendering a judgment for a sum of money against a. nonresident defendant upon whom personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>service has not been made, without his appearance, unless jurisdiction has been obtained by attachment. Before a judgment can be rendered, it must be made to appear that this formality has been complied with. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 1216, 1217. The service of the summons and complaint upon defendant in Chicago by mail was not sufficient to acquire.jurisdiction to render a judgment in the state of New York for a sum of money. Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714, 24 L. Ed. 565; Rigney v. Rigney, 127 N. Y. 408, 28 N. E. 405, 24 Am. St. Rep. 462. It .was held in Rigney v. Rigney, supra, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\">\u201cA judgment for alimony and costs cannot be supported on the ground that they are mere incidents of and subordinate to the right to a divorce, and the jurisdiction which is sufficient to support a decree changing the marital status of the plaintiff will not necessarily sustain a judgment for alimony ana costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">This case was subsequently reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States upon another ground. It is still an authority, however, upon the question involved here. The judgment for costs was rendered without authority, and is void as to the defendant. No valid force or effect can be given to any proceeding under a void judgment, and while better' practice might have been a motion to set aside the judgment, still the execution is open to attack and ought to have been vacated and set aside. Rowe v. Peckham, 30 App. Div. 173-176, 51 N. Y. Supp. 889; Johnson v. Manning, 75 App. Div. 285, 78 N. Y. Supp. 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The order therefore must be reversed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
