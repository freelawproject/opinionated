The plaintiff paid the sum of $100, as the agreement stated, \u201con account,\u201d and agreed to pay the balance of $850 on September 15,1906. The plaintiff also agreed to pay the broker\u2019s commission. This action was brought to recover the amount of such deposit. The court below gave a judgment for the plaintiff for $50. This was error. Under the testimony the plaintiff, if entitled to recover-at all, should have had a judgment for-the sum of $100, possibly less the broker\u2019s commission of $30, which the defendant had concededly paid, or the defendant should have had a judgment in his favor on the merits. There certainly is no foundation for the judgment as given, and it must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
