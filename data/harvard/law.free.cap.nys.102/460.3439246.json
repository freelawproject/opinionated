The complaint was dismissed as to both causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-17\">Although in support of the first the proof was meager indeed, there was evidence,- from the situation found by the firemen in breaking in the doors and the testimony, that articles so readily combustible as old rags, burlaps, and excelsior were stored in an old van near the elevator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>shaft, from which might have been inferred lack on the part of the bailee of the care which persons of ordinary prudence exercise in the management of their own property.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Upon the second cause of action there was sufficient to present an issue for consideration of the jury, under the doctrine laid down in Hickey v. Morrell, 102 N. Y. 454, 7 N. E. 321, 55 Am. Rep. 834, and followed since; for, as the plaintiff testified, with some corroboration by the defendant\u2019s president, upon his application, less than three weeks before the fire, for storage at the company\u2019s office, he was referred by the secretary to one Altschul, a stock clerk and foreman, who, upon inquiry by the plaintiff as to the condition of the building, said: \u201cIt is an absolutely fireproof building.\u201d The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
