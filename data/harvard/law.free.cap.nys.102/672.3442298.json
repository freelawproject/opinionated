An answer was served on October 8, 1906. The complaint alleged that plaintiff was a foreign corporation, as indeed, its name indicated. On December <em>22, </em>1906, the defendant obtained an ex parte order, requiring the plaintiff to give security for costs, and staying its proceedings until such security was given. It is settled by abundant authority in this department that a defendant waives his absolute right to require a nonresident plaintiff to give security for costs unless the order therefor is applied for before answer. Thereafter such an order becomes a matter of discretion, and will not, as a rule, be granted unless the defendant offers some reasonable excuse for not applying earlier for the order, or show some reason other than the mere fact of nonresidence why the order should be granted. In the present case nothing is shown to justify the exercise of the court\u2019s discretionary power in defendant\u2019s behalf. The only excuse given for the delay in applying for the order is the very vague and general one of pressing and important business which crowded the matter out of the mind of the defendant\u2019s attorney. This is obviously insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-16\">The order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to vacate the order requiring the plaintiff to give security of costs will be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
