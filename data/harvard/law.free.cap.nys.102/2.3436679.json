Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-20\">The opinion of the referee is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-21\">It is admitted by the defendant that he has failed to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of $1,000, part of the rent which became due by the terms of the lease on the 1st day of April, 1902.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-22\">The defendant covenanted that \u201che will make all repairs inside and outside of the said building which may be needful to the demised premises during his term, including repairs to all plumbing work and pipes, and will keep the demised premises in good order and. repair during his term, at his own expense, * * * and. will quit and surrender the premises hereby demised in as good state and condition as reasonable use and wear thereof will permit, damages by the elements excepted.\u201d The plaintiffs allege that the defendant failed to keep these covenants: that he did not maintain the premises in good condition, but allowed them \u201cto fall into and remain in a condition of dilapidation and disrepair, and quitted and vacated the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>while in snch condition,\u201d by reason whereof the plaintiffs have sustained suostantial uarnage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-3\">C'o^nants of tins character have been frequently considered by the courts, and are no longer of doubtml meaning. In Green v. Eden, 2 Thomp. &amp; G. \u00a1\"&gt;82, the covenant was \u201cto keep the whole of said house and premises in good repair and condition during the said demised term.\u201d It was held that the reliant was bound to repair defects existing at the time he took possession. In Lockrow v. liorgan, 08 N. Y. 635, the covenant was \"to make all necessary repairs, and to keep the same in tenantable order at his own cost.\u201d The promises became untenantable by reason of the settling of a wall, owing to detective construction of the foundation. The court said the tenant \u201cwas bound to make the repairs irrespective of the cause of the defect.\u201d In Lelmmier v. Jones, 100 App. Div. 403, 91 N. Y. Supp. 687, the lessee covenanted \u201cthat he will keep said premises in good repair at his own expense during said term, * * * and at the expiration of the said term will quit and surrender the premises hereby demised in as good state and condition as reasonable use and wear thereof will permit, damages by the elements excepted.\u201d The action was against the lessee for damages for failure to keep and leave the premises in good repair. JSTo proof was given by the plaintiffs as to the condition of the buildings when the lease was made. They rested their right to recover upon the fact that the buildings were out of repair when possession was surrendered by the defendant. His contention was that his covenant should be construed \u201cas if it provided that if the tenant desired any repairs he should make the same at his own expense, and that, therefore, it was incumbent on the plaintiffs to show that the premises were in a better state of repair when the lease was made than at the expiration of the term.\" The court held otherwise, saying that by the covenant the tenant was obligated not only to keep the premises in as good repair as when he entered, \u201cbut to put, keep and leave in good repair, having due regard to the age and class of the buildings,\u201d and this construction the court said is sustained by authority.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-5\">The building in question in this case was an old building, erected many years ago, but there is no proof that when the defendant took possession, or at any later time, its foundations or walls were not in good condition or that it was otherwise structurally weak. In 3887 it was leased for a term of ten years to the New York Steam Company, and that company expended in alterations and repairs upwards of $33,000. When the lease to the defendant was made it was clearly understood bv both parties that to put the building in proper repair would require a considerable outlay, and it was stipulated in the lea'se that towards these repairs the lessors should contribute the sum of $3.000. which thev did. The duty of making all repairs in excess of this sum, and of keening and leaving the hui'ding in g.iood condition, was assumed by the defendant by the covenants which have been referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-6\">T must find ns a matter of fact that the defendant did not leave the building in good condition. Upon this point the testimony of witnesses is in sharp conflict, but, in my .iudsment, the weight of testimony, all things considered, is plainly in favor of the Plaintiffs. The measure of their damas-es is the necessary cost of making the repairs. Lehmaier v. Jones, sunrn. The amount they claim for dmnaves is $3,982.88. It is, I think, excessive, gome of the items should be disallowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-7\">They claim $1,000 for repairing the elevator. The testimony of the architect is, \u201cIn the estimate received for repairing the elevator and car the amount was approximately $1.000.\u201d The cost of repairing the car was $200. -and for that a separate claim is made. The elevator was an old one and operated by hvdraulic or steam power, the architect is not certain which. It was not repaired, but a new and modern elevator operated by electricity was put in at an expense of $2 090. It is nnt claimed that, this was a necessity or that tlie old elevator was incapable of repair. Mr. Leeming. the architect, says, \u201cIt was deemed unwise and unsafe to use the then present elevator, and it was deemed unbusinesslike to expend the amount of money which would be necessary for repairs to the then present elevator, when, for a certain\" greater sum, a new elevator could be installed.\u201d So that it seems that the plaintiffs did not choose to hold the defendant to the terms of his ,cov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>enant. They elected not to repair at his expense, but to put in new machinery of an improved and essentially different character. My opinion is that they have no right to charge the defendant with the cost of that improvement to the extent of what repairs to the old machinery would have cost had they been made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-4\">The same objection lies to the item- of $177.10 for \u201celevator pump.\" This pump was a Worthington steam pump, and was used to raise watei to the tank on the roof. Mr. Leeming testifies as follows: \u201cIt was in very poor condition indeed. I cannot say anything positively now as to its exact condition, except that, after consultation, it was decided that it was absolutely necessary to remove it and to put in a new pump. * * * It was deemed unfit for use; it was deemed impossible to repair it, and .a new elevator pump was put in.\u201d When asked on cross-examination, \u201cWhat was the matter with it?\u201d he said, \u201cIt leaked. It needed repacking, and was badly worn.\u201d There is testimony, and it is not contradicted, that the pump was in working order and in use down to the time the defendant quitted the premises. There is no testimony that it at any time failed to do the work for which it was provided. The cost of the new electric pump is disallowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-7\">The plaintiffs claim to recover the sum of $441 as the cost of \u201cpainting the walls, etc., in building,\u201d and the further sum of $000 for \u201cpainting.\u201d Concerning the first item, the architect says: \u201cThat was the total exp\u00edense for putting the woodwork in the halls and the woodwork in the rooms in propee condition. * * * It covered the painting of the old woodwork in the halls and in certain offices in the building\u2014not all of them\u2014and it covered the painting of the walls and ceilings, the window frames, the roof, the new tank house, and such work in the building as required painting to put it in a good state of repair. * * * Painting the sash and frame and trim of the building, varnishing the old' worn-out woodwork, and all the general work required to put the old work in good condition, $375.\u201d He further testified that the general contractor for the mason and carpenter work, plastering and \u201cgeneral overhauling\u201d of the building \u201cdid some work,\u201d the cost of which, included in the original estimate, was $600, and that the said contract covered various items of repairs, including an item of $600 \u201cfor painting.\u201d In my judgment the testimony read together, does not warrant the allowance of this $600 item.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-9\">The remainder of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for damages (except the item of $25 for a metal celling), amounting to $4,180.78, should, I think, be allowed, provided the plaintiffs have any right of recovery on such claim, which the defendant denies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4\">The proofs show that in April, 1901, a full year before the expiration of the defendant\u2019s term, the plaintiffs leased the said premises to the Waterman Company for five years from May 1, 1902, and that the lease contained a covenant similar to that contained in defendant\u2019s lease\u2014that is to say\u2014 the Waterman Company engaged to, \u201cat its own expense, make all repairs inside and outside of the said building which may become needful during the said term, including repairs to all plumbing work and pipes, and keep the demised premises in good order and repair during the said term\u201d: and they show also that the repairs to the building which were made necessary by the defendant\u2019s default were made by and at the expense of the Waterman Company. Upon these facts it is argued that the defendant is not liable upon bis covenant, because the plaintiffs sustained no damages through his nonperformance. The same argument was overruled by the English Court of Appeal In Joyner v. Weeks,' 2 Q. B. 31. In that case the defendant had covenanted to keep and leave the premises in good repair, which he failed to' do, and the plaintiff recovered damages. The defendant\u2019s lease expired in 1889. In 1887 the plaintiff made a lease of the same premises to another party, to begin at the close of the defendant\u2019s term. The court assumed that the second lease required the new tenant \u201cto put the premises into the same state of repair as was required by the first lease.\u201d The Master of the Rolls (Esher) said: \u201cIn my opinion, the contract between the plaintiff and the third person cannot be taken into account; it is something to which the defendant is a stranger.\u201d Fry, L. J., concurred in this, saying: \u201cIt seems to me that it is res inter alios acta, with which the lessee has nothing to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>and. which he is not entitled to set up. How can subsequent performance by the second lessee of the covenants which he has entered into abridge or take away the cause of action which vested in the lessor before the second lease took effect? * * * The second lease passed no estate until possession was taken under it. * * * The lessor had a right of entry on the determination of the first lease. Directly that happened, a right of action for damages accrued in respect of the breach of the covenant to yield up in repair. Therefore, the lessor\u2019s right of action for these damages vested before any estate vested in the grantee of the subsequent lease.\" Rawlings v. Morgan, 18 C. B. (N. S.) 776, and Morgan v. Hardy, 17 Q. B. Div. 770, are in harmony with this decision. The claim for damages is therefore sustained to the extent mentioned above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-4\">The defendant has interposed a counterclaim, alleging that, by false and fraudulent statements made by authorized agents of the plaintiffs with knowledge of their falsity and with intent to deceive, and on which he relied, he was induced to enter into the lease of the premises and damaged to the extent of $24,000. The testimony does not support the claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-5\">The plaintiffs are entitled to judgment for $6,180.78, with interest on $1,000 from April 1, 1902.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b25-6\">Argued before PATTERSON, P.
