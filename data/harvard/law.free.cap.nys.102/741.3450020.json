It is the claim of the attorneys mentioned that this action is of a collusive nature, brought to obtain in an ex parte manner the determination of a question of the utmost gravity and greatest public importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-15\">We have considered the grounds upon which the moving parties rest their contention, and, after careful examination of the record, have reached the conclusion that no reasons appear that would warrant the dismissal of the appeal or the postponement of its determination. The record shows that the moving parties had ample opportunity to intervene upon the trial, or by brief upon submission. They did neither. The pleadings and the evidence were directed to the disposition of but one issue, viz., the limitation of transfers by the defendant.1 We are satisfied that the action was brought in good faith, fairly tried, and that the decision was an honest expression of the opinion of the learned trial justice upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-16\">The motion is dismissed, and the moving papers expunged from the records.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
