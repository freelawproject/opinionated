The motion for the injunction pendente lite was denied, and the preliminary injunction annulled, revplced, and set aside. In the case of \u2018 Sargent v. St. Mary\u2019s Orphan Boys\u2019 Asylum, 112 App. Div. 674, 98 N. Y. Supp. 632, cited by the learned counsel for the respondent, the preliminary order was limited to expire on the hearing and determination of the motion to continue; and, as Justice Nash pointed out, counsel was employed to oppose the motion for an injunction pendente lite. No order to vacate the temporary restraining order was required, and none was made. The expenses incurred for such services are not recoverable. After the decision of the motion to continue the injunction, the restraining order was no longer of any force or effect in the Sargent Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">In the case at bar, however^ the preliminary injunction enjoined and restrained defendants during the theatrical seasons of 1906-07, 1907-08 and 1908-09. We think it was reasonable that defendants should appear by counsel 'upon the motion, and, if so advised, to urge .that the order be vacated, and that the legitimate items of expense incurred to this end are legitimate and proper elements of damages. Perlman v. Bernstein, 93 App. Div. 335, 87 N. Y. Supp. 862. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">The injunction might have remained in force, had defendants failed to appear; and the order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, .and motion granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
