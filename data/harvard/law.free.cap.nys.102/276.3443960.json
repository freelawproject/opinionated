A bill of particulars thereof should have been ordered. It was apparently denied on the ground that the \u25a0 defendant would not as a condition of granting the motion waive its right to have a physical examination of the plaintiff. This was error. The particulars of the injuries may in themselves furnish reason for a physical examination. Too many other particulars were asked for, and the habit in that respect should be restrained.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-14\">The order should be reversed and the motion granted in respect of permanent injuries, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
