The defendant thereupon filed an answer, and the case was set down for trial. Upon the day set for trial, and before any testimony was taken, defendant moved to dismiss the amended complaint, upon the ground that it did not contain facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Decision on this motion was reserved until May 15, 1906, at which time the justice indorsed upon the record the words: \u201cDemurrer sustained. Action dismissed, with costs,\u201d Judgment was thereupon entered in favor of the defendant, from which judgment plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">There seems to be no express provision in the Municipal Court act permitting the defendant to test the sufficiency of a complaint, upon the question as to whether or not it states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, other than by demurrer or answer. It has been held, however, that such a motion may be made and entertained. Morris v. Hunken, 40 App. Div. 129, 57 N. Y. Supp. 712. Subdivision 2 of section 249 (Laws 1902, p. 1562, c. 580) provides that the action must be dismissed upon the merits \u201cwhere the court sustains a demurrer, and no leave to plead over is granted, as provided in this act.\u201d Nowhere-in the' act, however, is there any situation pointed out in which leave to \u201cplead over\u201d may be refused; and in subdivision 4 of section 145 (page 1536) it is plainly and explicitly provided that where a demurrer is well founded the court \u201cmust permit the pleading to 'be amended.\u201d A motion to dismiss the complaint is therefore equivalent to :a.demurrer (Rogers v. Fin [Sup.] 97 N. Y. Supp. 1004), and leave to serve an amended pleading must be granted when such a motion .is sustained (Rogers v. Fine, supra). The plaintiff was not given leave to plead after the decision of the motion, and the judgment must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">Judgment reversed-,' and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
