To prove that the oysters the defendant took and carried away from a bed in Tiana Bay, town of Southampton, Long Island, were the lawfully planted oysters of Squires, a lease by the trustees of the freeholders and commonalty of the town to Squires dated June 10th, 1902, of the said bed to plant oysters on it, was allowed in evidence, for the town owns the lands under water within its limits. The defendant\u2019s exception thereto is good. The lease was void. At the annual town meeting in 1897 it was voted that the said trustees should no longer lease the bottom under the waters of the town for oyster planting; and at the annual town meeting in 1901 the question whether such leases should be made was voted in the negative. The town meeting had the power to make this regulation in respect of the use of town lands (Town Law, Laws 1890, p. 1215, c. 569, \u00a7 24; 1 Rev. St p. 340, \u00a7 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-18\">Squires gave oral evidence of a prior lease to him in writing by the trustees for a term of five years with a right of renewal to him for five years, and which he claimed to have lost; but the jury may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>have- found that such a lease ever existed. Moreover, there is no evidence that it was given prior to the town meeting of 1897. He says it was given in 1898.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\">The judgment of the County Court and of the Court of Special Sessions should be reversed. All concur, except HOOKER, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
