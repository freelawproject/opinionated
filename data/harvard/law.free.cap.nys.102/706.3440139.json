At the close of the case the trial justice, after charging that the defendant is not negligent because of the existence of the space between the platform of the car and of the station, charged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-17\">\u201cIt becomes the duty of the defendant to give warning or notice of its existence, and the plaintiff's claim is predicated upon the failure of the defendant to give a sufficient warning. * * * It does not make any difference whether the plaintiff actually heard the warning, providing it was given-.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-19\">The justice, however, refused to charge the following requests made by counsel for the defendant;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-20\">\u201cI ask your honor to charge the jury that, if the guard upon the train uttered the words \u2018Watch the step!\u2019 in such a manner that a person paying ordinary attention to what was going on about her would naturally hear it, the defendant fulfilled any duty which it owed to the plaintiff in respect to warning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-21\">\u201cI ask your honor to charge the jury that, if the guard on the train uttered the words \u2018Watch the step!\u2019 in such a manner that a passenger paying ordinary attention to what was going on about her would naturally hear it, the defendant is guilty of no negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-22\">The defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-23\">The plaintiff and her witness testifying that they did not hear any warning and the guard of the train testifying that he gave such warning, the refusal of the trial justice to charge these requests was error, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>for \u201cthe timely utterance of cautionary words in such a tone and of such a character that they ought to be, and naturally would be, heard and understood by passengers giving ordinary attention to what is going on around them, is a full discharge of the obligation which the law imposes upon the common carrier under such circumstances.\u201d Langin v.
