The complaint alleges:</p>\n<p id=\"b705-18\">That for more than 10 years the plaintiff was, and now is, an artist and cartoonist of national reputation for ingenuity and skill in his profession, and was and is the originator of the series of c\u00f3mic pictures entitled \u201cBuster Brown and his dog Tige.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-19\">That the defendant maliciously composed and published concerning the plaintiff in his said profession the following false and defamatory matter, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-20\">\u201cBuster Brown\u2019s Career.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-21\">\u201cAll things have their period of growth, flower, and decay, even the subjects chosen by writers and illustrators contributing to the comic section of the Sunday newspaper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-22\">\u201cReaders of the Herald\u2019s European edition have been expressing dissatisfaction with recent numbers of the \u2018Buster Brown\u2019 pictures. A letter to the editor\u2014reproduced in a special cable despatch on another page\u2014explains to the grumbling children that Mr. Outcault has evidently run out of ideas, and, unlike Mr. Gibson, is not willing to attempt something new.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-23\">\u201cThe European edition has provided its readers with the new and exceedingly amusing little pet \u2018Nemo\u2019 and other illustrated features for its weekly comic section, and their popularity more than compensates for- the waning interest in \u2018Buster Brown.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-24\">That the facts stated in said publication were wholly false, and that by reason thereof the plaintiff has been injured in his reputation, and in his good name and credit as such artist, to his damage $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-25\">For the second cause of action, that the defendant maliciously com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>posed and published concerning the plaintiff in his said' profession the following false and defamatory matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">\u201cNew Features Replace Buster.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\u201cSere and Yellow Leaf Period Arrives, and the Herald Adopts More Amusing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">Pets. Compensate in Interest. Letter to European Edition Says Mr. Outcault has Evidently Run Out of Ideas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">\u201c(Special Cable to the Herald, Herald Bureau, No. 49 Avenue D\u00e9 L\u2019Opera, Paris, Sunday.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">\u201cThe Herald\u2019s European edition publishes the following: Considerable dissatisfaction has been expressed by readers of the European edition with recent; numbers of \u2018Buster Brown.\u2019 The following letter, for example, has been received and published:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-10\">\u201c \u2018Hotel Lord Byron, No. 16 Rue Lord Byron, Paris, Jan. 10, 1906.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-11\">\u201c \u2018To the Editor of the Herald:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-12\">\u201c \u2018What is the matter with Buster and Tige, children? I will tell you. Mr. Outcault has evidently run out of ideas and no wonder! But, unlike Mr. Gibson, he is not willing to attempt something new. \u201cThe Buster and his Bath\u201d that you saw in the Herald last Sunday was one of the first of the Buster Brown series and appeared in the New York Herald several years ago when Buster was still somewhat raw and crude. This accounts for the difference that puzzled you. ( Granny.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-13\">\u201cGrumblers do not appear to realize that the sere and yellow leaf .period must arrive for Buster as well as for all things. The power of the European edition has provided its readers with a new and exceedingly amusing pet, \u2018Little Nemo,\u2019 whose popularity here with young and old alike is boundless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-14\">\u201cIndeed, his adventures in Slumberland, the latest cataclysm provoked by Sammy Sneeze, and the agitated existence of those quaint little creatures, the Tiny Teds, form an amazingly popular feature of the weekly comic section of the European edition that more than compensates for the waning interest of Buster\u2019s pranks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-15\">That the facts stated in said publication were wholly false; and-that by. reason thereof the plaintiff has been injured in his reputation and in his good name and credit as such artist to his damage of $50,000..</p>\n<p id=\"b706-16\">The defendant demurred to each of the causes of action set fortlr upon the ground that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a 'cause' of action. The learned Special Term overruled the demurrer, and from the judgment entered thereon this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-17\">In neither of the alleged causes of action is there an innuendo which explains the meaning of the words complained of, nor is there any allegation by. way of innuendo which points to a libelous meaning. The complaint alleges that the plaintiff is an artist and cartoonist of national reputation for ingenuity and skill in his profession, and was, and is, the originator of a series of comic pictures and cartoons entitled \u201cBuster Brown and his dog Tige.\u201d It is clear that when an artist submits his work to the public, such work is subject to criticism, and that, no one is answerable for fair comment or criticism thereon. The actor, the artist, and the author submit their professional work to the public, and thereby appeal to the pubnv ror support and approval. They must accept with equal equanimity praise and blame so long as the comment is directed at the work itself. Newell on Libel &amp; Slander (2d Ed.) pp. 566, 567; Townshend on Slander &amp; Libel (4th Ed.) \u00a7 254; Odgers on Slander &amp; Libel (4th Ed.) p. 202. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b706-18\">This\" court said, in Battersby v. Collier, 34 App. Div. 347, 57 N. Y. Supp. 363:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>\u201cFair and legitimate criticism is always permitted \"upon any work of art to which the attention of the public has been invited. * * * However skillful an artist may be, it is not a libel upon him to say that any particular picture of his is not good of its kind. The same rules must be applied to persons in that profession as are applied to persons in every other profession; and nothing can be said to be libelous of a man in his profession except something which degrades or lowers him in his professional character generally; and it is not a libel of one in that regard to say that, in any particular work, he has fallen below the proper standard or has made a failure.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The Court of Appeals said in Triggs v. Sun Printing &amp; Publishing Association, 179 N. Y. 144, 71 N. E. 739, 66 L. R. A. 612, 103 Am. St. Rep. 841:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">\u201cAn author, when he places his work before the public invites criticism, and however hostile it may be, the critic is not liable for libel provided he makes no misstatement of the material facts contained in the writing and does not go out of his way to attack the author.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The respondent, while admitting the foregoing rule, claims that the articles complained of are not fair criticism of the work of the artist, but are attacks upon him personally, and come within the rule stated in the Triggs Case, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">\u201cIf, under, the pretext of criticising a literary production, or the acts of one occupying a public position, the critic takes an opportunity to attack the author or occupant, he will be liable in an action for libel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Respondent claims that the publication complained of falsely states the following material facts, viz.: (1) That the Herald\u2019s readers have been expressing dissatisfaction with plaintiff\u2019s drawings; (2) that plaintiff had run out of ideas, and was unwilling to attempt something new ; (3) that the Buster Brown drawings had reached the sere and yellow leaf period\u2014i. e., that they were no longer meritorious or popular; and'(4) that the Herald had substituted therefor a more popular series of drawings. This does not seem to be the obvious and necessary interpretation of the words complained of. They are, in our opinion, susceptible of interpretation as criticism of the particular work known as the \u201cBuster Brown series of pictures.\u201d Where an artist has been for a long time engaged in the production of a particular kind of work, criticism of that work upon the ground of sameness can hardly be said to be libelous per se. The articles, to our minds, are confined to a criticism of this series of productions, and did not attack their author in his general capacity or reputation as an artist. The severest part of the publication is perhaps the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-10\">'\u201cWhat is the matter with Buster and Tige, children? I will tell you. Mr. Outcault has evidently run out of ideas, and no wonder. But, unlike Mr. Gibson, he is not willing to. attempt something new.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">That paragraph is certainly susceptible of the interpretation that it was in respect to the Buster Brown series that the plaintiff had run out of ideas. That is to say, in regard to the particular work which he was submitting to the public; and so far from a suggestion that he had run out of all ideas as an artist, it is negatived by the statement that it was no wonder he had, in regard to the particular work, by reason of his long continuance therein, but that he had only to \u2018turn to a new line of work, if willing to do so, to achieve renewed success. We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>called upon, therefore, to apply the rule that where the words complained of are capable of two meanings-\u2014one defamatory, and the other not-\u2014the question as to the sense in which they are used can only be submitted to the jury when there is a proper innuendo pointing to an actionable meaning of which the words are capable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">\u201cIt is * * * well settled that where * * * the language is capable of being construed in an innocent and harmless, as well as in an injurious sense, an innuendo to point out the meaning which the plaintiff claims to be the true meaning, and the one on which he relies is necessary to the sufficiency of the statement for a cause of action.\u201d Beecher v. Press Publishing Co., 60 App. Div. 536, 69 N. Y. Supp. 895.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The same rule is laid down in actions for slander. Hemmens v. Nelson, 138 N. Y. 517 at page 531, 34 N. E. 342 at page 347 (20 L. R. A. 440). As the words complained of are susceptible of the interpretation-as criticisms of the artist\u2019s work, and therefore not libelous per se, 'the complaint fails to state a. caus\u00e9 of action by not containing an innuendo, pointing out the particular meaning which the plaintiff now seeks to ascribe thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The judgment overruling the demurrer should therefore be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, with costs to the appellant, with leave to the respondent, however, within 20 days upon payment of such costs, to serve an amended complaint. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
