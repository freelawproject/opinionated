Both actions were tried together. In the action for personal injuries the verdict was for $500, and in the action for. property injuries the verdict was $77. During that part of the charge in the action for personal injuries the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">\u201cShould you bring in a verdict for her, it must be for a sum that would compensate her for her injuries so far as you can do it; and it is fair for you to say in a case of that kind what you would under similar circumstances. Accept yourself for that suffering she has testified to, that pain and agony for a number of weeks, under the doctor\u2019s care every day being treated for it, and confined to a room or bed with those sufferings, and what would be the fair allowance, for it; and you can put yourself in her position in doing so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">He then proceeded to refer to the doctor\u2019s and medicine bills and to the injuries to the plaintiff\u2019s clothing, which were involved in the other action.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">Defendant\u2019s Counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-12\">\u201cI desire to take an exception to the court\u2019s charge in relation to the damages, and that the measure of damages is what they would expect to receive under similar circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">The Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-14\">\u201cI did not say \u2018is.\u2019 I said, \u2018You may\u2019 put yourself in her place and consider what you would be willing to take under the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-15\">To this also defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-16\">This language is, unfortunately, obnoxious to the decisions in Schmidt v. Interborough R. T. Co. (Sup.) 97 N. Y. Supp. 390, and Stantial v. Union Ry. Co. (Sup.) 101 N. Y. Supp. 662. I say unfortunately, because plaintiff had proved her case; and while I doubt, taking the charge in its entirety, that this language affected the amount of the verdict, nevertheless that doubt may not be urged against the foregoing authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-17\">The judgment for $536.50 in the action for personal injuries must therefore be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. The judgment for $99 in the action for injuries to property should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
