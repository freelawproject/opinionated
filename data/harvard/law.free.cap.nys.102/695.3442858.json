Proc., upon an agreed statement of facts, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b715-17\">The Bankers\u2019 Life Insurance Company of the City of New York is a corporation originally organized as a fraternal organization on March 24, 1869, under the name of the \u201cBank Clerks\u2019 Mutual Benefit Association of the City of New York.\u201d On the 15th day of August, 1884, it was formally incorporated under chapter 175, p. 172, of the Laws of 1883, under the same name, and was thereafter, on <em>June </em>28, 1893, reincorporated under article 6 of chapter 690, p. 2004, of the Laws of 1892, known as the \u201cInsurance Law,\u201d for the purpose of doing business on the regular assessment or co-operative plan, under the same name. By an order of the Supreme Court of the state of New York, made April 27, 1894, its name was changed to the Bankers\u2019 Life Insurance Company of the City of New York. Pursuant to the provisions of chapter 690, p. 1718, of the Laws of 1893, entitled. \u201cAn act authorizing ail insurance companies transacting business on the co-operative or the assessment plan to reincorporate as a stock corporation under its existing corporate name,\u201d it reincorporated as a stock corporation on the 2d day of August, 1899, with a capital stock of $100,-000, and has ever since been doing business as a stock company. As a stock company, the Bankers\u2019 Life Insurance Company was reasonably successful at the start, and it gradually increased its surplus, so that, on the 1st day of January, 1902, it had, as appears by its report, a surplus, beyond its capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>of $100,000, of $185,576. In the fall of 1902, the stock control of this company, which was then lodged in two of its directors, William O. Demarest and Charles H. Fanclier, was transferred to a corporation known as the' \u201cKnickerbocker Investment Company.\u201d A voting trust agreement was entered into by the officers of the Knickerbocker Investment Company without the knowledge or consent of the stockholders, by the terms of which the stock control of the Bankers\u2019 Life Insurance Company was vested for the period of five years in three voting trustees, Foster N. Vorhees, Edward C. Stokes, and William Scherer, who promptly elected themselves and certain of their friends and relatives into office. Foster N. Yoorhees became president of the company, William Scherer, vice president, and his son, general counsel. Edward C. Stokes became a director, and the position of third vice president was created fbr his brother, Howard K. Stokes. Before assuming'office, the stock had always paid 6 per cent, dividends. They ran the company at a rate of expense not common-, surate with the premium income of the company. They devised different schemes to make their policies attractive. Among other things they did, was to declare and pay out dividends on participating policies, which had never been earned, and armed with literature showing the payment of these dividends, their agents sought to procure business by showing the attractive results obtained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b716-5\">During the year 1902, the company lost $46,562 in surplus, and the officers declared and paid $21,035 dividends to policy holders. During the year 1903, the company lost $75,542 in surplus, and the officers declared and paid $25,827 dividends to policy holders. During the year 1904, the company made an apparent gain of $23,253, and declared and paid dividends of $35,000 to policy holders. During the year 1905, the surplus of $86,724, and the capital of $100,-000 suffered further diminution, so that the statement of December 31, 1905, showed that the entire surplus had been wiped out, and the capital reduced from $100,000 to $28,403, an impairment of $71,597 in its capital, and yet during that year the company declared to the policy holders $81,000 in dividends, of which $49,000 was paid and $32,000 not yet withdrawn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b716-6\">A tabulated statement, showing capital and 'surplus from January 1, 1902, to-December 31, 1905, together with losses or gain on the business and dividends of paid policy holders, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b716-7\">Capital ($100,000) and Loss or Gain Dividends Paid Surplus.

Dividends declared but not paid..... $257,173 $162,819</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b716-9\">The capital was found to be impaired by the New York insurance department in the spring of 1906, and the stockholders of the company were called upon to make good the impairment. All the minority stock which was controlled by the management and their friends, with the exception of five shares' of stock, refused to make good any portion of the impairment, and the Knickerbocker Investment Company was compelled to pay, and did pay, into the treasury of the company the whole amount of the impairment, amounting to some $72,000. Before doing so, however, the Knickerbocker Investment Company insisted that the voting trust agreement be abolished, and the directors and officers of the Bankers\u2019 Life Insurance Company should resign. This was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>finally acquiesced in, every officer and director of the company resigned, and in their place were elected the present management of the Bankers\u2019 Life Insurance Company. Upon an examination made by the new management into the affairs of the company, it was ascertained that the capital and surplus of $285,000 which existed in 1902, had been reduced to $28,000 in 1906. The corporation sustained a loss of $257,000 in four years. Its reports during that time show that its rate of mortality was lower than the expected rate, and that it had suffered no loss in its investments, and it was found that, although losing $257,000 during these four years, they had paid over $131,000 of dividends, and had declared, and not paid out some $31,000 of dividends. This latter item was considered a liability by the department of insurance, and treated as such in the report of 1905. These dividends had never been passed upon by the board of directors, but were paid by the officers. With an insignificant exception, the dividends had not been passed upon by the executive committee. Neither the charter of the company, nor its by-laws, provide how dividends shall be declared and paid. Prior to 1902, all dividends had always been passed upon by the board of directors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b717-4\">Following are all the by-laws which describe the powers of the board of directors and the respective officers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b717-5\">\u201c(1) The officers of the company shall consist of a president, a first, a second, and a third vice president, a secretary, an assistant secretary, and a treasurer, and two or more of said offices, except that of president, may be filled by one individual.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b717-6\">\u201c(2) The president shall be ex officio a member of all committees.

All such contracts shall be signed by at least two of the executive officers of the company, the printing of facsimile signature of the president to such contracts being a compliance with this provision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b717-9\">\u201c(5) The executive committee, two members of which shall constitute a quorum, shall assist the president in the general management and conduct of the business of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b717-10\">\u201c(6) The board of directors shall have charge of all funds of the company and see to the safe investment thereof.

As to these latter amounts, it became obvious to the present officers of this company that they had absolutely no right to pay dividends which they knew had not been earned, and that such action on their part would render them liable to prosecution. They knew, further, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>impairment of the capital \u00f3f the company, amounting to $72,000, found on December 31, last, was partly caused by the payment of unearned dividends. They felt they had no right to discriminate between the dividends declared and paid, and the dividends declared, but not withdrawn, and the only way was to treat them all alike. Hence the resolution passed March 28, 1906.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b718-5\">Upon assuming office, the new board of directors, in April of 1906, passed the following resolutions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b718-6\">\u201cWhereas, an examination of the affairs of the company shows that during the following years the following dividends have been paid to policy holders, namely: During the year 1902 the sum of $21,034.77; during the year 1903 the sum of $25,827.44; during the year 1904 the sum of $35,401.52; during the year 1905 the sum of $49,537.28; and during the year 1906 to date the sum of $11,876.47;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b718-7\">\u201cWhereas on the 1st day of January, 1902, the capital and surplus of the company amounted to $285,576.06, and whereas, since the 1st day of January, 1902, the business of the company has yearly shown a net loss until the 1st day of January, 1906, the above capital and surplus of $285,576.36 was reduced to $28,403 43;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b718-8\">\u201cAnd, whereas, each of the above dividends as paid or declared by the company were not paid or declared out of the profits of the company, but were paid or declared out of the reserve, capital, and surplus, and such declaration was therefore void and illegal:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b718-9\">\u201cResolved that all actions of the board of directors, of the executive committee, or of the officers of the company, in declaring such dividends, be rescinded, and that the following action be taken relative to the dividends declared, or to be declared, on the different policies:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b718-10\">\u201cAs to ordinary life, limited payment life and endowment policies, editions April, 1898, and January, 1899, the dividends so paid shall be charged against such policies, the insured being notified, and shall remain a lien thereupon at 5 per cent, per annum until paid, which payment may be made by note, cash or installments with subsequent premiums, provided, however, that where such dividends, or any part thereof, are still standing to the credit of such policies, the same shall be charged back, and their respective holders be notified of same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b718-11\">\u201cAs to all other forms of policies, all dividends paid since the 1st day of January, 1902, shall be a lien upon the policy with 5 per cent, interest from the date of the several payments, and shall be deducted in any settlement ,of the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b718-12\">\u201cAs to the item of $31,019.06, or any other dividends declared since the 1st day of January, 1902, and carried on the books of the company as a liability, the same not having been earned, and having been improperly declared, as aforesaid, they shall be abrogated and the amount thereof shall be turned over to the profit and loss account of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b718-13\">\u201cAs to all dividends that have been declared and paid on any form of policy since the 1st day of January, 1906, these dividends shall be a lien upon the policy together with 5 per cent, interest from the several dates of payment, and shall be deducted in any settlement made of the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b718-14\">\u201cAll interests or dividends heretofore paid, or credited, shall be charged up to date on each policy, and then on December 31, 1906, and annually thereafter.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b718-15\">\u25a0 The plaintiff, being of full age, is the holder of its participating 20 payment life policy No. 7,891 for $5,000, issued on the 14th day of October, 1899, calling for the payment of an annual premium or consideration of $284.50, which is in full forte and effect.

The dividend which plaintiff seeks to recover falls within the former class. Nothing is better settled than that dividends should be paid out of surplus and profits, and cannot be lawfully paid out of capital contributed by the shareholders, for the purpose of carrying on the company\u2019s business, and for the protection of its creditors. 2 Thompson on Corp. \u00a7 2126; Morawitz on Corp. \u00a7 453. To pay a dividend otherwise is forbidden by Pen. Code, \u00a7 594, subd. 1, and Insurance Law, Laws 1892, p. 1968, c. 690, \u00a7 83, authorizes dividends to policy holders to be paid only out of the surplus of the company. To require the defendant to pay plaintiff the premium declared upon his policy for the year 1905, which, if paid, would necessarily be paid out of capital, and not out of surplus, would be to compel the officers of defendant to do an illegal act. Of course no such judgment can be made. As to the right of the defendant to recover from other policy holders dividends which have been paid them out of capital, we cannot now pronounce any judgment as the parties to be affected are not before the court. Concerning the dividends heretofore paid to plaintiff, which it is now sought to charge against him as a liability, a different question arises. It does not appear that the payment of these dividends impaired the capital of the company. The only ground of objection to them is that they were not formally declared by the board of directors, or even by the executive committee. Neither the charter or by-laws provide specifically by whom dividends shall be declared, and, in the absence of any specific provision on the subject, we suppose that the discretion of determining how much of the surplus and profits earned by the company should be divided among the stockholders, is a matter peculiarly for the board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">Perhaps if the company refused to pay such a dividend, it might have defended a claim for the dividend, upon the ground that it had never been declared by competent authority. But, having paid it to plaintiff, who, as a policy holder, stood in a position analogous to that of a creditor, without notice of any infirmity in the manner of declaration, we think that the payment must be considered as a voluntary payment by the defendant, and that it may not now be recovered. The acquiescence of the company in the unauthorized act of its officers implies ratification. If the company could not recover back the dividends, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>we know of no principle that will permit it to charge them as a liability against the policy to be collected thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">There must be judgment, without costs, first, that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover from defendant the sum of $50.60, declared as a dividend upon his policy in the year 1905, but not paid; and, second, that the defendant is not entitled to recover from plaintiff, to be charged as a lien upon his policy, the sum paid him in the years 1901 to 1904 both inclusive, as dividends upon his said policy. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
