It being plain and unambigous, facts dehors may not be resorted to for its interpretation. It is not affected by the absence of the word \u201cheirs\u201d or other words of inheritance. A reservation by the grantor in a deed-poll is deemed a grant by the grantee to him, and operates as such. 3 Wash, on Real Prop. (5th Ed.) pp. 461-2, 470-3; Reeves on Real Prop. p. 166; Claflin v. B. &amp; A. R. Co., 157 Mass. 489, 32 N. E. 659, 20 L. R. A. 638; Stockbridge Iron Co. v. Hudson Iron Co., 107 Mass. 321. It was therefore necessary at common law for a reservation to be to the grantor and his heirs in order to make it perpetual instead of\" personal to him, that being the rule in respect of all grants in order to convey more than a life estate. But that rule was abrogated by statute in this state, and with us a grant without terms of inheritance conveys an estate of inheritance. 1 Rev. St. (1st Ed.) pt. 2, <em>c. </em>1, p. 748, tit. 5, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">HIRSCHBERG, P. J., and WOODWARD and MILLER, JJ., concur; HIRSCHBERG, P. J., and MILLER, J., being also of the opinion that the language of the reservation permits, if it does not require, the construction that the reservation of the right of way is to the grantor\u2019s heirs and assigns, as well as the reservation of the right to project cornices. RICH, J., concurs in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
