In the first item, after a legacy to the wife of his brother Patsey, he provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-8\">\u201cI give and bequeath to my brother, Patsey White, the \u00fase o\u00ed my house and seventeen acres of land lying on the extension of Mill street, in the town of Royalton, until the last of my children shall become of age. Then the property shall be sold and divided equally between my children, share and share alike.\"\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">The testator left four minor children, his only heirs at law. The land devised was sold by proceedings in the Surrogate\u2019s Court to pay the debts of the testator, and after paying the same there was a surplus, which came into the hands of the executor and was included among the assets for distribution upon the judicial settlement of his account. The surrogate, in construing the provision of the will quoted, for the purpose of decreeing distribution, has determined that the division of the property of the testator is suspended during the lives of the four minor children, which would be an unlawful suspension, and by his decree has directed distribution of this surplus to the guardians of the respective infants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">We cannot concur in his decision. The testator did .not create any trust in his brother. He only permitted him to enjoy the use of the property for a designated time. The primary scheme of the will apparently was to provide for his children, and he accomplished that purpose by vesting the title in them absolutely, but not to be enjoyed in possession until the youngest child attained his majority. They held a future estate with a precedent estate created at the same time. Section 27, Real Property Law (chapter 547, p. 564, Laws 1896). There was no suspension of the power of alienation. \u201cThe absolute power of alienation is suspended only when there is no person in being by whom an absolute fee in possession can be conveyed.\u201d Section 32, Real Property Laws. There are persons in being who can convey the property devised by the testator. Patsey White, who had the use, and the children, in whom thevfee was vested, could pass an indefeasible title at any time by joining in a conveyance of the premises, and immediate possession of the premises could be given. The remainder was not contingent, but vested; and the construction which permits this will be upheld where it can be consistently done. Hersee v. Simpson, 154 N. Y. 496, 48 N. E. 890; Miller v. Gilbert, 144 N. Y. 68, 38 N. E. 979. If one of the children died, his title would pass by descent to his heirs at law, even though the date of possession was not reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">The distinction between this case and others which have been held to offend against the statute of perpetuities is that in that class of cases a trust was created and the estate did not vest, as in Haynes v. Sherman et al., 117 N. Y. 433, 22 N. E. 938, while here the devisees took the title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>immediately upon the death of their devisor, but the enjoyment of it was postponed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-3\">The decree, so far as appealed from, should be reversed, with costs to appellant payable from the fund, and the proceeding remitted to the. Surrogate\u2019s Court of Niagara county to correct its decree in compliance with this opinion. So ordered. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
