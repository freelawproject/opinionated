The appellants, in their pleading which they seek to amend, admitted' the execution of the agreement, and that they do not now deny; but they charge that the plaintiffs have taken advantage of the phraseology, which the appellants at the time of the execution of the contract deemed ambiguous, and now contend for a construction contrary to the agreement as actually intended by both parties at the time. They claim that the plaintiffs now contend for an erroneous construction, of which, until the recent decision of the Special Term in Kings county in the case of Kalbach against them, they did not deem the contract fairly susceptible. They now, however, ask to have the contract reformed to clearly express the agreement which the parties intended' to make by the contract as drafted. They are not guilty of la'ches, and they should be afforded an opportunity to establish, if they can, facts which will warrant the court in reforming the contract before they are obliged to comply therewith. It is doubtful whether th\u00e9 contract is susceptible of the construction for which the plaintiffs contend; but, in the circumstances, the appellants should not be obliged to run the risk of a favorable construction, and should be permitted to have their pleadings in such form that they may, if necessary, demand the reformation of the contract. Since, however, the effect of granting the application will be to take the case off the calendar and delay the trial of the issue, and to present a new issue, the amendment should only be granted upon payment of all costs of the action to date.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">It follows that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, upon payment of all costs to date. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
