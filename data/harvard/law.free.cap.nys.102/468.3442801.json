The plaintiff was struck by a north-bound car while crossing the north <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>cross-walk of Columbus avenue and 107th street. The accident happened on a clear morning. According to plaintiff\u2019s own testimony he looked and saw no car, then walked to within three or four feet of the track, heard a wagon rattling, turned in the direction from which the sound came, looked south, and saw a wagon. He did not see any car, and started to cross over, and was just stepping on the track, when he heard somebody \u201choller.\u201d The car was then five of six feet away. The car struck him and knocked him back in the direction from which he came. Clearly, the plaintiff did not exercise the care which the law requires to establish freedom from contributory negligence. Madigan v. Third Ave. R. R. Co., 68 App. Div. 123, 74 N. Y. Supp. 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The judgment, therefore, must be reversed, and a new trial ordered with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
