Neither of those convictions constitutes a predicate felony conviction pursuant to Penal Law \u00a7 70.06. The California burglary statute under which defendant was convicted <em>(see, </em>Cal Penal Code \u00a7 459) has no New York felony equivalent <em>(see, People v Lockwood, </em>186 AD2d 985). Assault with intent to commit rape under the California Penal Code <em>(see, </em>Cal Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 220, 240, 261) encompasses conduct comparable to attempted rape in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 110.00, 130.35 [1], [2]), a class C violent felony <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 70.02 [1] [b]). The California statute, however, also criminalizes conduct that would constitute attempted rape in the third degree <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 130.25 [1]), a class A misdemeanor <em>(see, </em>Penal Law \u00a7 110.05 [7]), as well as conduct that would not constitute a crime in this State <em>(see generally, People v Hough, </em>159 Mise 2d 997). The People failed to produce the California accusatory instrument to clarify the statutory charge <em>(see, People v Gonzalez, </em>61 NY2d 586, 591) and enable the sentencing court to \"determine, if possible, for which act under the statute the defendant was convicted\u201d <em>(People v Jackson, </em>118 AD2d 469, 470, <em>Iv denied </em>67 NY2d 944). Conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>quently, the People failed to meet their burden of establishing that the California conviction of assault with intent to commit rape constitutes a predicate felony <em>(see, People v Jackson, supra, </em>at 471; <em>see also, </em>CPL 400.21 [7]). We modify the judgment, therefore, by vacating the sentence and remit the matter to Cattaraugus County Court for resentencing of defendant as a first felony offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">We have examined defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, including those raised in defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief, and conclude that none requires reversal.
