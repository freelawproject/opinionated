We conclude that the general standard of care is always \u201creasonable care,\u201d and it is for the jury to determine whether the defendant\u2019s conduct in a given case fell below that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">In this case, the trial court instructed the jury that electricity is inherently dangerous and, therefore, that defendant was required to inspect and repair its electrical lines. Because the instruction imposed an obligation to inspect and repair, it was improper. Further, we cannot conclude that the error in this case was harmless. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment for plaintiffs and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">Plaintiffs Kenneth and Diana Case were dairy farmers during the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s. In 1986, plaintiffs sold their dairy cows in a government buyout program. According to plaintiffs, the sale was induced by financial stress, which was a result of low milk production. In 1993, plaintiffs bought a new herd and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>resumed dairy farming. Shortly after buying the new herd, plaintiffs concluded that their earlier milk-production problems were caused by stray voltage, and sued Consumers Power Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Stray voltage (technically referred to as neutrai-toearth voltage, or nev) is an electrical phenomenon that can sometimes affect livestock, causing decreased milk production in dairy cows, among other problems. According to the parties, the voltage is so low that humans cannot detect it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stray voltage can have different causes, and stray voltage on a farm may be caused by a problem on the farm, a problem in Consumers\u2019 wires off the farm, or even a problem on another customer\u2019s property, such as a neighboring farm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is a procedure, sometimes referred to as \u201cseparating the neutrals,\u201d that, according to the parties, will eliminate all off-farm sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In this case, plaintiffs alleged that stray voltage depressed milk production on their farm until the neutrals were separated, whereupon milk production returned to normal. Defendant responded that it was not negligent, and that plaintiffs\u2019 milk-production problems were not caused by stray voltage. After hearing evidence regarding stray voltage and the problems on plaintiffs\u2019 farm, a jury rendered an award for plaintiffs, although the jury also found plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>partially at fault (fifty-five percent). Defendant filed motions for directed verdict, judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and a new trial, all of which the trial court denied. Defendant appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We then granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">The only issue before this Court concerns a jury instruction regarding the standard of care owed by Consumers to plaintiffs. Over Consumers\u2019 objection,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">It was the duty of the Defendant in connection with this occurrence to use ordinary care for the safety of the Plaintiffs\u2019 property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">It is well settled that electrical energy possesses inherently dangerous properties requiring expertise in dealing with its phenomena. Therefore Consumers Power Company has a duty to reasonably inspect and repair wires and other instrumentalities in order to discover and remedy hazards and defects. Consumers Power Company, being engaged in the transmission of electricity, is bound to anticipate ordinary use of the area surrounding the lines and to . . . appropriately safeguard an attendant risk. The test to determine whether a duty was owed is not whether Consumers Power Company should have anticipated a particular act from which the injury resulted, but whether it should have foreseen the probability that injury might result from any reasonable activity done on the premises for business, work or pleasure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">We review claims of instructional error de novo. In doing so, we examine the jury instructions as a whole to determine whether there is error requiring reversal. The instructions should include all the elements of the plaintiff\u2019s claims and should not omit material issues, defenses, or theories if the evidence supports them. Instructions must not be extracted piecemeal to establish error. Even if somewhat imperfect, instructions do not create error requiring reversal if, on balance, the theories of the parties and the applicable law are adequately and fairly presented to the jury. <em>Murdock v Higgins, </em>454 Mich 46, 60; 559 NW2d 639 (1997). We will only reverse for instructional error where failure to do so would be inconsistent with substantial justice. MCR 2.613(A); <em>Johnson v Corbet, </em>423 Mich 304; 377 NW2d 713 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">To establish a prima facie case of negligence, a plaintiff must prove four elements: (1) a duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, (2) a breach of that duty, (3) causation,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (4) damages. <em>Schultz v Consumers Power Co, </em>443 Mich 445, 449; 506 NW2d 175 (1993). The disputed instruction in this case was intended to aid the jury in determining whether defendant breached its duty to plaintiffs to exercise \u201creasonable care.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This is the so-called \u201cgeneral stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>dard of care\u201d applicable in negligence cases. See <em>Moning v Alfono, </em>400 Mich 425, 443; 254 NW2d 759 (1977). Ordinary care means the care that a reasonably careful person would use under the circumstances. See SJI2d 10.02; <em>Detroit &amp; Milwaukee R Co v Van Steinburg, </em>17 Mich 99, 118-119 (1868) (\u201cNegligence . . . consists in a want of that reasonable care which would be exercised by a person of ordinary prudence under all the existing circumstances, in view of the probable danger of injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Ordinarily, it is for the jury to determine whether a defendant\u2019s conduct fell below the general standard of care. Stated another way, the jury usually decides the <em>specific </em>standard of care that should have been exercised by a defendant in a given case. <em>Moning, supra </em>at 438. However, <em>the court </em>sometimes decides the specific standard of care if it is of the opinion \u201cthat all reasonable persons would agree or there is an overriding legislatively or judicially declared public policy . . . .\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">For example, in <em>Schultz, supra, </em>the plaintiff was electrocuted and died after an aluminum ladder he was using came too close to Consumers Power Company\u2019s 4,800 volt transmission lines. This Court recognized that \u201celectricity possesses inherently dangerous properties\u201d and that \u201celectric utility companies possess expertise in dealing with electrical phenomena and delivering electricity.\u201d <em>Schultz </em>at 451. Accordingly, the <em>Schultz </em>Court held not only that electric utility companies owed a duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining their wires, but that those companies are required to \u201creasonably inspect and repair wires and other instrumentalities in order to discover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>and remedy hazards and defects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court in <em>Schultz </em>cited a number of cases in support of its conclusion, all but one of which involved the dangers of unintended contact with high-voltage electricity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In this case, the trial court concluded that it was bound to instruct the jury consistently with the standard articulated in <em>Schultz, </em>although it expressed some reservation about doing so.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>The \u201cduty\u201d of inspection and repair imposed in <em>Schultz </em>was intended to protect against the likelihood of serious injury or death. <em>Id. </em>at 453-454. Clearly, \u201creasonable care under the circumstances\u201d represents a sliding scale. The more severe the potential injury, the more resources a reasonable person will expend to try and prevent that injury. Similarly, the greater the likelihood that a severe injury will result, the greater the lengths a reasonable person will go to prevent it. This principle is widely recognized.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">With this principle in mind, we think it beyond dispute that the dangers of high-voltage electricity (fire, electrocution, and death among them) are different in kind, and more severe, than the dangers of stray voltage. <em>Schultz </em>represents a very limited exception to the general rule that <em>the jury </em>determines the specific standard of care owed by a defendant in a particular case, and stray voltage simply does not qualify for that unusual treatment. Thus, we conclude that the obligation to inspect and repair that was articulated in <em>Schultz </em>is inapplicable in stray-voltage cases. Rather, we conclude that a jury must determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>precise actions required to meet the reasonable care standard in stray-voltage cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">As the United States Supreme Court recognized long ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">There is no fixed standard in the law by which a court is enabled to arbitrarily say in every case what conduct shall be considered reasonable and prudent, and what shall constitute ordinary care, under any and all circumstances. The terms \u201cordinary care,\u201d \u201creasonable prudence,\u201d and such like terms, as applied to the conduct and affairs of men, have a relative significance, and cannot be arbitrarily defined. What may be deemed ordinary care in one case may, under different surroundings and circumstances, be gross negligence. The policy of the law has relegated the determination of such questions to the jury, under proper instructions from the court. It is their province to note the special circumstances and surroundings of each particular case, and then say whether the conduct of the parties in that case was such as would be expected of reasonable, prudent men, under a similar state of affairs. <em>[Grand Trunk R Co v Ives, </em>144 US 408, 417; 12 S Ct 679; 36 L Ed 485 (1892).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Plaintiffs argue that, even if the disputed instruction was erroneous, it was harmless. Indeed, as plaintiffs point out, most of the instructions read to the jury properly cited the ordinary care standard. However, the disputed instruction specifically required defendant to \u201cinspect and repair\u201d its lines to prevent stray voltage. The instruction thus took from the jury one of the crucial questions before it: in light of the level of danger and likelihood of injury posed by stray voltage, what actions was defendant required to take in order to prevent such injury? Put differently, the instructions failed to present one of Consumers\u2019 primary defenses to the jury \u2014 that Consumers had no obligation to discover and repair unknown stray volt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>age problems. The essence of Consumers\u2019 position was that it was acceptable to wait for problems to be reported before it had to take action. Under these circumstances, we must reverse the verdict and remand for a new trial. <em>Gapske v Hatch, </em>347 Mich 648, 657-659; 81 NW2d 337 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">By our analysis we do not intend to suggest that ordinary care regarding stray voltage requires less than reasonable inspection and repair, or that it requires more than merely waiting for problems to be reported. Rather, we simply acknowledge that the jury must decide on the basis of the evidence before it exactly what actions defendant was required to take under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment for plaintiffs and remand for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b191-6\">Weaver, C.J., and Taylor and Markman, JJ., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-7\"> The parties agree that humans cannot detect the stray voltage at issue, but they use different terminology to explain that fact.

The majority adequately pinpoints the issue as being whether the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on the applicable standard of care in stray voltage cases. <em>Ante, </em>p 3. However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe obligation to inspect and repair that was articulated in <em>Schultz [v Consumers Power Co, </em>443 Mich 445, 449; 506 NW2d 175 (1993),] is inapplicable in stray-voltage cases.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 9. I further disagree that a remand for a new trial is warranted. All the critical issues in this case were presented to and properly decided by the jury. Therefore, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>The disputed jury instructions in this case sprang from <em>Schultz. </em>In <em>Schultz, </em>a man was electrocuted while painting a house. He and his companion were moving a metal ladder toward the house when it came close to an uninsulated power line hanging near the house. The proximity of the ladder to the uninsulated wire created an arc of electricity that sent a current of electricity down the ladder and into the men. This Court held that, because of the special relationship between the decedent and the power provider, the power company had an affirmative duty to \u201creasonably inspect and repair wires and other instrumentalities in order to discover and remedy hazards and defects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451. The special relationship arose out of the fact that electricity has inherently dangerous properties, and that special expertise is required to deal with electrical phenomena and the delivery of electricity. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The majority finds <em>Schultz </em>inapplicable to stray voltage cases partially on the basis that \u201cthe dangers of high-voltage electricity (fire, electrocution, and death among them) are different in kind, and more severe, than the dangers of stray voltage.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 9. As such, the majority argues, stray voltage cases should not receive the \u201cunusual treatment\u201d accorded to cases involving high-voltage electricity. <em>Id. </em>Although I agree with the majority that the nature of the danger presented by stray voltage is different than the nature of the danger presented by high-voltage electricity, I disagree that a difference in the type of damage caused justifies a departure from the <em>Schultz </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Stray voltage cases, like cases involving high-voltage electricity, involve harms caused by the properties of electricity. The appellant\u2019s own brief demonstrates this point. According to the appellant, \u201c[a]ll utilities, Consumers included, operate grounded power distribution systems, principally for safety reasons.\u201d Electricity must always return to its source to complete its circuit. If the \u201chot\u201d wire breaks, the current will flow down the nearest ground line into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>earth, bypassing the break until it can reconnect with the neutral at some other point. The ground wire also provides a path to earth for excessive voltage surges from lightning strikes and other accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Because of the inherently dangerous properties of electricity, these ground wires are provided, and must be reasonably maintained and inspected. But for the safety measure of the ground wires, events such as line breaks and lightning strikes would have catastrophic consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Therefore, maintaining and inspecting the neutral ground wires is inextricably bound with those properties of electricity causing fires and electrocution, even though, ordinarily, the neutral wires only carry neutral-to-earth voltage (nev) that is beneath the level of human detection.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Regardless of whether the distribution of high currents of electricity through uninsulated wires in residential neighborhoods might cause death, while the low currents involved in stray voltage cases causes a lesser degree of harm, the level of harm caused does not alter the properties of the electricity itself. The distribution of electricity still requires special knowledge about how to direct and control a dangerous commodity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For example, if a utility worker were injured while climbing up a utility pole, it might be appropriate to apply a different standard than in <em>Schultz </em>because the injury would be unrelated to the properties of electricity. Conversely, the properties of electricity itself give rise to stray voltage injuries. Here, the jury found that the Cases suffered the loss of an entire dairy herd and nearly two million dollars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>in damages because of defendant\u2019s negligence in dealing with the inherently dangerous properties of electricity. I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Schultz. </em>Rather, the trial court appropriately applied <em>Schultz </em>to this stray voltage action.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><em>Schultz\u2019s </em>requirement that providers of electricity \u201creasonably inspect and repair wires and other instru-mentalities in order to discover and remedy hazards and defects\u201d can fairly be applied in stray voltage cases. <em>Id. </em>at 451. While reasonable inspection might include detecting frayed wires or uninsulated wires in residential neighborhoods, reasonableness might not encompass detecting stray voltage. Similarly, power providers could also argue that stray voltage is neither a hazard nor a defect. The questions of reasonableness, of what it means to \u201cinspect and repair,\u201d and what constitutes \u201ca hazard or defect\u201d leave room for interpretation by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The defendant argues that its liability should be proportioned according to the degree of risk involved. While I agree with the majority that the concerns are different in stray voltage cases than in electrocution cases, I disagree that those differences render a <em>Schultz-based </em>jury instruction inadequate. Under the majority\u2019s approach, trial courts will be left to determine when electricity acquires \u201cdangerous\u201d properties. <em>Schultz, </em>on the other hand takes note of the fact that electricity has \u201cinherently dangerous\u201d properties, and allows the jury to determine when inspection and repair is reasonable. I would apply the <em>Schultz </em>test, and would uphold the jury\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The defendant also asserts that it was unable to fully present its arguments. The majority agrees. <em>Ante, </em>pp 10-11. Even if I were to agree with the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>that <em>Schultz </em>creates too high a standard for stray voltage cases, I would disagree with the majority\u2019s harmlessness assessment. The defendant had a fair opportunity to present its arguments. As the majority acknowledges, the defendant\u2019s primary argument is that it need only act with reasonable care under the circumstances, and that it had no duty to inspect and repair its wires. Under the <em>Schultz </em>instructions given, the jury could have concluded that the stray voltage detection required an unreasonable level of inspecting and repairing, or that inspecting and repairing would not serve the purpose of remedying hazards and defects. Thus, the jury had the opportunity to conclude that the defendant was not required to inspect and repair its wires under the circumstances. I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b196-6\">Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b196-7\">Corrigan, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-6\"> As <em>Schultz </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">Clearly, the relationship between the utility company and the decedent was sufficient to impose a duty under the circumstances. It is well established that those who undertake particular activities or enter into special relationships assume a distinctive duty to procure knowledge and experience regarding that activity, person, or thing. For example, a landlord must inspect a premises to keep it in a reasonably safe condition. <em>Samson </em>[v <em>Saginaw Professional Bldg, Inc, </em>393 Mich 393; 224 NW2d 843 (1975)]; <em>Lipsitz v Schechter, </em>377 Mich 685; 142 NW2d 1 (1966); 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 360, p 250. Physicians must keep reasonably abreast of current advances in their field. <em>Koch v Gorrilla, </em>552 F2d 1170 (CA 6, 1977). Manufacturers must diligently inspect their products to discover lurking dangers. <em>Livesley v Continental Motors Corp, </em>331 Mich 434; 49 NW2d 365 (1951); 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, comment, \u00a7 395, pp 326-332.

First, electri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>cal energy possesses inherently dangerous properties. Second, electric utility companies possess expertise in dealing with electrical phenomena and delivering electricity. Lastly, although a reasonable person can be charged with the knowledge of certain fundamental facts and laws of nature that are part of the universal human experience, such as the dangerous properties of electricity, <em>Koehler v Detroit Edison Co, </em>383 Mich 224, 231; 174 NW2d 827 (1970); Pros-ser &amp; Keeton [Torts (5th ed)], \u00a7 32, pp 182-184; 3 Harper, James <em>&amp; </em>Gray, Torts (2d ed), \u00a7 16.5, pp 405408, it is well settled that electricity possesses inherently dangerous properties requiring expertise in dealing with its phenomena. Therefore, pursuant to its duty, a power company has an obligation to reasonably inspect and repair wires and other instrumentalities in order to discover and remedy hazards and defects. <em>[Schultz </em>at 450451.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-9\"> See n 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
