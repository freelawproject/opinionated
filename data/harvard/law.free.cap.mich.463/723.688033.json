The issue before this Court is whether the Court of Appeals properly concluded that plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to create a question of fact with respect to whether defendant regarded her as having a determinable physical or mental characteristic that substantially limited one or more of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>major life activities. We hold that plaintiff did not present sufficient evidence to create such a question, and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">On September 1, 1995, plaintiff signed an employment contract with defendant to begin work as an executive secretary on September 11, 1995.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On September 4, 1995, plaintiff experienced numbness and tingling on her left side, which persisted for four days. She was seen by her family doctor, who referred her to Dr. Green, a neurologist. Plaintiff was able to begin work as scheduled. On September 23, 1995, plaintiff saw Dr. Green, who told her he suspected multiple sclerosis, but was unable to make a positive diagnosis at that time. Plaintiff testified at her deposition that she told defendant and others at the office about this tentative diagnosis. Plaintiff maintains that, after she revealed her condition, defendant undertook a course of harassment, which she attributed to his perception of her medical condition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Dr. Green saw plaintiff again on October 28, 1995. At this time, plaintiff had no symptoms of multiple sclerosis, and Dr. Green indicated on her medical record that she was \u201cdoing fine, feels great.\u201d Plaintiff continued to work without incident until Decem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>ber 28, 1995, when she left work, experiencing a loss of vision in one eye. She was seen by Dr. Green, who diagnosed multiple sclerosis. She was hospitalized for three days, and her vision improved after treatment. However, she did not return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Plaintiff brought this action alleging a violation of the Handicappers\u2019 Civil Rights Act (HCRA) and a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After discovery, defendant moved again for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The circuit court granted the motion, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-6\">[T]here is no evidence that the condition that Plaintiff was perceived to have was a condition which substantially limits one or more for [sic] major life activities. And no evidence to suggest that the Defendant had any knowledge that one or more of the major life activities was limited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">On January 26, 1999, the Court of Appeals issued a two-to-one decision affirming the dismissal of the intentional infliction of emotional distress count, but reversing the dismissal of plaintiffs handicap discrimination claim because it believed that plaintiff had presented sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of handicap discrimination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Relying on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number><em>Sanchez v Lagoudakis,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>plaintiff argued that one could find that her condition was a handicap as defined by the statute because the HCRA prohibits discrimination, even when an individual does not exhibit symptoms of a handicap. A majority of the Court of Appeals agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Noting that under <em>Sanchez, </em>the focus is on the employer\u2019s conduct and belief or intent, and not merely on the employee\u2019s condition, the majority reasoned that the mere fact that plaintiff was symptom free should not preclude her cause of action. The Court of Appeals explained that an \u201cindividual with multiple sclerosis can lead a normal life until the next exacerbation, which occurs with varying frequency and degree.\u201d Similarly, individuals with handicaps such as epilepsy and asthma may have periods of time where they are symptom free. Although plaintiff was not definitively diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, the Court of Appeals reasoned that applying <em>Sanchez, </em>in which the defendant based his employment decision on rumors that the plaintiff had aids, there was sufficient evidence to establish that in the present case, defendant may have regarded plaintiff as handicapped. The Court of Appeals noted that plaintiff\u2019s deposition testimony established that she informed defendant from the beginning of her employment that her doctors suspected she had multiple sclerosis. Further, plaintiff periodically took some time off during September and October 1995 to undergo testing for multiple sclerosis and to receive treatment to lessen the side effects of some of the testing procedures. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Therefore, the Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court had erred in granting summary disposition in defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">Judge Whitbeck dissented. His dissent focused on the fact that the definition of \u201chandicap\u201d was altered by a 1990 amendment to the HCRA<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to require that the physical or mental characteristic in question substantially limit one or more major life activities of the individual. The version of the statute in effect at the time of the events in <em>Sanchez </em>did not include this requirement; thus, it was improper for the majority to rely on that case as support for its conclusion. The dissent reasoned that, under the applicable version of the hcra, the plain language of the statute required defendant to perceive plaintiff as having a characteristic that substantially limited a major life activity. Because plaintiff did not present any evidence that defendant regarded her as having a condition that substantially impaired a major life activity, the dissent concluded that summary disposition was properly granted. '</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">This Court granted leave to appeal. 461 Mich 1020 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">A motion for summary disposition brought pursuant to MCR 2.116(C) (10) tests the factual support of a plaintiff\u2019s claim and is subject to de novo review. <em>Smith v Globe Life Ins Co, </em>460 Mich 446, 454; 597 NW2d 28 (1999). In reviewing a motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10), the court consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>ers the pleadings, affidavits, and other documentary evidence filed in the action or submitted by the parties in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. The motion is properly granted if the documentary evidence presented shows that there is no genuine issue with respect to any material fact and the moving party is therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">The hcra provides that \u201c[a]n employer shall not . . . [discharge or otherwise discriminate against an individual with respect to compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of a handicap[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] that is unrelated to the individual\u2019s ability to perform the duties of a particular job or position.\u201d MCL 37.1202(l)(b); MSA 3.550(202)(l)(b). To establish a prima facie case of handicap discrimination, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) he is handicapped as defined by the hcra, (2) the handicap is unrelated to his ability to perform the duties of his job, and (3) he was discriminated against in one of the ways described in the statute. <em>Chmielewski v Xermac, Inc, </em>457 Mich 593, 602; 580 NW2d 817 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">The act, as amended in 1990, defines handicap for employment related purposes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-7\">(i) A determinable physical or mental characteristic of an individual, which may result from disease, injury, congenital condition of birth, or functional disorder, if the characteristic:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-8\">(A) For purposes of article 2, substantially limits 1 or more of the major life activities of that individual and is unrelated to the individual\u2019s ability to perform the duties of a particular job or position or substantially limits 1 or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>of the major life activities of that individual and is unrelated to the individual\u2019s qualifications for employment or promotion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-6\">(ii) A history of a determinable physical or mental characteristic described in subparagraph (i).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-7\">(iii) Being regarded as having a determinable physical or mental characteristic described in subparagraph (i). [MCL 37.1103(e); MSA 3.550(103)(e).][<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Relying on subsection (iii), plaintiff argued that defendant undertook a course of harassment because he perceived her as handicapped. Thus, resolution of this matter requires us to construe this subsection of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Where statutory language is clear and unambiguous, its plain meaning reflects legislative intent, and judicial construction is not permitted. <em>McKenzie v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>458 Mich 214, 217; 580 NW2d 424 (1998). In this case, we find that the statutory language is clear and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">Considering the statute in its entirety, to qualify for protection under subsection (iii), an employee must be <em>\u201cregarded as having </em>a determinable physical or mental characteristic,\u201d as that characteristic is described in subsection (i) (emphasis added). Subsection (i)(A) describes the determinable physical or mental characteristic as one that <em>\u201csubstantially limits </em>1 or more of the major life activities of that individual . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The characteristic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>must also be unrelated either to \u201cthe individual\u2019s ability to perform the duties of a particular job or position\u201d or to \u201cthe individual\u2019s qualifications for employment or promotion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Thus, while a plaintiff need not actually have a determinable physical or mental characteristic, to qualify as handicapped under subsection (iii), the plain statutory language does require that the plaintiff prove the following elements: (1) the plaintiff was regarded as having a determinable physical or mental characteristic; (2) the perceived characteristic was regarded as substantially limiting one or more of the plaintiff\u2019s major life activities; and (3) the perceived characteristic was regarded as being unrelated either to the plaintiff\u2019s ability to perform the duties of a particular job or position or to the plaintiff\u2019s qualifications for employment or promotion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Only the first two elements are at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">We agree with the Court of Appeals dissent that reliance on <em>Sanchez </em>as support for the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals majority is misplaced. The version of the hcra in effect at the time of the events in <em>Sanchez </em>contained no requirement that the determinable physical or mental characteristic substantially limit a major life activity. Thus, under the pre-1990 version of the statute, a plaintiff only needed to be regarded as having a determinable physical or mental characteristic.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Finally, we note that the phrase \u201cregarded as having,\u201d found in subsection (iii), and the phrases \u201csubstantially limits\u201d and \u201cis unrelated\u201d found in subsection (i)(A), all appear in the present tense. Depending on whether a plaintiff is proceeding under the \u201cactual\u201d or \u201cregarded as\u201d portions of the statute, because of the Legislature\u2019s choice of present tense language in defining the term handicap, we must evaluate the physical or mental characteristic at issue either (1) as it actually existed at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s employment,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or (2) as it was perceived at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Thus, to qualify for coverage under subsection (iii), plaintiff must be regarded as presently having a characteristic that currently creates a substantial limitation of a major life activity.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In this case, plaintiff did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>not present any evidence to create a question of fact regarding whether defendant regarded her as having a characteristic that substantially limited a major life activity at the time she was his employee. She presented no evidence that Dr. Bar-Levav regarded her as unable to perform basic tasks of ordinary life. Indeed, from all indications, she was physically capable of performing her job duties. At most, plaintiff presented evidence that she informed defendant that she had been tentatively diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and that he believed that this might substantially limit her major life activities in the future. Thus, the trial court properly granted summary disposition on plaintiffs claim that she was regarded as handicapped under the hcra.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Although plaintiff also argued in the Court of Appeals that she was actually handicapped pursuant to subsection (i) of the hcra, the Court of Appeals did not address this argument. Therefore, we remand this case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of plaintiffs actual handicap theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>m</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">In conclusion, we find that, in order to succeed on a claim brought under subsection (iii), the plain language of the statute requires an employee prove (1) that the employee was regarded as having a determinable physical or mental characteristic, (2) that the perceived characteristic was regarded as substantially limiting one or more of the plaintiffs major life activities, and (3) that the perceived characteristic was regarded as being unrelated either to the plaintiffs ability to perform the duties of a particular job or position or to the plaintiffs qualifications for employment or promotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Moreover, depending on whether the claim is brought under subsection (i) (\u201cactual\u201d handicap) or subsection (iii) (\u201cperceived\u201d handicap), because of the present-tense language used in the statute, courts must evaluate the physical or mental characteristic at issue either (1) as it actually existed at the time of the plaintiffs employment, or (2) as it was perceived at the time of the plaintiffs employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">Because plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence to create a question of fact regarding whether the defendant regarded her as having a characteristic that substantially limited one or more of her major life activities, we reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s ruling granting summary disposition in defendant\u2019s favor on plaintiffs claim that she was regarded as handicapped pursuant to subsection (iii). We remand to the Court of Appeals for consideration of plaintiff\u2019s actual handicap theory.</p>\n<judges id=\"b915-8\">Corrigan, C.J., and Taylor, Young, and Markman, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-10\"> In 1998, after plaintiff filed her claim, the name of the act was changed to the Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act. 1998 PA 20, MCL 37.1101; MSA 3.550(101).

Focusing on the statute\u2019s requirement that the individual\u2019s condition substantially limits a major life activity, the Court held that it must examine the plaintiff\u2019s condition as it exists, with the benefit of his medication. <em>Id. </em>at 606-607.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Assessing an actual handicap at the time of employment is consistent with the federal approach under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ada).

We remind the dissent that while it may seem incongruous that the hcra does not provide protection against discrimination on the basis of a possibility that one might become handicapped in the future, our duty is to apply the law.

Instead, the Legislature defined protected activity as reporting a violation or being about to report one. The Legislature can and may rewrite the statute, but we will not do so. <em>[Chandler v Dowell Schlumberger, Inc, </em>456 Mich 395, 405-406; 572 NW2d 210 (1998).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">Consequently, while the Legislature may, and perhaps should, amend the hcra to include within its scope of protection discrimination based on the possibility of a future handicap, we decline to do so by construing the hcra in a manner inconsistent with its plain language.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b916-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Kelly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL3\">(dissenting). I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court correctly granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary disposition. Plaintiffs have submitted sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact whether Dr. Bar-Levav discriminated against Ms. Michalski because he thought she was handicapped. Accordingly, I dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Plaintiffs brought their claim pursuant to the Michigan Handicappers\u2019 Civil Rights Act (hcra).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The hcra prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of a handicap. Its definition of a handicap includes \u201c[b]eing regarded as having a determinable physical or mental characteristic\u201d that \u201csubstantially limits 1 or more of the major life activities of that individual .. . .\u201d MCL 37.1103(e); MSA 3.550(103)(e). When an employer discriminates against an employee because the employer perceives the employee as handicapped, the employer is in violation of the HCRA. See <em>Sanchez v Lagoudakis, </em>440 Mich 496; 486 NW2d 657 (1992), <em>(On </em>Remand) 217 Mich App 535; 552 NW2d 472 (1996), rev\u2019d on other grounds <em>(After </em>Remand) 458 Mich 704; 581 NW2d 257 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">In interpreting the scope of subsection (iii) of the HCRA using a narrow \u201cpresent tense\u201d standard, the majority gives it a meaning that the Legislature could not have intended. This Court has declined to embrace a literal construction of statutory language where such literalism would produce unreasonable and unjust results inconsistent with the purpose of the statute. <em>DiBenedetto v West Shore Hosp, </em>461 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>394, 403-404; 605 NW2d 300 (2000). In disregard of this principle, the majority concludes that, to discriminate under the statute, an employer must perceive that its employee has a condition that, at the time, substantially limits a major life activity. Under this interpretation, if the employer discriminated against the employee for having a condition that would develop into a handicap in the future, it would not violate subsection (iii). No violation of the act would occur if the employer discriminated against the employee because the employer perceived that the employee had a condition that presently was becoming a handicap.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">The majority notes that the hcra was amended in 1990. The amendments effected a slight change in the definition of a disability, but did not alter the well-settled purpose of the act. They did nothing to change the legislative intent or the breadth of the \u201cregarded as\u201d prong as stated in the act and described in <em>Sanchez, supra. </em>Under <em>Sanchez, </em>this Court determined that a plaintiff need not display symptoms of a handicap to be protected by the act. Rather, subsection (iii) is violated if an employer discriminates because it believes the employee is handicapped, even if the belief is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">The majority\u2019s \u201cpresent tense\u201d rendering of subsection (iii) whittles the \u201cregarded as\u201d prong down to a nubbin. It leaves a subsection (iii) claim virtually indistinguishable from a claim under subsection (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Subsection (i) extends protection to those who have an \u201cactual handicap.\u201d In order to prevail under that subsection, an employee must show that he suffers from the symptoms of an actual disease that impedes work. In addition, the employer must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>shown to have based an adverse employment decision on that fact. Subsection (iii) addresses situations where an employer is erroneous in believing that the employee has a disability. But, under the majority\u2019s standard, what would a plaintiff have to prove to recover under subsection (iii)?</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">For example, Ms. Michalski could not succeed merely by showing that Dr. Bar-Levav took an adverse action against her because (1) he perceived that she was in a dormant stage of MS and that (2) his perception was that she was becoming handicapped. Under the majority\u2019s \u201cpresent tense\u201d test, she would have to show that (1) she actually exhibited symptoms typical of MS, (2) her employer perceived them as bruiting her life activities, and (3) acted on that perception by taking adverse action against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">Additionally, despite being required to prove the manifest existence of actual symptoms, to succeed under subsection (iii), plaintiff would have to show an absence of the perceived handicapping disorder. Indeed, if she actually suffered from the handicap, recovery would be available under subsection (i), obviating any need for subsection (iii). Hence, the majority\u2019s holding leaves such a narrow avenue for recovery under subsection (iii) that it renders the \u201cregarded as\u201d prong of the hcra a virtual dead letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">Courts must, as far as possible, give effect to every phrase, clause, and word of a statute. <em>People v Borchard-Ruhland, </em>460 Mich 278, 285; 597 NW2d 1 (1999). Moreover, courts should avoid unnecessarily reading any portion of a statute out of existence because of rigid adherence to the doctrines of literalism and plain meaning. See, e.g., <em>Lane v Pena, </em>518 US 187, 199-200; 116 S Ct 1092; 135 L Ed 2d 486 (1996) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>(rejecting petitioner\u2019s invitation to read certain language out of the federal Rehabilitation Act); <em>Mason v Wayne Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>447 Mich 130, 137; 523 NW2d 791 (1994) (declining to \u201cread out of existence\u201d the word \u201ccrosswalks\u201d from the highway exception to Michigan\u2019s governmental immunity statute); <em>Nalepa v Plymouth-Canton Community School </em>Dist, 207 Mich App 580, 588; 525 NW2d 897 (1995) (rejecting an interpretation that \u201cwould read subsection 5 of the governmental immunity act out of the statute entirely\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">The Legislature could not have intended the literal \u201cpresent tense\u201d interpretation embraced by the majority. It is in derogation of established principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">A better view would recognize that it is immaterial whether an employer who perceives an employee as having a substantial limitation, believes it to be \u201cpresent\u201d or \u201cfuture.\u201d If the employer discriminates because it perceives the employee is handicapped or is becoming handicapped, it violates subsection (iii) of the act. Thus, subsection (iii) should be interpreted to contemplate a finding of discrimination for adverse acts against an employee arising from (1) an employer\u2019s perception of a handicap and (2) the perception that the handicap threatens work, even in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">The definition of \u201chandicap\u201d used in the hcra is similar to that used in the federal Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). Ada case law and regulations can be guides for us in interpreting the hcra. See <em>Stevens v Inland Waters, Inc, </em>220 Mich App 212, 216-217; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>559 NW2d 61 (1996). In <em>Sutton v United </em>Airlines, <em>Inc,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-5\">There are two apparent ways in which individuals may fall within this statutory definitional) a covered entity mistakenly believes that a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, or (2) a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual, non-limiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities. In both cases, it is necessary that a covered entity entertain misperceptions about the individual \u2014 it must believe either that one has a substantially limiting impairment that one does not have or that one has a substantially limiting impairment when, in fact, the impairment is not so limiting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The Court then identified that an individual may fall within the definition in another way. The ADA, it said, also protects individuals \u201cwho are regarded as impaired and who, as a result, are substantially limited in a major life activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, quoting <em>School Bd of Nassau Co </em>v <em>Arline, </em>480 US 273, 284; 107 S Ct 1123; 94 L Ed 2d 307 (1987). In other words \u201chaving such an impairment means . . . [having] a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward such impairment . . . .\u201d 29 CFR 1630.2(1)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">In the Michalskis\u2019 case, we are reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary disposition. We must consider all the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in the Michalskis\u2019 favor. <em>Bertrand v Alan Ford, Inc, </em>449 Mich 606, 617-618; 537 NW2d 185 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">The majority has acknowledged that \u201c[Ms. Michal-ski] informed defendant that she had been tentatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and that he believed that this might substantially limit her major life activities in the future.\u201d Federal law considers ms a physical impairment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and there is no dispute here that it qualifies as a physical characteristic under the Michigan statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">Plaintiffs presented Dr. Bar-Levav\u2019s own testimony that he recognized ms as a degenerative neurological disease with an outcome that can be \u201cvery bad.\u201d They alleged that, after learning that Ms. Michalski was suspected of having ms, Dr. Bar-Levav routinely criticized and berated her work, speech and appearance. When she complained of her symptoms, they asserted, he told her that God was punishing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Considering the factual allegations and supporting documents in a light most favorable to plaintiffs, I would find that a jury could infer that defendant regarded Ms. Michalski as handicapped. In addition, it could conclude that she was not handicapped and that defendant acted on his faulty perception in violation of the HCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Plaintiffs created a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether Dr. Bar-Levav erroneously regarded Ms. Michalski as substantially limited in a major life activity because he believed her afflicted with MS. Thus, I would affirm the Court of Appeals reversal of the trial court grant of summary disposition and would remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b921-7\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b916-7\"> MCL 37.1101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.550(101) <em>et seq. </em>The hcra has been renamed the Persons With Disabilities Civil Rights Act.
