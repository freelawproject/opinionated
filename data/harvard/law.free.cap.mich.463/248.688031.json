We conclude that the statute in question did not violate equal protection guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">In October 1978, plaintiff filed a paternity action, alleging that defendant fathered plaintiff\u2019s daughter who was bom in August 1978. In 1980, the parties reached a settlement agreement, and the complaint was dismissed without having determined the issue of paternity. Through the settlement agreement, defendant agreed to pay weekly child support but did not acknowledge paternity. As required by MCL 722.713; MSA 25.493, the trial court approved the terms of the settlement and ordered defendant to pay child support of $20 a week, pending a formal recommendation from the friend of the court. A second order was later entered, increasing the support to $35 a week, and providing that the order was \u201cnot modifiable.\u201d Moreover, this second order provided that the matter \u201cshall stand settled, discontinued, and dismissed\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>to defendant. In January 1981, after receiving the Mend of the court\u2019s support recommendation, the trial court entered a \u201cpermanent\u201d order, requiring defendant to pay $50 a week until the child\u2019s eighteenth birthday or until further order of the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In the early 1990s, plaintiff filed a motion to modify the support order, but the trial court dismissed the motion on the ground of res judicata. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal, holding that the nonmodifiable settlement agreement was binding on the parties. 201 Mich App 443, 447; 506 NW2d 568 (1993) <em>(Crego I). </em>Additionally, the Court rejected plaintiff\u2019s claim that MCL 722.713; MSA 25.493 was an unconstitutional denial of equal protection to illegitimate children. <em>Id. </em>at 446, citing <em>Hisaw v Hayes, </em>133 Mich App 639, 642; 350 NW2d 302 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">In 1995, however, in an unrelated case, the Court of Appeals reached the opposite conclusion when it held that MCL 722.713; MSA 25.493 violated the constitutional guarantees of equal protection because the statute authorized nonmodifiable child support awards in paternity actions, while child support awards in divorce actions always remain modifiable. <em>Dones v Thomas, </em>210 Mich App 674; 534 NW2d 221 (1995). The Court did not make reference to its earlier decision in <em>Crego I. </em>In response to <em>Dones, </em>plaintiff renewed her motion for modification of child support, and the trial court granted the motion, concluding that it was required to follow the decision in <em>Dones, </em>even where that decision conflicted with <em>Crego I. </em>The trial court also held that the parties would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>afforded an opportunity to resolve any issue regarding paternity through the use of dna testing if they so desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Qn appeal, the Court of Appeals held that it would find the statute unconstitutional except that it was barred from doing so by MCR 7.215(H)(1), requiring the Court to follow <em>Crego I, </em>regardless of the <em>Dones </em>decision. 226 Mich App 815, 821 (1997) <em>(Crego II). </em>A conflict panel was convened to resolve the conflict between <em>Crego I </em>and <em>Crego II, </em>MCR 7.215(H)(3),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that panel held that MCL 722.713; MSA 25.493 was unconstitutional as a violation of the equal protection guarantees of the United States and Michigan Constitutions. 232 Mich App 284; 591 NW2d 277 (1998) <em>(Crego III). </em>We granted leave to appeal. 461 Mich 896 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">II. CONFLICTING STATUTORY CHILD SUPPORT PROVISIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The repealed section of the Paternity Act at issue here established a means of enforcing nonmodifiable child support agreements under certain circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">(a) An agreement or compromise made by the mother or child or by some authorized person on their behalf with the father concerning the support and education of the child shall be binding upon the mother and the child only when the court having jurisdiction to compel support and education of the child shall have determined that adequate provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>sion is reasonably secured by payment or otherwise and has approved the agreement or compromise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">(b) The performance of the agreement or compromise, when so approved, <em>shall bar other remedies of the mother or child for the support and education of the child. </em>[MCL 722.713; MSA 25.493 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">It is important to recognize that the challenged statute was only relevant to nonmodifiable agreements where all the following elements were present: (1) a paternity action was filed; (2) the child\u2019s mother and putative father<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> voluntarily entered into an agreement regarding child support, <em>in lieu of </em>a judicial determination of paternity; (3) the circuit court made a determination that the agreement secured \u201cadequate provision\u201d for the child\u2019s needs; and (4) the agreement failed to include language preserving the right to modify support levels at a later time.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">In the instant case, the parties expressly agreed to nonmodifiable support. Specifically, the stipulation provided that, \u201cit is the intent of the parties that the attached order is not modifiable,\u201d and further provided that, \u201cthis matter shall stand settled, discontinued, and dismissed\u201d against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Plaintiff bases her constitutional challenge on the interplay between several statutes providing mechanisms for obtaining child support. Child support may be established through one of three categories of sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>port orders: (1) those entered pursuant to a divorce action; (2) those entered pursuant to a paternity action in which paternity has been established (through one of a number of available methods); and (3) those, as here, entered pursuant to a stipulation to dismiss a paternity action before determining paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">In the first category, children bom or conceived during a marriage are deemed issue of the marriage,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and child support agreements entered in divorce actions always remain modifiable, depending upon changed circumstances. This is made clear through the text of three separate statutory provisions. MCL 552.455(1); MSA 25.222(5)(1) explains the process through which predivorce temporary support orders may be modified; MCL 552.17(1); MSA 25.97(1) explains the process through which support orders entered pursuant to divorce may be modified by motion of the parties; and MCL 552.517; MSA 25.176(17) provides that postjudgment modifications to support orders may be made pursuant to friend of the court recommendations. These provisions, considered together, allow a circuit court to modify all child support agreements reached pursuant to a divorce action.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">In the second category, child support orders remain modifiable where a final paternity determination has been reached by way of a formal paternity action. Such a determination may be made through a variety of methods. In the first of two statutory methods, the Paternity Act, MCL 722.711 <em>et seq.] </em>MSA 25.491 <em>et seq., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>allows modification in cases where an order of filiation has entered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-4\">The court has continuing jurisdiction over proceedings brought under this act to increase or decrease the amount fixed by the order of filiation subject to section 7(3) or (4), and to provide for, change, and enforce provisions of the order relating to the custody or support of or parenting time with the child. [MCL 722.720(1); MSA 25.500(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The second statutory category, also found in the Paternity Act, MCL 722.711 <em>et seq.\\ </em>MSA 25.491 <em>et seq., </em>allows modification in cases where an acknowledgment of paternity has been obtained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">An acknowledgment signed under this act establishes paternity, and the acknowledgment may be the basis for court ordered child support, custody, or parenting time without further adjudication under the paternity act ... . The child who is the subject of the acknowledgment shall bear the same relationship to the mother and the man signing as the father as a child bom or conceived during a marriage and shall have the identical status, rights, and duties of a child bom in lawful wedlock effective from birth. [MCL 722.1004; MSA 25.604.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">Except as otherwise provided by law, a mother and father who sign an acknowledgment that is filed as prescribed in section 5 are consenting to the general, personal jurisdiction of the courts of record of this state regarding the issues of the support, custody, and parenting time of the child. [MCL 722.1010; MSA 25.610.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">It is the third statutory category of establishing child support \u2014 through orders entered pursuant to a voluntary stipulation to dismiss a paternity action before determining paternity \u2014 that is at issue in the instant case. Only in this statutory category are non-modifiable support agreements permitted. It is impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>tant to note, however, that this third category of child support includes both modifiable and nonmodifiable support agreements. The statute does not <em>require </em>that such orders be nonmodifiable; it merely <em>permits </em>nonmodifiable orders, provided that the court determines that the parties\u2019 agreement adequately provides for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">HI. EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution and the Michigan Constitution provide that no person shall be denied the equal protection of the law. US Const, Am XIV; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 2. This Court has found Michigan\u2019s equal protection provision coextensive with the Equal Protection Clause of the federal constitution. See, e.g., <em>Frame v Nehls, </em>452 Mich 171, 183; 550 NW2d 739 (1996) (\u201c[t]he Michigan and federal Equal Protection Clauses offer similar protection\u201d); <em>Doe v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>439 Mich 650, 670-671; 487 NW2d 166 (1992) (\u201ca review of the jurisprudence and constitutional history of this state suggests . . . that our Equal Protection Clause was intended to duplicate the federal clause and to offer similar protection\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The essence of the Equal Protection Clauses is that the government not treat persons differently on account of certain, largely innate, characteristics that do not justify disparate treatment. <em>Miller v Johnson, </em>515 US 900, 919; 115 S Ct 2475; 132 L Ed 2d 762 (1995); <em>El Souri v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>429 Mich 203, 207; 414 NW2d 679 (1987). Conversely, the Equal Protection Clauses do not prohibit disparate treatment with respect to individuals on account of other, presumably more genuinely differentiating, character<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>istics. <em>Puget Sound Power &amp; Light Co v City of Seattle, </em>291 US 619; 54 S Ct 542; 78 L Ed 1025 (1934). Moreover, even where the Equal Protection Clauses are implicated, they do not go so far as to prohibit the state from distinguishing between persons, but merely require that \u201cthe distinctions that are made not be arbitrary or invidious.\u201d <em>Avery v Midland Co, Texas, </em>390 US 474, 484; 88 S Ct 1114; 20 L Ed 2d 45 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">When a party raises a viable equal protection challenge, the court is required to apply one of three traditional levels of review, depending on the nature of the alleged classification. The highest level of review, or \u201cstrict scrutiny,\u201d is invoked where the law results in classifications based on \u201csuspect\u201d factors such as race, national origin, or ethnicity, none of which are implicated in this case. <em>Plyler v Doe, </em>457 US 202, 216-217; 102 S Ct 2382; 72 L Ed 2d 786 (1982). Absent the implication of these highly suspect categories, an equal protection challenge requires either rational-basis review or an intermediate, \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d review.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">A. WHERE RATIONAL BASIS APPLIES</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Under rational-basis review, courts will uphold legislation as long as that legislation is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. <em>Dandridge v Williams, </em>397 US 471, 485; 90 S Ct 1153; 25 L Ed 2d 491 (1970). To prevail under this highly deferential standard of review, a challenger must show that the legislation is \u201carbitrary and wholly unrelated in a rational way to the objective of the statute.\u201d <em>Smith v Employment Security Comm, </em>410 Mich 231, 271; 301 NW2d 285 (1981). A classification reviewed on this basis passes constitutional muster if the legislative judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ment is supported by any set of facts, either known or which could reasonably be assumed, even if such facts may be debatable. <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 613-614; 267 NW2d 72 (1978). Rational-basis review does not test the wisdom, need, or appropriateness of the legislation, or whether the classification is made with \u201cmathematical nicety,\u201d or even whether it results in some inequity when put into practice. <em>O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mut Automobile Ins Co, </em>404 Mich 524, 542; 273 NW2d 829 (1979). Rather, the statute is presumed constitutional, and the party challenging it bears a heavy burden of rebutting that presumption. <em>Shavers, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">B. WHERE HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY APPLIES</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized an intermediate level of review, between strict-scrutiny and rational-basis review, under which a challenged statutory classification will be upheld only if it is \u201csubstantially related to an important governmental objective.\u201d <em>Clark v Jeter, </em>486 US 456, 461; 108 S Ct 1910; 100 L Ed 2d 465 (1988). This \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d standard has been applied to legislation creating classifications on such bases as illegitimacy and gender. The standard recognizes that, while there may be certain immutable distinctions, for example, between men and women or between legitimate and illegitimate children, that justify differing legislative treatments under some circumstances, the Legislature\u2019s authority to invoke those distinctions should not be viewed as an \u201cimpenetrable barrier that works to shield otherwise invidious discrimination.\u201d <em>Gomez v Perez, </em>409 US 535, 538; 93 S Ct 872; 35 L Ed 2d 56 (1973). See also, e.g., <em>Clark, supra; Mills v Hab-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>luetzel, </em>456 US 91; 102 S Ct 1549; 71 L Ed 2d 770 (1982); <em>Mathews v Lucas, </em>427 US 495, 505-506; 96 S Ct 2755; 49 L Ed 2d 651 (1976) (all applying heightened scrutiny to classifications based on illegitimacy). Thus, where an equal protection claim alleges unconstitutional treatment on the basis of illegitimacy, the Supreme Court has held that \u201ca State may not invidiously discriminate against illegitimate children by denying them substantial benefits accorded children generally.\u201d <em>Gomez, supra </em>at 538. However, where a challenged statute is substantially related to an important state interest, the statute should be upheld. <em>Mills, supra </em>at 98-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">IV. PROBLEMS IN CHARACTERIZATION</p>\n<p id=\"Aqk\">A. GENERAL PROBLEMS IN CHARACTERIZATION</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Whether the Court uses a rational-basis or heightened scrutiny standard of review depends on the characterization of the statutorily created classifications. See, e.g., <em>Mathews, supra </em>at 504. Legislation, by its intrinsic nature, creates classifications, typically resulting in benefits or detriments to defined classes. See, e.g., <em>Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v Feeney, </em>442 US 256, 271-272; 99 S Ct 2282; 60 L Ed 2d 870 (1979); <em>F S Royster Guano Co v Virginia, </em>253 US 412, 415; 40 S Ct 560; 64 L Ed 989 (1920). It may sometimes be difficult, at least outside the realm of \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d review, to define a law in terms of whether it is countenancing a constitutionally impermissible classification or merely classifying persons who are genuinely situated differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">This is because, in one sense, an equal protection claim simultaneously asserts that two persons are similarly situated, but also that, at another level, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>persons are <em>not </em>similarly situated. The assertion that the two <em>are </em>similarly situated forms the predicate for the argument that, notwithstanding such similarity, they are being treated in a differing manner in some regard. The assertion that the two are <em>not </em>similarly situated is a function of the fact that there is some unshared characteristic that allegedly forms the basis for the differing treatment. Consequently, because an equal protection claim sometimes implicates this tension between the assertions of similarity and dissimilarity, its success may sometimes rise or fall on the basis of a court\u2019s characterization of the classifications created by a particular statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">B. SPECIFIC PROBLEMS IN CHARACTERIZATION</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Not surprisingly, defendant characterizes this case as one in which different treatment has been properly afforded to children who were not, in fact, similarly situated. Rather, children whose paternity <em>had </em>been ascertained were treated differently than children whose paternity had <em>not </em>been ascertained. This is not an unreasonable characterization. The only children affected by the statute were those: (1) whose putative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>father had not admitted paternity by signing an acknowledgment; (2) whose putative father had not been adjudicated the natural father through an order of filiation; and (3) whose mother had not been able to obtain, through stipulation, a modifiable support agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The constitutional challenge here, from defendant\u2019s perspective, is not unlike that raised in <em>Frame v Nehls, supra. </em>In <em>Frame, </em>a grandfather sought visitation rights with his illegitimate grandchild. Under the relevant statute, grandparents only had standing to seek visitation during the pendency of a \u201cchild custody dispute.\u201d Because a paternity action was not within the statutory definition of a \u201cchild custody dispute,\u201d the grandfather lacked standing, and he challenged the statute on equal protection grounds, claiming that it unconstitutionally differentiated between legitimate and illegitimate children.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">As in the instant case, the Court of Appeals in <em>Frame </em>agreed that the challenged statute created classifications on the basis of illegitimacy, and it found the statute an unconstitutional denial of equal protection. <em>Frame v Nehls, </em>208 Mich App 412, 416; 528 NW2d 773 (1995). However, this Court disagreed, holding that the classification did not distinguish between children on the basis of illegitimacy. Rather, this Court pointed out that grandparents had standing to pursue visitation regardless of the child\u2019s legitimacy where, for example, the parents of a child bom out of wedlock married, then later divorced. Consequently, this Court concluded that the statute did not create classifications on the basis of illegitimacy. 452 Mich 186-187.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Under this statute, there are a variety of situations under which illegitimate children receive the same right to fully modifiable support as children bom during a marriage. First, where a putative father has signed an acknowledgment of paternity, any child support order entered regarding the child is fully modifiable, because that child was, and is, accorded the \u201cidentical status, rights, and duties of a child bom in lawful wedlock.\u201d MCL 722.1004; MSA 25.604. Second, where a putative father has been adjudicated the natural father by a circuit court, and an order of filiation has been entered, any child support order entered regarding that child was, and is, modifiable under MCL 722.720; MSA 25.500. Finally, where the parties to a paternity action have reached an agreement regarding child support, that agreement is modifiable as long as the support order includes language allowing modification. Consequently, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the statute has not created a classification on the basis of illegitimacy, but rather has created a classification on the basis of whether <em>paternity had been legally determined. </em>This is a classification that distinguishes between categories of illegitimate children, not between the categories of illegitimate and legitimate children. Under this interpretation, the statute should be upheld as long as it is rationally related to a permissible legislative objective.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Dandridge, supra </em>at 485; <em>Manistee Bank &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>Trust v McGowan, </em>394 Mich 655, 668; 232 NW2d 636 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">The dissent concludes that \u201c[i]t is unreasonable to find that the statute did anything except distinguish the treatment of children on the basis of legitimacy.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 284 (Kelly, J., dissenting); see also <em>post </em>at 293-294 (Weaver, C.J., dissenting). The dissenting justices reach this conclusion because, \u201cillegitimate children, and they alone, received disparate treatment.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 284 (Kelly, J., dissenting); see also <em>post </em>at 294 (Weaver, C.J., dissenting). However, the facts in the instant case are not unlike the facts in <em>Geduldig v Aiello, </em>for example, where women, and they alone, were denied certain disability insurance benefits because the policy excluded benefits for pregnancy. 417 US 484; 94 S Ct 2485; 41 L Ed 2d 256 (1974).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In response to the argument that the challenged provision discriminated on the basis of gender because it <em>only </em>affected women \u2014 an argument analogous to the dissents\u2019 conclusion in the instant case \u2014 the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">While it is true that only women can become pregnant it does not follow that every legislative classification concerning pregnancy is a sex-based classification .... The [insurance] program divides potential recipients into two groups \u2014 pregnant women and nonpregnant persons. While the first group is exclusively female, the second includes members of both sexes. The fiscal and actuarial benefits of the program thus accrue to members of both sexes. <em>[Id. </em>at 496, n 20.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Likewise, \u201c[w]hile it is true\u201d that only illegitimate children face the risk of being unable to determine paternity with legal certainty, \u201cit does not follow that every legislative classification concerning\u201d the determination of paternity is an illegitimacy-based classification. Rather, in each case, the fundamental classification may be more appropriately identified as distinguishing between subclassifications of the larger group \u2014 only women who are pregnant, and only illegitimate children who have not determined paternity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Plaintiff, like the dissents, and also not surprisingly, characterizes the challenged statute as one creating a statutory classification on the basis of illegitimacy. And although we could reasonably conclude that the statute merely differentiated on the basis of whether paternity had been ascertained, we also acknowledge that plaintiff\u2019s characterization of the statute is not unreasonable. First and foremost is our acknowledgment that the statute, where it applies, <em>only </em>affects illegitimate children. There is no apparent set of circumstances under which a legitimate child would be the object of an enforceable, nonmodifiable support agreement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And while we do not find this dispositive regarding the \u201ccorrect\u201d characterization of the statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>see <em>Geduldig, supra, </em>it certainly provides support for a reasonable conclusion that the statute does create illegitimacy-based classifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We find it noteworthy that the Paternity Act itself, on its face, unquestionably differentiates between illegitimate and legitimate children. Indeed, it is an act created solely to apply to illegitimate children, to afford those children an opportunity to obtain child support that has always been available to legitimate children. Yet, surely plaintiff would not argue that the act itself is violative of equal protection merely because it recognizes the unique circumstances of the illegitimate child. But for this act, illegitimate children had no clearly enforceable means of obtaining support from their fathers. The individual provision in controversy is merely one specific element of the act, and that provision, like the overall act itself, advances the underlying goal of providing support to children who might otherwise be left without that support.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly examined laws differentiating on the basis of illegitimacy. For example, in <em>Mills </em>and <em>Clark, supra, </em>the Court examined Texas and Pennsylvania laws limiting the period during which illegitimate children could establish paternity. The Texas statute required that paternity actions be filed within one year after the illegitimate child\u2019s birth, and the Pennsylvania statute required that paternity actions be filed within six years after the illegitimate child\u2019s birth. As in the instant case, the challenged statutes affected only illegitimate children. However, also similar to the instant case, the challenged Texas and Pennsylvania statutes ultimately only affected a subclassification of illegitimate children \u2014 those who failed to establish pater<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>nity within the statutory period of limitations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See also <em>Lalli v Lalli, </em>439 US 259; 99 S Ct 518; 58 L Ed 2d 503 (1978) (upholding a New York statute imposing a proof requirement on illegitimate children who would inherit from their fathers); <em>Trimble v Gordon, </em>430 US 762; 97 S Ct 1459; 52 L Ed 2d 31 (1977) (striking down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>as unconstitutional an Illinois statute allowing legitimate children to inherit from both parents but precluding illegitimate children from inheriting from their fathers).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">V. RESOLVING the present case</p>\n<p id=\"AZ8\">A. RATIONAL BASIS SATISFIED</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The plaintiff does not claim that the statute in question is unconstitutional on its face. Consequently, the claim must fail unless the statute\u2019s <em>application </em>renders it unconstitutional. When faced with a claim that application of a statute renders it unconstitutional, the Court must analyze the statute \u201cas applied\u201d to the particular case. See, e.g., <em>People v </em>Lino, 447 Mich 567, 570-571; 527 NW2d 434 (1994). Regardless of the level of scrutiny employed, an equal protection challenge requires us to make two findings: the governmental purpose behind the legislative enactment, and how closely related the law is to that purpose. If w\u00e9 view the challenged statute as one that merely differentiates on the basis of whether paternity has been established, we must then determine whether the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. See <em>Dandridge, supra </em>at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The underlying purpose of the Paternity Act is to ensure that minor children bom outside a marriage are provided with support and education. <em>Whybra v Gustafson, </em>365 Mich 396, 400; 112 NW2d 503 (1961). It is beyond dispute that this is a permissible government purpose. Thus, under rational-basis review, the statute should be upheld unless allowing nonmodifiable support agreements where paternity has not been ascertained is \u201carbitrary and wholly unrelated in a rational way to the objective of\u201d securing support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>for children. <em>Smith v Employment Security Comm, supra </em>at 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In the context of a law created to secure child support from fathers, there is a core distinction between knowing who the child\u2019s father is and not knowing who the child\u2019s father is. Absent the disputed law, children whose paternity could not be determined had no means of obtaining support from their fathers. MCL 722.713; MSA 25.493 directly addressed the proof problem present in child support cases involving illegitimate children by providing an <em>additional </em>method by which illegitimate children could obtain financial support, again, a permissible, and even compelling government interest. See <em>Clark, supra </em>at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">As a result of DNA testing, the accuracy with which paternity can be proven has increased significantly since the parties in this lawsuit entered into their support agreement. See Shapiro, Reifler &amp; Psome, <em>The DNA paternity test: Legislating the future paternity action, </em>7 J Law &amp; Health 1, 29 (1992-93) (current testing methods can determine the probability of paternity to 99.999999% accuracy). However, at the time the parties before us entered into the disputed agreement, proving paternity was a very significant obstacle to an illegitimate child\u2019s access to child support. The first reported results of modem DNA paternity testing did not occur until 1985. See Blakesley, <em>Scientific testing and proof of paternity: Some controversy and key issues for family law counsel, </em>57 La L R 379, 382 (1997) (\u201cIn fact, since its first reported results in 1985, DNA matching has progressed to \u2018general acceptance in less than a decade\u2019 \u201d). Of course, while prior blood-testing methods could exclude some males from being the possible father of a child, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>those methods could not affirmatively pinpoint a particular male as being the father. Thus, when the settlement agreement between the present parties was entered in 1980, establishing paternity was a far more difficult ordeal than at present. Contested paternity actions at that time were often no more than credibility contests. See Illinois Family Study Commission, Report and Recommendations to the 76th General Assembly (1969) at 55 (finding that paternity actions at the time were often rife with coercion, corruption and perjury). Consequently, in every contested paternity action, obtaining child support depended not merely on whether the putative father was, in fact, the child\u2019s biological father, but rather on whether the mother could prove to a court of law that she was only sexually involved with one man \u2014 the putative father. Allowing parties the option of entering into private agreements in lieu of proving paternity eliminated the risk that the mother would be unable to meet her burden of proof. The procedure established by the Paternity Act provided a voluntary and additional alternative to the often uncertain paternity suit process by which a mother could obtain support for her illegitimate child.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In light of the pre-DNA proof problems associated with proving paternity, the availability of nonmodifiable child support specified by the Paternity Act promotes the principal purpose of the act, i.e., to ensure that minor children bom outside a marriage are provided with support and education. <em>Whybra, supra. </em>The statute in question takes cognizance of perhaps the central distinction between illegitimate and legitimate children \u2014 the formers\u2019 reduced lack of certainty regarding their paternity. By recognizing this reality, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>and seeking to ameliorate its consequences, the statute, as applied, is rationally related to the state\u2019s interest in ensuring that illegitimate children are provided support. For these reasons, we conclude that the disputed statute satisfies a rational-basis standard of review.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">B. HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY SATISFIED</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">In Gomez, <em>supra </em>at 538, the United States Supreme Court acknowledged that treating illegitimate children differently might be appropriate under some circumstances, due to the \u201clurking problems with respect to proof of paternity.\u201d See also <em>Clark, supra </em>at 461. The very existence of an \u201cintermediate\u201d level of review, i.e., a standard of review more respectful of legislative distinctions than with regard to the most highly suspect categories of race, nationality, and ethnicity, represents an implicit acknowledgment that there are some immutable distinctions between various classes of persons, and that it is sometimes within the Legislature\u2019s prerogative to address those distinctions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>even where the result is dissimilarity of treatment. For example, legislation addressing some aspect of pregnancy and childbirth does not violate equal protection merely because it differentiates on the basis of gender. <em>Geduldig, supra </em>at 496, n 20. Rather, such legislation would be in direct response to an immutable difference between men and women \u2014 the biological ability to bear children. See also <em>Rostker v Goldberg, </em>453 US 57; 101 S Ct 2646; 69 L Ed 2d 478 (1981) (holding that women were not similarly situated to men for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Providing financial support for children is a permissible, important, and even compelling governmental interest. A core distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children is the difficulty of determining paternity of the latter with the same level of certainty that paternity can be ascertained with respect to the former. And where paternity is uncertain \u2014 again, one of the immutable distinctions between legitimate and illegitimate children \u2014 providing an alternative means of obtaining child support to mothers who may not otherwise be able to prove paternity is substantially related to the goal of providing children with support. This is particularly true with respect to the instant case, where the parties entered into their agreement at a time in which plaintiff faced significant obstacles to overcoming defendant\u2019s claim that he was not the child\u2019s father. The lack of modem DNA testing when these parties entered their settlement underscores that the statute, as applied in this case, did not violate the constitutional guarantees of equal protection. See, e.g., <em>Lino, supra </em>at 570-571.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The possibility of nonmodifiable child support held out by MCL 722.713; MSA 25.493 provided an incentive for a putative father of an illegitimate child not to dispute paternity. This furthered the important governmental objective of ensuring financial support for children who otherwise may have gone without any form of \u201cpaternal\u201d child support.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The dissents rely on <em>Gerhardt v Estate of Moore, </em>150 Wis 2d 563; 441 NW2d 734 (1989), as support for the conclusion that the disputed statute was unconstitutional under intermediate scrutiny. <em>Post </em>at 288 (Kelly, J., dissenting); <em>post </em>at 295 (Weaver, C.J., dissenting). However, as the dissent in <em>Gerhardt </em>notes, there is an important distinction between the facts in <em>Clark, supra, </em>and the facts in <em>Gerhardt:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">Where the statute of limitations in <em>Clark, </em>according to the Supreme Court, might prevent a mother from bringing a support claim on behalf of the nonmarital child because she might not act to protect the child\u2019s interest in a timely manner, the settlement provision of the Wisconsin Statutes at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>issue in this case encourages her to do so. <em>[Id. </em>at 578 (Callow, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Likewise, MCL 722.713; MSA 25.493 did not operate to \u201cprevent a mother from bringing a support claim on behalf of [her] nonmaritai child.\u201d Rather, it operated as an <em>incentive </em>to those mothers who might have otherwise been reluctant or unable to invoke the paternity process in the face of highly uncertain prospects. Thus, the Wisconsin statute, and the statute before us, operated, not as a burden, as suggested by Justice Kelly, <em>post </em>at 287, n 5 (Kelly, J, dissenting), but as a benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Even presuming, however, that <em>Gerhardt </em>was correctly decided, that case is clearly distinguishable on its facts. First, the statute challenged in Wisconsin allowed nonmodifiable settlement agreements in <em>all </em>paternity actions, regardless of whether paternity had been admitted or ascertained by the court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Contrary to Justice Kelly\u2019s conclusion, this is a distinction with a crucial difference. See <em>post </em>at 291, n 10 (Kelly, J, dissenting). MCL 722.713; MSA 25.493, allows non-modifiable support agreements only where paternity has <em>not </em>been ascertained, a distinction illustrating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>clear relationship between the Michigan statute and paternity proof problems. Second, the defendant in <em>Gerhardt </em>acknowledged paternity. <em>Id. </em>at 566. It is true, as Justice Kelly observes, that the Wisconsin Supreme Court did not consider the defendant\u2019s admission of paternity in reaching its decision. <em>Post </em>at 291, n 10 (Kelly, J., dissenting). We point out, however, that in Michigan, once a putative father has acknowledged paternity, his child is entitled to fully modifiable support, just as any other child whose paternity has been ascertained. MCL 722.1004; MSA 25.604. It is only where paternity is uncertain that nonmodifiable child support is allowed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, if we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>were faced with the same facts as those before the Wisconsin Supreme Court, we cannot say whether we would reach a different conclusion. Clearly, under Michigan law, a defendant similarly situated to the defendant in <em>Gerhardt, </em>that is, one who has made a legal acknowledgment of paternity, would be required to provide fully modifiable child support, and the case would not be before us \u2014 a distinction with a clear difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">It is true that, in this case, MCL 722.713; MSA 25.493 was given continued application even after the advent of modem dna testing.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, at least in the context of a case in which the settlement agreement pertaining to support for an illegitimate child was entered before the advent of modem DNA testing, important governmental interests are clearly served by continuing to give force to the agreement even after the advent of such testing. The most obvious interest is allowing parties to an agreement to order their conduct in reliance upon such agreements, and maintaining the integrity of such agreements. In this and in countless similar cases, parties entered into nonmodifiable settlement agreements that were expressly approved by a circuit court judge. The putative fathers in such cases were, in effect, promised by a trial court judge that the level of child support imposed upon them would not be increased above the amount provided for in the settlement agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>To allow these understandings to be altered years later, even on the basis of technological advances, could only be expected to undermine confidence in the legitimacy and fairness of a legal system that promised these individuals one thing, but then later changed the rules of the game. Moreover, if we were to allow these promises to be avoided where technological advances could be utilized to <em>prove </em>paternity, we would also, in fairness, need to allow such promises to be avoided where technological advances could be utilized to <em>disprove </em>paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">It is critical to recognize that this is not a statute designed to impose <em>burdens </em>upon illegitimate children for the behavior of their parents, or even to discourage sexual relations outside the institution of marriage or otherwise influence societal norms. Rather, it is designed to address paternity proof problems in the support context \u2014 an important governmental interest, repeatedly sanctioned by the United States Supreme Court \u2014 in order to afford the mother of an illegitimate child the opportunity to bind the child\u2019s putative father to a support order, without a final determination of paternity, and thereby to afford enhanced opportunities for the support of illegitimate children. We do not conclude, as Justice Kelly contends, that these benefits \u201c[outweigh] the. substantial interest our state has in ensuring that our youngsters receive adequate support throughout childhood.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 291, n 10. Rather, we conclude that these benefits themselves directly address \u201cthe interest our state has in ensuring that our youngsters receive adequate support throughout childhood.\u201d They do so by providing additional opportunities to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>obtain that support to children who might otherwise be denied any support whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Nor can we altogether ignore the fact that the instant statute does not compel mothers to agree to nonmodifiable support. Rather than denying illegitimate children the right of support from their fathers, the statute provides illegitimate children, through their mothers, a voluntary and <em>additional </em>optional mechanism for obtaining support \u2014 a compromise in exchange for the significant risk that the mother would lose the case and the child would receive no support whatsoever. Nonmodifiable support agreements, along with modifiable support agreements, are <em>available, </em>not <em>required, </em>under the statute, and are only enforceable where the court has otherwise determined that the agreements provide sufficient support for the child. Again, this is not a case in which the state \u201cposit[ed] a judicially enforceable right of children to support from their natural fathers,\u201d but denied that same right to illegitimate children. <em>Mills, supra </em>at 92, citing <em>Gomez, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The dissenting opinions conclude that the statute, rather than providing an additional opportunity for illegitimate children to obtain support, actually operates to their detriment because it precludes modification of child support. However, this conclusion not only fails to take into consideration the practical problems confronting the mother of the illegitimate child in proving paternity before the advent of dna testing, but also fails to consider that modification of child support is based on more than merely the child\u2019s needs. In determining whether modification is warranted, the courts are required to take into consideration, not only the child\u2019s needs, but also the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>father\u2019s financial circumstances. Although recipients of nonmodifiable support may be precluded from obtaining an increase in support, they are also precluded from suffering a reduction in support. Even more consequentially, of course, absent the statute, the recipients of nonmodifiable support are \u201cprecluded\u201d from being denied support <em>altogether, </em>such as where the mother was unable to overcome problems in proving paternity that existed before dna testing. Moreover, putative fathers who agreed to nonmodifiable support are precluded from taking advantage of advances in technology to disprove paternity, just as the mothers are to prove paternity.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Finally, we emphasize again that nonmodifiable support agreements are only enforceable when a court has determined that they satisfactorily provide for the child. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>While the courts certainly cannot anticipate every need and every change in the child\u2019s circumstances, these agreements have presumably been analyzed in the light of their ability to adequately provide for the child <em>throughout childhood.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Because the statute is substantially and directly related to the general goal of obtaining child support for illegitimate children, and because it is substantially and directly related to the state\u2019s legitimate concern regarding proof problems in the child support context, we find that it is not an unconstitutional denial of equal protection under the law, regardless of whether the rational basis or intermediate standards of review are employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">There are alternative ways of characterizing the classifications created by the instant statutory provision. One reasonable characterization is that this statute distinguishes between children whose paternity has not been ascertained and children whose paternity has been ascertained. Alternatively, the classifications created by the challenged statute could reasonably be characterized as being based on illegitimacy because the statute <em>only </em>affects children bom out of wedlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Viewing the challenged statute as one which merely differentiates on the basis of whether paternity has been ascertained, we find that the statute is rationally related to the legitimate state interest of ensuring that minor children bom out of wedlock are provided with support and education. Moreover, viewing the challenged statute as one that distinguishes children on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>the basis of illegitimacy, we find that the statute\u2019s purpose of providing support for illegitimate children is an important, and even compelling, state interest and that the challenged statute, as applied, substantially and directly advances this important interest by providing an avenue to avoid problems associated with proving paternity, yet still provide support for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Therefore, we find that, regardless of this Court\u2019s characterization of the classifications created by the challenged statute, the statute does not violate the constitutional guarantees of equal protection of the law. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b462-5\">Taylor, Corrigan, and Young, JJ., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-8\"> The Legislature repealed the statute effective June 1, 1997, after a Court of Appeals decision finding the statute unconstitutional. <em>Dones v Thomas, </em>210 Mich App 674; 534 NW2d 221 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b433-7\"> This order was not signed by the parties, nor did their attorneys approve the order as to form or substance.

Common sense requires us to read this language to mean the \u201cputative father,\u201d as no determination of paternity has been made when a paternity complaint is initially filed. Additionally, the statute appears to use the term \u201cputative father\u201d interchangeably with \u201cfather.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\"> This presumption is rebuttable. The Paternity Act is applicable where the presumption has been successfully rebutted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b442-7\"> In <em>Feeney, supra, </em>for example, the Supreme Court faced the difficulties in the characterization of a statute when female plaintiffs challenged a law granting veterans preferences with regard to state civil service hiring decisions. 442 US 259. Because the law operated overwhelmingly to the advantage of male applicants, the plaintiffs characterized the preference as impermissibly creating a classification on the basis of gender. However, the Court ultimately chose to characterize the preference as one creating a classification on the basis of one\u2019s status as a veteran. In other words, the Court determined that, even though significantly more men than women were being granted a benefit by the preference, the law was properly characterized as one granting veterans, regardless of gender, a benefit over nonveterans. Rather than distinguishing between persons on the basis of gender, the law distinguished between job applicants on the basis of nongender considerations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b444-5\"><em> </em>A classification based on whether paternity has been determined neither implicates a fundamental right or an inherently suspect class, nor has it been recognized by this Court or the United States Supreme Court as deserving of any heightened standard of review.

Rather, we merely acknowledge that, just as it is not unreasonable to characterize a statute relating to pregnancy in more than one manner, it is not unreasonable to characterize the statute here in more than one manner. Because we find that the statute, as applied, was constitutional under <em>either </em>characterization, we need not decide which of these characterizations is more appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b446-7\"> The Paternity Act applies to children bom during wedlock who are later deemed not to be the issue of the marriage. Thus, these children would be classified also as \u201cillegitimate.\u201d MCL 722.713; MSA 25.493.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b448-6\"> Neither <em>Mills </em>nor <em>Clark </em>requires us to reach the conclusion that the statute challenged here created classifications on the basis of illegitimacy; in neither of those cases did the Court address the threshold question whether the challenged statutes actually created classifications on the basis of legitimacy. The dissent states, \u201cI conclude that the <em>[Clark] </em>Court did find that the statute created a classification on the basis of illegitimacy.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 285-286, n 4 (Kelly, J., dissenting). However, Justice Kelly reaches this conclusion, not because the Court expressly decided that the statute created classifications on the basis of illegitimacy, but rather because the Court examined the statute under intermediate scrutiny. We find the dissenter\u2019s analysis flawed. In both <em>Mills </em>and <em>Clark, </em>the Supreme Court was examining statutory periods of limitation applicable to <em>all </em>illegitimate children. Unlike the statute before us, the statutes challenged in <em>Mills </em>and <em>Clark </em>imposed a requirement on <em>all </em>illegitimate children \u2014 either ascertain paternity within the allotted time frame or be forever precluded from access to child support. So even though we conclude, for argument\u2019s sake, that the statutes in <em>Mills </em>and <em>Clark, as applied, </em>could be characterized as creating classifications either on the basis of illegitimacy or on the basis of whether paternity had been determined, there are significant differences between those cases and the instant case that could lead the same court to opposite results. Specifically, the statutes challenged in <em>Mitts </em>and <em>Clark </em>created a mandatory prerequisite to child support for <em>all </em>illegitimate children \u2014 prove paternity within the period of limitation. By contrast, the instant statute created options \u2014 prove paternity, obtain a nonmodifiable support agreement, or even obtain a modifiable support agreement. Consequently, even if we were to agree that the Supreme Court reached a decision that it did not expressly address, and even if we were to agree that such implicit decision making was binding on this Cotut, <em>Mills </em>and <em>Clark </em>do not require a conclusion that the challenged statute creates an illegitimacy-based classification; those cases are readily distinguishable from the instant case on their facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Even more importantly, the <em>Clark </em>Court was careful to point out that statutory classifications based on illegitimacy designed to punish the conduct of parents were different than statutory classifications based on illegitimacy designed to address paternity proof problems in the support context. <em>Clark, supra </em>at 461. The disputed statute here, to the extent that it treated illegitimate children differently than legitimate children, addressed the latter issue. That is, the challenged statute provided an alternative means of obtaining support for a child where paternity was uncertain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\"> Even recognizing that dna testing can conclusively establish paternity, and that the unreliability of testing is no longer the obstacle that it once was in paternity suits, this does not altogether eliminate \u201cproof\u201d problems in the context of paternity suits. Proving paternity involves not only the technical and scientific elements of establishing a genetic relationship, but also a variety of other legal and practical burdens, including the necessity of identifying and locating the putative father, the need to obtain and enforce court orders requiring paternity testing, the emotional and psychological burdens associated with trial, the inevitable uncertainties of the legal process, and, while perhaps increasingly remote, problems associated with obtaining reliable test results. Each of these steps to proving paternity can involve significant resources, in terms of time, effort, and money. Moreover, there may conceivably be circumstances in which ascertaining paternity through the legal process may not always be in the child\u2019s own best interest, even where such paternity could be proven conclusively from a scientific standpoint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\"> Justice Kelly compares the instant case to <em>Evink v Evink, </em>214 Mich App 172; 542 NW2d 328 (1995), a case in which the Court of Appeals obviated a father\u2019s attempt to avoid his child-support obligations through voluntary termination of his parental rights. However, this case illustrates precisely why it may be appropriate in some cases to treat legitimate and illegitimate children differently. A child\u2019s absolute right to receive child support from a father only has value where paternity can, in fact, be ascertained. A child does not have an absolute right to receive child support from a <em>putative </em>father. The case before us is not a case in which a known parent has been allowed to \u201cvoluntarily release parental rights in order to escape the child support obligation . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176. Rather, this is a case in which a child of <em>uncertain </em>paternity was provided with a means of obtaining child support from a person who, because of eviden-tiary limitations, might otherwise have avoided any obligation to pay child support.

Regardless of the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s dicta regarding what it would or would not find constitutional under facts not before it, the challenged statutory scheme in that case allowed an illegitimate child to file a paternity action at any time. The Illinois court relied on the express language of the state\u2019s Paternity Act to conclude that whenever paternity was ascertained, the child was entitled to the same right to modifiable child support as legitimate children. <em>Miller, supra </em>at 411, quoting Ill Rev Stat 1983, ch 40, par 1352, \u201cThe father of a child bom out of wedlock whose paternity is established in a proceeding under this Act shall be liable for its support ... to the same extent and in the same manner as the father of the child born in lawful wedlock . . . .\" Although the court expressed its opinion with respect to the constitutionality of a hypothetical statute that precluded modification, there is no indication in its opinion that it relied on anything but the plain language of the statutory scheme and legislative intent to determine that the statute allowed complete modification any time that paternity was ascertained and that a nonmodifiable settlement agreement did not bar a suit to ascertain paternity. <em>Id. </em>at 412 (\u201cTo find otherwise would be to denigrate the clearly expressed intent of the legislature as well as the public policy of the State\u201d).

At the time the instant agreement was entered into, the judicial system was less able to ascertain the truth concerning matters of paternity than it might be today. The mothers who entered into the agreements provided for by MCL 722.713; MSA 25.493 accepted nonmodifiable support to avoid the risk of receiving no child support whatsoever, in the event of their inability to convince the court that the putative father was, in fact, the biological father. Moreover, they avoided the risk of receiving a reduction in child support in the event that the child\u2019s needs and the parties\u2019 financial situation warranted such reduction, and they also avoided the risk that the putative father could, with advances in technology, eliminate child support altogether. Similarly, the putative fathers agreed to nonmodifiable support to avoid the risk of the court determining \u2014 perhaps incorrectly, and certainly not with scientific certainty \u2014 that they were the biological fathers. The goal of ascertaining the truth is not compromised when parties, recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of the proofs available in their situation, agree to make concessions so that each might avoid unnecessary risks. Here, the Legislature has allowed, and the parties have agreed, that a given child should receive child support from the putative father even without <em>judicial </em>ascertainment of the truth particularly where, as here, the judiciary lacked the means by which to ascertain this with any genuine degree of certainty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b462-6\">Kelly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aod\">(dissenting).

Intermediate or heightened scrutiny applies to claims of disparate treatment based on the legitimacy or illegitimacy of a person. <em>Mills v Habluetzel, </em>456 US 91; 102 S Ct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>1549; 71 L Ed 2d 770 (1982); <em>Pickett v Brown, </em>462 US 1; 103 S Ct 2199; 76 L Ed 2d 372 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The majority states that one could reasonably characterize \u00a7 3 as treating children differently on the basis of whether paternity has been established. <em>Ante, </em>p 266. That view focuses on the fact that illegitimate children whose paternity has been established are not affected by the statute. Then, it supports a rational basis standard of review, because a classification based on paternity invokes neither intermediate nor strict scrutiny. See <em>Plyler v Doe, </em>457 US 202, 216-217; 102 S Ct 2382; 72 L Ed 2d 786 (1982) (identifying situations in which strict scrutiny applies); <em>Mills, supra </em>(identifying situations in which intermediate scrutiny applies).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The majority\u2019s view is flawed. It is unreasonable to find that the statute did anything except distinguish the treatment of children on the basis of legitimacy. Although not all illegitimate children received disparate treatment under \u00a7 3, the dominant reality is that illegitimate children, and they alone, received disparate treatment. The majority acknowledges that \u201c[t]here is no apparent set of circumstances under which a legitimate child would be the object of an enforceable, nonmodifiable support agreement.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 266.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The United States Supreme Court has held intermediate or heightened scrutiny to apply under similar circumstances. <em>Clark v Jeter, </em>486 US 456; 108 S Ct 1910; 100 L Ed 2d 465 (1988); see also <em>Williams v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number><em>Lambert, </em>902 F Supp 460 (SD NY, 1995); <em>Gerhardt v Estate of Moore, </em>150 Wis 2d 563; 441 NW2d 734 (1989). In <em>Clark, </em>the Court considered a Pennsylvania statute that required illegitimate children to prove paternity before seeking support from their fathers. It required that a suit to establish paternity be brought within six years of the children\u2019s birth. <em>Clark, supra </em>at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In contrast, legitimate children could seek support from their parents at any time. <em>Id. </em>The statute did not affect all illegitimate children by blocking their attempts to obtain support from their fathers. It affected only those illegitimate children who had not established paternity within six years of birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Thus, as here, children could have been identified as those whose paternity had been determined and those whose paternity had not. However, the Court was not concerned about that fact, instead it applied intermediate scrutiny to a review of the statute. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">\u201cFirst, the period for obtaining support . . . must be sufficiently long in duration to present a reasonable opportunity for those with an interest in such children to assert claims on their behalf. Second, any time limitation placed on that opportunity must be <em>substantially related to the State\u2019s interest in avoiding the litigation of stale or fraudulent claims.\" [Clark, supra </em>at 462, quoting <em>Mills, supra </em>at 99-100 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The Court held that the statute was unconstitutional on the basis that it was not <em>substantially related </em>to an important state interest. <em>Id. </em>at 464.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>I reach the same conclusion as did the United States Supreme Court in <em>Clark. </em>Even though \u00a7 3 did not include every illegitimate child, intermediate scrutiny must apply where the statute affected any child\u2019s right to receive parental support on the basis of illegitimacy. Accordingly, intermediate or heightened scrutiny should be the only standard used in considering the constitutionality of \u00a7 3. Clark, <em>supra </em>at 461.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">In order to survive intermediate scrutiny, a statute that results in the treatment complained of must be \u201csubstantially related to an important governmental objective.\u201d <em>Clark, supra </em>at 461. The majority attempts to show that, even when intermediate scrutiny is applied, \u00a7 3 passes constitutional muster. <em>Ante, </em>p 281. It relates the important government objective of \u00a7 3</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">to address paternity proof problems in the support context ... in order to afford the mother of an illegitimate child the opportunity to bind the child\u2019s putative father to a support order, without a final determination of paternity, and thereby to afford enhanced opportunities for the support of illegitimate children. <em>[Ante, </em>p 278.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">I recognize the importance of the state\u2019s interest in enhancing the opportunity for illegitimate children to obtain support from their fathers. However, I disagree with the majority that \u00a7 3 is substantially related to that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">While the Supreme Court in <em>Clark </em>did not rest its decision on such grounds, it recognized that the need for child support changes over time.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">A mother might realize only belatedly \u201ca loss of income attributable to the need to care for the child,\u201d <em>Pickett, supra </em>[p 12]. Furthermore, financial difficulties are likely to increase as the child matures and incurs expenses for clothing, school, and medical care. . . . Thus it is questionable whether a State acts reasonably when it requires most paternity and support actions to be brought within six years of an illegitimate child\u2019s birth. <em>[Clark, supra </em>at 463-464.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>How much more unreasonable is it for a state to preclude any modifications to support agreements entered into shortly after a child\u2019s birth in light of those same factors?

The <em>Gerhardt </em>court, however, recognized the error in that argument.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>[I]t is an option that has in reality worked to the detriment of many nonmarital children. It is, at best, an illusory benefit amounting to no benefit at all. It is, in reality, an additional burden. Similar to the procedural bars invalidated in the <em>Clark </em>line of cases, the lump-sum settlement provision deprives certain nonmarital children the opportunity to obtain adequate support. Although <em>Clark </em>and the cases cited therein deal with statutory limitation bars to the filing of actions, the bar to seeking additional child support that results from a iump:sum agreement works in precisely the same manner. Regardless of the label attached to the statutory bar, the result is the same. The nonmarital child, unlike the marital child, is barred from seeking additional support, regardless of need. <em>That is hardly fair to the nonmarital child, much less constitutional. That is what the United States Supreme Court recognized in remanding this action, and that is what we recognize today.

It did so by foreclosing any opportunity for support orders to be modified beyond what was agreed to under conditions very likely unfavorable to both mother and child.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is unreasonable to believe that an agreement entered into at the onset of a child\u2019s life can accurately anticipate and provide for all the contingencies that child will face until reaching adulthood. Thus, I conclude that \u00a7 3 worked against and failed to be substantially related to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>state\u2019s interest in procuring adequate child support for illegitimate children.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In a somewhat analogous situation, our Court of Appeals declared that a noncustodial father could <em>not </em>avoid his obligation to support his child by voluntarily terminating his parental rights. <em>Evink v </em>Evink, 214 Mich App 172; 542 NW2d 328 (1995). It recognized that \u201c[a] child has an inherent right to parental support\u201d and \u201cparents may not bargain away a child\u2019s right to receive adequate support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175-176 (citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>To accept defendant\u2019s position would be to allow a parent to voluntarily release parental rights in order to escape the child support obligation where the child remains in the custody of the other biological parent. Such a result is not supported by statute, case law, or sound public policy. <em>[Id. </em>at 176.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">In this case, \u00a7 3 of the Paternity Act presented a father with the same opportunity, that of evading his child support obligation, as was rejected by the Court of Appeals in <em>Evink. </em>The act allowed a father to voluntarily enter into a child support agreement that the mother could not modify, even if the child\u2019s needs increased. The act allowed a father to escape his responsibility to provide for his child, and the child was deprived of that to which it was entitled.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> No similar \u201cloophole\u201d exists in the law for the benefit of fathers of legitimate children.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Accordingly, I conclude that \u00a7 3 violated the right of illegitimate children to equal protection under the law.

A New York federal district court believed that a New York appellate court would strike down a substantially similar New York statute on the basis of <em>Clark </em>or construe the statute so that it would permit an illegitimate child to seek modification of a support agreement. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 463, n 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The Illinois Supreme Court, on the basis of <em>Clark </em>and <em>Gerhardt, </em>took the second approach. In <em>Dep\u2019t of Public Aid ex rel Cox v Miller, </em>146 Ill 2d 399, 408-410; 586 NE2d 1251 (1992), that court considered \u201cwhether a settlement order and dismissal entered in a paternity action bar a subsequent action brought by or on behalf of the illegitimate minor for support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403. The court identified that previous appellate court decisions held that the Illinois Paternity Act did not \u201c \u2018permit the mother, alleged father, or a public agency which has supported the child to bring an action after a court-approved settlement has been reached.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402 (citation omitted). The court agreed with the analysis of <em>Gerhardt. </em>It held that equal protection of the law would be violated if illegitimate children were unable to seek modification of child support agreements when legitimate children had that opportunity. <em>Id. </em>at 411. To salvage the statutory scheme, the court read the act to allow illegitimate children to bring an action to modify child support agreements. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, the \u201cplain language of the statutory scheme\u201d allowed a child to bring an action at any time only to ascertain paternity. <em>Id. </em>It said nothing of a child\u2019s right to modify otherwise nonmodifiable support agreements. <em>Id:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The majority attempts to discredit my citation to <em>Cox </em>by identifying it as dicta and trying to distinguish the instant case from it.

See <em>ante, </em>p 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">In addition, the majority attempts to draw a distinction between this case and <em>Gerhardt </em>because the statute in <em>Gerhardt </em>allowed nonmodifiable child support agreements in all paternity actions. Also, in <em>Gerhardt, </em>there was an admission of paternity. <em>Id. </em>Each is a distinction without a difference. The fact that the statute in <em>Gerhardt </em>applied to all paternity actions does not diminish the fact that both it and \u00a7 3 had disparate effects on illegitimate children. There is, as the majority asserts, a clear relationship in Michigan between our statute and paternity proof problems. However, it is also true that \u00a7 3 discriminates against illegitimate children in the same manner as the statute at issue in <em>Gerhardt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Neither is it of any significance that there was an admission of paternity in <em>Gerhardt. </em>That fact was irrelevant to the court\u2019s determination that the statute was not substantially related to an important government objective. <em>Gerhardt, supra </em>at 574; see also Coa;, <em>supra </em>at 408. One would expect that, had paternity not been admitted or established in <em>Gerhardt, </em>as it has not been here, the <em>Gerhardt </em>court would have reached the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">In an effort to justify the statute, the majority reaches to find a <em>benefit </em>in the fact that \u201cputative fathers who agreed to nonmodifiable support are precluded from taking advantage of advances in technology to disprove paternity, just as the mothers are to prove paternity.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 280.1 fail to see how that is a benefit, because one of our major goals is to ascertain the truth. The state clearly does not have a substantial state interest in furthering falsehood and avoiding the truth. Although the majority names additional benefits that the statute provides, none of them outweigh the substantial interest our state has in ensuring that our youngsters receive adequate support throughout childhood.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b472-9\"> Contrary to the assertion by the majority, <em>Evink </em>illustrates precisely why we should not allow illegitimate children to be burdened by nonmodifiable child support agreements. See <em>ante, </em>p 274, n 13. The majority fails to acknowledge that a putative father may very well know that he is the father of a child. However, he may be able to profit from the difficult situation the mother faces to procure a settlement he finds favorable. The majority identifies the statute as providing an illegitimate child with an opportunity to obtain child support from someone who might not otherwise provide it. However, it also allows someone who might otherwise have been responsible for adequate child support to avoid that obligation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b472-10\"> See <em>Dones, </em>n 1 <em>supra; Crego v Coleman, </em>226 Mich App 815 (1997) <em>(Crego II); Crego v Coleman, </em>n 2 <em>supra (Crego III).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\"> <em>Cox, </em>n 8 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b473-9\"> See <em>Gerhardt, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b473-5\">Weaver, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV4\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that MCL 722.713; MSA 25.493 did not violate equal protection. I believe that the statute creates a classification based on illegitimacy and that the statute cannot withstand the heightened scrutiny applied to such a classification. Therefore, I would affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Because there are situations in which illegitimate children receive a right to modifiable support, the majority opines that this statute does not create a classification based on illegitimacy, but one based on whether \u201cpaternity ha[s] been legally determined.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 264. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Children have a right to support from their biological parents. See <em>Evink v Evink, </em>214 Mich App 172, 175-176; 542 NW2d 328 (1995). As the majority acknowledges, MCL 722.713; MSA 25.493 affects <em>only </em>the right of illegitimate children, precluding them from obtaining additional support to meet changing needs where the parties have reached a settlement agreement pursuant to the statute. By contrast, there are no circumstances under which a legitimate child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>would be foreclosed from petitioning for future modification of child support. Pursuant to MCL 552.17(1); MSA 25.97(1), children of divorced couples may petition the court to modify a support award upon demonstrating changed circumstances, and the parents cannot bargain away the right to seek modification of support. See <em>Calley v Calley, </em>197 Mich App 380, 382, n 1; 496 NW2d 305 (1992); <em>Johns v Johns, </em>178 Mich App 101, 106; 143 NW2d 446 (1989). Therefore, I would conclude that the statute classifies children on the basis of illegitimacy and not on the basis of whether paternity has been legally determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Classifications based on illegitimacy are subject to heightened scrutiny. <em>Clark v Jeter, </em>486 US 456, 461; 108 S Ct 1910; 100 L Ed 2d 465 (1988); <em>Spada v Pauley, </em>149 Mich App 196, 203; 385 NW2d 746 (1986). To withstand heightened scrutiny, the statutory classification must be substantially related to an important governmental objective. <em>Clark, supra </em>at 461. This level of scrutiny \u201cis not a toothless one.\u201d <em>Pickett v Brown, </em>462 US 1, 8; 103 S Ct 2199; 76 L Ed 2d 372 (1983), quoting <em>Mathews v Lucas, </em>427 US 495, 510; 96 S Ct 2755; 49 L Ed 2d 651 (1976). MCL 722.713; MSA 25.493 fails to satisfy this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">In upholding the statute, the majority concludes that the statute is substantially related to the \u201cpermissible, important, and even compelling governmental interest\u201d of providing financial support for children. <em>Ante </em>at 273. The majority reasons that the statute affords illegitimate children an \u201cadditional optional mechanism for obtaining support\u201d by allowing the parties to circumvent the proof problems that may arise in paternity cases. <em>Ante </em>at 279. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>I recognize that the problems in proving paternity distinguish legitimate children from illegitimate children in their claims for child support. However, this justification is neither \u201csufficiently weighty nor substantially related to the limitation\u201d to uphold MCL 722.713; MSA 25.493 under equal protection. <em>Mills v Habluetzel, </em>456 US 91, 102; 102 S Ct 1549; 71 L Ed 2d 770 (1982) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor are the state\u2019s interests in settlement and finality sufficient to justify a classification based on illegitimacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">As noted earlier, children have a right to support. <em>Evink, supra </em>at 175-176. However, rather than operate as an additional mechanism for support, the statute, in reality, imposes a burden on illegitimate children by restricting their ability to obtain adequate support. The Wisconsin Supreme Court made a similar conclusion when striking down a statutory scheme that precluded illegitimate children involved in lump-sum settlement agreements from seeking additional support, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">[I]t is an option that has in reality worked to the detriment of many nonmarital children. It is, at best, an illusory benefit amounting to no benefit at all. It is, in reality, an additional burden. <em>[Gerhardt v Estate of Moore, </em>150 Wis 2d 563, 571; 441 NW2d 734 (1989).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The possibility that children may encounter circumstances that alter their need for support does not vary between illegitimate and legitimate children. Both may encounter circumstances that give rise to a need for increased support. Yet, in the case of illegitimate children, they may be deprived of the opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>seek increased support on the basis of changed circumstances because their parents entered an agreement, pursuant to the statute, that precludes modification. Thus, the statute actually operates to their detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In my opinion, neither proof problems nor the interests of settlement and finality outweigh the irrevocable and potentially damaging effect that a nonmodifiable settlement may have on the changing financial needs of illegitimate children. Consequently, the statute is not substantially related to the supposed interest it seeks to serve \u2014 namely, providing an additional mechanism for obtaining support for illegitimate children \u2014 and it should be determined to be violative of equal protection.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-7\"> A total of five justices joined this section of Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s concurring opinion. <em>Mills, supra </em>at 102.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
