INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">In these consolidated cases, we granted leave to once again consider the scope of the so-called \u201chighway exception\u201d to governmental immunity. MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1). Specifically, we must decide the extent, if any, to which the highway exception accords protection to pedestrians injured by a condition within the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel. Further, we must decide whether the highway exception creates a duty, with regard to the state and county road commissions, to install, maintain, repair, or improve traffic control devices, including traffic signs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">In <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567; 363 NW2d 641 (1984), this Court confronted and resolved conflicting case law defining the scope of governmental immunity. The <em>Ross </em>Court explained its goals in tackling the issue, and its approach, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">In resolving the questions presented by this [governmental immunity] act, our goal has been to create a cohesive, uniform, and workable set of rules which will readily define the injured party\u2019s rights and the governmental agency\u2019s lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>bility. We recognize that our case law on these questions is confused, often irreconcilable, and of little guidance to the bench and bar. We have made great efforts to reexamine our prior collective and individual views on this subject in order to formulate an approach which is faithful to the statutory language and legislative intent. Wherever possible and necessary, we have reaffirmed our prior decisions. The consensus which our efforts produce today should not be viewed as this Court\u2019s individual or collective determinations of what would be most fair or just or the best public policy. The consensus does reflect, however, what we believe the Legislature intended the law to be in this area. <em>[Id. </em>at 596.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\"><em>Ross, </em>constituting a significant change in governmental immunity jurisprudence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> held that the immunity conferred on governmental agencies is <em>broad, </em>with <em>narrowly </em>drawn exceptions. <em>Id. </em>at 618. The failure to consistently follow <em>Ross, </em>specifically with regard to the interpretation and application of the highway exception, has precipitated an exhausting line of confusing and contradictory decisions. These decisions have created a rule of law that is virtually impenetrable, even to the most experienced judges and legal practitioners.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, these conflicting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>decisions have provided precedent that both parties in highway liability cases may cite as authority for their opposing positions. This area of the law cries out for clarification, which we attempt to provide today.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Accordingly, we return to a narrow construction of the highway exception predicated upon a close examination of the statute\u2019s plain language, rather than merely attempting to add still another layer of judicial gloss to those interpretations of the statute previously issued by this Court and the Court of Appeals. We believe that such an approach will maintain fidelity to the requirements set forth by the Legislature, while providing the lower courts with a clearer standard to follow when applying the highway exception in individual cases. However, we refuse to impose upon the people of this state our individual determinations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>proper public policy, relating to the availability of lawsuits arising from injuries on the public highways. Rather, we seek to faithfully construe and apply those stated public policy choices made by the Legislature when it drafted the statutory language of the highway exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Because prior decisions of this Court have improperly broadened the scope of the highway exception and provided a variety of contradictory and conflicting interpretations of this exception\u2019s statutory language, we believe it is impossible to avoid overruling some precedent, if we are to set forth a clear rule of law. While we emphasize that we do not lightly overrule existing precedent, we are duty-bound to overrule past decisions that depart from a narrow construction and application of the highway exception and the plain language of the statutory clause, especially when they directly disregard, and are inconsistent with, other decisions of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In <em>Nawrocki v Macomb Co Rd Comm, </em>we believe that the circuit court erred in granting summary disposition in favor of the governmental defendant. We hold that the highway exception applies when a plaintiff\u2019s injury is proximately caused by a dangerous or defective condition of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel. We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the circuit court, and remand to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In <em>Evens v Shiawassee Co Rd Comm\u2019rs, </em>we hold that the state or county road commissions\u2019 duty, under the highway exception, does not extend to the installation, maintenance, repair, or improvement of traffic control devices, including traffic signs, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>rather is limited exclusively to dangerous or defective conditions within the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel; that is, the actual roadbed, paved or unpaved, designed for vehicular travel. We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary disposition in favor of defendant road commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ay-dedup-0\">A. <em>NAWROCKI v MACOMB CO RD COMM</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">On May 28, 1993, plaintiff Rachel Nawroeki was a passenger in a truck driven by her husband. He parked the truck next to the curb on Kelly Road, in Macomb County,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Nawroeki exited from the passenger side onto the grass between the street curb and the sidewalk. She walked the length of the truck and stepped off the curb onto the paved roadway. Nawroeki allegedly stepped on cracked and broken pavement on the surface of Kelly Road and sustained serious injuries to her right ankle, necessitating several operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Nawroeki sued defendant Macomb County Road Commission,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> arguing that it negligently failed to maintain Kelly Road in reasonable repair and in a condition safe and convenient for public travel. The mcrc moved for summary disposition under MCR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>2.116(C)(7) and (8), arguing that Nawrocki\u2019s claim was barred by governmental immunity because the highway exception did not apply to pedestrians. The circuit court initially denied the motion, relying on <em>Gregg v State Hwy Dep\u2019t, </em>435 Mich 307; 458 NW2d 619 (1990), for the proposition that pedestrians traveling on the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel are covered by the highway exception. On the mcrc\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the circuit court granted summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(7), on the ground that pedestrians are covered by the highway exception only when their injuries resulted from vehicular accidents, relying on <em>Mason v Wayne Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>447 Mich 130, 135, n 4; 523 NW2d 791 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Nawrocki appealed as of right to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in reliance on its previous opinion in <em>Suttles v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>216 Mich App 166; 548 NW2d 671 (1996), a case subsequently remanded by this Court for further factual findings, <em>Suttles v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>457 Mich 635; 578 NW2d 295 (1998). We granted Nawrocki\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">B. <em>EVENS v SHIAWASSEE CO RD COMM\u2019RS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">On May 18, 1992, plaintiff Brian Evens sustained serious injuries in an automobile accident at the intersection of Newburg Road and Byron Road in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Shiawassee County.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Traffic on both northbound and southbound Byron Road was regulated by stop signs, posted on both the left and right sides of the roadway. Traffic on eastbound and westbound Newburg Road was not required to stop, but posted traffic signs warned of the approaching intersection. Both Newburg Road and Byron Road were posted with 55 mph speed limit signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Evens was driving northbound on Byron Road at the time of his accident. After stopping at the stop signs, Evens entered the intersection, where he collided with a westbound car traveling on Newburg Road, which had the right of way.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Evens sued defendant Shiawassee County Road Commissioners, arguing that they negligently failed to maintain the intersection in reasonable repair and in a condition safe and convenient for public travel. Specifically, Evens argued that the scrc owed him a duty to install additional stop signs or traffic signals at the intersection.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The scrc moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8) and (10), on two separate grounds. First, the scrc argued that county road commissions could not be held liable for a failure to install traffic signs on the theory that signs are outside the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel and are not covered by the highway exception. Second, the SCRC argued that Evens\u2019 intervening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>negligence of failing to yield to oncoming traffic was the sole proximate cause of his accident, and that the SCRC was therefore relieved of liability. The circuit court granted summary disposition to the SCRC under MCR 2.116(C)(10), holding that the SCRC could not be liable for a failure to install traffic signs, in reliance on the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Pick v Gratiot Co Rd Comm, </em>203 Mich App 138; 511 NW2d 694 (1993). The circuit court specifically rejected the scrc\u2019s intervening negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">One year after the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary disposition, this Court released its opinion in <em>Pick v Szymczak, </em>451 Mich 607; 548 NW2d 603 (1996), which held that governmental agencies had a duty to provide traffic control devices or warning signs at points of special hazard. The Court of Appeals then reversed the circuit court in part,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> relying on this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Pick, </em>and remanded the case with instructions to determine whether the intersection at issue was a point of special hazard. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of the scrc\u2019s motion on the intervening negligence issue. We granted defendant SCRC leave to appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">m. STATUTORY LANGUAGE</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Governmental immunity is the public policy, derived from the traditional doctrine of sovereign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>immunity, that limits imposition of tort liability on a governmental agency. <em>Ross, supra </em>at 621. Under the governmental tort liability act, MCL 691.1401 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.996(101) <em>et seq., </em>governmental agencies are immune from tort liability when engaged in a governmental function. Immunity from tort liability, as provided by MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107), is expressed in the broadest possible language \u2014 it extends immunity to all governmental agencies for <em>all </em>tort liability whenever they are engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function. <em>Ross, supra </em>at 618. However, there are five statutory exceptions to governmental immunity.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Legislature\u2019s refusal to abolish completely governmental immunity, evidences a clear legislative judgment that public and private tortfeasors are to be treated differently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">\u201cGovernment cannot merely be liable as private persons are for public entities are fundamentally different from private persons. Private persons do not make laws. Private persons do not issue and revoke licenses to engage in various professions and occupations. Private persons do not quarantine sick persons and do not commit mentally disturbed persons to involuntary confinement. Private persons do not prosecute and incarcerate violators of the law or administer prison systems. Only public entities are required to build and maintain thousands of miles of streets, sidewalks and highways. Unlike many private persons, a public entity cannot often reduce its risk of potential liability by refusing to engage in a particular activity, for government must continue to govern and is required to furnish services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>that cannot be adequately provided by any other agency. Moreover, in our system of government, decision-making has been allocated among three branches of government\u2014 legislative, executive and judicial \u2014 and in many cases decisions made by the legislative and executive branches should not be subject to review in tort suits for damages, for this would take the ultimate decision-making authority away from those who are responsible politically for making the decisions.\u201d <em>[Ross, supra </em>at 618-619.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Because immunity necessarily implies that a \u201cwrong\u201d has occurred, we are cognizant that some tort claims, against a governmental agency, will inevitably go unremedied. Although governmental agencies may be under many duties, with regard to services they provide to the public, only those enumerated within the statutorily created exceptions are legally compensa-ble if breached. MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107); <em>Ross, supra </em>at 618-619.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">These consolidated cases involve the highway exception, MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1), which provided:<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">Each governmental agency having jurisdiction over any highway shall maintain the highway in reasonable repair so that it is reasonably safe and convenient for public travel. Any person sustaining bodily injury or damage to his or her property by reason of failure of any governmental agency to keep any highway under its jurisdiction in reasonable repair, and in condition reasonably safe and fit for travel, may recover the damages suffered by him or her from the governmental agency. The liability, procedure and remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>as to county roads under the jurisdiction of a county road commission shall be as provided in section 21 of chapter IV of Act No. 283 of the Public Acts of 1909, as amended, being section 224.21 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. The duty of the state and the county road commissions to repair and maintain highways, and the liability therefor, shall extend only to the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel and shall not include sidewalks, crosswalks, or any other installation outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">There is one basic principle that must guide our decision today: the immunity conferred upon governmental agencies is <em>broad, </em>and the statutory exceptions thereto are to be <em>narrowly </em>construed. <em>Robinson v Detroit, </em>462 Mich 439, 455; 613 NW2d 307 (2000); <em>Suttles, </em>457 Mich 641; <em>Horace v City of Pontiac, </em>456 Mich 744, 749; 575 NW2d 762 (1998); <em>Wade v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>439 Mich 158, 166; 483 NW2d 26 (1992); <em>Reardon v Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>430 Mich 398, 411; 424 NW2d 248 (1988); <em>Ross, supra </em>at 618.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The highway exception waives the absolute immunity of governmental units with regard to defective highways under their jurisdiction. However, when the Legislature codified governmental immunity in 1964, it specifically reduced the purview of the highway exception in MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102) from the broad approach previously taken. <em>Suttles, </em>457 Mich 644. Because subsection 2(1) is a narrowly drawn exception to a broad grant of immunity, there must be strict compliance with the conditions and restric<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>tions of the statute. <em>Scheurman v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>434 Mich 619, 629-630; 456 NW2d 66 (1990). Thus, we axe compelled to strictly abide by these statutory conditions and restrictions in deciding the instant cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Moreover, when reviewing questions of statutory construction, our purpose is to discern and give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Murphy v Michigan Bell Telephone Co, </em>447 Mich 93, 98; 523 NW2d 310 (1994). We begin by examining the plain language of the statute. It is a fundamental principle of statutory construction that the words used by the Legislature shall be given their common and ordinary meaning, and only where the statutory language is ambiguous may we look outside the statute to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Turner v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>448 Mich 22, 27; 528 NW2d 681 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The structure of MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1) is critical to its meaning. Thus, we begin by observing that the first and second sentences of the highway exception clause apply to all governmental agencies having jurisdiction over any highway. In contrast, the third and fourth sentences address more specifically the duty and resulting liability of the state and county road commissions. Therefore, while we are constrained to construe the highway exception as a whole,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> it is necessary to parse each sentence of the statutory clause to ascertain the scope of the exception, as determined by the stated policy considerations of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The first sentence of the statutory clause, crucial in determining the scope of the highway exception, describes the basic duty imposed on all governmental agencies, including the state, having jurisdiction over any highway: \u201c[to] maintain the highway in reasonable repair so that it is reasonably safe and convenient for public travel.\u201d This sentence establishes the duty to keep the highway in reasonable repair. The phrase \u201cso that it is reasonably safe and convenient for public travel\u201d refers to the duty to maintain and repair. The plain language of this phrase thus states the desired outcome of reasonably repairing and maintaining the highway; it does not establish a second duty to keep the highway \u201creasonably safe.\u201d Pick, <em>supra </em>at 635-636 (Riley, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The second sentence describes those persons who may generally recover damages when injured by a breach of the duty created by the <em>first </em>sentence: \u201c[a]ny person sustaining bodily injury or damage to his or her property by reason of failure of any governmental agency to keep any highway under its jurisdiction in reasonable repair, and in condition reasonably safe and fit for travel . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>The third sentence of the statutory clause specifically addresses the duty and resulting liability of county road commissions, as opposed to the state and other governmental agencies with highway jurisdiction. This sentence provides that the \u201cliability, procedure and remedy as to county roads under the jurisdiction of a county road commission\u201d is provided by MCL 224.21; MSA 9.121. At the time in question, MCL 224.21; MSA 9.121 provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\">It is hereby made the duty of the counties to keep in reasonable repair, so that they shall be reasonably safe and convenient for <em>public travel, </em>all county roads, bridges and culverts that are within their jurisdiction and under their care and control and which are open to <em>public travel. </em>[Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The fourth sentence of the statutory clause, specifically applicable to the state and county road commissions, proceeds to narrowly limit the general duty to repair and maintain, created by the <em>first </em>sentence, \u201conly to the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d Further, this sentence expressly provides that the limited duty does <em>not </em>extend to \u201csidewalks, crosswalks, or any other installation outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d We believe the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>language of this sentence definitively limits the state and county road commissions\u2019 duty with respect to the <em>location </em>of the alleged dangerous or defective condition; if the condition is not located in the actual roadbed designed for vehicular travel, the narrowly drawn highway exception is inapplicable and liability does not attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">A. PEDESTRIANS</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The facts of <em>Nawrocki v Macomb Co Rd Comm </em>require us to apply these principles to determine whether the statutory language of the highway exception imposes a duty on the state and county road commissions to protect pedestrians from dangerous or defective conditions in the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel, even when injury does not arise as a result of a vehicular accident. We conclude that it does.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The MCRC argues that, as a general rule, pedestrians are excluded from the protection of the highway exception. It contends that, even if pedestrians are not excluded as a general rule, they may benefit from the highway exception only when the improved portion of the highway is not reasonably safe for <em>vehicular </em>travel, as opposed to pedestrian travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">We believe, however, that pedestrians may recover damages from the state or county road commission for personal injuries and property damage, the same as all other persons, when such injury or damage is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>proximately caused by a failure of the state or county road commission to carry out its duty to repair and maintain the narrowly defined location prescribed by the fourth sentence of the statutory clause: the \u201cimproved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">There are four recent opinions of this Court that discuss whether, or to what extent, the highway exception extends to pedestrians: <em>Roy v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>428 Mich 330; 408 NW2d 783 (1987), <em>Gregg, Mason, </em>and <em>Sutiles, supra. </em>This Court\u2019s decisions in these cases have interpreted the statutory language in conflicting and confusing ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">First, <em>Roy </em>involved a plaintiff riding a bicycle on a bicycle path parallel to, but separate from, the roadway actually used by vehicular traffic. The plaintiff suffered injuries when his bicycle struck a bump on the asphalt path. This Court concluded that the plaintiff was not protected by the highway exception because the bicycle path at issue was an \u201cinstallation.\u201d The <em>Roy </em>Court concluded, on the basis of its review of the statutory language, that the Legislature chose not to impose a duty of maintenance or repair on governmental agencies on behalf of pedestrians or bicyclists traveling <em>outside </em>the improved portion of the highway. This legislative intent was demonstrated by the exclusionary language contained in the fourth sentence of the statute, which indicates that pedestrians traveling in such locations are adequately protected by their separation from vehicular traffic. <em>Id. </em>at 336. With regard to pedestrians traveling on the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel, this Court explained that the location of the alleged defect was the critical factor in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>whether the highway exception applied to a particular plaintiffs case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">Indeed, the statute does not offer general protection to pedestrians or motorists <em>without regard to location. . . . </em>The criterion used by the Legislature was not based on the class of travelers, but the road on which they travel. <em>[Id. </em>at 341 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The next case in which this Court discussed the application of the highway exception to pedestrians, Gregg, involved a plaintiff riding a bicycle on a bicycle path immediately adjacent to the paved roadway, who suffered injuries when his bicycle struck a pothole.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The <em>Gregg </em>Court again focused on whether the bicycle path at issue was an \u201cinstallation,\u201d but determined that it was not, because it was located on \u201cthe inner portion of the shoulder closest to the roadway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310. The defendant in <em>Gregg </em>argued that nonmotorists, as a class, are not protected by the highway exception. This Court rejected that argument in reliance on the \u201c[a]ny person\u201d language of the statute\u2019s second sentence, concluding that the plaintiff fell within the general class of travelers protected by the highway exception. <em>Id. </em>at 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The third case, <em>Mason, </em>involved a child struck by a car while crossing the street at the crosswalk. Once again focusing on the \u201cinstallation\u201d exclusion, this Court held that the statute excluded \u201cspecific installations whose only rational purposes narrowly service the unique needs of pedestrians,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 136, and indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>cated a legislative \u201cconclusion that pedestrians and users of these installations have been sufficiently protected by the separation of them from motorists, without any need to impose a duty of maintenance and repair enforced by liability for resultant injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\">The explicit removal of exclusively pedestrian installations from the highway exception, coupled with the express language of the provision itself, permits but one conclusion: Pedestrians who trek upon Michigan highways must and do venture beyond the protective mandates of MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1). . . . Pedestrians are situated differently than vehicular traffic, which may approach obstacles in the highway too quickly to avoid them, or may avoid obstacles only by jeopardizing traffic in the adjoining lanes. <em>[Id. </em>at 137-138.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The fourth case, <em>Suttles, </em>involved a pedestrian who, like Nawrocki, sustained injuries when stepping out of a parked car.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This Court did not decide whether the plaintiff was entitled to the protections of the highway exception, but remanded for a factual determination of the exact location where she fell. 457 Mich 651-652. However, the <em>Suttles </em>Court stated that \u201c[a] review of MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1) and previous decisions of this Court\u201d necessitated a conclusion that pedestrians may come within the highway exception. 457 Mich 645.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>These cases exemplify the confusing and inconsistent nature of the case law discussing the highway exception, which we acknowledged at the outset of this opinion. The case law fails to consistently adhere to the basic principle found in <em>Ross </em>or to a single interpretation of the statutory language, thereby also necessarily failing to establish a clear rule of law describing what protections, if any, the highway exception accords to pedestrians. While <em>Mason </em>did not expressly overrule Gregg, it can fairly be read as an implicit rejection of <em>Gregg\u2019s </em>holding that pedestrians, as a subset of the class of \u201c[a]ny person sustaining bodily injury or damage to his or her property,\u201d are <em>always </em>protected by the highway exception. In contrast, <em>Mason </em>can fairly be read for the proposition that pedestrians are <em>never </em>protected by the highway exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">As a consequence, parties like Nawrocki will typically cite <em>Roy </em>or <em>Gregg </em>for the proposition that pedestrians may recover under the highway exception because the state or county road commissions\u2019 duty is determined not by the identity of the injured person, but by the area on which the person traveled. Simultaneously, defendants like the MCRC will cite <em>Mason </em>for the proposition that pedestrians are simply not protected by the highway exception. These conflicting decisions must be resolved, in a manner that faithfully interprets and applies the statutory language drafted by the Legislature and adheres to the narrow construction of the highway exception as required by <em>Ross.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Unquestionably, it is the language used by the Legislature in drafting this statutory clause that has created much of the continuing confusion regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>whether pedestrians injured on public highways may avail themselves of the protection afforded by the highway exception. For example, the judiciary has struggled with the language contained in the fourth sentence of MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1), regarding \u201csidewalks, crosswalks, or any other installation outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ao-dedup-0\">While any number of interpretations of the highway exception might be \u2014 and have been \u2014 argued,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>mately it is this Court\u2019s obligation to set forth what we believe to be the most plausible construction of the statutory language in controversy, and, at the same time, construe the highway exception in accordance with the interpretative principles of <em>Ross.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Thus, we agree with <em>Roy </em>that the <em>location </em>of an alleged dangerous or defective condition, as narrowly defined in the fourth sentence of the statutory clause, is the critical factor in determining whether a plaintiff is successful in pleading in avoidance of governmental immunity under the highway exception. Moreover, given the Legislature\u2019s use of language in the statutory clause, we believe <em>Gregg </em>properly relied on the \u201c[a]ny person\u201d language of the statute\u2019s second sentence to hold that pedestrians are protected by the highway exception, and that the words \u201cdesigned for vehicular travel\u201d serve to define and describe the \u201cimproved portion of the highway\u201d; in other words, the <em>location </em>where the state and county road commissions\u2019 duty arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">However, we are convinced that <em>Mason </em>erred in rejecting any reliance on the \u201c[a]ny person\u201d language, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>and in determining that the words \u201cdesigned for vehicular travel\u201d \u201cpermit[] but one conclusion: Pedestrians who trek upon Michigan highways must and do venture beyond the protective mandates of MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1).\u201d <em>Mason, supra </em>at 137.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In our view, this conclusion ignores the implication of the first and third sentences of the statutory clause, both of which impose a duty upon the state and county road commissions to repair and maintain highways so that they are \u201creasonably safe and convenient for <em>public </em>travel,\u201d and results in a much too narrow construction of the statutory clause, thereby completely removing pedestrians from the protection afforded by the highway exception. Moreover, we are convinced that <em>Mason </em>further complicated matters by stating that a pedestrian <em>may </em>recover under the highway exception, but only for injuries that result from a vehicular accident. <em>Id. </em>at 135, n 4. This proposition, set forth as dicta in <em>Mason, </em>is inconsistent with the statutory language of the highway exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">While it is true that the second sentence of MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1) generally allows \u201cany person\u201d to recover damages from a governmental agency with highway jurisdiction, the fourth sentence of the statutory clause specifically limits the state and county road commissions\u2019 duty, and resultant liability for breach of this duty, \u201conly to the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d The plain language of this sentence, though limiting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>duty and resultant liability, does not expressly exclude any particular <em>class </em>of injured traveler from recovering damages under the highway exception. Thus, we believe that pedestrians who sue the state or a county road commission are not automatically and entirely excluded, as a class, from the protections of the statutory clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The general description of the state\u2019s duty, with regard to the highway exception, is established by the first sentence of the statutory clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">Each governmental agency having jurisdiction over any highway shall maintain the highway in reasonable repair so that it is reasonably safe and convenient for <em>public </em>travel. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The general description of a county road commission\u2019s duty, with regard to the highway exception, is referenced in the third sentence of the statutory clause, as set forth in MCL 224.21; MSA 9.121:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">It is hereby made the duty of the counties to keep in reasonable repair, so that they shall be reasonably safe and convenient for <em>public </em>travel, all county roads, bridges and culverts that are within their jurisdiction and under their care and control and which are open to <em>public </em>travel. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Thus, a county road commission\u2019s duty is coextensive with that owed by other governmental agencies, including the state, under the first two sentences of the highway exception clause. However, it is the fourth sentence of the highway exception that expressly limits the duty of the state and county road commissions, the breach of which permits avoidance of governmental immunity,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>only to the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel and shall not include sidewalks, crosswalks, or any other installation outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel. [MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Constrained to apply the statutory language as best as possible as written, we are persuaded that the exclusionary language of the fourth sentence of the statutory clause narrows the duty of both the state and county road commissions with regard to the <em>location </em>of the dangerous or defective condition, not to the <em>type </em>of travel <em>or </em>traveler. The phrase \u201cdesigned for vehicular travel\u201d modifies the prior phrase \u201cimproved portion of the highway\u201d and thus defines the location to which the duty of the state and county road commissions extends. Thus, if the condition proximately causing injury or property damage is located in the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel, not otherwise expressly excluded, the state or county road commissions\u2019 statutory duty under the highway exception is implicated and a plaintiff is capable of pleading in avoidance of governmental immunity.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Moreover, because the state and county road commissions must \u201crepair and maintain\u201d their respective highways and roads so that they are \u201creasonably safe and convenient for public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>travel,\u201d and because we believe \u201cpublic travel\u201d encompasses <em>both </em>vehicular and pedestrian travel, the plain language of the highway exception cannot be construed to afford protection only when a dangerous or defective condition \u201cof the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel\u201d affects <em>vehicular </em>travel.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Applying these principles to Nawrocki, we conclude that the circuit court erred in granting summary disposition to the mcrc. By alleging that she was injured by a dangerous or defective condition of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel, and not a sidewalk, crosswalk, or \u201cany other installation outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel,\u201d Nawrocki pleaded in avoidance of governmental immunity. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">B.

MCL 691.1402; MSA 3.996(102).\u201d <em>Pick, supra </em>at 619. In <em>Pick, </em>the plaintiff was injured in a collision at an intersection of two roads under the jurisdiction of the Gratiot County Road Commission. At issue on appeal was whether the highway exception created a duty within county road commissions to install signs and other traffic control devices at \u201cknown points of hazard\u201d associated with the improved portion of the highway and whether visual obstructions located on private property adjacent to the highway imposed liability on a county road commission. In <em>Pick, </em>the Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary disposition to the defendant and, quoting <em>Scheurman, supra, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-4\">\u201cWhat is not so clear is whether the improved portion of the highway includes improvements that serve as integral parts of the highway, such as signs and shoulders. [Citations omitted.] If there is an \u2018integral parts of the highway\u2019 exception under the broad concept of \u2018traffic sign maintenance\u2019 that includes erecting signs or warning devices at points of hazard, it appears to conflict with the very narrow definition of duty that excluded street lighting in <em>Scheur-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>man. </em>Because we can find no way to distinguish between street lighting and traffic signs, and because both have their physical structure outside the traveled or paved portion of the roadbed, we must conclude that the defendant is not subject to liability for the alleged lack of adequate traffic signs at the intersection of Roosevelt and Crapo Roads.\u201d <em>[Pick, supra </em>at 613-614.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-5\"><em>Pick </em>determined that the ruling of the circuit court, and the Court of Appeals affirmance of that ruling, were \u201cerroneous as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615. The majority believed that <em>Scheurman </em>\u201c[did] not establish authoritative precedent for any such \u2018very narrow definition of duty\u2019 and that, in any event, the statutory language of the highway exception, read in its entirety, does not support such a narrow definition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Amicus curiae Michigan Department of Transportation urges this Court to overrule <em>Pick </em>and hold that the statute imposes no duty on the state and county road commissions to install traffic signs, on the theory that signs are outside the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel, which connotes merely the physical surface of the road. In light of the broad reading of the highway exception by this Court in <em>Pick, </em>and the plain language used by the Legislature in setting forth this exception, we feel compelled to accept the amicus\u2019 invitation and overrule <em>Pick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">We believe that a broad, rather than a narrow, reading of the highway exception is required in order to conclude that it is applicable to anything but the highway itself. See <em>Horace, supra. </em>In <em>Pick, </em>this Court stated that \u201ca bright-line rule . . . that limits governmental responsibility for public roadways to factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>that are physically part of the roadbed itself\u201d would require \u201can improperly stringent reading of the highway exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621. This statement evidences a departure from the interpretative principle of <em>Ross. </em>In ostensibly stating a more \u201cworkable principle\u201d for applying the highway exception, <em>Pick </em>resulted in a complete abrogation of this Court\u2019s duty to <em>narrowly </em>construe exceptions to the <em>broad </em>grant of immunity. Because <em>Pick </em>entails such a broad reading of the highway exception, and thus disregards the basic principle of <em>Ross, </em>we believe that it must be overruled if we are to have any hope of restoring a stable rule of law in this difficult area of the law. <em>Robinson, supra </em>at 455; <em>Horace, supra </em>at 750, n 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Further, although <em>Pick </em>determined that the \u201cstatutory language of the highway exception itself, read in its proper context, is fully adequate for resolution of the precise legal question before us in this case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 620, we are convinced that its holding <em>cannot </em>be supported by the plain language of the statutory clause. In attempting to place its interpretation of the statute in the \u201cproper context,\u201d <em>Pick </em>failed to simply apply the plain language of the highway exception and, instead, relied on judicially invented phrases nowhere found in the statutory clause, thus thrusting upon the state and county road commissions a duty not contemplated by the Legislature.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>Pick </em>unaccept<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>ably departed from the plain language of the statute, thus allowing a plaintiff to avoid governmental immunity for conditions arising at \u201cpoint[s] of hazard,\u201d affecting travel on the surface of the improved portion of the highway, regardless of whether those conditions originated on the surface of the roadbed or not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">Such an expansive interpretation of [the highway exception] goes far beyond that which section 2 provides. The statute provides that [the waiver of immunity under the highway exception] \u201cshall extend only to the improved portion of the highway [designed for vehicular travel],\u201d it does not contemplate \u201cconditions, the source of which do not originate on the surface of the roadbed . . . .\u201d <em>[Scheurman, supra </em>at 631, n 22.][<footnotemark>31</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">While we agree with <em>Pick </em>that the first sentence of the statutory clause establishes a general duty to repair and maintain highways so that they are reasonably safe and convenient for public travel, this duty, with regard to the state and county road commissions, is significantly limited, extending <em>\u201conly </em>to the improved portion of the highway <em>designed for vehicular travel\u201d </em>MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1) (emphasis added). Nowhere in this language, or anywhere else in the statutory clause, do phrases such as \u201cknown points of hazard,\u201d \u201cpoints of special danger,\u201d \u201cintegral parts of the highway,\u201d or \u201ctraffic sign maintenance\u201d appear.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We are not persuaded that the high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>way exception contemplates \u201cconditions\u201d arising from \u201cpoint[s] of hazard,\u201d \u201careas of special danger,\u201d or \u201cintegral parts of the highway,\u201d outside the actual roadbed, paved or unpaved, designed for vehicular travel. None of these phrases or concepts appears anywhere within the provisions of the highway exception. To continue to rely upon these phrases in determining the scope of the highway exception is contrary to the language selected by the Legislature in creating this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Unless we construe the highway exception narrowly, as mandated by <em>Ross, </em>and in accordance with the language of the statutory clause, every accident and every injury, occurring on an otherwise unexceptional highway, containing no dangerous or defective conditions in the actual roadbed itself, will become the potential basis for a lawsuit against the state or county road commissions. This is an extraordinary proposition not contemplated, in our judgment, by the Legislature\u2019s narrowly drawn highway exception.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>For example, under Pick, a plaintiff may sue the state or a county road commission, and plausibly argue that</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u2014 there should have been yield signs along a highway instead of no signs;</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u2014 there should have been stop signs along a highway instead of yield signs;</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u2014 there should have been a flashing yellow/red traffic light along a highway instead of stop signs;</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u2014 there should have been a fully functional red/yellow/green traffic signal along a highway instead of a flashing yellow/red light;</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">\u2014 there should have been an overpass above a highway, thus eliminating the need for traffic signals altogether;</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">\u2014 there should have been a 25 MPH sign, instead of a 30 MPH sign, nearing an approach to an intersection; or</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">\u2014 there should have been a left turn lane where none existed.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>There is potentially no end to the creative and innovative theories that can be raised in support of the proposition that a highway accident, occurring upon even the most unremarkable thoroughfare, was, in fact, the result of inadequate or imperfect signage. Courts possess no greater insight than the state or county road commissions into matters involving traffic control devices, such as traffic signs. Maintenance of an appropriate deference for, and application of, the public policy choices made by the Legislature, as reflected in the plain language of the statutory highway exception, ensures that determinations regarding how to best allocate limited public highway funds are left to the proper authorities.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Because we are persuaded that the state and county road commissions\u2019 duty, imposed by the high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>way exception clause, is only to repair and maintain \u201cthe improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel,\u201d MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1), we hold that the actual language of this statutory clause sets forth an exception that encompasses only the \u201ctraveled portion, paved or unpaved, of the roadbed actually designed for public vehicular travel.\u201d <em>Scheurman, supra </em>at 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We are thus compelled to overrule <em>Pick </em>because it fails to narrowly construe the highway exception and contradicts the language of the statute, imposing upon state and county road commissions a duty under the highway exception to install, maintain, repair, or improve traffic control devices, including traffic signs. Yet, we wish to make clear that we do not lightly overrule existing precedent. In <em>People v </em>Graves, 458 Mich 476, 480-481; 581 NW2d 229 (1998), this Court recently discussed the proper circumstances under which it would overrule prior case law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">It is true of course that we do not lightly overrule a case. This Court has stated on many occasions that \u201c[u]nder the doctrine of stare decisis, principles of law deliberately examined and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction should not be lightly departed.\u201d Further, . . . \u201c[bjefore this court overrules a decision deliberately made, it should be convinced not merely that the case was wrongly decided, but also that less injury will result from overruling than from following it.\u201d When it becomes apparent that the reasoning of an opinion is erroneous, and that less mischief will result from overruling the case rather than following it, it becomes the duty of the court to correct it. Although we respect the principle of stare decisis, we also recognize the common wisdom that the rule of stare decisis is not an inexorable command. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>As we recently explained in <em>Robinson, supra, </em>a judicial tribunal is most strongly justified in its reversal of precedent when adherence to such precedent would perpetuate a plainly incorrect interpretation of the language of a constitutional provision or statute. <em>Id. </em>at 463-468.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\">We are confident that our holding today is also reinforced by the fact that the duty implicating the installation, maintenance, repair, or improvement of traffic signs is expressly created under statutes separate from the highway exception. For example, MCL 257.609(a); MSA 9.2309(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\">The state highway commission <em>shall place or require to be placed and maintain or require to be maintained </em>such traffic-control devices, conforming to said manual and specifications, upon all state highways <em>as it shall deem necessary </em>to indicate and to carry out the provisions of this chapter or to regulate, warn or guide traffic.

All such traffic control devices hereafter erected shall conform to the state manual and specifications.

Therefore, allowing <em>Pick </em>to stand, in our judgment, would perpetuate the lack of a principled and consistent application of the law and would permit the continuation of a heightened potential for arbitrary, inconsistent, and highly confused decision making in personal injury or property damage cases involving the state or county road commissions. Such results would be contrary to the statute, undermine other important case law, and impose far more injury upon the judicial process than any effect associated with our decision to apply the policy decisions of the Legislature instead of the policy decisions of this Court in <em>Pick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The state and county road commissions\u2019 duty, under the highway exception, is only implicated upon their failure to repair or maintain the actual physical structure of the roadbed surface, paved or unpaved, designed for vehicular travel, which in turn proximately causes injury or damage. <em>Scheurman, supra </em>at 631. A plaintiff making a claim of inadequate signage, like a plaintiff making a claim of inadequate street lighting or vegetation obstruction, fails to plead in avoidance of governmental immunity because signs are not within the paved or unpaved portion of the roadbed designed for vehicular travel. Traffic device claims, such as inadequacy of traffic signs, simply do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>not involve a dangerous or defective condition in the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Evens argues that the scrc failed to install additional traffic signs or signals that might conceivably have made the intersection safer.

CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">With regard to the state and county road commissions, we hold that a pedestrian is entitled to the protections of the highway exception, the same as all other persons, when injuries are proximately caused by the defendant\u2019s failure to repair and maintain the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel so that it is reasonably safe and convenient for public travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Additionally, we hold that the state or county road commissions have no duty, under the highway exception, to install, maintain, repair, or improve traffic control devices, including traffic signs.

First, its structure implies that installations 1, 2, and 3 are exclusions from the highway exception. Yet, it is difficult to fathom how \u201csidewalks,\u201d unlike \u201ccrosswalks,\u201d could be construed as part of the \u201cimproved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel,\u201d even absent their explicit exclusion from the highway exception. Second, the \u201cany <em>other </em>installation\u201d language of the third exclusion to the highway exception follows a specific enmneration of terms that by implication also describe installations \u201coutside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel\u201d; \u201ccrosswalks,\u201d however, clearly do not fit this description, hr other words, it is unclear why \u201csidewalks\u201d are expressly excluded from the highway exception and it is equally unclear why \u201ccrosswalks\u201d are implicitly described as installations \u201coutside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d [457 Mich 643, n 5.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\"> For example, in attempting to interpret the statutory clause, one might conclude that the fourth sentence of the statutory clause, specifically the phrase \u201cdesigned for vehicular travel,\u201d expressly limits the references to \u201cpublic travel\u201d in the first and third sentences, and thereby establishes a duty within the state and county road commissions to repair and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>maintain highways so that they are reasonably safe for <em>vehicular </em>travel only. One might also be convinced that the fourth sentence of the statutory clause limits the state and county road commissions\u2019 duty by defining the location within which this duty arises, not with regard to the <em>class </em>of traveler, but with regard to the <em>type of risk </em>the highway exception seeks to avoid, i.e., dangers to vehicular travel, not pedestrian travel. See e.g., <em>Mason, supra. </em>The statutory language might also lead one to the conclusion that, although pedestrians, as a class, may be protected by the statute \u2014 specifically under the second sentence\u2019s \u201cany person\u201d phrase \u2014 the fourth sentence only allows a pedestrian protection if an injury or damage was the result of a vehicular accident. See <em>Mason, supra </em>at 135, n 4. However, in our judgment, none of these interpretations reflects the construction of the highway exception that is most compatible with its language; we merely acknowledge that the exception is susceptible to misreading, a misreading that we believe has been reflected in past judicial decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b349-5\"> We note that in <em>Mason </em>the claimed defect was in a crosswalk; the express exclusion of crosswalks from the highway <em>exception </em>was disposi-tive.

See <em>Mason, supra </em>at 139 (Cavanagh, C.J., dissenting in part).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b351-5\"> We are not unaware of the potential for today\u2019s holding to result in outcomes that appear illogical or incongruous. For example, a pedestrian injured by a dangerous or defective condition located within a crosswalk, which is arguably integrated into a roadbed, may not be able to plead in avoidance of governmental immunity, while a pedestrian who steps out of a vehicle, onto the paved or unpaved portion of the roadbed used by vehicular traffic, and is injured by a dangerous or defective condition within the roadbed itself, may proceed under the highway exception. However, such an anomalous result appears compelled by the language of the highway exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b352-8\"> We acknowledge that repairing and maintaining the improved portion of the highway in a condition reasonably safe and convenient for <em>public </em>travel represents a higher duty of care on the part of the government than repairing and maintaining it for <em>vehicular </em>travel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b352-9\"> As noted by this Court in <em>Suttles, </em>457 Mich 651, n 10, simply falling within the highway exception is not the end of the analysis. After successfully pleading in avoidance of governmental immunity, a plaintiff still must prove a cause of action under traditional negligence principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">Concepts such as the \u201cintended and permitted user\u201d language derived from <em>Gregg </em>apply to the negligence analysis and bear on whether a defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff or whether the plaintiff was comparatively negligent.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b355-5\"> The dissent contends that \u201c[t]he plain meaning of the words \u2018improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel\u2019 connotes a broader concept than just the surface of the road, itself.\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 188. We are convinced, however, that quite the opposite is true; while the term \u201chighway\u201d may be broad and potentially ambiguous, the phrase \u201cimproved portion\u201d clearly narrows the term \u201chighway\u201d to its physical structure, and the phrase \u201cdesigned for vehicular travel\u201d further narrows \u201chighway\u201d to the physical roadbed itself. Thus, the dissent is simply wrong, in our judgment, when it states that the language of the highway exception \u201cleaves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>uncertain whether the space above the highway containing traffic lights is included.\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 189.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\"> The limited scope of the term \u201chighway\u201d in \u00a7 2 \u201cparallels the common understanding of the word.\u201d <em>Scheurman v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>434 Mich 630; <em>Roy v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>428 Mich 339.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b356-9\"> <em>Pick\u2019s </em>effort to define a \u201cpoint of hazard\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>provide[s] insight to the Legislature\u2019s desire to limit the duty of the state and county only to the obligation to \u201crepair and maintain\u201d the improved portion of the highway [designed for vehicular travel]. The duty to repair would generally limit the government\u2019s liability to cases in which there are defects in the roadbed\u2019s surface. In contrast, the Legislature may have feared that it could not anticipate the circumstances in which the state or county would be exposed to liability if the Legislature imposed on [them] the duty to ensure that travel is reasonably safe on governmental highways. <em>[Id. </em>at 641 (Riley, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\"> The dissent relies upon the doctrine of legislative acquiescence in stating that \u201cthe Legislature [in making revisions to the governmental immunity act in 1999] did not revise the highway exception to exclude traffic control devices, despite <em>Pick\u2019s </em>1996 holding that traffic control devices are included within the exception.\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 197, n 8. However, this Court has made it clear that the doctrine of legislative acquiescence \u201cis a highly disfavored doctrine of statutory construction; sound principles of statutory construction require that Michigan courts determine the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>ture\u2019s intent from its <em>words, </em>not from its silence.\u201d <em>Donajkowski v Alpena Power Co, </em>460 Mich 243, 261; 596 NW2d 574 (1999) (emphasis in the original).

While it is arguable that \u201chighway,\u201d within the language of the Motor Vehicle Code, may include traffic control devices, the Legislature clearly intended to limit the <em>highway exception </em>to the <em>roadbed itself </em>when it drafted the fourth sentence of subsection 2(1).

However, because traffic control devices are clearly not implicated in the broad definition of \u201chighway,\u201d there can be no \u201cshifting\u201d of liability from the state and county road commissions to local municipalities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Kelly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW_\"><em>{concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>I concur with the majority\u2019s disposition of <em>Nawrocki v Macomb Co Rd Comm. </em>But I cannot join its decision in <em>Evens v Shiawassee Co Rd Comm\u2019rs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In the <em>Evens </em>case, the majority again decides that a well-reasoned precedent of this Court must give way to its own interpretation of a Michigan statute. MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1). I find the majority\u2019s analysis badly flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">I. <em>NAWROCKI v MACOMB COUNTY ROAD COMMISSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">In <em>Nawrocki v Macomb Co Rd Comm, </em>the trial court relied on obiter dictum from <em>Mason v Wayne Co Bd of </em>Comm\u2019rs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to conclude that the highway exception to governmental immunity does not protect pedestrians, unless their injuries result from vehicular accidents. In so holding, the trial court ignored this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Gregg v State Hwy Dep\u2019t, </em>435 Mich 307; 458 NW2d 619 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">In <em>Mason, </em>the ten-year-old plaintiff entered a roadway near his school and, while in the intersection, was struck by a vehicle running a red light. <em>Id. </em>at 132-133. He sued the Wayne County Board of Commissioners to recover for his injuries on the theory that the board should have provided signs warning drivers that a school was nearby. <em>Id. </em>This Court found that the highway exception did not apply and that the plaintiff\u2019s suit was barred by governmental immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 138. The holding was based on a finding that \u201c[t]he highway exception specifically excepts the state and counties from liability for defects in cross<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>walks, the defect alleged by the plaintiff . . . <em>\"Id. </em>at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">In a footnote in <em>Mason, </em>this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">It is true that \u201c[a]ny person\" may recover, but only for ii\\juries that result from vehicular accidents. If a defect in the improved portion of the highway causes a traffic accident, any person injured as a result of that accident may recover, including injured passengers or pedestrians, if any, and the owner of the vehicle. <em>[Id. </em>at 135, n 4.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The issue in <em>Mason </em>was whether the highway exception applies to a pedestrian injured in a crosswalk, not whether pedestrians in other locations can recover under the exception. Therefore, I regard footnote 4 as mere dictum.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">In <em>Gregg, </em>however, the defendant argued that the highway exception did not apply to nonmotorists.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 310-311. We rejected the argument because the highway exception expressly includes \u201cany person sustaining bodily injury or damage to his property . . . <em>Id. </em>at 311. Thus, <em>Gregg </em>stands for the proposition that the highway exception allows injured pedestrians and the occupants of motor vehicles to recover. The injuries must have been caused by the failure of county road commissions or the state to maintain the improved portion of a highway designed for vehicular travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">In this case, the trial court erred when it rejected the holding <em>of Gregg </em>in favor of dictum from <em>Mason. </em>I agree with the majority that the trial court should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>have granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">II. <em>EVENS v SHIAWASSEE COUNTY ROAD COMMISSIONERS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">However, I disagree with the conclusion in <em>Evens </em>that MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1) establishes an exception to governmental immunity involving only traveled portions of a roadbed actually designed for vehicular travel. This interpretation is myopic in that it fails to place MCL 691.1402(1); ' MSA 3.996(102)(1) in its proper statutory framework. It is erroneous, also, because the majority inserts its own meaning of the words \u201cimproved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">A. THE WORDS \u201cIMPROVED PORTION OF THE HIGHWAY DESIGNED FOR VEHICULAR TRAVEL\u201d REFER TO MORE THAN JUST THE ROADBED</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Had the Legislature intended to impose liability on county road commissions and the state for defects in the surface of roads, alone, it could have and would have said so. The plain meaning of the words \u201cimproved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel\u201d connotes a broader concept than just the surface of the road, itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">The primary goal of statutory interpretation is to give effect to the controlling intent of the Legislature. <em>Lorencz v Ford Motor Co, </em>439 Mich 370, 376-377; 483 NW2d 844 (1992). \u201cWhen determining legislative intent, statutory language should be given a reasonable construction considering its purpose and the object sought to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Wills v Iron Co </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>Bd of Canvassers, </em>183 Mich App 797, 801; 455 NW2d 405 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">As the majority hints, this Court has long struggled with the outrageously imperfect language of the highway exception to governmental immunity. <em>Ante, </em>p 167. That long struggle, alone, supports the conclusion that the language of the highway exception is far from plain.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the majority asserts that the language of the statute is \u201cplain,\u201d in the sense that it lacks ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">I differ with the majority\u2019s conclusory assertion that the statutory phrase \u201cimproved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel\u201d has a plain meaning wilfully disregarded by this Court in <em>Pick v Szymczak, </em>451 Mich 607; 548 NW2d 603 (1996). Standing alone, the phrase does not specify that the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel includes only the surface of the highway. For example, it leaves uncertain whether the space above the highway containing traffic lights is included.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Because it does not, the words \u201cimproved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel\u201d might include traffic control devices. Beyond dispute, they constitute an improvement, inasmuch as they are placed on or above the highway by a government agency to improve vehicular travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">As we noted in <em>Pick, </em>vehicles do not travel \u201csolely on the two-dimensional length and width of the roadway,\u201d but in three dimensional space. <em>Id. </em>at 622-623. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>And for obvious reasons, it is impossible to place traffic control devices on the roadbed that the vehicles touch while traveling.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Provisions of the Motor Vehicle Code support the conclusion that the Legislature envisioned traffic control devices as an integral part of the highway itself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">The state highway commission shall place or require to be placed and maintain or require to be maintained such traffic control devices, conforming to said manual and specifications, <em>upon </em>all state highways as it shall deem necessary to indicate and to carry out the provisions of this chapter or to regulate, warn or guide traffic. [MCL 257.609(a); MSA 9.2309(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The county road commission has a similar duty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">Local authorities and county road commissions in their respective jurisdictions shall place and maintain such traffic control devices <em>upon </em>highways under their jurisdiction as they may deem necessary to indicate and carry out the provisions of this chapter or local traffic ordinances or to regulate, warn or guide traffic. All such traffic control devices hereafter erected shall conform to the state manual and specifications. [MCL 257.610(a); MSA 9.2310(a) (emphasis added).][<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>The Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cupon\u201d indicates that traffic control devices are on, not off highways. The Legislature appears to have intended that they become a part of the highway itself. Since we cannot determine from the phrase alone whether it includes improvements such as traffic devices, it is appropriate to analyze the provisions of the governmental immunity act as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">B. THE STATUTORY SCHEME OF THE GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITY ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On </em>Rehearing),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we recognized that the governmental immunity act was intended to provide uniform liability and immunity to both state and local government agencies. The preamble to the act notes that it is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">an act to make uniform the liability of municipal corporations, political subdivisions, and the state, its agencies and departments, officers, employees, and volunteers thereof, and members of certain boards, councils, and task forces when engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function, for injuries to property and persons; to define and limit this liability ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The highway exception is \u00a7 2 of the governmental immunity act, MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1). In it, the Legislature placed a general duty on \u201ceach governmental agency having jurisdiction over a highway\u201d to \u201cmaintain the highway in reasonable repair so that it is reasonably safe and convenient for public travel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>. . . The next sentence imposes liability on a government agency having jurisdiction over a highway for failure \u201cto keep a highway under its jurisdiction in reasonable repair and in a condition reasonably safe and fit for travel . . . Thus, liability not only extends to highways in a state of disrepair, but to those in a condition not reasonably safe and fit for travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The majority concludes that the Legislature did not intend to include traffic control devices within the purview of the highway exception. To reach that conclusion, it reads the first and second sentence of MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1) <em>separately. </em>The result is that it contradicts the Legislature\u2019s clear intent and renders the second sentence nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The second sentence of MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">A person who sustains bodily injury or damage to his or her property by reason of failure of a governmental agency to keep a highway under its jurisdiction in reasonable repair and in a condition reasonably safe and fit for travel may recover the damages suffered by him or her from the governmental agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">In this sentence, the Legislature expressly provides that persons who are injured because a government agency failed to keep a highway \u201cin reasonable repair <em>and </em>in a condition reasonably safe and fit for travel\u201d may recover damages from that agency. The majority quotes Justice Riley\u2019s dissent in <em>Pick, </em>asserting that a duty to keep the highway in a condition reasonably safe for travel does not exist. However, the assertion is refuted by the second sentence of the highway exception, itself. It is illogical to conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Legislature would impose liability where there is no duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">It is a maxim of statutory construction that every word in a statute should be read to give the word meaning. Also, a court should avoid a construction that would render any part of a statute surplusage or nugatory. <em>In re MCI Telecommunications, </em>460 Mich 396, 414; 596 NW2d 164 (1999); <em>Altman v Meridian Twp, </em>439 Mich 623, 635; 487 NW2d 155 (1992). The majority violates these principles by reading the first sentence of the highway exception, but ignoring the second. It renders meaningless the Legislature\u2019s intent to allow damages to those injured when a government agency fails to keep a highway under its jurisdiction reasonably safe for public travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Keeping the highway in a condition reasonably safe for public travel includes maintaining traffic control devices in working order. The majority maintains that traffic control devices are not implicated in the definition of \u201chighway\u201d under the highway exception to the governmental immunity act. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Under subsection 1(e) of the governmental immunity act, MCL 691.1401(e); MSA 3.996(101)(e),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">\u201cHighway\u201d means a public highway, road, or street that is open for public travel and includes bridges, sidewalks, trail-ways, crosswalks, and culverts on the highway. The term highway does not include alleys, trees, and utility poles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">As the majority concedes, this definition of \u201chighway\u201d is broad. <em>Ante, </em>p 175, n 30. In defining it, the Legislature specifies what is excluded: alleys, trees, and utility poles. Notably, it did not exclude traffic control devices. The majority usurps the Legislature\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>role by adding traffic control devices to the list of exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">This broad definition of \u201chighway\u201d explains the presence of the fourth sentence of MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">The duty of the state and county road commissions to repair and maintain highways, and the liability for that duty, extends only to the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel and does not include sidewalks, trailways, crosswalks, or any other installation outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">This sentence relieves county road commissions and the state from liability for installations outside the improved portions of the highway. But the Legislature did not completely bar recovery when an individual is injured because of a defect in \u201ca portion of a county highway outside of the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel, including a sidewalk, trailway, crosswalk or other installation.\u201d MCL 691.1402a(l); MSA 3.996(102a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Instead, the act places liability for those accidents on municipal corporations. MCL 691.1402a(1); MSA 3.996(102a)(1). If a municipal corporation knew about a defect thirty days before a plaintiffs injury and the defect is the proximate cause of the injury, then the corporation is liable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> MCL 691.1402a(1)(a) and (b); MSA 3.996(102a)(1)(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Under the statutory scheme created by the governmental immunity act, state and county road commissions are hable for defects <em>in </em>the improved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel. MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1). When a municipal corporation knows or should know about the existence of a defect outside the improved portion of the highway, it is liable for injuries caused by the defect. MCL 691.1402a; MSA 3.996(102a).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Maintaining traffic control devices is a governmental function delegated to county road commissions and the state. MCL 257.609(a); MSA 9.2309(a), MCL 257.610(a); MSA 9.2310(a). The governmental immunity act was intended to make uniform the liability of government agencies when, in the discharge or exercise of certain government functions, persons were injured. One of the functions is maintaining highways in reasonable repair and in a condition reasonably safe and convenient for public travel. Hence, the act includes the highway exception, which is found at MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Defective traffic control devices make highways hazardous for vehicular traffic. It is therefore logical to conclude that the Legislature intended to include traffic control devices in the duty to maintain highways in a condition reasonably safe for public travel. However, the majority has decided that traffic control devices are located outside the improved portions of roads, shifting liability for defective control devices to municipal corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>I find this conclusion illogical, particularly when county road commissions and the state have the duty to place and maintain traffic control devices on highways. MCL 257.609(a); MSA 9.2309(a); MCL 257.610(a); MSA 9.2310(a). Shifting liability for defective traffic control devices to municipal corporations when it is the county road commissions or the state that have the duty to maintain them is simply senseless.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">C. PUBLIC POLICY CONSIDERATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In support of its construction of MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1), the majority points to certain public policy considerations. Specifically, it is concerned about the costs taxpayers might sustain if we determine that the use and maintenance of traffic control devices are part of keeping highways safe for public travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s predictions, the inclusion of traffic control devices would not make county road commissions and the state responsible for every instance of injury arising from automobile accidents. Instead, they would be liable only for injuries caused by their failure to maintain the improved highways in a condition <em>reasonably safe </em>for vehicular travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">In terms of public policy, one could argue that the taxpayers desire the reasonable use of traffic control devices to make roads safer. One could also argue that they intend compensation for those injured when an agency fails to keep roads safe, as expressly provided in the second sentence of the highway exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>There has been no evidence that, \u201cbefore <em>Pick, </em>a dearth of traffic control devices existed, creating unsafe highways . . . <em>Ante, </em>p 178, n 34. By the same token, there is no evidence that, since <em>Pick </em>in 1996, state coffers have been drained by a flood of lawsuits alleging injuries from unsafe traffic control devices.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, if it were the case that <em>Pick </em>resulted in an unbearable financial strain on the state, then surely the Legislature would have rewritten the governmental immunity act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">HI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\"><em>Pick </em>does not contradict the plain meaning of MCL 691.1402(1); MSA 3.996(102)(1). Rather, the interpretation proffered by the majority today offends the statutory scheme set in place by the Legislature. Moreover, it offends principles of statutory construction, the doctrine of stare decisis, and common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In <em>Ross, </em>we provided that exceptions to the governmental immunity act should be construed narrowly; however, it does not follow that they should be construed in contravention of the stated intent of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">It appears that the majority is straining in making the statutory interpretation in <em>Evens. </em>It has improp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>erly interpreted the words \u201cimproved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel\u201d to include only the surface of the road. If the Legislature did so intend, it could have and, presumably, would have said \u201csurface of the road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">More problematic is the majority\u2019s analysis of the words \u201cimproved portion of the highway designed for vehicular travel.\u201d It distorts the governmental immunity act by shifting to municipalities liability for defective traffic control devices. It does so despite the Legislature\u2019s delegation of the duty to maintain these devices to county road commissions and to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Throughout this judicial term, I have been dismayed by the majority\u2019s disregard of precedent laid down by the Court in years past. See <em>Robinson v </em>Detroit, 462 Mich 439, 475-477; 613 NW2d 307 (2000) (Kelly, J., dissenting). This case is yet another example.</p>\n<judges id=\"b378-7\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-9\"> 447 Mich 130, 135, n 4; 523 NW2d 791 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b367-9\"> The plaintiff in <em>Gregg </em>was injured while riding his bicycle on the shoulder of highway M-35.

It seems to conclude that their discretion is complete. Therefore, a finding that the governmental immunity act imposes liability for the failure to maintain these devices in a condition reasonably safe for vehicular travel would disturb this discretion. But, the majority reaches this conclusion simply by failing to give weight to the language that follows the phrase \u201cdeem necessary.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 182, n 36. The county road commission and the state shall place and maintain traffic control devices as they deem necessary \u201cto indicate and to cany out the provisions of this chapter [and local traffic ordinances, in the case of county road commissions] or to regulate, warn or guide traffic.\u201d MCL 257.609(a); MSA 9.2309(a). MCL 257.610(a); MSA 9.2310(a). Thus, the county road commissions\u2019 and the state\u2019s discretion is not as complete as the majority would lead one to believe. Holding that the high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>way exception to governmental immunity includes traffic control devices does not interfere with the placement and maintenance of these devices to effectively regulate, guide and warn traffic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b371-11\"> 420 Mich 567, 614; 363 NW2d 641 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\"> Section 2a of the governmental immunity act was added recently. 1999 PA 205.
