Its boundaries were fixed and defined as follows (25 Stat. 124):</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-7\">\u201c Beginning at a point in the middle of the main channel of Milk River, opposite the mouth of Snake Creek; thence due south to a point due west of the western extremity of the Little Rocky Mountains; thence due east to the crest of said mountains at their western extremity, and thence following the southern crest of said mountains to the eastern extremity thereof; thence in a northerly direction in a direct line to a point in the middle of the main channel of Milk River opposite the mouth of People\u2019s Creek; thence up Milk River, in the middle of the main channel thereof, to the place of beginning.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-8\">Milk River, designated as the northern boundary of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>reservation, is a non-navigable stream. Large portions of the lands embraced within the reservation are well fitted and adapted for pasturage and the feeding and grazing of stock, and since the establishment of the reservation the United States and the Indians have had and have large herds of cattle and large numbers of horses grazing upon the land within the reservation, \u201c being and situate along and bordering upon said \u25a0Milk River.\u201d Other portions of the reservation are \u201cadapted for and susceptible of farming and cultivation and the pursuit of agriculture, and productive in the raising thereon of grass, grain and vegetables,\u201d but such portions are of dry and arid character, and in order to make them productive require large quantities of water for the purpose of irrigating them. In 1889 the United States constructed houses and buildings upon- the reservation for the occupancy and residence of the officers in charge of it, and such officers depend entirely for their domestic, culinary and irrigation purposes upon the water of the river. In the year 1889, and long prior to the acts of the defendants complained of, the United States, through its officers and agents at the reservation, appropriated and took from the river a flow of 1,000 miners\u2019 inches, and conducted it to the buildings and premises, used the same for domestic purposes and also for the irrigation of land adjacent to the buildings and premises, and by the use thereof raised crops of grain, grass and vegetables. Afterwards, but long prior to the acts of the defendants complained of, to wit, on the fifth of July, 1898, the Indians -residing on the reservation diverted from the river for the purpose of irrigation a flow of 10,000 miners\u2019 inches of water to and upon divers and extensive tracts of land, aggregating in amount about 30,000 acres, and raised upon said lands crops of grain, grass and vegetables. And ever since 1889 and July, 1898, the United States and the Indians have diverted and used the waters of the river in the manner and for the purposes mentioned, and the United States \u201chas been enabled by means thereof to train, encourage and accustom large numbers of Indians residing upon the said reserva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>tion to habits of industry and to promote their civilization and improvement.\u201d It is alleged with detail that all of the waters of the river are necessary for all those purposes and the purposes for which the reservation was created, and that in furthering and \u25a0 advancing the civilization and improvement of the Indians, and to encourage habits of industry and thrift among them, it is essential and necessary that all of the waters of the river flow down the channel uninterruptedly and undiminished in quantity and undeteriorated in quality.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-5\">It is alleged that \u201cnotwithstanding the riparian and other rights \u201d of the United States and the Indians' to the uninterrupted flow of the waters of the river the defendants, in the year 1900, wrongfully entered upon the river and its tributaries above the points of the diversion of the waters of the river by the United States and the Indians, built large and substantial dams and reservoirs, and by means of canals and ditches and waterways have diverted the waters of the river from its channel, and have deprived the United States and the Indians of the use thereof.

This agreement was ratified by an act of Congress of May 1, 1888, c. 213, 25 Stat. 113, and thereby the lands to which the Indians\u2019^ title was thus extinguished became a part of the public domain of the United States and subject to disposal under the various land laws, \u201cand it was the' purpose and intention of the Government that the said land should be thus thrown open to settlement, to the end that the same might be settled upon, inhabited, reclaimed and cultivated and communities of civilized persons be established thereon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-6\">That the individual defendants and the stockholders of the Matheson Ditch Company and Cook\u2019s Irrigation Company were qualified to become settlers upon the public land and to acquire title thereto under the homestead and desert land laws of the United States.

The- defendants and the stockholders of the defendant corporations have expended many thousands of dollars in constructing dams, ditches and reservoirs, and in improving said lands, building fences, and other structures, establishing schools and constructing highways and other improvements, usually had and enjoyed in a civilized community, and that the only supply of water to irrigate the lands is from Milk River.

That all of the waters of these streams can be made available for use upon the reservation, and that it was not the. intention of the Government to reserve any of the waters of Milk River or its tributaries. That the respective claims of the defendants to the waters of the river_and its tributaries are prior and paramount to the .claims of the United States and the Indians, except as to 250 inches used in and around the agency buildings, and at all times there has been sufficient water - flowing down the river to more than supply these 250 inches. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-5\">And it is again alleged that the waters of the river are indispensable \u25a0 to defendants, are of the value of more' than $100,000 to them, and that if they are deprived of the waters \u201ctheir lands will be ruined, it will be necessary to abandon their homes, and they will be greatly and irreparably damaged, the extent and amount of which damage cannot now be estimated, but will greatly exceed $100,000,\u201d and that they will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>be wholly without remedy if the claim of the United States and the Indians be sustained. .</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b603-5\"><em>Mr. Edward C.

Nor can it be held, that the Indians understood that there was any reservation of the waters of Milk River for use upon the Belknap Reservation, or that they ceded and relinquished to the Government anything less than the absolute title to the lands and all waters thereon to that portion of the former reservation to which they -relinquished their claims. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-10\">The rul\u00e9 that the treaty must, be construed most favorably to the Indians does not apply to\u2019this case.

In such .case, the appellants are the public in whose behalf the grants must be construed most strongly.

Five of the defendants named in 'the bill failed to answer and a decree <em>pro confesso </em>was taken against them. The other defendants, appellants here, after the affirmance by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the interlocutory injunction,' filed a joint and several answer. On this answer and the bill the case was heard and a decree entered against all of the defendants. From that decree' the appellants here appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals without joining therein the other five defendants. The .contention is that the Circuit Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction and that this court has none, because the five defaulting defendants had such interest in the case and decree that they should have joined in the -appeal, or proceedings should have been taken against them in the nature of summons , and severance or its equivalent.-</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The rule which requires, the parties to . a judgment or decree to join in an appeal or writ of error, or be det\u00e1ched from the right by some proper proceeding, or by their renunciation, is firmly established.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But the rule only applies to joint judgments or decrees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In other words, when the interest of a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>fendant is separate from that- of other defendants he may appeal without them. Does the case at bar come within the rule? The bill does not distinguish the acts of the defendants, but it does not necessarily imply that there was between them, in-the diversion of the waters of Milk River, concert of action or-union of interest. The answer to-the bill is joint and several, and in effect avers separate rights, interests and action on the part of the defendants. In other words, whatever rights were asserted or admission of acts done by any one defendant had no dependence upon or relation to the acts of any other defendant in the appropriation or diversion of the water. If trespassers at all, they were separate trespassers. Joinder in one suit did not necessarily identify them. Besides, the defendants other than appellants defaulted. A decree <em>pro confesso </em>was entered against them, and. thereafter, according to Equity Rule 19, the cause was required to proceed <em>ex parte </em>and the matter of the bill decreed by the court. <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>Wooster, </em>114 U. S. 104. The decree was in due course made absolute, and granting that it might have been appealed from by the .defaulting defendants, they would have been, as said in <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>Wooster, </em>absolutely barred and precluded from questioning its correctness, unless on the face of the bill it appeared-manifest that it was erroneous and improperly granted. Their rights, therefore, were entirely different from those of the appellants; they were naked trespassers, and conceded by their.default the rights of the United States and the Indians, and were in no position to resist the prayer of the bill. But the appellants justified by counter rights and submitted those right's for judgment. There is nothing, therefore, in common between appellants and the other defendants. The motion to dismiss is denied and we proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The case, as we view it, turns on the agreement of May, 1888, resulting in the creation of Fort Belknap Reservation. In the construction of this agreement there are certain elements to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>be considered that are prominent and significant. The reservation was a part of a very much larger tract which the Indians had the right to occupy and use and which was adequate for the habits and wants of a nomadic and uncivilized people. It was the policy of the Government, it was the desire of the Indians, to change those habits and to become a pastoral and civilized people. If they should become such the original tract was too extensive, but a smaller tract would be inadequate without a change of conditions. The lands were arid and, without irrigation, were practically valueless. And yet, it is contended, the means of' irrigation were deliberately given, up by the Indians and deliberately accepted by the Government. The lands ceded were, it is true, also arid; and some argument may be urged, and is .urged, that with their cession there was the cession of the waters, without which they would be valueless, and \u201ccivilized' communities could not be established thereon.\u201d And this, it is further contended, the Indians knew, and yet made no reservation of the waters. We realize that there is a conflict of implications, but that which makes for the retention of the waters is of greater force than that which makes for their cession. The Indians had command of the lands and the waters\u2014command of all their beneficial use, whether kept for hunting, \u201cand grazing roving herds of stock,\u201d or turned to agriculture and the arts, of civilization. Did they give up all this? Did they rqduce the area of their occupation and give up the waters which made it valuable or adequate? And, even regarding the allegation of the answer as true, that there are springs and streams on the reservation flowing about 2,900 inches of water, the inquiries are pertinent. If it were possible to believe affirmative answers, we might also believe that the Indians were awed by the power of the Government or deceived by its negotiators. Neither view is possible. The Government is asserting the rights of the Indians. But extremes need not bo taken into account. By a rule of interpretation of agreements and treaties with the Indians, ambiguities occurring will be resolved from the standpoint of the Indians. And the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>should certainly be applied to determine between two inferences, one of which would support the purpose of the agreement and the other impair or defeat it. On account of their relations to the Government, it cannot be supposed that the Indians were alert to exclude by formal words every inference which might militate against or defeat the declared purpose of themselves and the Government, even if it could be supposed that they had the intelligence to foresee the \u201cdouble sense\u201d which might some time be urged against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Another contention of appellants is that if it be conceded that there was a reservation of \"the waters of Milk River by the agreement of 1888, yet the reservation was repealed by the admission of Montana into the Union, February 22, 1889, c. 180, 25 Stat. 676, \u201cupon an equal footing with the original States.\u201d The language of counsel is that \u201cany reservation in the agreem\u00e9nt with the Indians, expressed or implied, whereby the waters of Milk River were not to be subject of appropriation by the citizens and inhabitants of said State, was repealed by the act of admission.\u201d But to establish the repeal counsel rely substantially upon the same argument that they advance against the intention of the agreement to reserve the waters. The power of the Government to reserve the waters and exempt them from appropriation under the state laws is not denied, and could not be. <em>The United States </em>v. <em>The Rio Grande Ditch &amp; Irrigation Co., </em>174 U. S. 690, 702; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Winans, </em>198 U. S. 371. That the Government did reserve them we have decided, and for a use which would be necessarily continued through yearn- This was done May 1,1888, and it would be extreme to believe that within a year Congress destroyed the reservation and took from the Indians the consideration of their grant, leaving them a barren waste\u2014took from them the means of continuing their old habits, yet did not leave them the power to change to new ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Appellants\u2019 argument upon the incidental repeal of the agreement by the admission of Montana into the Union and the power over the waters of Milk River, which the State thereby acquired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>to dispose of them under its laws, is elaborate and able, but our construction .of the agreement and its effect make it unnecessary to answer the argument in detail. For the same reason we have not discussed the doctrine of riparian rights urged by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b610-7\">Mr. Justice Brewer dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\"> <em>Williams v.
