Such a construction of this statute is in palpable violation of the rule that penal statutes, should be strictly construed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-9\">If there is a class of persons literally within the terms of this immigration statute, but who' for sufficient reasons cannot be held'subject to its-obvious requirements (as in this instance seamen who must leave the ship, on ship\u2019s duty, and virtually must be allowed to leave the ship on shore leave), then the only permissible conclusion is, not that the rule of the statute will be modified as to them by giving it an entirely different meaning so as to reach them, but that they do not come within the statute, because a thing may be within the letter of a statute \u2022yet not within the statute, because not within' its spirit, nor within \u2018the intention of its makers. <em>Holy Trinity Church </em>v. <em>United States, </em>143 U.

'The title of an act can aid in construing a doubtful provision. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fisher, 2 </em>Cranch, 358, 386; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>3 Wheat. 610, 631; <em>Myer </em>v. <em>Car Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>102 U.

Immigration statutes prior to 1903 did not apply to <em>bona fide </em>seamen, and it appears from the Congressional history of the act of 1903 that Congress did not then intend to change the law on that subject.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-6\">To hold-that Congress intended to make \u00a7 18 apply to desertion of <em>bona fide </em>seamen involves attributing to' Congress the intention to hold a shipmaster responsible as a criminal for failing to prevent the unavoidable, and the intention to punish him for the act of another by which he himself is the - immediate sufferer.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-7\"><em>Mr. Harrington Putnam </em>for defendant in error, Macdonald, in No. 404:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-8\">A writ of error does not lie in behalf of the United States, from the judgment of the Circuit Court, in favor of the defendant in error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-9\">Notwithstanding the distinction attempted to be taken in the act of March 2, 1907, the constitutional safeguard to the defendant extends equally to the case of'a decision upon a demurrer to the indictment as to a hearing and trial of the facts by a jury. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanges, </em>144 U.

Such an innovation in the established criminal-procedure of the United States deserves to be closely scrutinized; otherwise a constitutional safeguard may be gradually undermined, leaving a poor defendant to be run down by the powerful and persistent action of the Government.

The word \u201c immigrant <em>\u201d </em>was omitted wherever it was found in the text of earlier acts for a deliberate purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-6\">A study of the various sections of the statute shows that Congress intended to include something more than passengers in using the words \u201calien\u201d or \u201cany alien.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-7\">The fact that the act retains the title of the former acts and is called \u201c An act to regulate the immigration of aliens into the United States\u201d is not inconsistent with the application of the text to all aliens and even if it were, it could not override the plain purpose of the text to refer to all such aliens.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b155-8\">Mr.'Justice Holmes</author>\n<p id=\"Aam\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">The first of these cases comes up on certiorari to review a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, affirming a conviction of the petitioner under the Immigration Act of March 3,1903, c. 1012, \u00a7 18, 32 Stat. 1213,1217.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That section makes it the duty of any officer in charge of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>vessel bringing an alien to the United States to adopt due precautions to prevent the landing of such alien at any time or place other than that designated by the immigration officers, and punishes him if he lands or permits to land any alien at any other time or place. The indictment was for willfully permitting an alien to land at another place. The evidence was that the defendant was master of the Cunard Steamship <em>\u201c </em>Slavonia,\u201d that the alien was an Austrian sailor who shipped as a cook at Fiume, Hungary, for the round trip, not to be paid off until he returned, and that on the evening of the day of arrival at New York, after he had reported his work finished, he went ashore, intending to come back,, but changed his mind. He did not formally ask leave to go, but leave habitually was given and no additional precautions were taken when leave was asked. The judge was requested to direct a verdict for the defendant and to instruct the jury that if the sailor intended to return when he left the ship they must acquit, etc.; but he left it to the jury to say whether the defendant had used reasonable precautions, adverting to the fact that there were other desertions, and emphasizing the failure to enforce a rule requiring the men to ask leave to go ashore. Exceptions were taken, but the Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the judgment, as we have said. 152 Fed. Rep. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">We assume for purposes of decision that one who makes it possible .for an alien to land, by omitting due precautions to prevent it, permits him to land within the'meaning of the penal clause in \u00a7 18. But we are of opinion that the section does not' apply to the ordinary case of a sailor deserting while on shore leave, and that therefore the. judgment must be reversed. We are led to this opinion by what seems to us the literal meaning of the section and also by the construction that would be almost necessary if the literal meaning seemed to us less plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The reasoning is not long.\u2019 The- phrase which .qualifies the whole section is, \u201cbringing an alien to the United States.\u201d It is only \u201csuch\u201d officers of \u201csuch\u201d vessels that are punished. \u201cBringing to the United States,\u201d taken literally and nicely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>means, as a similar phrase in \u00a7 8 plainly means, transporting with intent to leave in the United States and for the sake of transport\u2014not transporting with intent to carry back, and merely as incident to employment On the instrument of transport. So again, literally, the later'words \u201c to land\u201d mean to go ashore. To avoid certain inconveniences the Government and the courts below say that sailors do not land unless they permanently leave, the ship. But the single word is used for all' cases and must mean the sam\u00e9 thing for all, for sailors and other aliens. It hardly can be supposed that a master would be held justified under this section for allowing a leper to wander through the streets of New York on th\u00e9 ground that, as he expected the passenger to return and his expectations had been fulfilled, he could not be said to have allowed the leper to land. The words must be taken in their literal sense. \u201cLanding from such vessel\u201d takes place and is complete the moment the vessel is left and the shore reached. But it is necessary to commerce, as all admit, that sailors should go ashore, and no one believes that the statute intended altogether to prohibit their doing so. The contrary always has been understood of the earlier acts, in judicial decisions and executive practice. If we reject the ambiguous interpretation of \u201cto land,\u201d as we have, the necessary result can be reached only by saying that the section does not apply to sailors carried to an American port with a <em>bona fide </em>intent to take them out again when the ship go\u00e9s on, when not only there was no ground for supposing that they were making the voyage a pretext to get here, desert and get in, but there is no evidence that they were doing so in fact. Whether this result is reached by the interpretation of the words \u201cbringing an alien to the United States,\u201d that has been suggested, or. on the ground that the statute cannot have intended its precautions to apply to the ordinary and necessary landing of seamen, even if the words of the section embrace it,. as in <em>Church of the Holy Trinity </em>v. <em>United States, </em>143 U. S. 457, does not matter for this case. We think it superfluous to go through all the sections of the act for confirmation of our opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>ion. It is enough to say that we feel no doubt when we read the act as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">A reason for the construction adopted below was found in the omission of the word \u201cimmigrant\u201d which had followed \u201calien\u201d in the earlier acts. No doubt that may have been intended to widen the reach of the statute, but we see no reason .to suppose that the omission meant to do more than to avoid the suggestion that no one was within the act who did not come here with intent to remain. It is not necessary to regard the change as a-mere abbreviation, although the title of the statute is \u201c An Act to regulate the immigration of aliens into the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Upon our construction of the statute we need not go further into the particular circumstances. But we may add that even on a different reading the jury was permitted to establish a questionably high standard of conduct, if it be admitted, as it was, that shore leave might be granted. No practicable method- of preventing sailors from occasionally yielding to the seductions of an unduly prolonged stay on land was.suggested or occurs to our mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In the second case the District Judge declined to follow the decision in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>The United States, 152 </em>Fed. Rep. 1, which we have been considering, and quashed an indictment which disclosed that the alien alleged to have been permitted unlawfully to land was a seaman. The United States brings a writ of error under the Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246, on the ground, it must be presumed, that the judgment was based upon the construction of the statute. There are other technical questions apparent on the record, but, if they are open, the Government very properly has not pressed them, but has confined itself to the question of law with which we have dealt. There is an allegation in the indictment that the alien was a stowaway under order of deportation, and there is a suggestion that this raises a doubt if he was a <em>bona fide </em>seaman.'\u25a0 This is the only additional point raised. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">But we perceive nothing in the fact that an alien has been \u2022 refused leave to land from a British ship and has been ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>to be deported, to make it impossible as matter of law for the British master subsequently to accept him as a sailor on the high seas, even if bound for an American port. If the Government had wished to try the good faith of this particular transaction, and not simply to get a construction of the act, there was no need to rely on the allegation mentioned alone. Of course it is possible for a master unlawfully to permit an alien to land, even if the alien is a sailor, and it was alleged that the master did so. But we take the Government at its word.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\">The defendant\u2019 argues that the United States cannot be allowed a writ of error in a criminal case like this. We do not perceive the difficulty.' No doubt of the power of Congress is intimated in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanges, </em>144 U. S. 310. If the Fifth Amendment has any bearing, the act of 1907 is directed to judgments rendered before the moment of jeopardy is reached. <em>Keener </em>v. <em>United States, </em>195 U. S. 100, 128. We think it unnecessary to discuss the question at length.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><em>Judgment in No. </em>238 <em>reversed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\"><em>Judgment in No. </em>404 <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-10\"> Sec. 18.
