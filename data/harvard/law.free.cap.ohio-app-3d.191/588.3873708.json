Appellants assign a single error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">The court of common pleas erred in affirming the decisions of the Ohio Department of Commerce Bureau of Wage and Hour because those decisions were not supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence and were not in accordance with law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Because the common pleas court (1) did not err in determining that reliable, probative, and substantial evidence supports the Commerce Department\u2019s final order against American Glass but (2) erred in determining that Dorsey received adequate notice of the charges against it, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">{\u00b6 2} Dorsey and American Glass are separate companies with common ownership; Pruneau is the president of both companies. In 2005, the city of Columbus contracted with Dorsey, as general contractor, to construct a new entrance for Columbus\u2019s Central Safety Building located at 120 Marconi Boulevard; American Glass was the glass subcontractor on the project. As a contract for a public-improvement project, the contract was subject to Ohio\u2019s Prevailing-Wage Law set forth in R.C. 4115.01 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">{\u00b6 3} In separate notices of intentional violation issued January 15, 2008, the Commerce Department alleged that Dorsey and American Glass had violated R.C. 4115.13(H)(1) by knowingly submitting false or erroneous reports. Dorsey\u2019s notice letter alleged that Dorsey had submitted certified payroll reports from November 2005 through April 2006, to which Pruneau attested, indicating that fringe benefits had been paid although those payments did not occur until approximately May 2007. American Glass\u2019s notice letter alleged that American Glass submitted payroll reports from March 2006 through April 2006, to which Pruneau also attested, indicating that fringe benefits had been paid although those payments did not occur until April 19, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">{\u00b6 4} Both Dorsey and American Glass requested separate administrative hearings pursuant to R.C. 4115.13(B). Different hearing examiners conducted the two hearings, with Dorsey\u2019s hearing being held on April 21, 2008, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>American Glass\u2019s hearing commencing on April 22, 2008. Although the hearings were separate, they were similar in that the same witnesses testified, with the exception of one additional witness for American Glass. At each hearing, undisputed evidence established that both Dorsey and American Glass had submitted certified payroll records indicating fringe benefits paid but that neither company actually paid the benefits until more than a year after certifying the reports and only after the Commerce Department initiated its investigations into each company. At each hearing, Pruneau testified that she had always intended to pay the fringe benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">{\u00b6 5} On July 1, 2008, the hearing examiner for Dorsey\u2019s hearing issued a report and recommendation finding that \u201calthough [the Commerce Department] did not prove a clear violation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(1), there was sufficient notice in the detail of the charges to find that [Dorsey\u2019s] actions constituted a violation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(4).\u201d With that premise, the hearing examiner found an intentional violation of Ohio\u2019s Prevailing Wage Law from Dorsey\u2019s failure to pay fringe benefits \u201cwithin a reasonable time or on a regular basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">{\u00b6 6} On July 18, 2008, the hearing examiner for American Glass issued a report and recommendation concluding that when payroll reports are certified pursuant to R.C. 4115.13(H)(1), the \u201cwages and pension contributions shown on the payroll report must not only be accurate, they also must be paid. To find otherwise is to circumvent the meaning of the statute.\u201d The hearing examiner thus determined that American Glass had intentionally violated Ohio\u2019s Prevailing-Wage Law in its failure to pay fringe benefits \u201cwithin a certain time period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">{\u00b6 7} On August 15, 2008, Commerce entered final orders against both Dorsey and American Glass, adopting the reports and recommendations of the hearing examiners that found intentional violations in each case. Pursuant to R.C. 4115.13(D), the department ordered that both Dorsey and American Glass be debarred and \u201cprohibited from contracting directly or indirectly with any public authority for the construction of a public improvement or from performing any work on the same\u201d for a one-year period, applicable from either the expiration of the applicable period for filing an appeal or the date of the final judgment of a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">{\u00b6 8} Both Dorsey and American Glass timely appealed to the common pleas court pursuant to R.C. 119.12, and the court consolidated the two eases. In a decision and entry filed March 29, 2010, the court concluded that reliable, probative, and substantial evidence supported both of the department\u2019s final orders, determined that the final orders were in accordance with law, and presumably affirmed the orders when it dismissed both appeals. Dorsey and American Glass timely appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">{\u00b6 9} Under R.C. 119.12, a common pleas court, in reviewing an order of an administrative agency, must consider the entire record to determine whether rehable, probative, and substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s order and the order is in accordance with law. <em>Univ. of Cincinnati v. Conrad </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 108, 110-111, 17 O.O.3d 65, 407 N.E.2d 1265. The common pleas court\u2019s \u201creview of the administrative record is neither a trial <em>de novo </em>nor an appeal on questions of law only, but a hybrid review in which the court \u2018must appraise all the evidence as to the credibility of the witnesses, the probative character of the evidence, and the weight thereof.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lies v. Veterinary Med. Bd. </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 204, 207, 2 OBR 223, 441 N.E.2d 584, quoting <em>Andrews v. Bd. of Liquor Control </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 275, 280, 58 O.O. 51, 131 N.E.2d 390. The common pleas court must give due deference to the administrative agency\u2019s resolution of evidentiary conflicts, but \u201cthe findings of the agency are by no means conclusive.\u201d <em>Conrad </em>at 111. The common pleas court conducts a de novo review of questions of law, exercising its independent judgment in determining whether the administrative order is \u201cin accordance with law.\u201d <em>Ohio Historical Soc. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 466, 471, 613 N.E.2d 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">{\u00b6 10} An appellate court\u2019s review of an administrative decision is more limited than that of a common pleas court. <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621, 614 N.E.2d 748. The appellate court is to determine only whether the common pleas court abused its discretion. Id.; <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (defining an abuse of discretion). Absent an abuse of discretion, a court of appeals may not substitute its judgment for that of an administrative agency or the common pleas court. <em>Pons </em>at 621. An appellate court, however, has plenary review of purely legal questions. <em>Big Bob\u2019s, Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm., </em>151 Ohio App.3d 498, 2003-Ohio-418, 784 N.E.2d 753, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">III. Statutory Framework \u2014 Ohio\u2019s Prevailing-Wage Law</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. Chapter 4115 contains Ohio\u2019s prevailing-wage laws. \u201cIn general, these provisions require contractors and subcontractors for public works projects to pay laborers and mechanics the \u2018prevailing wage\u2019 in the locality where the project is to be performed.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Assoc. Builders &amp; Contrs. of Cent. Ohio v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of </em>Commrs., 125 Ohio St.3d 112, 2010-Ohio-1199, 926 N.E.2d 600, \u00b6 10, citing R.C. 4115.03 through 4115.21; <em>J.A. Croson Co. v. J.A. Guy, Inc. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 346, 349, 691 N.E.2d 655. \u201c \u2018[T]he primary purpose of the prevailing wage law is to support the integrity of the collective bargaining process by preventing the undercutting of employee wages in the private construction sector.\u2019 \u201d <em>Assoc. Builders &amp; Contrs. of Cent. Ohio </em>at \u00b6 10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>quoting <em>J.A. Croson Co. </em>at 349, citing <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Moore </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 88, 91, 23 O.O.3d 145, 431 N.E.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">{\u00b6 12} The director of commerce determines the prevailing rate of wages for a particular class of work and enforces the prevailing-wage laws. R.C. 4115.04(A)(1) and 4115.10(E); <em>Assoc. Builders &amp; Contrs. of Cent. Ohio </em>at \u00b6 11. If the director receives a complaint, an investigation ensues, after which the director determines whether a violation occurred and, if so, whether that violation was intentional. R.C. 4115.13(A) and (B). If the director recommends that a violation was intentional, the director provides written notice of that recommendation to the violator. R.C. 4115.13(B). Here, the notice letters provided to Dorsey and American Glass alleged that both companies had intentionally violated R.C. 4115.13(H)(1) by knowingly submitting false or erroneous reports certifying that fringe benefits had been paid when they had not been.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 4115.13(H)(1) defines \u201cintentional violation\u201d as \u201c[a]n intentional failure to submit reports as required under division (C) of section 4115.071 of the Revised Code or knowingly submitting false or erroneous reports.\u201d See also <em>Assoc. Builders &amp; Contrs. of Cent. Ohio, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 112, 2010-Ohio-1199, 926 N.E.2d 600, at \u00b6 12, citing R.C. 4115.13(H)(1) through (6) (\u201cA contractor or subcontractor intentionally violates prevailing-wage laws when it intentionally fails to submit payroll records to the contracting public authority [or] knowingly submits false payroll records\u201d). R.C. 4115.071(C), in turn, requires contractors and subcontractors to deliver \u201ca certified copy of the contractor\u2019s or subcontractor\u2019s payroll\u201d to the prevailing-wage coordinator. The certified copy \u201cshall exhibit for each employee paid any wages, * * * the employee\u2019s hourly rate of pay, the employee\u2019s job classification, fringe payments, and deductions from the employee\u2019s wages.\u201d R.C. 4115.071(C). Further, the certification \u201cshall be executed by the contractor, subcontractor, or duly appointed agent thereof and shall recite that the payroll is correct and complete and that the wage rates shown are not less than those required by the contract.\u201d R.C. 4115.071(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">{\u00b6 14} Although the notice letters to both Dorsey and American Glass specifically charged the two companies with violations of R.C. 4115.13(H)(1), only the final order against American Glass found a violation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(1); the final order against Dorsey instead found a violation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(4). Pursuant to R.C. 4115.13(H)(4), \u201cintentional violation\u201d includes \u201c[a]n intentional failure to pay the prevailing wage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">IV. Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">{\u00b6 15} In their sole assignment of error, appellants assert that the common pleas court erred in affirming the administrative orders because not only does reliable, probative, and substantial evidence not support them, but they are not in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>accordance with law. Dorsey\u2019s issues are distinct from those of American Glass, so we address the two separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">A. American Glass</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">{\u00b6 16} American Glass argues that the common pleas court erred in two ways in upholding the Department of Commerce\u2019s decision finding that American Glass intentionally violated R.C. 4115.13(H)(1). Initially, American Glass asserts that the common pleas court erred in interpreting R.C. 4115.13(H)(1). Secondly, American Glass contends that the department\u2019s investigation into the violation was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">\n<em>1. Interpretation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(1)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">{\u00b6 17} In addressing American Glass\u2019s appeal, the common pleas court explained that American Glass violated R.C. 4115.13(H)(1) when it failed to contribute to employees\u2019 pension plans while continuing to submit certified payroll reports indicating that those payments had been made. The common pleas court\u2019s decision turns largely on the interplay between R.C. 4115.13(H)(1) and 4115.071(C) and the importance under those provisions of certifying that fringe benefits were paid. See also R.C. 4115.03(E)(2) (\u201cThe rate of contribution irrevocably made by a contractor or subcontractor to a trustee or to a third person pursuant to a fund, plan, or program\u201d is a portion of the total prevailing wage). American Glass, however, argues that the court misinterpreted R.C. 4115.13(H)(1). It contends that the section does not involve a certification that fringe benefits were paid but only that the payroll reports were correct and complete and the wage rates shown on the reports were not less than those the contract required.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">{\u00b6 18} Despite its contentions on appeal, American Glass undisputedly and expressly certified on its payroll reports \u201c[t]hat the fringe benefits have been paid as indicated above.\u201d American Glass attempts to circumvent its certification by suggesting that the language is superfluous, since R.C. 4115.13(H)(1) requires only that the wages shown comply with the contract provisions. Contrary to American Glass\u2019s argument, R.C. 4115.13(H)(1) and 4115.071(C) require that a certified payroll report must include \u201cfringe payments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">{\u00b6 19} Despite the statutory language, American Glass asserts that industry practice involves filing the required payroll report but waiting some time before making payments to a pension plan. Even if the industry standard or some other policy allows contractors to wait a defined period of time before depositing payment into a pension fund, American Glass was outside any such time period, rendering its argument unpersuasive. American Glass did not make payments to its employees\u2019 pension plans until April 2007, more than a year after American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Glass certified fringe payments and only after the Department of Commerce initiated its investigation into American Glass\u2019s pension payments. Moreover, Pruneau expressly testified that although it was always her intention to pay the fringe benefits, she did not do so because American Glass did not have the funds to make the payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">{\u00b6 20} The common pleas court did not err in concluding that American Glass intentionally violated R.C. 4115.13(H)(1) when it certified fringe payments and that the company knew it lacked the income to actually make those payments and did not make fringe-benefit payments for over a year after its certification. The largely undisputed factual record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that substantial, reliable, and probative evidence supports the department\u2019s final order finding that American Glass intentionally violated R.C. 4115.13(H)(1), a decision that is in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">\n<em>2. Timeliness of Investigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">{\u00b621} American Glass next argues that the department\u2019s investigation into the prevailing-wage-law violation was untimely because the investigator did not begin her investigation until April 3, 2007, more than five days after the complaint was filed. Accordingly, American Glass asserts, the common pleas court erred in affirming the final order stemming from that investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">{\u00b6 22} According to R.C. 4115.13(A), the director of commerce shall investigate any alleged violation of Ohio\u2019s Prevailing-Wage Law \u201cwithin five days of the filing of the complaint.\u201d The complaint against American Glass was prepared on March 19, 2007, and filed with the department on March 22, 2007. The assistant chief of the department testified that she reviewed the complaint, initialed it, and assigned the complaint to an investigator that same day. The superintendent of the Division of Labor and Worker Safety for the Department of Commerce, testified that the assistant chiefs review of the complaint \u201cstarts the investigation process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">{\u00b6 23} With that record, the department determined that the investigation was timely, and the common pleas court accepted the department\u2019s interpretation of the timeliness requirement. \u201cThe Ohio Supreme Court has * * * recognized that \u2018[a] court must give due deference to the agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the legislative scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Newark v. Indus. Comm., </em>10th Dist. No. 05AP-1118, 2006-Ohio-5033, 2006 WL 2780927, \u00b6 6, quoting <em>Northwestern Ohio Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council v. Conrad </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 282, 287, 750 N.E.2d 130. Under the department\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 4115.13(A), the investigation into American Glass\u2019s conduct was timely. Even apart from the department\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 4115.13(A), the statutory scheme indicates that the time provisions of the statute are directory, not mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>{\u00b6 24} American Glass premises its argument on the statutory language. Because the statute uses \u201cshall\u201d in describing the time frame within which the investigation prescribed under the statute is to begin, American Glass asserts that the statute is mandatory. See <em>Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. v. Countrywide Home Loans, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 522, 2003-Ohio-4358, 794 N.E.2d 56, \u00b6 4 (construing R.C. 4112.05(B)(7) to be mandatory, not directory, in providing that any complaint the Ohio Civil Rights Commission issued, based on the filing of a charge of unlawful discriminatory practice, \u201cshall be so issued within one year after the complainant filed the charge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>Countrywide, </em>the Supreme Court concluded, \u201c \u2018[T]he word \u201cshall\u201d shall be construed as mandatory unless there appears a clear and unequivocal legislative intent that [it] receive a construction other than [its] ordinary usage.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 4, quoting <em>Dorrian v. Scioto Conservancy Dist. </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 102, 56 O.O.2d 58, 271 N.E.2d 834, paragraph one of the syllabus. In so determining, the court decided that R.C. 4112.05(B)(7) is a statute of limitations and that the one-year time limit contained in the statute for filing an administrative complaint is mandatory. Id. at \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">{\u00b6 26} The court\u2019s construction of R.C. 4112.05(B)(7) in <em>Countrywide </em>does not control the proper construction of R.C. 4115.13(A), because of significant differences in the two statutes. <em>Countrywide </em>involved a time limit on when a complaint is filed. American Glass, by contrast, does not assert that the complaint was not timely filed; rather, its argument involves procedural time limits after the commission properly issued its complaint. The mandatory rule applied in <em>Countrywide </em>and <em>Dorrian </em>does not pertain when the statutory language at issue relates to \u201cthe manner or time in which power or jurisdiction vested in a public officer is to be exercised.\u201d <em>Schick v. Cincinnati </em>(1927), 116 Ohio St. 16, 155 N.E. 555, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">{\u00b6 27} Notwithstanding <em>Countrywide, </em>the general rule is that \u201c \u2018 \u201ca statute providing a time for the performance of an official duty will be construed as directory so far as time for performance is concerned, especially where the statute fixes the time simply for convenience or orderly procedure.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Hardy v. Delaware Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 359, 2005-Ohio-5319, 835 N.E.2d 348, \u00b6 22, quoting <em>State ex rel. Ragozine v. Shaker, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 201, 2002-Ohio-3992, 772 N.E.2d 1192, \u00b6 13, quoting <em>State ex rel. Jones v. Farrar </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 467, 32 O.O. 542, 66 N.E.2d 531, paragraph three of the syllabus. Accordingly, a statute will be construed as directory \u201c \u2018unless the nature of the act to be performed or the phraseology of the statute or of other statutes relating to the same subject-matter is such that the designation of time must be considered a Imitation upon the power of the officer.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Davis </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 520, 522, 705 N.E.2d 1219, quoting <em>State ex rel. Smith v. Barnell </em>(1924), 109 Ohio St. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>246, 255, 142 N.E. 611. See also <em>Schick </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201cStatutes which relate to the manner or time in which power or jurisdiction vested in a public officer is to be exercised, and not to the limits of the power or jurisdiction itself, may be construed to be directory, unless accompanied by negative words importing that the act required shall not be done in any other manner or time than that designated\u201d). Had the General Assembly intended R.C. 4115.13(A)\u2019s time frames to be jurisdictional in nature, it could have explicitly so stated. See, e.g., R.C. 4735.32.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">{\u00b6 28} Because the time frames provided in R.C. 4115.13(A) are directory, the department did not lose jurisdiction, even if it failed to act within the statutory time periods. As a result, in claiming reversible error in the department\u2019s alleged failure to meet the statutory time limits, American Glass also must demonstrate prejudice. <em>Hughes v. Ohio Real Estate Comm. </em>(July 22, 1999), 8th Dist. No. 74480, 1999 WL 528506, citing <em>In re Heath </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 605, 608, 609 N.E.2d 1346. American Glass neither alleged nor demonstrated any prejudice resulting from any delays in the investigation. Accordingly, American Glass\u2019s timeliness argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">B. Dorsey</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">{\u00b6 29} Dorsey also advances two arguments to reverse the common pleas court\u2019s decision to uphold the department\u2019s final order finding an intentional violation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(4). Dorsey initially argues that the common pleas court erred in finding no due process violation when the notice letter explicitly charged Dorsey with a violation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(1) but the department ultimately concluded that Dorsey had violated R.C. 4115.13(H)(4). Secondly, Dorsey, like American Glass, argues the department\u2019s investigation into the matter was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">\n<em>1. Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">{\u00b6 30} When an administrative agency proposes to take disciplinary action against a party, R.C. 119.07 requires the agency to \u201cgive notice to the party informing the party of the party\u2019s right to a hearing.\u201d The notice \u201cshall include the charges or other reasons for the proposed action, the law or rule directly involved, and a statement informing the party that the party is entitled to a hearing if the party requests it within thirty days.\u201d R.C. 119.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cThe fundamental requirement of procedural due process is notice and hearing, that is, an opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Korn v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1988), 61 Ohio App.3d 677, 684, 573 N.E.2d 1100, citing <em>Luff v. State </em>(1927), 117 Ohio St. 102, 157 N.E. 388. \u201c \u2018An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u2019 \u201d <em>Althof v. Ohio State Bd. of Psychology, </em>10th Dist. No. 05AP-1169, 2007-Ohio-1010, 2007 WL 701572, \u00b6 19, quoting <em>Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1950), 339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 657, 94 L.Ed. 865. \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe right to a hearing embraces not only the right to present evidence, but also a reasonable opportunity to know the claims of the opposing party and to meet them.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Gonzales v. United States </em>(1955), 348 U.S. 407, 414, 75 S.Ct. 409, 99 L.Ed. 467, fn. 5, quoting <em>Morgan v. United States </em>(1938), 304 U.S. 1, 18, 58 S.Ct. 773, 82 L.Ed. 1129. Within those parameters, the issue here resolves to whether appellants had a reasonable opportunity to know that it was charged with a violation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(4), an intentional failure to pay the prevailing wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">{\u00b6 32} In dismissing Dorsey\u2019s appeal, the common pleas court noted that although the department found that Dorsey had violated R.C. 4115.13(H)(4), Dorsey\u2019s conduct actually constituted a violation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(1). As a result, the common pleas court did \u201cnot find merit\u201d in Dorsey\u2019s argument that it had not received proper notice of the claims against it. Explaining its conclusion, the common pleas court stated that \u201cnotice and precise notice are two distinct issues,\u201d and that since Dorsey\u2019s notice letter included a general reference to R.C. Chapter 4115, the notice that it received was not prejudicial. The common pleas court emphasized that R.C. 4115.13(H) defines an intentional violation as \u201cincluding], but * * * not limited to,\u201d subsections (1) through (6) of R.C. 4115.13(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">{\u00b6 33} Dorsey initially responds that the common pleas court lacks the authority to change the nature of the charged offense to correct the department\u2019s error in finding a violation of a section not specified in the notice letter. Secondly, Dorsey argues that the notice letter that the department sent to it specifically charged Dorsey with a violation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(1), not a general violation of R.C. Chapter 4115, rendering the notice provided to Dorsey insufficient to find a violation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">{\u00b6 34} Were an appeal available to the Commerce Department and pursued, the common pleas court well may have concluded that the hearing examiner had erred in finding no violation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(1). See R.C. 119.12 (stating that absent a finding that reliable, probative, and substantial evidence supports the order of the administrative agency, the common pleas court \u201cmay reverse, vacate, or modify the order or make such other ruling as is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law\u201d). In the absence of such proceedings, however, the notice issue is pertinent. To conclude otherwise would create the undesirable situation in which an administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>agency could provide notice to a party regarding one specific charge but subsequently find that party violated an entirely different charge within the code chapter at issue. That procedure would seriously undermine the purpose of the notice requirement and the protections that it is designed to afford. Whether Dorsey received proper notice of a violation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(4) is a valid issue for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 35} To support its conclusion that the notice Dorsey received did not prejudice it, the common pleas court relied on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Fehrman v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce </em>(2001), 141 Ohio App.3d 503, 751 N.E.2d 1089. In <em>Fehrman, </em>the appellant was given notice that the Commerce Department would be \u201cconsidering whether he was of good business repute, as defined in Ohio Adm.Code 1301:6-3-19(D)(7) and (9).\u201d Id. at 511. This court held that even though the appellant \u201cwas not given notice of one specific subsection of Ohio Adm.Code 1301:6-3-19(D), he clearly had adequate notice of the issues * * * to be considered at the hearing\u201d as well as \u201cthe opportunity to present evidence in his favor on these issues.\u201d Id. (noting that \u201cthere was a basis for appellee\u2019s finding that appellant was not of good business repute under the subsections of Ohio Adm.Code 1301:6-3-19(D) for which appellant was given notice\u201d). On those facts, this court concluded that the appellant in <em>Fehrman </em>suffered no prejudice stemming from the general notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">{\u00b6 36} Dorsey\u2019s notice differs in specificity from the one at issue in <em>Fehrman. </em>It stated that \u201c[b]ased upon documentation\u201d that the department had received \u201cduring its investigation into this matter, Commerce has determined\u201d that Dorsey and Pruneau \u201cviolated R.C. 4115.13(H)(1) by knowingly submitting false or erroneous reports\u201d and attesting that \u201cthe fringe benefits were paid as indicated on the certified payroll reports,\u201d since Dorsey and Pruneau \u201cdid not make the above-mentioned fringe benefit payments until approximately May 2007.\u201d The notice letters thus did not allege a general violation of R.C. Chapter 4115, but alleged a very specific violation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(1) and failed to refer to R.C. 4115.13(H)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">{\u00b6 37} The record here contains an additional factor that distinguishes <em>Fehrman. </em>During the hearing, Dorsey\u2019s counsel read from the notice letter and specifically referred to R.C. 4115.13(H)(1). Both parties then stipulated that \u201cthe only charges we\u2019re talking about are what [the department has] listed in this letter.\u201d Both the notice that the department sent to Dorsey and the steps taken at the hearing to clarify the charge against Dorsey undermine the department\u2019s contention that Dorsey was on notice of more than charges under R.C. 4115.13(H)(1). To the contrary, the parties\u2019 stipulation confirms Dorsey\u2019s expectation that it needed to defend against only the specific allegation of an intentional violation under R.C. 4115.13(H)(1). Given the specificity of the notice letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>and the stipulation before the hearing examiner, Dorsey did not receive adequate notice that it faced a potential violation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">{\u00b6 38} Commerce argues that even if the notice was less than it should have been, Dorsey suffered no prejudice because notice of one necessarily provides notice of the other, given the similarity between R.C. 4115.13(H)(1) and (H)(4). An intentional violation under R.C. 4115.13(H)(1) involves \u201c[a]n intentional failure to submit reports as required under [R.C. 4115.071(C) ] or knowingly submitting false or erroneous reports.\u201d By contrast, R.C. 4115.13(H)(4) defines \u201cintentional violation\u201d as including \u201c[a]n intentional failure to pay the prevailing wage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 39} Although under certain circumstances a contractor or subcontractor could violate both subsections with substantially similar conduct, that result is not preordained. For example, if a contractor paid the required prevailing wage but failed to file the necessary report, the contractor arguably would violate R.C. 4115.13(H)(1) but not R.C. 4115.13(H)(4). Conversely, if the contractor intentionally failed to pay prevailing wages but nonetheless filed the required report that accurately so stated, then the contractor arguably would violate R.C. 4115.13(H)(4) but not R.C. 4115.13(H)(1). See the hearing examiner\u2019s explicit conclusion that the department \u201cdid not prove a clear violation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(1),\u201d yet still finding that Dorsey had violated R.C. 4115.13(H)(4), a conclusion that the department did not modify in its final order adopting the hearing examiner\u2019s report and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">{\u00b6 40} Unlike those examples, the facts here suggest a violation of both sections, and, but for the specificity of the stipulations before the hearing examiner, we might find the department\u2019s argument more persuasive. But we cannot ignore that had Dorsey known that other potential charges were at issue, it may have presented additional or different evidence, or even used a different defense strategy, in light of the additional charge. Because of the undisputed assurance given to Dorsey that only a violation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(1) was at issue, we are compelled to conclude that the notice to Dorsey was insufficient to alert Dorsey that charges under R.C. 4115.13(H)(4) were at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">{\u00b6 41} Accordingly, Dorsey has demonstrated prejudice from the Department of Commerce\u2019s failure to provide adequate notice that Dorsey faced a charge under R.C. 4115.13(H)(4), since Dorsey confined its defense to an alleged violation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(1) and did nothing to attempt to refute a charge under R.C. 4115.13(H)(4). The common pleas court erred in determining that Dorsey was not prejudiced from the inadequate notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">\n<em>2. Timeliness of Investigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">{\u00b6 42} Similar to the argument that American Glass advanced, Dorsey also asserts that the department did not timely commence the investigation against it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>For the same reasons set forth in addressing American Glass\u2019s timeliness argument, Dorsey\u2019s contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">V. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">{\u00b6 43} The common pleas court did not abuse its discretion in determining that reliable, probative, and substantial evidence supports the department\u2019s order concluding that American Glass committed an intentional violation of R.C. 4115.13(H)(1). The common pleas court, however, erred when it in effect affirmed the department\u2019s order finding that Dorsey had violated R.C. 4115.13(H)(4), since Dorsey did not have adequate notice of the charges against it. Finally, the department timely commenced the investigations against both American Glass and Dorsey. Accordingly, we overrule in part and sustain in part appellants\u2019 assignment of error, and we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgments of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas and remand with instructions to reverse the department\u2019s order against Dorsey.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Judgments affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded with instructions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b636-8\">Tyack, P.J., and French, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
