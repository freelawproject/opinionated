Because the trial court erred as a matter of law in affirming the CRS\u2019s decision to deny Perkins service credit transferred from the state retirement system that would have ensured his eligibility for the ERIP, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment in Perkins\u2019s administrative appeal. But we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Perkins\u2019s mandamus action because he had an adequate remedy at law available in the administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\n<em>I. Perkins and the ERIP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">{\u00b6 2} In 2007, the city offered an incentive for the early retirement of qualified current employees. The ERIP offered two additional years of service credit to city employees with at least 28 years of service credit on December 31, 2007. Perkins had been employed as an inspector with the city\u2019s buildings department since March 1980. By the end of 2007, Perkins had accrued 27 years and ten months of CRS service credit. But Perkins had also worked as a seasonal municipal-service aide for the city\u2019s recreation department as a part-time student employee from July 9, 1972, until September 4, 1972. Perkins had not earned CRS service credit for that period of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">{\u00b6 3} Seeking service credit for his 1972 summer employment, Perkins submitted an application to participate in the ERIP. His application was denied by the staff of the CRS. In November 2007, the CRS finance manager explained to Perkins that for his 1972 service to be eligible for credit towards the ERIP, \u201cthe service would had to have been eligible at the time of employment.\u201d Under Ordinance No. 386-1952, the CRS did not extend service credit for temporary work like Perkins\u2019s 1972 summer employment with the recreation department.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">{\u00b6 4} On December 26, 2007, Perkins filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to keep the ERIP open until his administrative appeal had been resolved. At the same time, Perkins sought credit for his 1972 summer employment from the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (\u201cOPERS\u201d). In a decision dated January 28, 2008, OPERS determined that Perkins was entitled to .25 of a year of service credit under its system for the 1972 summer employment. Perkins then sought to transfer that service credit from OPERS to CRS under their transfer-of-service credit agreement. If he had been successful, Perkins would have had sufficient service credit to participate in the ERIP.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">{\u00b6 5} On January 31, 2008, the CRS Benefits Committee conducted a hearing. Perkins was represented by counsel at the hearing. The committee compiled findings of fact and conclusions of law and forwarded its results to the CRS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Board. The board adopted the committee\u2019s findings and conclusions and denied Perkins the opportunity to participate in the ERIP.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">{\u00b6 6} Perkins appealed the administrative decision of the CRS board to the court of common pleas. He also filed an amended verified complaint seeking a writ of mandamus and other injunctive relief. Under Civ.R. 42(A)(1), the trial court consolidated the two cases. In a single entry, the trial court ultimately entered judgment for the city in both cases. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\n<em>II. Perkins\u2019s Appeal of the CRS Decision Denying Service Credit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">{\u00b6 7} In his first assignment of error, Perkins asserts that the trial court erred in affirming CRS\u2019s decision denying his right to participate in the ERIP. He claims that the trial court erroneously affirmed the CRS\u2019s legal conclusion that the .25 year of service credit allowed by OPERS for his 1972 summer employment could not be transferred to his CRS service credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">{\u00b6 8} The CRS board had adopted the recommendation of the CRS Benefits Committee to deny Perkins\u2019s participation in the ERIP. The board agreed that Perkins\u2019s time as a municipal service aide was not eligible for CRS credit because (1) he had not been an employee eligible for CRS credit, as defined by Ordinance No. 386-1952, (2) he had not purchased the ineligible service credit when permitted by ordinance in 1997, and (3) a transfer of credit from OPERS to CRS for the 1972 employment was not permitted under the law governing the CRS. The trial court found sufficient, reliable, and probative evidence to support the boards\u2019 findings of fact and conclusions of law, and it affirmed the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">{\u00b6 9} As this court noted in <em>Cincinnati Bengals, Inc. v. Papania, </em>\u201cpursuant to R.C. 2506.04 the court of common pleas may determine whether the board\u2019s decision is, <em>inter alia, </em>\u2018illegal,\u2019 <em>i.e., </em>contrary to law.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cSubsequent appeals to this court are limited to questions of law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this case, we must\u2019 therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court unless we conclude that the trial court\u2019s judgment is contrary to law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">{\u00b6 10} Pursuant to Cincinnati Municipal Code 203-8, the city entered into a transfer-of-service credit agreement with OPERS. Under the transfer agreement, service credit can be transferred between CRS and OPERS. Section III <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>of the transfer agreement provides that once an eligible CRS member files the appropriate paperwork with the CRS, \u201cthe Accepting System [CRS] shall provide written notice to the Transferring System [OPERS], and Eligible Service Credit <em>shall he transferred </em>\u201d by the means described in the remainder of the section.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cEligible Service Credit\u201d is defined as \u201c[s]erviee credit earned under the Transferring System.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">{\u00b6 11} The transfer agreement also states, in Section TV, that \u201c[t]he Accepting System [CRS] shall grant service credit to the Eligible Member for a specific period of time of Eligible Service Credit to be transferred from the Transferring System [OPERS] as allowed by the Accepting System\u2019s applicable service credit law* * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 12} The city, however, contends that as the accepting system, its applicable service-credit law \u2014 Ordinance No. 386-1952 \u2014 prevented it from crediting Perkins for his 1972 summer employment. The ordinance excluded retirement service credit, <em>under CRS, </em>for temporary employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 13} But the gravamen of Perkins\u2019s argument is not that the CRS had failed to award him CRS credit. He argues that the CRS failed to honor the transfer of .25 of a year of service credit awarded by OPERS in its January 28, 2008 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">{\u00b6 14} We hold that the city\u2019s reliance upon Ordinance No. 386-1952 in this case is misplaced. The CRS should have looked to the text of the transfer agreement and to Cincinnati Municipal Code 203-1-C2 for the \u201capplicable service-credit law\u201d governing whether the CRS was required to transfer Perkins\u2019s OPERS service credit. The agreement provides that service credit earned under OPERS is eligible service credit that \u201cshall be transferred.\u201d And Cincinnati Municipal Code 203-1-C2 defines \u201ccreditable service\u201d for retirement purposes to be \u201cthe sum of a member\u2019s * * * membership service [and] State Retirement System Credit purchased under [Cincinnati Municipal Code] 203-8.\u201d Thus, if Perkins was otherwise eligible, CRS\u2019s applicable service-credit law required it to transfer to Perkins service credit for the .25 of a year of eligible service under OPERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">{\u00b6 15} Therefore, we hold that the trial court erred as a matter of law in affirming the CRS board\u2019s conclusion that Perkins was not entitled to credit for the .25 of a year of service credit granted by OPERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">{\u00b6 16} We note that during pretrial preparations, the city and Perkins entered into a written stipulation that was filed on December 31, 2007, in the original papers of the mandamus action. The stipulation stated that if Perkins was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>ultimately successful in obtaining his requested additional service credit, he would be entitled to participate in the ERIP. On appeal, Perkins argues that the stipulation bound the city to concede his right to participate in the ERIP because OPERS ultimately awarded service credit for his 1972 employment. We disagree. It is unlikely that the city\u2019s experienced trial counsel would have, by stipulation, discredited the city\u2019s entire theory of the case \u2014 that OPERS could not mandate what type of employment merited service credit under the CRS. We construe the stipulation only as a binding admission by the city that if Perkins were to prevail in his administrative appeal, in the case numbered A-0804354, he would necessarily prevail in his pursuit of extraordinary and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">{\u00b6 17} The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\n<em>III. CRS Board Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 18} In Perkins\u2019s second assignment of error, he argues that the trial court erred in failing to compile its own findings of fact and conclusions of law, when the CRS board had denied his counsel the opportunity to argue in violation of R.C. 2506.03(A)(2)(a). In light of our resolution of his first assignment of error, we hold that Perkins cannot demonstrate any prejudice flowing from this alleged error. The assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\n<em>TV. Perkins Had an Adequate Remedy at Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">{\u00b6 19} In his third assignment of error, Perkins argues that for the same reasons detailed in his first assignment of error, the trial court erred in dismissing his amended verified complaint seeking a writ of mandamus and other injunctive relief. We overrule this assignment of error and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment, in the case numbered A-0711761, albeit on grounds completely different from those advanced by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">{\u00b6 20} Our resolution of the first assignment of error \u2014 that the trial court erred in failing to grant judgment in Perkins\u2019s favor in his administrative appeal \u2014 has established that Perkins had an adequate remedy at law. \u201c \u2018An administrative appeal generally provides an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law that precludes extraordinary relief in mandamus.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mandamus cannot issue when the relator has an adequate remedy at law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\n<em>V. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 21} Having sustained the first assignment of error, we reverse that part of the trial court\u2019s judgment upholding the CRS board\u2019s decision in the administrative appeal. That case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings under Cincinnati Municipal Code 203-8 consistent with law and with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 22} But having overruled Perkins\u2019s third assignment of error, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment to the eictent that it denied relief in the mandamus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b431-8\">Cunningham, P.J., and Hildebrandt and Mallory, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-10\">.
