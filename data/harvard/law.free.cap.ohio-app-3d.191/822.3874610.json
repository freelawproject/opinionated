On cross-appeal, appellee and cross-appellant The Strip Delaware, L.L.C. appeals the amount of attorney fees awarded in the trial court\u2019s April 23, 2010 judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-15\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b857-16\">{\u00b6 2} The Strip Delaware, L.L.C. (the \u201clandlord\u201d) owns a parcel of commercial real estate known as \u201cThe Strip\u201d in Jackson Township, Stark County, Ohio. In 1997, Landry\u2019s Seafood House-Ohio, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the \u201ctenant\u201d), entered into a lease agreement with the landlord to operate a \u201cJoe\u2019s Crab Shack\u201d restaurant. Landry\u2019s Seafood Restaurants, Inc., a Delaware Corporation, (the \u201cguarantor\u201d), executed a guaranty agreement, guaranteeing the full performance of the lease by the tenant. The tenant and the guarantor are collectively hereinafter referred to as \u201cLandry\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-17\">{\u00b6 3} In 2006, the guarantor sold the majority of its Joe\u2019s Crab Shack restaurants, and as a result, closed the restaurant at The Strip on November 17, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>2006. The landlord then notified the tenant that it was in default on the lease agreement, which required it to continuously operate at the leased premises. On December 22, 2006, the landlord repossessed the leased premises, changing the locks and posting notices on the doors. All the equipment and furnishings that the tenant had used to operate its restaurant remained on the premises. On December 29, 2006, the landlord terminated the lease with the tenant and requested that the tenant remove its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">{\u00b6 4} The tenant disputed the landlord\u2019s decision, and on February 1, 2007, the landlord filed a complaint for declaratory judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment, finding that the tenant and the guarantor had violated the terms of the lease agreement, that the agreement was terminated as a result of the default, and that the landlord was entitled to self-help repossession of the leased premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">{\u00b6 5} The tenant and the guarantor appealed the matter to this court in <em>Stark Commons, Ltd. v. Landry\u2019s Seafood House Ohio, Inc., </em>Stark App. No. 2007-CA00240, 2008 WL 2102353. By a judgment entry of April 14, 2008, this court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">{\u00b6 6} Thereafter, the landlord filed a complaint for money damages. Following a bench trial, the trial court found that the tenant and the guarantor were liable as a holdover tenant from December 22, 2006, through April 14, 2008, at 150 percent of the base rent (the rate provided for in the lease), together with applicable taxes and charges. The court\u2019s June 9, 2008 judgment entry states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-7\">{\u00b6 <em>rjy </em>\u00abrpjjg Qour\u00bf gnc[s fhat plaintiff is entitled to damages by way of rents, attorney fees, taxes, insurance, and shopping center expense pro-ration. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cPursuant to the lease judgment of reasonable attorney fees to Plaintiff and against Defendant is granted with the amount to be determined based upon evidence to be presented under this case, Case No. 2007CV00522 and 2007CV00240. Case No. 2007CV0522 and this case are consolidated for the purpose of attorney fees due in the interest of judicial economy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court further found that the landlord had not violated its duty to mitigate damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">{\u00b6 10} The trial court, by a judgment entry of July 7, 2008, awarded the landlord $209,312.99, plus accrued interest in the amount of $24,744.05, plus any additional accrued interest from the date of the judgment entry. Landry\u2019s was ordered to pay all costs and the landlord\u2019s attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">{\u00b6 11} On July 18 and July 25, 2008, the trial court held hearings on the issue of attorney fees. By a judgment entry of September 12, 2008, the trial court awarded the landlord attorney fees in the amount of $147,632.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>{\u00b6 12} By a judgment entry of March 9, 2009, this court determined that the tenant was not a holdover tenant as defined in the lease and by case law and that the trial court had erred in using the holdover clause of the lease as the basis of its computation of damages. This court affirmed the trial court\u2019s holding as to all the assignments of error pertaining to the tenant\u2019s and guarantor\u2019s liability, but remanded the matter to the trial court to recompute damages. See <em>The Strip Delaware, L.L.C. v. Landry\u2019s Restaurants, Inc., </em>Stark App. Nos. 2008 CA 00146 and 2008 CA 00160, 2009-Ohio-1106, 2009 WL 638516.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">{\u00b6 13} By a judgment entry of August 3, 2009, this court reversed the trial court\u2019s September 12, 2008 judgment entry holding that the landlord was not entitled to attorney fees relative to the original declaratory-judgment action against the tenant. See <em>Stark Commons Ltd. v. Landry\u2019s Seafood House-Ohio, Inc., </em>Stark App. No. 2008 CA 00206, 2009-Ohio-3847, 2009 WL 2372143.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">{\u00b6 14} By a judgment entry of April 23, 2010, the trial court found the landlord to be the prevailing party for the purposes of awarding attorney fees and ordered Landry\u2019s to pay attorney fees of $133,908.66 plus interest at the rate of 18 percent per the terms of the lease. The landlord had requested attorney fees of $140,735.41, which amount did not include fees related to the original declaratory-judgment action. The trial court reduced the fees requested by dividing the specific fees relating to the March 9, 2009 appeal to this court, in which Landry\u2019s was partially successful on the issue of holdover tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">{\u00b6 15} By a judgment entry of May 14, 2010, the trial court, upon motion of the landlord, ordered payment on the bond relating to the attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">{\u00b6 16} Landry\u2019s now appeals, assigning as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cI. The trial court erred to the extent it held appellant Landry\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. Liable for attorney fees, where neither the lease, to which it is not a party, or the guaranty agreement, authorize attorney fees against this appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cII. The trial court erred by failing to determine that Strip Delaware was not a \u2018prevailing\u2019 party with respect to the appeal in case No. 2008-CA-00146 and 00160, nor in case No. 2009-CA-00206, before this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-10\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cHI. The trial court erred by determining that Strip Delaware was a prevailing party with respect to the attorney fee hearing of July 18 and 25, 2008, where as a result of this court\u2019s decision in case No. 2008-CA-00206, Strip Delaware was not a prevailing party at that hearing insofar as it sought attorney fees for the declaratory judgment action, and this action should be remanded for a reduction in the attorney fees allowable with respect to that proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>{\u00b6 20} \u201cIV. The trial court erred where it determined that Strip Delaware is entitled to eighteen percent interest upon unpaid attorney fees, and by failing to hold that interest begins to accrue only from the date of the judgment entry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-4\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cV. The trial court erred by ordering that Strip Delaware be paid $172,074.81 from appellants\u2019 bonding company where the bond that was on file was posted to secure the damage judgment and not a later attorney fee award, and where the damages judgment had been previously paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">I, II, and III</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">{\u00b6 22} Landry\u2019s first three assignments of error raise common and interrelated issues; therefore, we will address the arguments together.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">{\u00b6 23} Section 3.4 of the lease agreement reads,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-8\">{\u00b6 24} <em>\u201cSection 3.h Additional Payments.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(a) Except as expressly provided to be paid by Landlord, Tenant shall pay any and all rents and sums of money or charges required to be paid by tenant under this Lease (collectively the \u201cRent\u201d) promptly when the same are due without demand, set off or deduction. Tenant\u2019s failure to pay any such amounts or charges when due shall carry with it the same consequences as tenant\u2019s failure to pay Rent. All such amounts or charges shall be payable to Landlord at the place where the Minimum Rent is payable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">{\u00b6 26} Section 14.10 of the lease agreement reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-11\">{\u00b6 27} <em>\u201cSection H.10 Legal Expenses. </em>In case suit shall be brought for recovery of possession of the Leased Premises for the recovery of rent or any other amount due under the provisions of this Lease, or because of the breach of any other covenant herein contained on the part of either party to be kept or performed, the losing party shall pay to the prevailing party all actual expenses incurred therefor, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and court costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">{\u00b6 28} Pursuant to the above provisions, we find that the payment of attorney fees is included under the terms of the lease collectively as rent because rent includes money or charges required to be paid by the tenant under Section 14.10 of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-13\">{\u00b6 29} The guaranty agreement executed by the guarantor reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-14\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(\u2018Guarantor\u2019) hereby unconditionally guarantees to the Landlord * * * the full performance and observance of all the covenants, conditions and agreements therein provided to be performed and observed by the Tenant * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-15\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cIf, at any time, default shall be made by the Tenant in the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions required to be performed or observed by tenant under the Lease, the Guarantor will keep, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>perform and observe the same in the place and stead of the Tenant. Guarantor also guarantees the payment to Landlord of any monies payable by Tenant under the provisions of the Lease, or in connection with or arising out of any provision of the Lease, in law or equity, including, without limitation, any warranty, indemnity or covenant of Tenant under this agreement and this Guaranty shall be primary and not as a guarantor, and that in any right of action which shall accrue to the Landlord under, in connection with or arising out of the within Lease, the Landlord may, at its option, proceed against any judgment against the Tenant. The heading of this agreement and the words \u2018Guaranty\u2019 and \u2018guarantees\u2019 shall not be interpreted to limit the aforesaid primary obligation of Guarantor under this Lease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">{\u00b6 32} As guarantor of the lease agreement, Landry\u2019s guarantees the payment of \u201cany monies payable by Tenant under the provisions of the Lease, or in connection with or arising out of the Lease.\u201d The lease agreement provides, in an action to recover rent, that the losing party shall pay the prevailing party expenses, including attorney fees. Further, as noted supra, the lease defines \u201crent\u201d as \u201cany and all sums of money required to be paid by Tenant under the terms of the Lease.\u201d The lease requires Landry\u2019s to pay attorney fees, if it is not the prevailing party, and such fees are considered collectively as \u201crent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">{\u00b6 33} The trial court\u2019s April 23, 2010 judgment entry states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-7\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cFour appeals were initiated by the defendant, three which were related to the case sub judice. However, it appears that the defendant\u2019s only level of success on appeal occurred on April 20, 2009 in Case No. 2008CA00206 where the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision as to liability in the second appeal but remanded to recalculate the damage amount. As a result, the Court finds the only fees in question to be those on the appeal issue that was reversed. This consisted of the fees on November 25 and November 26, 2008 of $1,483.50 and $559.00; December 1, 2008 to December 29, 2008 totaling $8,888.50; and January 8, 2009 through January 31, 2009 of $2,722.50. The cumulative total of fees in question is $13,653.50.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-8\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cThe Court is reducing those fees for the appeal by fifty percent due to the Defendant\u2019s partial claim of success in the appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-9\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cThe decision of whether to award attorney fees rests in the sound discretion of the court and will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse that of discretion.\u201d <em>Moore v. Moore, </em>175 Ohio App.3d 1, 2008-Ohio-255, 884 N.E.2d 1113, \u00b6 81.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">{\u00b6 37} A prevailing party is generally the party \u201c \u2018in whose favor the decision or verdict is rendered and judgment entered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hagemeyer v. Sadowski </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 563, 566, 621 N.E.2d 707, quoting <em>Yetzer v. Henderson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>(June 4, 1981), 5th Dist. No. CA-1967, 1981 WL 6293, at *2. See also <em>Falther v. Toney, </em>5th Dist. No. 05 CA 32, 2005-Ohio-5954, 2005 WL 2995161.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">{\u00b6 38} The Eleventh District Court of Appeals has elaborated on this definition:</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">{\u00b6 39} The prevailing party is \u201c[t]he party to a suit who successfully prosecutes the action or successfully defends against it, prevailing on the main issue, even though not necessarily to the extent of his original contention. The one in whose favor the decision or verdict is rendered and judgment entered. * * * This may be the party prevailing in interest, and not necessarily the prevailing person. To be such does not depend upon the degree of success at different stages of the suit, but whether, at the end of the suit, or other proceeding, the party who had made a claim against the other, has successfully maintained it.\u201d <em>Lehto v. Sankey </em>(June 29, 2001), 11th Dist. No. 99-T-0137, 2001 WL 735898, at *7, as cited by the Ninth District Court of Appeals in <em>Moga v. Crawford, </em>Summit App. No. 23965, 2008-Ohio-2155, 2008 WL 1961216.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">{\u00b6 40} As set forth in the statement of the case above, on March 9, 2009, this court affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding as to Landry\u2019s liability, but remanded the matter to the trial court on the limited issue of recalculation of damages after finding that Landry\u2019s was not a holdover tenant under the terms of the lease. The trial court properly recalculated these damages. The trial court determined that Landry\u2019s was a prevailing party in the March 9, 2009 appeal on this limited issue and reduced the amount of the attorney fees specifically relating to the appeal by 50 percent. We find that the trial court acted within its discretion in equitably awarding less than the full amount of attorney fees relating to the March 9, 2009, having found both parties prevailed on an issue assigned as error in the appeal. Accordingly, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in determining the amount of the attorney-fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">{\u00b641} Landry\u2019s first, second, and third assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">{\u00b6 42} Landry\u2019s fourth assignment of error argues that the trial court, via judgment entry of March 22, 2010,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> erred in determining that the landlord is entitled to 18 percent interest upon unpaid attorney fees and in failing to find that the interest accrues from the date of the judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">{\u00b6 43} Section 3.4 of the lease agreement governs \u201cAdditional Payments\u201d and reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>{\u00b6 44} \u201c(b) Any payment due from Tenant to Landlord not received by Landlord on the date herein specified to be paid shall bear interest from the date such payment is due to the date of actual payment at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum or the highest lawful rate of interest permitted in the State, \u25a0whichever rate of interest is lower.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">{\u00b6 45} As discussed in our analysis and disposition of Landry\u2019s first three assignments of error, attorney fees fall within the definition of rent as set forth in the lease agreement. Therefore, the trial court did not err in applying the 18 percent interest rate as set forth in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">{\u00b6 46} The lease clearly states that the monies shall be paid when due. We conclude that the monies relative to the attorney fees were due on the date of the trial court\u2019s original judgment entry granting attorney fees, June 9, 2008, as set forth in the statement of the facts and case above.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">{\u00b6 47} Accordingly, the fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">{\u00b6 48} In the fifth assignment of error, Landry\u2019s maintains that the trial court erred in ordering payment of the bond on the attorney-fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">{\u00b6 49} The landlord sought payment on the bond, which had been filed in November of 2008, and the trial court ordered said payment. Throughout the pendency of these proceedings, Landry\u2019s has issued a number of bonds relative to the compensatory damages award in the amount of $300,000, and in the amount of $250,000 as to the attorney fees award.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">{\u00b6 50} Upon review of the record, Landry\u2019s has not demonstrated error in the trial court\u2019s application of the bond to the payment of attorney fees, and the fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">CROSS-APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">{\u00b6 51} On cross-appeal, Landlord assigns as error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-13\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cI. The trial court erred in failing to award appellee all attorneys\u2019 fees incurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">{\u00b6 53} The landlord asserts that the trial court erred in failing to award the entirety of attorney fees incurred. Specifically, the landlord maintains that it was the \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the terms of the lease and therefore is entitled to all attorney fees incurred in the defense of Landry\u2019s appeals in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-15\">{\u00b6 54} As set forth in our analysis and disposition of Landry\u2019s first three assigned errors, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the landlord was the prevailing party as to Landry\u2019s liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>and in then determining that Landry\u2019s succeeded on appeal in garnering a recalculation of damages, following'this court\u2019s determination that Landry\u2019s was not a holdover tenant. We previously found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in reducing the amount of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">{\u00b6 55} The landlord\u2019s assigned error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b864-7\">Edwards, P.J., and Delaney, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-11\">.
