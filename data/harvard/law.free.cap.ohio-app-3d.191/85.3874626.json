The trial court sentenced defendant to the maximum allowable five-year prison term. Defendant timely appealed to this court from his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-16\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-17\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of defendant and abused its discretion in allowing evidence not disclosed until the day before trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-18\">{\u00b6 3} Defendant engaged in telephone conversations with the victim while defendant was in the Clark County Jail. The calls were recorded. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>argues that because he was not given timely discovery of the recorded statements he made during those conversations, the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted the recordings in evidence and failed to order a continuance of the trial on defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">{\u00b6 4} At approximately 3:30 p.m. on September 8, 2009, the day before trial was scheduled to commence, defense counsel went to the prosecutor\u2019s office to ask about text messages between defendant and the victim that were referred to in the police reports. The prosecutor at that time produced two compact discs and said, \u201cI only have these.\u201d The compact discs contained recorded phone conversations between defendant and the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">{\u00b6 5} Defense counsel was provided with a copy of both compact discs by 4:30 p.m. Defendant filed two motions to continue the trial, one the day before the trial began and another during the trial. Those motions refer only to counsel\u2019s need for additional time to prepare for trial, and do not allege discovery violations. The trial court overruled those motions, denying a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">{\u00b6 6} On the morning of trial, following voir dire, defense counsel made the trial court aware that he had twice asked the bailiff to let him address the court regarding discovery sanctions and that he would like to do that. Defense counsel told the trial court that the state had failed to timely disclose the two compact discs containing recorded phone conversations between defendant and the victim and that defense counsel had not had sufficient time to listen to both compact discs and go over them with defendant; and for those reasons, defendant was requesting that the trial court exclude the compact discs as evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">{\u00b6 7} The prosecutor responded that the existence of the compact discs was disclosed to the defense, along with the fact that the compact discs were available for listening, inspecting, and copying, and that defense counsel did not take advantage of that opportunity until the afternoon of September 8, 2009. Defense counsel disputed that, claiming that the discovery he received mentioned only text messages, not compact discs, and therefore he did not know the compact discs existed until the afternoon before trial. The trial court, after referring to evidence that defense counsel \u201cdidn\u2019t know about these conversations any earlier than yesterday afternoon,\u201d ordered a brief two-and-one-half hour recess, from 11:00 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., to give defense counsel an opportunity to listen to the compact discs and discuss them with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">{\u00b6 8} When court reconvened, defense counsel indicated that had he been given notice of the existence of the compact discs earlier, he would have filed a motion in limine challenging their admissibility and requested a hearing. Defense counsel challenged the admissibility of the compact discs on relevancy, hearsay, and Evid.R. 404(B) other-crimes, wrongs, or bad-acts grounds. The state responded that defendant\u2019s statements on the compact discs put him at the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>scene, connect him to the victim\u2019s injury, and show his motive for committing the alleged crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court overruled defendant\u2019s objections to admission of the compact discs, finding that some of defendant\u2019s statements were an admission, but the court ordered the compact discs redacted to remove any reference to other crimes. During the testimony of the victim, Kaitlyn Murphy, both compact discs were played for the jury, over defendant\u2019s objection \u201cfor the reasons previously stated.\u201d At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, defendant renewed his objection to the two compact discs, which the trial court overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">{\u00b6 10} Defendant argues that he was prejudiced by the state\u2019s failure to timely disclose the compact discs and that the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to exclude the compact discs as evidence or impose some other appropriate sanction per Crim.R. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">{\u00b6 11} If a party fails to comply with Crim.R. 16\u2019s discovery requirements, the court may order the party to permit discovery, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances. Crim.R. 16(E)(3). It is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to decide what sanction to impose for a discovery violation. <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1993), 91 Ohio App.3d 611, 632 N.E.2d 1384. A trial court should impose the least severe sanction for a discovery violation that is consistent with the purposes of the rules of discovery. <em>State v. Thornton, </em>Montgomery App. No. 20652, 2005-Ohio-3744, 2005 WL 1714208. A continuance, upon proper motion, is a favored method to avoid prejudice that may flow from a failure to provide discovery yet ensure that the charges against an accused are tried timely and fairly. <em>State v. Chapman </em>(Sept. 9, 1994), Montgomery App. No. 14076, 1994 WL 567534, *4, citing <em>State v. Parks </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 150, 155, 590 N.E.2d 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">{\u00b6 12} In the event of a discovery violation, an inquiry into whether the court abused its discretion in its order must address (1) whether the prosecution\u2019s failure to provide discovery was a willful violation of Crim.R. 16, (2) whether foreknowledge of the evidence would have benefitted the accused in the preparation of his defense, and (3) whether the accused was prejudiced by the evidence concerned. <em>Chapman, </em>citing <em>State v. Parson </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 442, 6 OBR 485, 453 N.E.2d 689; <em>State v. Finnerty </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 104, 543 N.E.2d 1233. We have previously held that a trial court abuses its discretion when it denies a motion for continuance and provides only a brief adjournment on the day of trial for the defendant to examine the materials that the state should have disclosed earlier. <em>Parks; Chapman. </em>However, that outcome requires that the three factors in <em>Parson </em>and <em>Finnerty </em>be determined adverse to the state. <em>Chapman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>{\u00b6 13} Clark County Loc.R. 16 provides that \u201c[a]ll discovery shall be conducted in accordance with the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure and the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d Crim.R. 16(B) triggers the prosecutor\u2019s duty of disclosure when the defendant makes a written demand for discovery. The state contends that defendant failed to make a written demand. Defendant does not deny that contention, and the record fails to demonstrate otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">{\u00b6 14} Nevertheless, from the prosecutor\u2019s arguments when defendant requested a sanction, it is clear that the state had provided some form of discovery pursuant to Crim.R. 16. Paragraph (A) of the rule provides that \u201c[a]ll duties and remedies are subject to a standard of due diligence * * Therefore, the defendant was entitled to believe that the discovery he was given by the state was complete. Absent access to the compact discs containing recorded statements made by the defendant, which is required by Crim.R. 16(B)(1), discovery was incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">{\u00b6 15} The prosecutor contended that defendant had been made aware of the existence of the compact discs, a matter defendant disputed. The trial court apparently concluded that defendant had been denied the opportunity to timely review the content of the discs to which he is entitled; and to cure the problem, the court granted a brief recess of the trial. Such a measure is generally insufficient when a discovery violation has occurred. <em>State v. Parks, </em>69 Ohio App.3d 150, 590 N.E.2d 300. Neither does the measure relieve a trial court of its duty to determine whether a discovery violation has in fact occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">{\u00b6 16} We have previously criticized the Clark County prosecutor\u2019s office for failure to timely disclose the existence of recorded jailhouse telephone conversations. <em>State v. Davis, </em>Clark App. No. 08CA0117, 2010-Ohio-5279, 2010 WL 4311743. That failure denies a defendant \u201cinformation necessary for a full and fair adjudication of the facts,\u201d to which he is entitled pursuant to Crim.R. 16(A), and reverts to trial by ambush and surprise. The facts of the present case suggest that a similar failure occurred here. The failure is not justified by the prosecutor\u2019s practice of waiting until shortly before trial to review those recordings. Neither is the problem cured by the trial court\u2019s grant of a brief recess on the day of trial in order for a defendant to review the recordings. The trial court abused its discretion when it ordered only a brief recess instead of the continuance of the trial that defendant requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">{\u00b6 17} The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe defendant-appellant received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Defendant argues that his trial counsel performed in a deficient manner because he failed to preserve the discovery violation for appellate review by renewing his objection to the state\u2019s use and admission of the compact discs during trial on the grounds that the compact discs\u2019 untimely disclosure required more than just a brief recess so defense counsel could listen to them. The error assigned is rendered moot by our ruling sustaining the first assignment of error. Therefore, we need not decide the second assignment of error. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">{\u00b6 20} Having sustained the first assignment of error, we will reverse defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b124-6\">Brogan and Froelich, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
