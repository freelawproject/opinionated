McMonagle, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant, Lawrence Marzett, appeals from his convictions for murder and felonious assault. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">{\u00b6 2} On November 13, 2008, defendant was indicted for attempted murder and felonious assault in connection with an alleged attack on 58-year-old Robert Moore. Moore died on December 17, 2008, and defendant was later indicted pursuant to a three-count indictment. Count 1 charged him with murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A). Count 2 charged him with murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B), and Count 3 charged him with felonious assault. All counts also contained notice of a prior conviction for felonious assault and a repeat-violent-offender specification. Defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">{\u00b6 3} On June 24, 2009, defendant filed a motion for the appointment of a medical expert at the state\u2019s expense to examine Moore\u2019s medical records. Defendant asserted that there was a particularized need for the expert in order to determine whether Moore died due to blows sustained in the altercation or due to his past medical problems. The trial court denied this request. The court found defendant\u2019s claim of indigence to be of \u201cquestionable credibility,\u201d since defendant had retained counsel and since the motion was filed within three business days of trial. The court also determined that defendant had not demonstrated a particularized need for the expert and had instead offered mere speculation as to the need for this expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">{\u00b6 4} Defendant waived his right to a jury trial on Counts 2 and 3 and the specifications and notice of prior conviction attendant to Count 1. The hybrid jury and bench trial commenced on June 29, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>{\u00b6 5} The state\u2019s evidence demonstrated that at around noon on October 23, 2008, Moore was walking on Euclid Avenue. Video surveillance from the Noble Drive Thru shows that Moore was approached by Kent Fletcher, who was with defendant. The video further shows that defendant and Moore had a verbal exchange and Moore then began to walk away.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">{\u00b6 6} The defendant then swung at Moore and punched him in the face. Moore, a former boxer, assumed a defensive stance, and he and defendant fought. The fight continued for several minutes, and as it proceeded, defendant took off his shirt. He struck Moore several times in the face, then pinned him. Defendant subsequently got free of Moore and fled. Fletcher fled in a different direction. As shown on the video, Moore was not totally prone at the end of the fight. The video had several breaks, however, and according to the state\u2019s witnesses, the system stops recording when there is no motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">{\u00b6 7} Jeff Polk and Rodney Starks, East Cleveland Emergency Medical Technicians (\u201cEMTs\u201d), arrived at the scene in response to a call that there was someone in the street who was having a seizure. They intubated Moore and administered epinephrine and shock treatments to restart his pulse. According to Polk, Moore remained unresponsive. The EMTs administered the Glascow Coma Scale to Moore to quantify his eye movements, motor skills, and verbal ability. Moore received a 3 on this test, the lowest possible score, which signified that Moore had irreversibly ceased all brain function.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">{\u00b6 8} When the detectives located Fletcher, he was in possession of belongings discarded during the defendant\u2019s fight with Moore. Fletcher identified defendant as the person involved in the fight with Moore. Fletcher made a statement to police and also testified at trial. According to the statement, Moore approached him while he was with defendant and asked about drugs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant started to say something to Moore, but Moore became angry and told defendant that the matter was none of his business. Defendant then became upset and sucker punched Moore in the face. Defendant and Moore began to fight. Fletcher broke up the fight and continued to speak with Moore. Defendant complained that his lip was hurt and attacked Moore again. Defendant then choked Moore. Moore fell to the ground and defendant continued to strike him. Fletcher attempted to break up the fight but was unable to do so. After several minutes of beating Moore, defendant fled toward Noble Road. According to the oral statement, Fletcher did not know that Moore was badly hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">{\u00b6 9} Fletcher testified that he ran into defendant on his way to the Noble Road Drive Thru. Moore approached, and Fletcher tried to show him some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>thing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant told Fletcher to go. Moore told defendant to \u201cshut the f* * * up,\u201d and defendant then punched Moore in the face. Moore fought back and split defendant\u2019s lip. Fletcher and Moore walked around the corner. The fight continued. Defendant then fled, and Fletcher picked up defendant\u2019s hat, jacket, and glasses, which were left behind.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">{\u00b6 10} Patrolman John Donitzen testified that he arrested defendant and that defendant repeatedly stated that Moore had started the altercation and that he was afraid of Moore. Defendant additionally stated that after the fight had ended, Moore walked away.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">{\u00b6 11} Moore was taken to Huron Road Hospital. He was comatose and was later transported, via Life Flight, to the Cleveland Clinic. His relatives made medical decisions on his behalf. Moore was later transferred to the Hospice of the Western Reserve, where he died several weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">{\u00b6 12} Deputy Coroner Dan Galita testified that he performed an autopsy on Moore. Dr. Galita observed a healing injury laceration to the back of Moore\u2019s head, which demonstrated that Moore had sustained blunt force trauma to the head one or two months before his death. In addition, Moore\u2019s tongue fell back and obstructed his airway immediately following the assault. This impaired Moore\u2019s airway and his brain could not receive oxygen. Dr. Galita also observed a healing fracture to the rib. Moore died due to \u201cpost-traumatic hypoxic ischemic brain damage due to blunt force trauma to the head with subsequent prolonged ventricular fibrillation arrest.\u201d According to Dr. Galita, Moore suffered a prolonged lack of oxygen to his brain due to head trauma and this rendered him irreversibly unconscious. The manner of death was homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">{\u00b6 13} Dr. Galita further explained that Moore had an enlarged heart due to heart disease, fluid in his lungs, 80 percent clogged arteries, and a seizure disorder. Dr. Galita testified that all of these conditions could have caused death, some at any time, but that they did not, however, in his opinion cause Moore\u2019s death. Moore also had cocaine in his system. According to Dr. Galita, cocaine can produce bleeding in the brain, but it does not cause deep coma followed by cardiac respiratory arrest. In addition, according to Dr. Galita, the results of the Glascow Coma Scale administered by the EMTs demonstrate that Moore had, after the assault, irreversibly ceased all brain function.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">{\u00b6 14} Moore\u2019s daughter, Charese Krasacok, testified that her father never regained consciousness and that she and her sisters made medical decisions on his behalf. She admitted, however, that her father had preexisting heart problems and was a drug user.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>{\u00b6 15} Defendant elected to present evidence. He testified that Moore offended him by asking if he had something to smoke \u201cdope\u201d with. Defendant told him to get out of his face. Moore responded by informing defendant of his 15-to-20-year boxing career and that he would knock defendant out. Defendant felt Moore\u2019s words were threatening. Moore then \u201cflinched\u201d at him, causing him to believe that Moore was going to strike him, and defendant then struck Moore in the face. Moore then retaliated with a \u201cfour piece combination,\u201d meaning he hit defendant four times in the face. Defendant\u2019s mouth and nose began to bleed\u2014 he was spitting out blood. Defendant was upset. Moore said to defendant, \u201cYou\u2019re disabled now. I should have bust a cap in your a*</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">{\u00b6 16} Defendant then tapped Moore on the shoulder and asked if Moore was going to get a gun. Moore responded that he might, and then Moore hit defendant in the face. They continued to fight. Defendant denied choking Moore and testified that he did not try to kill him. Defendant fled when he heard someone say \u201ccall an ambulance. He having a seizure.\u201d Defendant said he ran away because he believed that Moore might really try to shoot him. At this time, Moore was sitting and looked like he still wanted to fight. According to defendant, Moore had a \u201cgood scowl on his face\u201d like a \u201cpit bull.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">{\u00b6 17} Defendant denied following Moore and Fletcher around the corner to reinitiate the fight. He claimed he was instead trying to make sure that Moore did not get a gun. Defendant said that he was trying to get away from the situation. He claimed that Moore resumed the fight. Defendant could not recall how many times he had punched Moore because he was in a rage.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">{\u00b6 18} The jurors presented a series of questions for defendant to answer, including what medication he was prescribed on the date the fight occurred, whether he hit Moore with anything other than his fist, whether he slammed Moore\u2019s head on the ground, and whether defendant felt he ever had any leverage over Moore in the fight. Defendant denied using anything besides his fist and said that he did not slam Moore\u2019s head on the ground and that he felt the fight was even.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">{\u00b6 19} The jury acquitted defendant of murder as alleged in Count 1, as well as the inferior degree and lesser included offenses of voluntary manslaughter and reckless homicide. The court found defendant guilty of murder as alleged in Count 2 and felonious assault as alleged in Count 3. Thereafter, the trial court sentenced defendant to a term of life imprisonment, with parole eligibility after 15 years for the murder conviction, and a concurrent eight-year term for the felonious-assault conviction. A three-year term of postrelease control was also included in the sentence for felonious assault. Defendant has appealed and has assigned five errors for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>{\u00b6 20} In his first assignment of error, defendant contends a violation of his constitutional rights occurred when the trial court spoke with the jurors after they finished deliberating on Count 1, before the trial court determined guilt or innocence on Counts 2 and 3 and the relevant specifications. Appellant seeks a new trial as to Counts 2 and 3 of the indictment due to the trial court\u2019s unrecorded discussions with the jury, which occurred outside of his presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">{\u00b6 21} Appellant requested, the state acquiesced, and the trial court permitted the appellant to select which counts of his indictment he wished to try to the jury and which to the bench. Specifically, appellant offered a waiver of his right to jury trial on Counts 2 and 3, felony murder under R.C. 2903.02(B), and felonious assault, along with some specifications. However, he at the same time demanded a jury trial on Count 1, murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">{\u00b6 22} This case involves multiple counts of murder and felonious assault that arose out of the same nucleus of operative facts. Additionally, the appellant asserted self-defense, a defense that, if factually proved, would have entitled him to acquittal on all counts. Indeed, the trial court\u2019s comments following the jury\u2019s verdict recognized that this was one of the potential bases for the jury\u2019s not-guilty verdicts on murder, voluntary manslaughter, and reckless homicide. Notwithstanding the jury\u2019s verdict, the trial court found appellant guilty of both felony murder and felonious assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">{\u00b6 23} We acknowledge that appellant, who ultimately invited this situation, has not raised or challenged it in this appeal. However, this peculiar procedural posture must be taken into consideration in examining the propriety of the discussions held between the trial court and the jury and outside of appellant\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">{\u00b6 24} An accused has a fundamental right to be present at all critical stages of his criminal trial. Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution; Crim.R. 43(A). <em>In re R.G., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 90389, 2008-Ohio-6469, 2008 WL 5182950.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">{\u00b6 25} At issue here is the regularity of the trial court\u2019s deliberative process. We are guided by Crim.R. 33(A)(1), which allows for a new trial in criminal cases when there has been an irregularity in the proceedings. Without disputing that an irregularity occurred, the state contends that this assigned error lacks merit for two reasons: (1) defendant did not object and (2) there is no evidence that the discussions influenced the trial court\u2019s decision. Neither reason is sufficient in this case to overcome the merits of appellant\u2019s arguments in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">{\u00b6 26} At least one court has held that an alleged irregularity in the deliberative process implicates a structural error that is not waived for failure of trial counsel to object and can be raised for the first time on appeal. E.g., <em>State v. </em>Davis, Clark App. No. 2002-CA-43, 2003-Ohio-4839, 2003 WL 22110297, \u00b6 54-55 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>(\u201cIt is a claim of structural error, since it challenges the regularity of the jury deliberation. Where structural error is found, prejudice is presumed; prejudice is not required to reverse a judgment tainted by structural error\u201d). In the absence of structural error, plain-error analysis would apply. Crim.R. 52(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">{\u00b6 27} As stated, the jury and bench trials proceeded simultaneously. Based on the evidence presented, the trial court instructed the jury on the affirmative defense of self-defense. While the jury retired to deliberate on Count 1 and the additional offenses of inferior and lesser degree, the trial court heard additional arguments from the parties on Counts 2 and 3. Again, the defense maintained that he acted in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">{\u00b6 28} The jury\u2019s not-guilty verdicts were announced in open court on July 6, 2009, after which the defense inquired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThey were instructed as to \u2014 if self-defense was the reason for their plea, I believe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">{\u00b6 30} The court responded: \u201cWell, they found not guilty, there was no separate interrogatory on self-defense, so I\u2019m not going to \u2014 I\u2019ve got no means by which to ask what the reason is, but I would imagine, though, your client is satisfied with these verdicts. He probably doesn\u2019t want to question them too much, I would think.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">{\u00b6 31} The court then discharged the jury and proceeded to deliberate on Counts 2 and 3 of the indictment. But prior to rendering its verdict, the court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cOrdinarily * * * I converse with the jury in chambers after any case regardless of what the verdict is. Counts 2 and 3 are still pending before the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-11\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cIs there any objection to the Court having that conversation under these circumstances * * *?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">{\u00b6 34} The state believed that the court would \u201cnot be influenced by opinions of the jury\u201d and had no objection. The defense likewise deferred to the court and did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">{\u00b6 35} The court, prior to conversing with the jurors and rendering its verdict, observed the following on the record: \u201cThe verdicts just rendered, it seems to me, are supportive in two possible ways. The first is that the jury believes the state did not meet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The second, though, is it seems to me that the jury found that the defendant proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, the defense of self-defense.\u201d The state then proffered a third speculative basis for the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>{\u00b6 36} The court told appellant that it expected to have its verdict \u201crelatively quickly\u201d but was \u201cnot ready to rule at this point.\u201d The record reflects that court was adjourned, after which the court apparently had its contemplated conversation with the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">{\u00b6 37} The record resumes approximately two weeks later on July 16, 2009, when the trial court found appellant guilty of felony murder, felonious assault, and a repeat-violent-offender specification, finding that appellant had previously been convicted of felonious assault. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court reasoned that self-defense did not apply because it concluded that appellant started the fight. The court also found that the victim\u2019s death was the proximate result of appellant\u2019s commission of felonious assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">{\u00b6 38} The communications between the trial court and the jurors during the court\u2019s deliberative process were not recorded. It can be gleaned from the record, however, that it was likely that the trial court would be engaging in substantive discussions with the jury about this case. Even the prosecutor\u2019s comments contemplated that the jurors\u2019 opinions would be discussed with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">{\u00b6 39} As previously noted, \u201c[t]his court stands behind the position that a trial judge should refrain from any contact with a jury in the absence of proper representation by both parties.\u201d <em>State v. White </em>(1989), 65 Ohio App.3d 564, 584 N.E.2d 1255, citing <em>State v. Maynard </em>(1987), 38 Ohio App.3d 50, 53, 526 N.E.2d 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">{\u00b6 40} In \u201cvery limited circumstances, reviewing courts have found a trial court\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>communication on peripheral matters with a jury to be harmless. See <em>Rushen v. Spain </em>(1983), 464 U.S. 114, 104 S.Ct. 453, 78 L.Ed.2d 267.\u201d <em>Sweet v. Clare-Mar Camp, Inc. </em>(1987), 38 Ohio App.3d 6, 526 N.E.2d 74. Because the discussions at issue were not recorded, we have no way of knowing what matters, peripheral or otherwise, that the court and the jury actually discussed. Id. (\u201cIn view of a silent record we are unable to determine the propriety of the court\u2019s words to the jury * * * \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">{\u00b6 41} Although the existing case law that prohibits ex parte communications between the judge and jury pertains to matters being deliberated by a jury, this is a distinction without a difference. The law provides for either a trial by a jury of 12 or a bench trial in which the judge acts solely as the finder of fact. There is no provision that would allow any collaboration between a trial court judge, who is acting as the fact-finder, and a jury of 12 in reaching a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">{\u00b6 42} We hold that the trial court\u2019s conversations with the jury outside the presence of the defense and while still deliberating its verdict on pending charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>is an unsupportable irregularity in the proceedings that merits reversal. Accord, <em>Sweet, </em>38 Ohio App.3d 6, 526 N.E.2d 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">{\u00b6 43} Accordingly, this assignment of error is sustained, defendant\u2019s convictions are reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings as to Counts 2 and 3 of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">{\u00b6 44} Our resolution of the first assignment of error renders the remaining errors moot and we make no determination as to the potential merits of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b223-8\">Jones, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Ah\">Dyke, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-13\">.
