Minear\u2019s motion to suppress. At issue is whether such exigent circumstances existed that the police were authorized to enter his home without a search warrant. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-17\">{\u00b6 2} On October 5, 2009, appellee was charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (\u201cOVI\u201d), in violation of R.C. 4511.191(A)(1)(a) and (h); speeding, in violation of R.C. 4511.21(A); and failure to stop after an accident, in violation of R.C. 4549.02. The charges arose from a hit-skip crash in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>which appellee rear-ended another vehicle and left the scene before police arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">{\u00b6 3} Appellee pleaded not guilty and filed a motion to suppress evidence. The court subsequently held a suppression hearing. Patrolman Jon Hurley and Sergeant Troy Beaver of the Streetsboro Police Department testified for the state. Appellee did not testify or present any evidence in opposition. The officers\u2019 testimony was therefore undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">{\u00b6 4} Officer Hurley testified that on October 2, 2009, at approximately 4:30 p.m., he was dispatched to the exit ramp off Interstate 480 at Frost Road on a call of a traffic crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">{\u00b6 5} On arrival, he spoke to a Mr. Geib, who reported that while he was driving on the exit ramp, a gray Volkswagen struck his vehicle from behind. Geib\u2019s vehicle had sustained damage to the right rear bumper as a result of the impact. He said that the driver of the Volkswagen had exited his vehicle and appeared to have been drinking alcohol. He briefly showed Geib his driver\u2019s license, but then left the scene before Geib could get the driver\u2019s information and before the police arrived. However, Geib took down the driver\u2019s license-plate number.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">{\u00b6 6} Geib gave Hurley a description of the driver and his vehicle, and told the officer that the man had said he lived just down the road. Geib also provided the officer with the man\u2019s license-plate number. The information provided by dispatch from the license plate, including the description of the vehicle and its registered owner, matched the information provided by Geib. The other driver was identified as appellee. His address was listed as the Woodland Apartments, 833 Frost Road, Apartment 502, which, as appellee had told Geib, was just down the road from the crash scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">{\u00b6 7} Hurley proceeded to investigate. He went to appellee\u2019s apartment complex to question him concerning his involvement. He also called dispatch and requested that Sergeant Troy Beaver respond to provide assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">{\u00b6 8} Hurley located appellee\u2019s Volkswagen in the parking lot. He saw that the front left bumper had sustained damage that was consistent with Geib\u2019s report. Appellee\u2019s vehicle had sustained damage that was more serious than that sustained by Geib\u2019s vehicle. Hurley said that he believed appellee\u2019s vehicle had sustained a greater impact, increasing the likelihood that he had been injured in the crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">{\u00b6 9} Sergeant Beaver testified that he met Hurley in the parking lot. Hurley advised him of the status of the investigation and pointed out the damage to appellee\u2019s vehicle. The officers then approached appellee\u2019s apartment and knocked on the door. They knocked and pounded for several minutes with no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>response. Beaver testified that they were concerned that something might have been wrong with appellee because the crash had just occurred, and although they believed he was in his apartment, he was not answering the door. As a result, Beaver asked dispatch to call the manager and ask him to respond so they could check on appellee\u2019s welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">{\u00b6 10} Hurley testified that he then began to knock on the windows on both sides of the front door. As he was knocking on the left window, he saw a male body lying motionless, face down, inside the apartment between the living room and the hallway. While they were pounding on the windows, the body did not move. Hurley could not tell whether the man was unconscious or injured. The officers had knocked on the door and windows for ten minutes before Hurley saw the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">{\u00b6 11} Hurley said to Beaver, \u201cThere\u2019s a body there. * * * They\u2019re not * * * moving. We need to get in.\u201d Hurley said that as soon as he saw the body lying on the floor, he told Beaver about it, called the information in to dispatch; and requested that emergency medical personnel be dispatched to the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">{\u00b6 12} Beaver testified that he saw the lower half of a body lying face down in the living room. He said there was no indication that the man was simply asleep. He said, \u201c[T]he person was unresponsive * * *. We knocked loud enough and long enough and hard enough where a person simply sleeping would have been alert, and clearly they were lying face down and, in my opinion, in duress and in need of attention * *</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">{\u00b6 13} Although the manager had not yet arrived at the scene, Beaver told Hurley to knock down the door, and he did so. Hurley said the officers then entered the apartment to check on the man\u2019s welfare. They tried to get a response from him by saying, \u201cHey, hey,\u201d grabbing his shoulder and leg, and shaking him. Finally, after about one minute, the man, later identified as appellee, awoke. He appeared intoxicated. A strong odor of alcohol emanated from his person. His speech was slurred. He had bloodshot eyes. He had urinated on himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">{\u00b6 14} Appellee kept saying, \u2018What are you doing in my house?\u201d The officers said that his car had been involved in a crash, he was not answering the door, and they were here to check on him. Appellee said that he had not been involved in a crash. A few minutes later, emergency medical personnel arrived. The paramedics walked appellee to the couch. He was unsteady and stumbling. Appellee\u2019s subsequent breathalyzer-test result was .222, nearly three times the legal limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">{\u00b6 15} Following the hearing, the trial court sustained appellee\u2019s motion to suppress. In support of its ruling, the trial court made the following finding: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>\u201cThe Court on these circumstances and facts finds no exigent facts or circumstances that would justify such an entry. There was no evidence of injury or emergency which would be necessary to protect an injured occupant.\u201d The state appeals the trial court\u2019s ruling, asserting the following for its sole assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-4\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cA de novo review of the law on exigent circumstances and the emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement using factual findings that are supported by competent and credible evidence in the record demonstrates that the trial court erroneously granted Minear\u2019s motion to suppress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">{\u00b6 17} The state argues that the trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion to suppress because the evidence supported a finding of exigent circumstances, making a search warrant unnecessary, based on the officers\u2019 reasonable belief that a man inside appellee\u2019s apartment was in need of emergency aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cOn review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, an appellate court determines whether the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by some competent, credible evidence.\u201d <em>Bainbridge v. Kaseda, </em>11th Dist. No. 2007-G-2797, 2008-Ohio-2136, 2008 WL 1934491, at \u00b6 20. When the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by competent, credible evidence, the appellate court is required to accept the trial court\u2019s factual findings as true. Id. The reviewing court then determines, without deference to the trial court, whether the applicable legal standard has been met. Id.; <em>State v. Jackson, </em>11th Dist. No. 2003-A-2005, 2004-Ohio-2920, 2004 WL 1238392, at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">{\u00b6 19} Accordingly, a reviewing court must defer to the trial court\u2019s factual findings only if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. <em>State v. Long </em>(1998), 127 Ohio App.3d 328, 332, 713 N.E.2d 1. We review determinations of facts only for clear error. <em>State v. Gillard </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 548, 552, 679 N.E.2d 276. \u201c \u2018A finding is \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d when * * * the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Prigmore, </em>5th Dist. No. 2005-CA-00115, 2005-Ohio-6952, 2005 WL 3547949, at \u00b6 15, quoting <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co. </em>(1948), 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">{\u00b6 20} The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 14, Article 1 of the Ohio Constitution require police to obtain a search warrant based on probable cause prior to conducting a search unless the search falls within an exception to this requirement. <em>Katz v. United States </em>(1967), 389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576; see also <em>State v. Totten </em>(Feb. 15, 2001), 10th Dist. No. 00AP-535, 2001 WL 125153.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cSearches conducted without warrants have been held unlawful \u2018notwithstanding facts unquestionably showing probable cause,\u2019 <em>Agnello v. United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>[(1925)], 269 U.S. 20, 33, 46 S.Ct. 4, 6, 70 L.Ed. 145, for the Constitution requires \u2018that the deliberate, impartial judgment of a judicial officer * * * be interposed between the citizen and the police * * *.\u2019 <em>Wong Sun v. United States </em>[(1963)], 371 U.S. 471, 481-482, 83 S.Ct. 407, 414, 9 L.Ed.2d 441. \u2018Over and again this Court has emphasized that the mandate of the [Fourth] Amendment requires adherence to judicial processes,\u2019 <em>United States v. Jeffers </em>[(1951)], 342 U.S. 48, 51, 72 S.Ct. 93-95, 96 L.Ed. 59, and that searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment \u2014 subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d <em>Katz </em>at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>State v. Stanberry, </em>11th Dist. No. 2002-L-028, 2003-Ohio-5700, 2003 WL 22427922, this court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe doctrine of exigency is an exception to the general, constitutional prohibition against warrantless searches. \u2018Exigency denotes the existence of \u2018real immediate and serious consequences\u2019 that would certainly occur were a police officer to postpone action to get a warrant. <em>Welsh v. Wisconsin </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 740, 751, 104 S.Ct. 2091, 80 L.Ed.2d 732. As such, a court will not \u2018excuse the absence of a search warrant without a showing by those who seek exemption from the constitutional mandate that the exigencies of the situation made that course imperative.\u2019 <em>McDonald v. United States </em>(1948), 335 U.S. 451, 456, 69 S.Ct. 191, 93 L.Ed. 153.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cThe United States Supreme Court has held that the doctrine of exigency applies in two separate sets of circumstances: first, police may commence a warrantless search and seizure to avoid \u2018the imminent destruction of vital evidence.\u2019 <em>Wong Sun v. United States </em>(1963), 371 U.S. 471, 484, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441. Second, a warrant is unnecessary where the police are faced with a \u2018need to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury.\u2019 <em>Mincey v. Arizona </em>(1978), 437 U.S. 385, 392, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290.\u201d <em>Stanberry, </em>2003-Ohio-5700, 2003 WL 22427922, at \u00b6 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>Mincey, </em>437 U.S. at 392, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290, the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-9\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c[T]he Fourth Amendment does not bar police officers from making warrantless entries and searches when they reasonably believe that a person within is in need of immediate aid. * * * \u2018The need to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury is justification for what would-be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or emergency.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">{\u00b6 27} For example, in <em>State v. Bugaj, </em>7th Dist. No. 06-BE-27, 2007-Ohio-967, 2007 WL 678480, the court held that exigent circumstances existed when the officer saw a man lying face down on the floor and not moving. Id. at \u00b6 22. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>court stated: \u201cBecause Deputy Stoffer did not know whether the man on the floor was dead or alive, whether he had suffered a drug overdose, or whether he had another medical problem, * * * exigent circumstances existed for Deputy Stoffer to enter the apartment.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">{\u00b628} In <em>State v. Williams, </em>8th Dist. No. 88873, 2007-Ohio-4845, 2007 WL 2729798, police officers responded to a call from the defendant regarding a disturbance at her home. As they approached the house, they observed through the screen door a motionless man lying on the floor a few feet from the front door. The officers repeatedly called out to the man, but he did not respond. The officers then entered the home. In affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the Eighth District held: \u201cThe warrantless entry into the home was justified because the officers were lawfully responding to defendant\u2019s call for help when they observed [her ex-husband] lying on the floor unresponsive. The officers could reasonably believe that it was an emergency and that [he was] in peril and in immediate need of aid.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">{\u00b6 29} Turning to the facts of the instant case, when Hurley arrived at the scene of the crash, he learned that appellee had just rear-ended Geib\u2019s vehicle, that appellee had appeared to be under the influence of alcohol, and that he had left the scene before police arrived. Geib had taken down his license number, which allowed police to obtain appellee\u2019s information.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">{\u00b6 30} Shortly after appellee left the crash scene, Hurley located appellee\u2019s vehicle in the parking lot of his apartment complex. It had sustained damage to its front bumper, which, according to Hurley, was serious enough to cause him to be concerned that appellee might have been injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">{\u00b6 31} Although both officers loudly knocked and pounded on appellee\u2019s door for several minutes, he did not respond, although, with his vehicle in the parking lot, the officers believed that he was in his apartment. Appellee\u2019s failure to respond in these circumstances caused the officers to be concerned for his well-being. Sergeant Beaver then asked dispatch to call the manager to ask him to respond to the apartment to assist the officers in checking on appellee\u2019s welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">{\u00b6 32} Thereafter, Hurley started knocking on the window next to the door, and while doing so, he saw a male body lying face down between the living room and the hallway. Despite the long and loud banging on the door and windows, the body remained motionless. While still outside, Hurley immediately called dispatch and requested that emergency medical personnel be sent. Beaver said that in the circumstances, it did not appear that the man was sleeping, but rather, that he was in distress and needed medical attention. Then, on Beaver\u2019s instruction, Hurley broke down the door, and the officers entered appellee\u2019s apartment to check on appellee\u2019s welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>{\u00b6 33} The foregoing undisputed evidence supported a finding that the officers were faced with exigent circumstances that justified their entry into appellee\u2019s apartment without a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">{\u00b6 34} We note that several factual findings of the trial court were not supported by and in fact were contradicted by the foregoing undisputed evidence. Specifically, the court incorrectly found: (1) \u201cSergeant Beaver * * * learned that the drivers had exchanged information * * * at the scene\u201d (Geib did not obtain appellee\u2019s information from him. Instead, he took down appellee\u2019s license plate number, and this is how the officers obtained appellee\u2019s information); (2) \u201cThe officers, through dispatch, attempted to contact a manager of the complex * * * to obtain a key, but were not successful\u201d (the officers knocked on the door before they asked dispatch to call the manager, and there was no evidence that they attempted to obtain a key); (3) \u201cHaving received no answer from the manager of the units, the officers pounded on the door * * * and got no response\u201d (the officers had not yet called for the manager before they started knocking on the door); and (4) \u201cUpon entry, * * * [t]hey saw no injuries or evidence of any injury\u201d (appellee was found lying face down, motionless, and unresponsive). Because these findings are not supported by the evidence, they are clearly erroneous and are not entitled to any deference on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">{\u00b6 35} Appellee argued below that the officers\u2019 true intent was to arrest him, rather than to provide medical attention. However, it is well settled that as long as the circumstances justify the officers\u2019 actions, their subjective intent is irrelevant. In <em>Brigham City, Utah v. Stuart </em>(2006), 547 U.S. 398, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 164 L.Ed.2d 650, the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-7\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c[L]aw enforcement officers may enter a home without a warrant <em>to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant </em>or to protect an occupant from imminent injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-8\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-9\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cAn action is \u2018reasonable\u2019 under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the individual officer\u2019s state of mind, \u2018as long as the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify [the] action.\u2019 * * * The officer\u2019s subjective motivation is irrelevant. * * * It therefore does not matter * * * whether the officers entered the kitchen to arrest respondents and gather evidence against them or to assist the injured and prevent further violence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 403-405, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 164 L.Ed.2d 650.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">{\u00b6 39} The circumstances presented here, when viewed objectively, justified the officers\u2019 actions. As a result, their subjective motivation is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>{\u00b6 40} Appellee argues on appeal that the officers were not justified in entering his apartment because any reasonable person finding him lying unresponsive on the floor would conclude that he was merely sleeping. However, Sergeant Beaver\u2019s undisputed testimony defeats this argument. He stated that the officers knocked \u201cloud enough and long enough and hard enough\u201d that any person who was simply sleeping would have been awakened. He also said that the lower part of the body was lying face down on the floor in the living room. Based on the foregoing, Beaver testified that he believed that the man was in distress and in need of attention. In light of the evidence presented, this belief was reasonable. In these circumstances, if the officers had failed to secure immediate aid for appellee, they may well have been defending a claim that they were derelict in their duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">{\u00b6 41} Contrary to appellee\u2019s argument, we agree with the holding of the Seventh District in <em>Bugaj, </em>2007-Ohio-967, 2007 WL 678480, and <em>Williams, </em>2007-Ohio-4845, 2007 WL 2729798, that exigent circumstances exist when police see an adult lying on the floor motionless and unresponsive. We note that appellee has failed to cite any authority for the proposition that under such facts, exigent circumstances do not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">{\u00b6 42} The dissent maintains that the \u201cpivotal fact\u201d that renders the officers\u2019 entry unlawful is their decision to call for the manager before they discovered the body. However, as noted above, the officers\u2019 subjective intent is irrelevant to the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">{\u00b6 43} In <em>Michigan v. Fisher </em>(2009), \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 546, 175 L.Ed.2d 410, the Supreme Court held: \u201cThis \u2018emergency aid exception\u2019 does not depend on the officers\u2019 subjective intent * * * when the emergency arises. * * * It requires only \u2018an objectively reasonable basis for believing,\u2019 * * * that \u2018a person within [the house] is in need of immediate aid.\u2019 * * Id., \u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. at 548, 175 L.Ed.2d 410. In upholding the warrantless entry in that case, the court noted that the officers observed the emergency <em>before the entry. </em>Id., \u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. at 547, 175 L.Ed.2d 410. The court held that \u201cthe officer\u2019s <em>entry </em>was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., \u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. at 549, 175 L.Ed.2d 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">{\u00b6 44} Further, the Supreme Court in <em>Brigham City, </em>547 U.S. at 404, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 164 L.Ed.2d 650, held: \u201c * * * An action is \u2018reasonable\u2019 under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the individual officer\u2019s state of mind, \u2018as long as the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify [the] action.\u2019 * * * The officer\u2019s subjective motivation is irrelevant.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Id. Noting that the officers saw a fight taking place in the kitchen and one man being punched, the court held that it was reasonable for the officers to <em>enter </em>the house because they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>had an objectively reasonable basis for believing that the victim \u201cmight need help\u201d and that the violence was only beginning.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">{\u00b6 45} Based on the foregoing, it is the officers\u2019 <em>entry </em>into the apartment, not their previous <em>decision to call for the manager, </em>that must be justified. The officers\u2019 decision to call for the manager does not have Fourth Amendment implications because the officers did not enter the apartment at that time. The officers\u2019 subjective motivation in entering the apartment is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">{\u00b6 46} The \u201cpivotal fact\u201d was, therefore, not what the officers knew when they decided to call for the manager, but rather, what they had seen when they entered the apartment. In fact, once they saw the body, the officers decided not to wait for the manager; instead, they immediately called emergency medical personnel and entered the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">{\u00b6 47} Therefore, because it is the entry, not the decision to call for the manager, that is relevant, and because the officers saw the body before they entered, the officers did not rely on hindsight to support their entry, as the dissent asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">{\u00b648} Next, we do not agree with the dissent\u2019s argument that the officers were not faced with an emergency. The Supreme Court in <em>Fisher, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 546, 175 L.Ed.2d 410, held: \u201cOfficers do not need ironclad proof of \u2018a likely serious, life-threatening\u2019 injury to invoke the emergency aid exception. * * * [T]he test * * * [is] whether there was \u2018an objectively reasonable basis for believing\u2019 that medical attention was needed * * *.\u201d Id., \u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. at 549, 175 L.Ed.2d 410. Thus, in order for police to invoke the exception, they need have only a reasonable basis to believe the occupant is in need of medical attention. As noted above, the fact that the officers saw the body lying face down, motionless, and unresponsive justified their belief that appellee needed medical attention and was sufficient to invoke the emergency-aid exception. <em>Bugaj, </em>2007-Ohio-967, 2007 WL 678480; <em>Williams, </em>2007-Ohio-4845, 2007 WL 2729798.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">{\u00b6 49} Finally, the dissent suggests that even if the officers had been entitled to enter appellee\u2019s apartment to render emergency assistance, their observations of his inebriated condition were subject to exclusion due to their previous decision to call for the manager. However, the case cited by the dissent does not support this argument. In <em>Georgia v. Randolph </em>(2006), 547 U.S. 103, 126 S.Ct. 1515, 164 L.Ed.2d 208, the Supreme Court stated: \u201cAnd since the police would then be lawfully in the premises, there is no question that they could seize any evidence in plain view or take further action supported by any consequent probable cause * * Id. at 118. Here, appellant was obviously in \u201cplain view\u201d because the officers were entitled to enter his apartment without a warrant based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>objectively reasonable exigent circumstances. As a result, testimony regarding their observations of his condition would not be subject to exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">{\u00b6 50} We therefore hold that the trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">{\u00b6 51} For the reasons stated in the opinion of this court, it is the judgment and order of this court that the judgment of the Portage County Municipal Court, Ravenna Division, is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b819-8\">Cannon, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b819-9\">Trapp, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b819-10\">Mary Jane Trapp, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ApGo\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">{\u00b6 52} The pivotal fact in this case, and to our analysis, should be that even before the officers noticed Jeffrey Minear lying face down in the hallway, they had made a decision to make a warrantless entry. Without any indication of any type of emergency or even the knowledge that he was home at the time, the property manager was called to open the unit \u201cin order to speak to the driver.\u201d Thus, I have no choice but to respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">{\u00b6 58} During the suppression hearing, the patrolman testified that he arrived at the apartment and knocked on the door \u201cso he could talk to the owner of the vehicle and see * * * what involvement happened.\u201d He further testified, \u201c[I] kept knocking on the door several times. Began to knock on the windows. At that time [his sergeant] arrived on scene. He also knocked a couple of times. He made a decision to contact dispatch and see if we could get management * * * to come to the scene <em>to see as far as getting in </em>to see if we could talk to the person who was driving the vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cAfter \u2014 while we were waiting for that person, dispatch said it would be about five minutes. While we were waiting for management to show up, that\u2019s when I stepped over to the left to look in the window and saw the body and knocked on the window and no response. Called dispatch again, and at this time have E.M.S. dispatched to the scene.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">{\u00b6 54} The sergeant testified that \u201cnothing stood out about the apartment itself,\u201d and the officers were on the scene for ten minutes before they observed the body through the window.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">{\u00b6 55} In these \u201cexigent-circumstances\u201d or \u201cemergency-aid-exception\u201d cases, there must be an objective inquiry into the circumstances leading up to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>decision to make a warrantless entry. The United States Supreme Court, in <em>Michigan v. Fisher </em>(2009), \u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 546, 175 L.Ed.2d 410, recently reexamined this line of cases, including <em>Mincey v. Arizona </em>(1978), 437 U.S. 385, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290, and <em>Brigham City v. Stuart </em>(2006), 547 U.S. 398, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 164 L.Ed.2d 650. It is apparent from the trial court\u2019s written opinion in this case that it, too, considered these cases before ruling on the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">{\u00b6 56} In <em>Fisher, </em>the police officers were responding to a disturbance complaint and were directed to a residence where a man was \u201cgoing crazy.\u201d Upon arrival, they found a smashed pick-up truck, damaged fence posts, broken windows, and blood on the truck hood and on the clothing inside the truck. Through a window, they saw the defendant throwing things and screaming; he refused to answer the door. When the officers pushed the door partly open, they saw the defendant pointing a long gun at them.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">{\u00b6 57} The majority in <em>Fisher, </em>in a rare fact-based decision, reversed the state court, citing the exigency identified in <em>Brigham City, </em>547 U.S. 398, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 164 L.Ed.2d 650, i.e., \u201cthe need to assist persons who are seriously injured or threatened with such injury.\u201d <em>Fisher, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. at 548, 175 L.Ed.2d 410. It noted that the emergency-aid exception does not depend on the subjective intent of the police officers or the seriousness of the crime being investigated. Rather, \u201c[i]t requires only \u2018an objectively reasonable basis for believing\u2019 * * * that \u2018a person within [the house] is in need of immediate aid.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">{\u00b6 58} The objective facts presented to the police officers in <em>Fisher </em>and in <em>Brigham before </em>they made a decision to enter a private residence without a warrant were quite similar and striking: a report of a disturbance, signs of injury, and sounds of ongoing violent or threatening behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">{\u00b6 59} There were no such objective compelling facts in this case, and I find that there was competent, credible evidence supporting the factual findings of the trial court that on these facts, no exigent circumstances justified the decision to call the property manager to gain entry. When the officers made this decision, there was simply no evidence of an injury or an emergency before them.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">{\u00b6 60} The question is what emergency was confronting the officers when the decision was made to call the manager to gain entry? Indeed, the driver of the first vehicle had told the officer at the scene that both drivers were uninjured. The officer was aware of Minear\u2019s address, arrived at the address, and found the suspect\u2019s vehicle. There was \u201cminimal to moderate damage\u201d to both cars. When repeated knocking on the suspect\u2019s door and windows \u201ca good half a dozen to ten times\u201d provoked no response, and knowing that a possibly impaired driver was now off the road, the officers could have returned after securing a warrant. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>the decision was made to call the manager and wait for the manager to arrive in order to make a warrantless entry. It was only while waiting for another ten minutes to gain entry that the officer then observed Minear lying face down on the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">{\u00b6 61} As <em>Fisher </em>explained, it is not what the officer believed, but whether there was \u201can objectively reasonable basis for believing\u201d that \u201csomeone was in need of medical assistance or in danger\u201d when the decision was made to summon the manager to gain entry. Just as the court found that \u201c[i]t was error for the Michigan Court of Appeals to replace that objective inquiry into appearances with its hindsight determination that there was in fact no emergency,\u201d <em>Fisher, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. at 549, 175 L.Ed.2d 410, the corollary is also true. It would be error to replace objective inquiry into appearances with both the officers\u2019 and this majority\u2019s hindsight determination that the decision to enter without securing a warrant made before the officer saw a person on the floor was excused because he did see a person on the floor and rightly made the decision to force entry to check on the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">{\u00b6 62} During oral argument, the state asserted that if the trial court\u2019s decision stands, a police officer seeing a body lying face down on a floor will be caught in a \u201cCatch-22\u201d: enter to offer aid and then later have a trial court suppress any evidence found after the warrantless entry and further face a tort claim because of the warrantless entry, or not enter to offer aid and then face a tort claim for not coming to the aid of an injured person.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">{\u00b6 63} First \u201c ![i]t would be silly to suggest that the police would commit a tort by entering * * * to determine whether violence (or threat of violence) has just occurred or is about to (or soon will) occur.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brigham City, </em>547 U.S. at 403-404, 126 S.Ct. 1943, 164 L.Ed.2d 650, quoting <em>Georgia v. Randolph </em>(2006), 547 U.S. 103, 126 S.Ct. 1515, 164 L.Ed.2d 208. Second, officers will, of course, come to the aid of a possibly injured person and worry about the suppression hearing later. The prosecutors will then just have to rely on other evidence to make the state\u2019s case. Here, the state had the testimony of the other driver that it appeared to him that Minear had been drinking; that Minear had suggested to the other driver that they go back to his place to \u201csmoke a bowl and talk about this incident;\u201d and that Minear caused an accident. Such evidence is not optimal for a prosecution for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, but cases have been successfully made on such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">{\u00b6 64} The fact that Minear was found lying face down, passed out on the floor, after the decision was made to enter without a warrant cannot retroactively justify this decision made without any basis grounded in any of the exceptions to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against the warrantless entry into one\u2019s home. The trial judge in this case who heard the officers\u2019 testimony was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>convinced that they had an objectively reasonable basis for believing that an emergency existed at the time the decision was made to gain entry, and as the dissenters in <em>Fisher </em>wrote, \u201c[w]e ought not usurp the role of the factfinder when faced with a close question of the reasonableness of an officer\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Fisher, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. at 551, 175 L.Ed.2d 410.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
