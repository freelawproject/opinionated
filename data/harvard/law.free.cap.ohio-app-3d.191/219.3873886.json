Lee Jr., appeals his conviction from the Fayette County Court of Common Pleas for operating a vehicle under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>{\u00b6 2} On December 18, 2009, a trooper from the Ohio State Highway Patrol initiated a traffic stop of appellant\u2019s vehicle after observing the vehicle traveling 89 m.p.h. in an area with a posted speed limit of 65 m.p.h. After the trooper observed appellant\u2019s poor performance of field sobriety tests, the trooper placed appellant in his vehicle. Appellant admitted that he had been drinking that evening and submitted to a breath test, which registered at .240 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Appellant was arrested and charged with operating a vehicle under the influence in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) and operating with a prohibited alcohol concentration in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(h). Appellant\u2019s BMV transcript revealed that he had five prior OVI convictions, two of which were felony convictions. As a result, the indictment also included felony-enhancement specifications based upon appellant\u2019s previous convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant filed motions to suppress his prior OVI convictions and to dismiss the specification, which were overruled by the trial court. Following a jury trial, appellant was found guilty as charged, including a specification that elevated the offense to a felony of the third degree. Appellant filed a motion for acquittal, arguing that the evidence did not support the jury verdict. The trial court overruled the motion and sentenced appellant to six years in prison. Appellant timely appeals, raising two assignments of error. We address appellant\u2019s assignments of error out of order.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">{\u00b6 4} Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe trial court erred in overruling defendant-appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29(C).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">{\u00b6 6} Our review of a trial court\u2019s denial of a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal is governed by the same standard as that used for determining whether a verdict is supported by sufficient evidence. <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>Butler App. No. CA2008-07-162, 2009-Ohio-4460, 2009 WL 2762754, \u00b6 60. Whether the evidence presented is legally sufficient to sustain a verdict is a question of law. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541. An appellate court, in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction, examines the evidence in order to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would support a conviction. <em>State v. Carroll, </em>Clermont App. Nos. CA2007-02-030 and CA2007-03-041, 2007-Ohio-7075, 2007 WL 4555782, \u00b6 117. After examining the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, the appellate court must then determine if \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is \u201cproof of such character that an ordinary person would be willing to rely and act upon it in the most important of his own affairs.\u201d R.C. 2901.05(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>{\u00b6 7} R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) provides that \u201c[n]o person shall operate any vehicle * * * if, at the time of the operation, * * * [t]he person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them.\u201d Similarly, R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(h) provides that \u201c[n]o person shall operate any vehicle * * * if, at the time of the operation, [t]he person has a concentration of seventeen-hundredths of one gram or more by weight of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of the person\u2019s breath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">{\u00b6 8} The state also pursued felony-enhancement specifications for the offenses based upon appellant\u2019s prior OVI convictions. \u201cAn offender who previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of division (A) of this section that was a felony, regardless of when the violation and the conviction or guilty plea occurred, is guilty of a felony of the third degree.\u201d R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(e). \u201c[A]n offender who, within twenty years of the offense, previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to five or more violations [operating a vehicle under the influence and/or operating a vehicle with a prohibited alcohol concentration] is guilty of a felony of the fourth degree.\u201d R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">{\u00b6 9} There is no dispute that the state presented sufficient evidence to convict appellant of OVI pursuant to R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) and (h). Appellant was observed speeding along Interstate 71 in Fayette County and a traffic stop was initiated. The highway patrol officer observed that appellant\u2019s eyes were glassy and bloodshot, his movements were jittery and erratic, and a strong odor of alcoholic beverage was emanating from the vehicle. Appellant was unable to perform a one-leg-stand sobriety test and was placed in the officer\u2019s vehicle. Appellant later admitted that he had been drinking and submitted to a breath test, which registered .240 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">{\u00b6 10} Instead, in his second assignment of error, appellant challenges the jury verdict form and the evidence relating to the specification that elevated the offense to a third-degree felony. An interrogatory on the jury form asked the jury to determine the number of appellant\u2019s prior felony convictions of operating a vehicle under the influence and/or operating with a prohibited alcohol concentration. The jury concluded on the verdict form that appellant had five prior felony convictions. Appellant argues that reversal of the specification is necessary, since he had only two prior felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">{\u00b6 11} The state submitted evidence at trial indicating that appellant had five prior OVI convictions, two of which were felonies. After review of the record in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that sufficient evidence was submitted to convict appellant of the OVIs with the specifications as charged. The BMV record revealed that appellant had five prior OVI convictions, two of which were felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>{\u00b6 12} However, we are troubled by the jury verdict form and the jury\u2019s conclusion that all of appellant\u2019s prior convictions were felonies, which demonstrates that the jury was clearly confused regarding the nature of the prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>State v. Pelfrey, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 422, 2007-Ohio-256, 860 N.E.2d 735, the Ohio Supreme Court reviewed a case involving a defective verdict form. Pelfry, who was hired by Enviro-Test Systems to perform automobile-emissions tests (\u201cE-Checks\u201d), was charged with tampering with records for falsifying an E-Check form in exchange for a bribe. Id. at \u00b6 3. Tampering with records is a misdemeanor. However, the offense is enhanced to a third-degree felony if the tampering involved government records. Id. Pelfry was found guilty of the enhanced offense and sentenced to four years in prison. Id. Pelfry appealed, alleging defects in the verdict form. Id. at \u00b6 4. Neither the verdict form nor the trial court\u2019s entry set forth the degree of the offense, nor had the jury found that the records involved were government records. Id. Citing R.C. 2945.75(A), the Supreme Court found the verdict form insufficient to convict Pelfry of the enhanced version of the offense. Id. at \u00b6 13. Due to the omission, the court reversed Pelfry\u2019s conviction for tampering with government records and remanded the matter to the trial court, instructing the court to enter a judgment convicting Pelfry of misdemeanor tampering with records. Id. at \u00b6 15. See R.C. 2945.75(A)(2). See also <em>State v. Schwable, </em>Henry App. No. 7-09-03, 2009-Ohio-6523, 2009 WL 4756435:</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">{\u00b6 14} <em>Pelfrey </em>is inapplicable to the case at bar because the verdict form itself in this case was not defective. Our review of this matter presents a more unusual issue. Specifically, the form in this case contained the appropriate interrogatories to enhance the conviction. Unlike <em>Pelfrey, </em>error exists in this case because the jury\u2019s findings on the form were not reflective of the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">{\u00b6 15} The state suggests that since the jury was required to find only that appellant had committed one prior felony OVI to enhance the conviction to a third-degree felony, the jury\u2019s finding of five felonies implicitly means that the jury would have found at least one felony and, as a result, any error is harmless. We are unpersuaded by the state\u2019s argument, primarily due to the clear confusion of the jury in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">{\u00b6 16} The state submitted appellant\u2019s driving record as Exhibit 4 in this case. The prosecutor explained during closing argument that the BMV records reflect that \u201cthere are five prior OVI convictions, and included in those five prior OVI convictions are two felony OVI convictions in the Cuyahoga Common Pleas Court.\u201d Yet the jury remained confused about the document and the distinction between a felony and misdemeanor. The jury was given no guidance by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>prosecution, the defense, or the court regarding how to interpret the BMV record or how a felony is distinguished from a misdemeanor in the BMV record.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">{\u00b6 17} We cannot accept a jury verdict form when the findings to the interrogatories on the form are not supported by the evidence in the record. Although the evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s convictions for OVI with the specification, the jury was clearly confused regarding appellant\u2019s prior felony OVI convictions, which resulted in an inaccurate and inconsistent jury verdict. Specifically, the jury\u2019s finding of five prior felony OVI convictions is not supported by the evidence. The jury was clearly confused regarding the distinction between a felony and a misdemeanor and how many of appellant\u2019s previous convictions were felonies. As a further result, we cannot accept the state\u2019s argument urging us to conclude that the jury implicitly found at least one felony because we do not know, nor do we wish to speculate, whether the jury would have found the presence of any felonies when weighing the evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">{\u00b6 18} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained. We reverse the conviction based upon the inaccurate and inconsistent findings of the felony-enhancement specifications and remand the matter for a new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>State v. Huckabee, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 88458, 2004-Ohio-5593, 2004 WL 2361817, \u00b6 34, 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">{\u00b6 19} Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cThe trial court erred in permitting plaintiff-appellee to introduce an improperly certified Bureau of Motor Vehicles transcript as evidence of defendant-appellant\u2019s prior convictions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">{\u00b621} In his first assignment of error, appellant challenges the BMV transcript offered as evidence of his prior convictions. Appellant argues that the transcript was neither properly certified nor sufficient to be self-authenticating because it was not authenticated by a five witness and did not contain a notarization, signature, or affidavit from an individual at the BMV.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">{\u00b6 22} Although we have already found reversible error under appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, we shall nevertheless address this assignment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>error because the issue at hand is capable of repetition, yet evading review. See <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Ronan, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 17, 2009-Ohio-5947, 918 N.E.2d 515, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus. An appellate court will not disturb evidentiary rulings absent an abuse of discretion that produced a material prejudice to the aggrieved party. <em>State v. Roberts, </em>156 Ohio App.3d 352, 2004-Ohio-962, 805 N.E.2d 594, \u00b6 14. An abuse of discretion is more than an error of judgment; it means that the trial court was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable in its ruling. <em>State v. Jackson, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, \u00b6 181. When applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, an appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621, 614 N.E.2d 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">{\u00b6 24} R.C. 2945.75(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(1) Whenever in any case it is necessary to prove a prior conviction, a certified copy of the entry of judgment in such prior conviction together with evidence sufficient to identify the defendant named in the entry as the offender in the case at bar, is sufficient to prove such prior conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(2) Whenever in any case it is necessary to prove a prior conviction of an offense for which the registrar of motor vehicles maintains a record, a certified copy of the record that shows the name, date of birth, and social security number of the accused is prima-facie evidence of the identity of the accused and primafacie evidence of all prior convictions shown on the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">(\u00b6 27} Evid.R. 901 provides that authentication or identification of a piece of evidence is a condition precedent to the admissibility of that evidence. Evid.R. 902 lists certain items that are self-authenticating so as to negate the need for any extrinsic evidence in support of the item\u2019s admissibility. An item that is not self-authenticating must be properly authenticated by other means.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">{\u00b6 28} The issue in this case is similar to the situation in <em>State v. McCallum, </em>Medina App. No. 08CA0037-M, 2009-Ohio-1424, 2009 WL 805805. Like the case at bar, McCallum was charged with a fourth-degree-felony OVI for being previously convicted of five similar offenses within the past 20 years. Id. at \u00b6 4. As evidence of her previous convictions, the prosecution submitted a \u201ccopy of McCallum\u2019s driving record and a copy of a cover sheet signed by Mike Rankin and marked \u2018Driver Record Certification.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 22. The <em>McCallum </em>court found, \u201cRankin indicates on the cover page that he is the Registrar and custodian of the files and records for the BMV and that \u2018the attached documents are true and accurate copies of the records in [his] custody.\u2019 Yet Exhibit 2 is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>notarized and does not contain an official seal. * * * Moreover, Rankin did not testify at trial. * * * Exhibit 2 was not self-authenticating because it lacked a seal, notarization, or affidavit attesting to its authenticity. * * * [T]he State only introduced a photocopy of the document. * * * [N]o one from the BMV testified. The State introduced Exhibit 2 through the testimony of Deputy Seiberling. Deputy Seiberling was in no position to attest to Exhibit 2\u2019s authenticity or propriety because he had no personal knowledge of the contents of the exhibit. See Evid.R. 901 (providing that an item may be authenticated through the testimony of a witness with knowledge). Accordingly, the trial court erred in admitting Exhibit 2.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">{\u00b6 29} Appellant\u2019s BMV transcript in this case contains similar deficiencies. The transcript in this case is accompanied by a cover page stating that \u201c[t]his certifies that a search has been made of the files and records of the Ohio Registrar of Motor Vehicles; that the attached documents are true and accurate copies of the files or records of the Registrar; and that the Registrar\u2019s official seal has been affixed in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code (R.C.) 4501.34(A), which states in part: \u2018[The Registrar] shall adopt a seal bearing the inscription: Motor Vehicle Registrar of Ohio. The seal shall be affixed to all writs and authenticated copies of records, when it has been so attached, such copies shall be received in evidence with the same effect as other public records. All courts shall take judicial notice of the seal.\u2019 \u201d Further, the cover page contains an official seal, which was printed on the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">{\u00b6 30} However, no individual or employee of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles is identified on the document as certifying the record and there is no signature, notarization, or affidavit attesting to the record\u2019s authenticity. The cover page contains a notation indicating that the record may have been created \u201cBy: TVNSICKL.\u201d Yet no further information is given to suggest the identity of this individual, the individual\u2019s position at the BMV, or the individual\u2019s knowledge of appellant\u2019s driving record. Absent such information and a signature attesting to the record\u2019s authenticity, the document does not qualify as a certified record under R.C. 2945.75(B). Moreover, R.C. 4501.34(A) allows for BMV records to be admitted into evidence, but it similarly requires that these records be \u201cauthenticated.\u201d Without identification of an individual attesting to the record\u2019s authenticity or a signature providing for the records authenticity, no \u201cauthentication\u201d exists. See Evid.R. 901. Like the state in <em>McCollum, </em>the prosecution in this case attempted to introduce appellant\u2019s BMV record through the testimony of the arresting officer, but, as in <em>McCollum, </em>the officer is not an individual capable of authenticating the record because he had no personal knowledge of the contents of the exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>{\u00b6 31} Further, EvicLR. 902 allows certain types of evidence to be admitted as self-authenticating. The BMV record in this case does not qualify under any category of self-authenticating evidence. The applicable provisions of Evid.R. 902 under which a BMV record could arguably qualify provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(1) Domestic public documents under seal. A document bearing a seal purporting to be that of * * * any State * * * or of a political subdivision, department, officer, or agency thereof, and a signature purporting to be an attestation or execution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(2) Domestic public documents not under seal. A document purporting to bear the signature in the official capacity of an officer or employee of any entity included in paragraph (1) hereof, having no seal, if a public officer having a seal and having official duties in the district or political subdivision of the officer or employee certifies under seal that the signer has the official capacity and that the signature is genuine. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c(4) Certified copies of public records. A copy of an official record or report or entry therein, or of a document authorized by law to be recorded or filed and actually recorded or filed in a public office, including data compilations in any form, certified as correct by the custodian or other person authorized to make the certification, by certificate complying with paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this rule or complying with any law of a jurisdiction, state or federal, or rule prescribed by the Supreme Court of Ohio. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(8) Acknowledged documents. Documents accompanied by a certificate of acknowledgment executed in the manner provided by law by a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(10) Presumptions created by law. Any signature, document, or other matter declared by any law of a jurisdiction, state or federal, to be presumptively or prima facie genuine or authentic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">{\u00b6 37} Subsections (1) and (2) of Evid.R. 902 both require an accompanying signature. As described above, the BMV record in this case bears no signature. Subsection (4) states that the record must be accompanied by an acknowledgement from a \u201ccustodian or other person authorized to make the certification.\u201d There is no indication on the BMV record that a custodian or authorized individual certified the record. The section also refers to subsections (1), (2), and (3), which require accompanying signatures. Subsections (8) and (10) refer to documents executed or declared by law to be authentic. In this case, the applicable Ohio law for authenticating BMV records is R.C. 4501.34(A). As previously discussed, the BMV record does not comply with R.C. 4501.34(A). Accordingly, the BMV record submitted in this case does not qualify as a self-authenticating document under Evid.R. 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>{\u00b6 38} We find that the trial court erred by admitting the BMV record. <em>McCallum </em>at \u00b6 23.
