Zeller, Inc. (collectively, \u201cCity Rentals\u201d), appeal the judgment of the Defiance County Municipal Court dismissing City Rentals\u2019 case against Rodney Kesler. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>{\u00b6 2} In the fall of 2008, City Rentals discovered that its former bookkeeper, Robin Bauer, had embezzled several hundred thousand dollars from the company. On July 29, 2009, Bauer was convicted in a separate criminal case and ordered to pay $200,000 in restitution to City Rentals.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">{\u00b6 3} During the commission of the criminal offense, Bauer forged several checks drawn on City Rentals\u2019 bank account and issued them to various people including Kesler. Kesler described Bauer as a neighbor and family friend whom he had known for over 30 years. Kesler also explained that between 2005 and 2007, he had lent money to Bauer on several occasions in the form of personal loans. Between June 2007 and July 2008, Bauer repaid some of the money she owed to Kesler by directly depositing checks into his bank account or making payments on his commercial and mortgage loans serviced by the bank. Kesler admitted giving Bauer permission over the phone to make each deposit or payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">{\u00b6 4} However, Kesler stated that unbeknownst to him at the time, Bauer made these deposits and payments using City Rentals\u2019 checks. Kesler explained that he never saw or endorsed the checks Bauer deposited into his account, and he further denied having any knowledge that the checks used by Bauer had been paid from City Rentals\u2019 funds. Kesler maintained that he became aware of Bauer\u2019s wrongdoing only when the police questioned him about the checks in the fall of 2008 during their investigation of Bauer. Kesler was never charged in connection with Bauer\u2019s crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">{\u00b6 5} City Rentals claimed that Bauer was not authorized to write the checks to Kesler. In addition, it is undisputed by the parties that Kesler never provided any goods or services to City Rentals. After becoming aware of Bauer\u2019s embezzlement, City Rentals notified Kesler that Bauer had forged the checks issued to him and demanded that he return the funds. Kesler refused City Rentals\u2019 demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">{\u00b6 6} City Rentals subsequently filed this action in the Defiance County Municipal Court, alleging that Kesler\u2019s retention of the funds constituted unjust enrichment. Kesler submitted his answer denying City Rentals\u2019 allegation. On March 10, 2010, City Rentals filed a motion for summary judgment. On April 10, 2010, Kesler also filed a motion for summary judgment. In his motion for summary judgment, Kesler asserted that the Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d), governed this case because Bauer had paid him with cheeks, which are negotiable instruments. Kesler maintained that because he received the checks as payment on an antecedent debt, he was a holder in due course under the relevant provisions of the UCC and therefore was under no obligation to return the funds to City Rentals.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>{\u00b6 7} The trial court subsequently overruled both parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment and stated that two genuine issues of material fact remained: (1) whether Kesler \u201chad no knowledge of [City Rentals\u2019] checks being deposited into his accounts and (2) the amount of [City Rentals\u2019] funds received by [Kesler].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">{\u00b6 8} Prior to trial, the parties stipulated that Bauer deposited $13,420 of City Rentals\u2019 money into Kesler\u2019s accounts. On May 20, 2010, the court conducted a bench trial. The only witnesses to testify were Kesler and his wife. On June 10, 2010, the trial court issued its decision granting judgment in favor of Kesler and dismissing City Rentals\u2019 case. In rendering its decision, the trial court concluded that the UCC, and not common-law principles, governed this case. The trial court further stated that it was \u201cconvinced that Defendant Kesler had no knowledge of Robin Bauer using money embezzled from the Plaintiffs.\u201d The trial court then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">With the evidence presented to the Court, case law mandates that Plaintiffs\u2019 case be dismissed, the Defendant having received payment of an antecedent debt in good faith without knowledge of the funds having been embezzled by the payer [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">This is not to say that Plaintiffs don\u2019t have further recourse as to the return of their money, as the Defiance County Common Pleas Court has already ordered the repayment of the money embezzled by their former employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">{\u00b6 9} On June 29, 2010, City Rentals filed its notice of appeal and submitted the following three assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-10\">The trial court erred as a matter of law denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment as there were no material facts at issue and judgment was a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">{\u00b6 10} In its first assignment of error, City Rentals argues that the trial court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment. Specifically, City Rentals contends that the court erred when it found that genuine issues of material fact remained that warranted the denial of City Rentals\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">{\u00b6 11} Generally, an appellate court reviews a lower court\u2019s decision to deny summary judgment de novo. <em>Doe v. Shaffer </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 388, 390, 738 N.E.2d 1243. Summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine issue of material fact, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and reasonable minds can reach but one conclusion when viewing the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party, and the conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party. Civ.R. 56(C); <em>State ex rel. Cassels v. Dayton City School Dist. Bd. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>Edn. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 631 N.E.2d 150. De novo review is independent and without deference to the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>Monroeville v. Wheeling &amp; Lake Erie Ry. Co., </em>152 Ohio App.3d 24, 2003-Ohio-1420, 786 N.E.2d 504, \u00b6 9. See also <em>Graham v. Drydock Coal Co. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 311, 313, 667 N.E.2d 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">{\u00b6 12} In order to prove its claim for unjust enrichment, City Rentals had to demonstrate that (1) it conferred a benefit upon Kesler, (2) Kesler had knowledge of the benefit, and (3) Kesler had retained the benefit under circumstances where it would be unjust to do so without payment. <em>Hambleton v. R.G. Barry Corp. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 179, 183, 12 OBR 246, 465 N.E.2d 1298. Specifically, at issue in this assignment of error is whether a genuine issue of material fact remained as to the second element \u2014 whether Kesler knew that Bauer was depositing City Rentals\u2019 checks into his account. City Rentals maintains that the trial court misconstrued the knowledge requirement necessary to prove an unjust-enrichment claim when it found that a genuine issue of material fact remained regarding this element. However, after reviewing the evidence before the court in favor of Kesler, as the nonmoving party, we find that the record supported the trial court\u2019s determination that summary judgment in this case was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 13} Moreover, even assuming arguendo that we find error in the trial court\u2019s determination that a genuine issue of material fact remained, the error is harmless and does not rise to the level of reversible error under these circumstances. The Supreme Court of Ohio has previously held that \u201cany error by a trial court in denying a motion for summary judgment is rendered moot or harmless if a subsequent trial on the same issues raised in the motion demonstrates that there were genuine issues of material fact supporting a judgment in favor of the party against whom the motion was made.\u201d <em>Continental Ins. Co. v. Whittington </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 150, 156, 642 N.E.2d 615. Here, the trial court conducted a bench trial on the same issues raised by City Rentals in its motion for summary judgment. The evidence adduced at trial demonstrated that there were genuine issues of material fact supporting judgment in favor of Kesler on City Rentals\u2019 claim for unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, City Rentals\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\">The trial court erred in the dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 case as the decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>{\u00b6 15} In its second assignment of error, City Rentals contends that the trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss its claim for unjust enrichment was against the manifest weight of the evidence. In raising this assignment of error, City Rentals appears to incorporate essentially the same argument from the previous assignment of error that the trial court misconstrued the second element of unjust enrichment. Specifically, this element requires a showing that Kesler had knowledge of a benefit conferred upon him by City Rentals. City Rentals maintains that Kesler\u2019s testimony demonstrated that he developed the requisite knowledge that City Rentals had conferred a benefit to him when the police informed him of Bauer\u2019s embezzlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">{\u00b6 16} A civil judgment \u201csupported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, syllabus. \u201c[W]hen reviewing a judgment under a manifest-weight-of-the-evidence standard, a court has an obligation to presume that the findings of the trier of fact are correct.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, \u00b6 24, citing <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273. The rationale for this presumption is that the trial court is in the best position to evaluate the evidence by viewing witnesses and observing their demeanor, voice inflection, and gestures. <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>at 80. \u201cA reviewing court should not reverse a decision simply because it holds a different opinion concerning the credibility of the witnesses and evidence submitted before the trial court. A finding of an error in law is a legitimate ground for reversal, but a difference of opinion on credibility of witnesses and evidence is not.\u201d Id. at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">{\u00b6 17} Although the trial court did not explicitly indicate that it relied on the UCC in rendering its decision, it is apparent that it followed the UCC doctrine of holder in due course in making its ruling. In particular, the trial court in its judgment entry dismissing City Rentals\u2019 case quoted at length from <em>Hinkle v. Cornwell Quality Tool Co. </em>(1987), 40 Ohio App.3d 162, 532 N.E.2d 772. In <em>Hinkle, </em>the Ninth District Court of Appeals held that \u201conly bad faith on the part of a third person receiving stolen money or his failure to pay valuable consideration therefor, will defeat his title thereto as against the true owner. Money and bank notes are the exception to the general rule that no one can obtain title to stolen property. A holder in due course of a stolen negotiable instrument can receive good title thereto and is subject only to the defense that he was a party to the theft.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. at 166-167.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>{\u00b6 18} Despite City Rentals\u2019 contentions that the common law should control this case, we believe the trial court correctly determined that the facts of this case fall under the province of the UCC. The payments at issue were made by eight checks written on City Rentals\u2019 account. Checks are negotiable instruments falling within the scope of the UCC, which is codified in R.C. Chapter 13. See R.C. 1303.02 (stating that R.C. Chapter 13 applies to negotiable instruments) and 1303.03(F)(1) (defining a check as a negotiable instrument that is a draft payable on demand and drawn on a bank). R.C. 1301.03 further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">Unless displaced by the particular provisions of Chapters 1301., 1302., 1303., 1304., 1305., 1307., 1308., 1309., and 1310. of the Revised Code, the principals of law and equity, including the law merchant and the law relative to capacity to contract, principal and agent, estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, bankruptcy, or other validating or invalidating cause shall supplement their provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Moreover, \u201cwhen the Ohio General Assembly has codified the law on a subject, the statute governs to the exclusion of the common law, unless there is clear legislative intent that the statutory provisions are merely duplicative. * * * There is nothing in the Uniform Commercial Code which indicates that the Ohio General Assembly intended its provisions to be duplicative of the common law it supplanted.\u201d <em>Baggott v. Piper Aircraft Corp. </em>(S.D.Ohio 1999), 101 F.Supp.2d 556, 561; see <em>Amzee Corp. v. Comerica Bank-Midwest, </em>10th Dist. No. 01AP-465, 2002-Ohio-3084, 2002 WL 1012998, \u00b6 46 (finding that where a company\u2019s employee forged company checks to pay her personal charge account at a bank, the company could not sue the bank on common-law claims for conversion, negligence, and unjust enrichment because the UCC governed the transaction).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">{\u00b6 19} Having concluded that the provisions of the UCC govern the parties\u2019 rights and responsibilities in this case, we must next determine whether the trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss City Rentals\u2019 claim for unjust enrichment was supported by some competent, credible evidence. Implicit in the trial court\u2019s ruling is its determination that Kesler was a holder in due course and, therefore, not subject to City Rentals\u2019 claim for unjust enrichment. Generally speaking, a holder in due course takes an instrument, in this instance a check, free from all claims and defenses with certain limited exceptions. <em>All Am. Fin. Co. v. Pugh Shows, Inc. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 130, 131-132, 30 OBR 443, 507 N.E.2d 1134. A person who is not a holder in due course takes the instrument subject to all valid claims, defenses available in an action on a simple contract, claims in recoupment, and certain other specified defenses. Id.; see also R.C. 1303.35 (listing the claims and defenses in recoupment).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>{\u00b6 20} In order to qualify as a holder in due course, a person must meet all the statutory requirements. <em>Arcanum Natl. Bank v. Hessler </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 549, 552, 23 O.O.3d 468, 433 N.E.2d 204. \u201cUnder UCC 3-302, a holder becomes a holder in due course if the holder takes the instrument (1) for value, (2) in good faith, (3) and without notice of any claims or defenses otherwise available to the person obligated on the instrument or various defects in the instrument.\u201d <em>Dice v. White Family Cos., Inc., </em>173 Ohio App.3d 472, 2007-Ohio-5755, 878 N.E.2d 1105, \u00b6 27, citing R.C. 1303.32(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 21} At trial, Kesler testified that he had known Bauer for over 30 years. Kesler explained that he and Bauer were raised in the same town, went to the same primary and secondary schools, and had been neighbors at one point. Kesler testified that his family and Bauer\u2019s family spent time together on several occasions because their children were roughly the same ages.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">{\u00b6 22} Kesler recalled that the first time Bauer came to him asking to borrow money, the loan amount was only $500. Kesler stated that Bauer repaid him in cash a few weeks later. Kesler then described other specific instances in which he lent Bauer money for her son\u2019s graduation party and to buy a car for her oldest daughter. Kesler maintained that in each instance the loan amount was somewhere between $500 to $1,100. Kesler testified that the largest amount he lent to Bauer at one time was $5,000, which Bauer needed in order to get a divorce. Kesler admitted that their arrangement remained informal and was never reduced to writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">{\u00b6 23} Kesler testified that he did not hesitate in lending Bauer money because he was aware that she was going through a difficult time with her marriage and, based on the first few instances when he had lent her money, he trusted that Bauer would promptly repay him. Kesler stated that Bauer had established a course of conduct in which she would repay him in person with either cash or a check written on her personal checking account.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">{\u00b6 24} Kesler recalled that after he had lent Bauer some of the larger amounts of money in the spring of 2007, she became less prompt with repayment. Kesler described specific instances in which he resorted to calling Bauer asking for some of his money. The following is an excerpt from Kesler\u2019s testimony at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0J\">Q: And so you had some discussion about, \u201cWhen are you going to pay me?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">A: Yes. As a matter of fact, one time, I had to, I got pretty verbal, that I needed my money. Me and my wife were going to do something, some other business, and I had to have my money. And that time she put one of the larger amounts, I don\u2019t remember the date of the check, but one time she put one of the larger amounts into the Huntington checking account. Because I went to the Huntington Bank to make sure that she did, before I left town.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Q: But you would just, after these conversations, direct her where to put the checks, or where to pay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">A: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">Q: You would say, \u201cJust take it down to First Federal and put it into my checking account.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">Q: And then' \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-9\">A: She would call me first, and say, \u201cHey, I have X amount,\u201d whatever that, say if it was Eleven Hundred Dollars, \u201cI have the Eleven Hundred Dollars, Rodney,\u201d and, \u201cWhat do you want me to do with this?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-10\">Q: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-11\">A: Because sometimes, I wanted my money right then, and a couple of times I drove back to Defiance, you know, prior to all this. And then I said, \u201cHey, just run it up to the bank and put it into my checking account.\u201d. My name is the only one on the checking account, so at First Federal, and that is when it first started, her going and putting something into my account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-12\">Q: And then, the times you would run back into Defiance to get the money, would she have paid you cash?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-13\">A: Yes. That or, there were a couple times when she gave me a personal check from her account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-14\">Q: And then you\u2019d check online?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-15\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-16\">Q: Your online banking statement doesn\u2019t have any images, imaging, of the checks that are deposited, or anything of that nature?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-17\">A: No, the only images it has are just my personal checks that come back to the bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-18\">Q: Okay, just opposed to sending you a bank statement, then, you can get online and see your checks that cleared?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-19\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-20\">Q: So you can reconcile your checkbook?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-21\">A: Right. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-22\">Q: But as far as deposits, it wouldn\u2019t show you a deposit slip and, like, a list of checks or currency that was deposited?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-23\">A: No, it just had, just a deposit, and like a slash mark, and then a date, and an amount. I believe it was about like the statements. That statement there has\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-24\">Q: Okay, So how would you keep track of the loan amounts, then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>A: Like I said, if I loaned her Five Hundred Dollars, for instance, she pulled back in my driveway and paid me Five Hundred Dollars back. So then she didn\u2019t owe me anything anymore, of course. You know, the next time she wanted to borrow some money, say it was one of the Eleven Hundred Dollar ones, she would come, and I would loan her the money, and within a few weeks, or sometimes a month, she would pay me back. Like I said I never got, or let it get out of control, or it never went a large amount of time, or it never went over the amount of the largest that we had loaned her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">Q: And that was the Five Thousand Dollars?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">A: The Five Thousand Dollars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">{\u00b6 25} Kesler maintained that when he was able to meet with Bauer she would pay him in cash or with a personal check. It was only on the occasions that he did not personally meet with Bauer that she repaid him by directly depositing the checks into his accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">{\u00b6 26} Kesler revealed that he was notified of Bauer\u2019s wrongdoing several months after Bauer\u2019s last repayment when the police questioned him during their investigation of Bauer. Kesler denied having any knowledge that Bauer had used City Rentals\u2019 checks to make repayment to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">{\u00b6 27} Kesler\u2019s wife, Melinda, was the only other witness to testify. Melinda described her relationship with Bauer as \u201cjust friendly neighbors.\u201d Melinda stated that she knew that Kesler had lent money to Bauer. Melinda expressed empathy for Bauer\u2019s poor marital situation and stated that she felt sorry for Bauer\u2019s children. Melinda further stated that she trusted that Bauer would repay them.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">{\u00b6 28} Based on the testimony elicited at trial, we find that the judgment of the trial court was supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all of the essential elements in this case. In reviewing the trial court\u2019s application of the holder-in-due-course doctrine to this case, we agree with the trial court that Kesler paid value for the checks in question. Bauer deposited the cheeks into Kesler\u2019s account as repayment for an existing debt she owed to him. R.C. 1303.33(A)(3) provides that \u201c[a]n instrument is issued or transferred for value if * * * [t]he instrument is issued or transferred as payment of, or as security for, an antecedent claim against any person, whether or not the claim is due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">{\u00b6 29} Regarding the second holder-in-due-course element of good faith, City Rentals presented no evidence that Kesler lacked good faith when he received the checks. See <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Camp, </em>159 Ohio App.3d 784, 2005-Ohio-926, 825 N.E.2d 644 (stating that good faith is defined as the absence of bad faith or dishonesty with respect to a party\u2019s conduct in a commercial transaction). On the contrary, Kesler\u2019s testimony indicates that he was completely unaware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>that Bauer used City Rentals\u2019 checks to make the repayments that she deposited into his accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">{\u00b6 30} We also find that the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s decision with respect to the third holder-in-due-course element of notice. In order to prevent one from taking as a holder in due course, notice of claims or defenses of the person obligated on the instrument must be acquired <em>at the time of the taking or the time the instrument is transferred </em>and not subsequently arising thereafter. See 71 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (2010), Negotiable Instruments and Other Commercial Paper, Section 322. Kesler was consistent in his adamant denial of having any knowledge that Bauer forged the checks she deposited into his accounts at the time she made the repayments. Furthermore, City Rentals presented no evidence at trial to rebut Kesler\u2019s testimony. After reviewing the record before us it is evident that City Rentals simply failed to present any evidence to overcome Kesler\u2019s defense that he was a holder in due course under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">{\u00b6 31} Moreover, although not mentioned by the parties, the UCC expressly addresses the liability of the employer in a situation, such as this one, in which an employee entrusted with the responsibility of issuing checks on behalf of the employer has committed fraud. R.C. 1303.47 (employer\u2019s responsibility for fraudulent endorsement by employee). This particular section adopts the principle that the risk of loss for certain fraudulent conduct by employees who are entrusted with the responsibility with respect to checks should fall on the employer rather than on innocent third parties. The rationale for this position is that \u201cthe employer is in a far better position to avoid the loss by care in choosing employees, in supervising them, and in adopting other measures to prevent * * * fraud in the issuance of instruments in the name of the employer.\u201d Official comment to UCC Section 3-405; see R.C. 1303.47. Notwithstanding the above, we acknowledge that Bauer was not a party to this case and that no evidence was presented at trial regarding Bauer\u2019s employment with City Rentals other than the fact that she was employed as a bookkeeper for the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">{\u00b6 32} Nevertheless, for the reasons discussed above, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss City Rentals\u2019 case, having found that its judgment was supported by some competent, credible evidence. Accordingly, City Rentals\u2019 second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. Ill</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">The trial court erred as a matter of law by applying the law of conversion in the dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 case when the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and entire case prayed for relief under the theory of unjust enrichment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>{\u00b6 33} In its third assignment of error, City Rentals claims that the trial court erroneously applied the law of conversion rather the law of unjust enrichment when it decided to dismiss its case. In raising this assignment of error, City Rentals\u2019 obfuscates the trial court\u2019s ruling. As previously stated, the trial court relied on the UCC holder-in-due-course doctrine when it dismissed City Rentals\u2019 case. A central tenet of the holder-in-due-course doctrine is that the holder in due course takes the instrument free of claims or defenses made by the obligor, in this case City Rentals.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">{\u00b6 34} Although the trial court in its judgment entry relied on case law shielding a holder in due course from liability on a claim for conversion, the same result is contemplated by the UCC regarding an obligor\u2019s claim for unjust enrichment against a holder in due course. Once a person has demonstrated entitlement to holder-in-due-course status, he is immunized from most of the obligor\u2019s claims and defenses, including a claim for unjust enrichment. See <em>Dice v. White Family Cos., Inc., </em>173 Ohio App.3d 472, 2007-Ohio-5755, 878 N.E.2d 1105, \u00b6 61 (stating that \u201c[t]o permit a claim for unjust enrichment when the UCC precludes liability is contrary to the \u2018delicately balanced statutory scheme\u2019 of the UCC\u201d). Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s reliance on a case addressing an obligor\u2019s claim for conversion is inconsequential to the outcome of this case because the same analysis is used when addressing an obligor\u2019s claim for unjust enrichment against a holder in due course. As a result, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss City Rentals\u2019 case on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">{\u00b6 35} Finally, in upholding the judgment of the trial court we are reminded of the following. \u201c[T]he Uniform Commercial Code is a delicately balanced statutory scheme designed, in principle, to ultimately shift the loss occasioned by negotiation of a forged instrument to the party bearing the responsibility for the loss. Ideally, the thief is held accountable. The unfortunate reality is that the loss is often shifted to the innocent party whose conduct or relationship with the forger most facilitated the risk of loss.\u201d <em>Ed Stinn Chevrolet, Inc. v. Natl. City Bank </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 221, 226, 28 OBR 305, 503 N.E.2d 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">{\u00b6 36} With this in mind, we overrule City Rentals\u2019 third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">{\u00b6 37} Having found no error prejudicial to the appellant herein in the particulars assigned and argued, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b520-9\">Willamowski, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b520-10\">Rogers, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
