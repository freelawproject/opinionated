Klem asserts that the trial court committed prejudicial error by failing to properly instruct the jury, refusing to allow a witness to testify, and refusing to dismiss jurors for cause. For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">{\u00b6 2} This case arises under the Federal Employer\u2019s Liability Act, Section 51, Title 45, U.S.Code, et seq. (\u201cFELA\u201d), and the Locomotive Inspection Act, Section 20701, Title 49, U.S.Code, et seq. (\u201cLIA\u201d). Klem alleges that during his employment with appellant, Consolidated Rail Corp. (\u201cConrail\u201d), the locomotive he was operating had an independent brake that was not in working condition and was not safe to operate. Klem claims that he was injured when he tried to release the defective independent brake. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Conrail.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">{\u00b6 3} On November 10, 2003, Klem, a veteran locomotive engineer, was assisting other Conrail employees in putting together a train for Marathon Oil at the Conrail facility in River Rouge, Michigan. While moving the locomotive, Klem noticed that the track switch indicated that the tracks were misaligned. Because of the danger of derailment, Klem needed to immediately stop the locomotive. When Klem attempted to release the independent brake, it became stuck and he suffered serious injury to his thumb.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">{\u00b6 4} Klem asserted that the independent brake malfunctioned when it locked up. He described the occurrence: \u201cSo I get moving up to about eight miles an hour and then I knock the throttle off, because I\u2019m seven, eight, I don\u2019t know exactly. * * * And as soon as I see it, I tried to slap on it [the independent brake] and it goes about that far * * * And I had a sharp pain go up \u2014 the pain was so intense in my hand I believe it passed my elbow. Not even sure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">{\u00b6 5} After the independent brake became stuck or got \u201ccaught up,\u201d Klem tried the brake again and was eventually able to move it into position to stop the locomotive. After Klem reported his injury and the trouble with the independent brake, several other Conrail employees came on board to see what the problem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>was. They were able to release the independent brake only with some difficulty. The conductor, Ralph Sturgall, had it jam up on him. The trainmaster, Thomas Szpond, and the engine maintainer, Roy Duhadway, tried unsuccessfully to work it. They also attempted to fix the independent brake. Because they were unable to repair it, the locomotive was placed \u201cout of service\u201d and \u201cblue-flagged.\u201d The records do not reflect whether the independent brake was repaired or replaced, but they clearly state that there had been some difficulty in using it. The problem was described in the written reports as a \u201chesitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">{\u00b6 6} Like the other Conrail employees, Duhadway could not recall details of the incident, but he acknowledged that someone else had written \u201chesitation\u201d on the form and given it to him to sign. Duhadway conceded that \u201chesitation\u201d could mean that the independent brake was not working normally.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">{\u00b6 7} Prior to the incident, no issues had been reported with respect to the locomotive. It had been inspected on a regular basis and all the paperwork was in order, suggesting no history of problems or issues with the independent brake. There remains some question as to whether the locomotive was actually repaired. Conrail\u2019s copy of the locomotive-inspection report noted that the locomotive was shipped later that month (presumably as a result of the incident) to Maryland for repair. Klem\u2019s copy of the report, which was given to him during discovery, contained no such notation that the locomotive was to be repaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">{\u00b6 8} As a result of the injury, Klem filed suit under the FELA and the LIA, alleging that the locomotive was not in working condition and was not safe to operate. Klem\u2019s amended complaint contained two claims for cumulative trauma to his back and other body parts and two claims for injuries arising out of the November 10, 2003 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">{\u00b6 9} Klem and Conrail filed opposing motions for summary judgment. Conrail asked that Klem\u2019s first and second claims, for cumulative-trauma injuries to his back and other body parts, be dismissed, asserting that Klem had failed to submit any evidence that Conrail was negligent under FELA or that defendants had violated any regulation of the LIA. Klem argued that the deposition of Dr. Todd Jaeblon raised genuine issues of material fact. Conrail countered that the deposition was speculative and conclusory and should be stricken. The trial court agreed with Conrail, dismissing Klem\u2019s first and second claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">{\u00b6 10} Klem\u2019s motion for summary judgment addressed the third and fourth claims, for injury arising from the November 10, 2003 incident, asserting that the independent brake was defective and that Conrail is strictly liable under the LIA. Conrail countered that the locomotive was not \u201cin use\u201d at that time and that the alleged defect did not create an unnecessary danger of personal injury. The trial court held that the locomotive was \u201cin use\u201d at the time of the November 10, 2003 accident and that the accident was the cause of Klem\u2019s injuries. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>trial court also held that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether the alleged defect created an unnecessary danger of personal injury. Therefore, the only issue before the jury, according to the trial court, was whether Conrail had breached its duty to keep the independent brake in proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">{\u00b6 11} At trial, Duhadway admitted that the locomotive\u2019s independent brake \u201cwas not working as intended.\u201d Asserting that the testimony reflected that the independent brake had not been functioning properly and was binding upon Conrail, Klem moved for a directed verdict at the close of Conrail\u2019s case. The trial court denied the motion. Klem also asked that the trial court include an instruction that mirrored Section 229.46, Title 49, C.F.R., a specific regulation concerning the condition of the independent brake under the Federal Railroad Administration (\u201cFRA\u201d). Klem argued that the testimony made clear that the independent brake did not \u201coperate as intended.\u201d The trial court refused to include that instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">{\u00b6 12} The jury returned a verdict in favor of Conrail. The jury also determined that Conrail was not negligent. Klem filed posttrial motions seeking a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (and in the alternative, for a new trial), and a motion to amend the complaint to conform to the evidence. The trial court denied both. Klem appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">II. JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">{\u00b6 13} In his first assignment of error, Klem contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe trial court erred in denying Klem\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v. on his Locomotive Inspection Act claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">{\u00b6 15} As stated by the Supreme Court of Ohio:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-10\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe test to be applied by a trial court in ruling on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is the same test to be applied on a motion for a directed verdict.\u201d <em>Osler v. Lorain </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 345, 347, 28 OBR 410, 504 N.E.2d 19.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>Ramage v. Cent. Ohio Emergency Serv., Inc. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 97, 109, 592 N.E.2d 828, the Supreme Court of Ohio set forth the standard for granting a directed verdict. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-12\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe strict standard for granting a directed verdict is found in Civ.R. 50(A)(4): \u2018When a motion for a directed verdict has been properly made, and the trial court, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, finds that upon any determinative issue reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>and that conclusion is adverse to such party, the court shall sustain the motion</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>Strother v. Hutchinson </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 282, 284, 21 O.O.3d 177, 423 N.E.2d 467, the court explained this standard: \u201cWhen considering a motion for a directed verdict, a trial court must construe the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe law in Ohio regarding directed verdicts is well formulated. * * * Thus, \u2018if there is substantial competent evidence to support the party against whom the motion is made, upon which evidence reasonable minds might reach different conclusions, the motion must be denied. <em>Kellerman v. J.S. Durig Co. </em>(1964), 176 Ohio St. 320 [27 O.O.2d 241, 199 N.E.2d 562].\u2019 <em>Hawkins v. Ivy </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 114, 115 [4 O.O.3d 243, 363 N.E.2d 367].\u201d See <em>Wells v. Miami Valley Hosp. </em>(1993), 90 Ohio App.3d 840, 631 N.E.2d 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">{\u00b6 22} A motion for directed verdict presents a question of law. A court shall not grant a directed verdict when the record contains sufficient evidence going to all the essential elements of the case. <em>Wagner v. Roche Laboratories </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 116, 671 N.E.2d 252. In ruling upon the motion, the trial court may not weigh the evidence. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">{\u00b6 23} Klem asserts that he is entitled to a judgment notwithstanding the verdict because of Duhadway\u2019s admission that the locomotive was not in proper condition or safe to operate. Klem argues that Duhadway\u2019s admission that the independent brake \u201chesitated\u201d establishes that (1) Conrail failed to comply with regulations promulgated under the FRA requiring that the independent brake \u201coperate as intended\u201d and (2) Conrail violated the LIA when it breached its broad duty to keep the locomotive\u2019s parts and appurtenances in proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury. See Section 20701(1), Title 49, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">{\u00b6 24} Conrail counters that Klem never pleaded with specificity any regulation under the FRA and insists that the only issue before the jury was Conrail\u2019s compliance with the broad duty of the LIA, requiring that \u201c[a] railroad carrier may use or allow to be used a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only when the locomotive or tender and its parts and appurtenances * * * are in proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury.\u201d Section 20701(1), Title 49, U.S.Code. Conrail asserts that Klem had to demonstrate that the locomotive\u2019s \u201cparts and appurtenances\u201d were not \u201cin [a] proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury\u201d and insists that Klem failed to do so. Cf. Section 229.7, Title 49, C.F.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>{\u00b6 25} We disagree with the argument set forth by Conrail, but also disagree with Klem\u2019s argument for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Duhadway\u2019s testimony must be considered as an issue of fact to be weighted, not as a matter of law; and as an issue of fact, it cannot then support a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">{\u00b6 26} Our analysis begins with the regulations governing interstate railroads and ends with Conrail\u2019s and Klem\u2019s arguments regarding their application to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">{\u00b6 27} The LIA, the FELA, and the FRA provide the guiding statutes relevant to the present case. At the outset, the LIA and FELA should be read together as companion statutes. <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio RR. Co. v. Groeger </em>(1925), 266 U.S. 521, 528, 45 S.Ct. 169, 69 L.Ed. 419. The LIA supplements the FELA by imposing on interstate railroads a duty to provide safe equipment. Id. Because the LIA does not create an independent cause of action for personal injuries, injured parties rely on the FELA to recover damages caused by an LIA violation. <em>Matson v. Burlington N. Santa Fe RR. </em>(C.A.10, 2001), 240 F.3d 1233, 1235. Although the statutes are closely intertwined, they have different standards. Therefore, they require separate analyses.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">A. The Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">{\u00b6 28} The FELA provides that \u201c[ejvery common carrier by railroad while engaging in [interstate] commerce * * * shall be liable * * * to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce * * * for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the [carrier\u2019s] negligence.\u201d Section 51, Title 45, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">{\u00b6 29} To recover damages under the FELA, the plaintiffs injury must occur while he is acting within the scope of his employment and in furtherance of the employer\u2019s interstate business. See <em>Green v. River Terminal Ry. Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1985), 763 F.2d 805, 808. The employer\u2019s negligent conduct must also play a role in causing the employee\u2019s injury. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">{\u00b6 30} Congress enacted the FELA as a \u201cbroad remedial statute\u201d to assist railroad employees when an employer\u2019s negligence causes injury. <em>Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Buell </em>(1987), 480 U.S. 557, 561-562, 107 S.Ct. 1410, 94 L.Ed.2d 563. The FELA is a \u201cresponse to the special needs of railroad workers who are daily exposed to the risks inherent in railroad work and are helpless to provide adequately for their own safety.\u201d <em>Sinkler v. Missouri Pacific RR. Co. </em>(1958), 356 U.S. 326, 329, 78 S.Ct. 758, 2 L.Ed.2d 799. The FELA is intended to be read liberally in favor of injured railroad employees. <em>Urie v. Thompson </em>(1949), 337 U.S. 163, 180, 69 S.Ct. 1018, 93 L.Ed. 1282. Under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>FELA, the employer\u2019s duty is nondelegable. <em>Shenker v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio RR. </em>(1963), 374 U.S. 1, 7, 83 S.Ct. 1667, 10 L.Ed.2d 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">B. The Locomotive Inspection Act</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">{\u00b6 31} Congress enacted the LIA to promote the safety of railroad employees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Matson v. Burlington N. Santa Fe RR., </em>240 F.3d at 1235. The LIA imposes strict liability on railroad carriers for violating the act\u2019s safety standards. Id. See <em>Urie </em>at 188-190.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">{\u00b6 32} The LIA differs from the FELA in that the LIA does not confer any right of action on injured employees. <em>Urie, </em>337 U.S. at 188, 69 S.Ct. 1018, 93 L.Ed. 1282. The United States Supreme Court has construed the LIA to be an amendment to the FELA, so that \u201cproof of [an LIA violation] is effective to show negligence as a matter of law\u201d under the FELA. <em>Urie </em>at 189. The prime purpose of both the FELA and the LIA is \u201cthe protection of railroad employees * * * from injury due to industrial accident,\u201d <em>Urie </em>at 191, and the LIA is \u201cto be read and applied with the [FELA],\u201d <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio RR. v. Groeger, </em>266 U.S. at 528, 45 S.Ct. 169, 69 L.Ed. 419. The FRA may promulgate regulations implementing the requirements of the LIA. Section 20103, Title 49, U.S.Code; Section 1.49(c)(5), (g), Title 49, C.F.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">{\u00b6 33} The LIA contains a broad duty to maintain equipment in good and safe working order: \u201cA railroad carrier may use or allow to be used a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only when the locomotive or tender and its parts and appurtenances * * * are in proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury.\u201d Section 20701, Title 49, U.S.Code. The LIA regulations also include this broad duty. See Section 229.7, Title 49, C.F.R. (requiring a locomotive and its appurtenances to be \u201cin proper condition and safe to operate in the service to which they are put, without unnecessary peril to life or limb\u201d); Section 229.45, Title 49, C.F.R. (requiring that \u201c[a]ll systems and components on a locomotive * * * be free of conditions that endanger the safety of the crew * * * \u201d). These two regulations impose upon railroads a general duty to maintain its parts and appurtenances. <em>Lilly v. Grand Trunk W. RR. </em>(1943), 317 U.S. 481, 485, 63 S.Ct. 347, 87 L.Ed. 411; see <em>Engvall v. Soo Line RR. </em>(Minn.2000), 605 N.W.2d 738, 739, fn. 1 (noting that the LIA \u201cimposes an absolute requirement that employers provide safe equipment\u201d); see also <em>Herold v. Burlington N., Inc. </em>(C.A.8 1985), 761 F.2d 1241, 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">{\u00b6 34} A railroad can violate the LIA by either (1) breaching the aforementioned broad duty to keep its locomotives\u2019 \u201cparts and appurtenances * * * in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury\u201d or (2) failing to comply with additional specific regulations issued by the FRA. Section 20701(1), Title 49, U.S.Code; <em>McGinn v. Burlington N. RR. Co. </em>(C.A.7, 1996), 102 F.3d 295, 298-299; <em>Herold v. Burlington N., Inc. </em>at 1246. See also <em>Hager v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>8th Dist. No. 87553, 2006-Ohio-6580, 2006 WL 3634373, \u00b6 31, citing <em>Mosco v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio RR. </em>(C.A.4, 1987), 817 F.2d 1088, 1091; <em>Reed v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co. </em>(N.D.Ohio 2004), 312 F.Supp.2d 924, 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">{\u00b6 35} It is the failure to comply with a specific regulation issued by the FRA that is relevant to our analysis. Conrail\u2019s broad duty to maintain equipment in good and safe working order under the LIA has already been addressed by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">C. The Federal Railroad Administration Regulation</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">{\u00b6 36} The FRA regulation provides that the responsibility for safe equipment precedes the use of the equipment. The regulation imposes upon Conrail a duty to isolate and identify problems with the equipment before it is used instead of imposing a duty to correct the equipment condition only after some showing of a problem that it knew about, but did not fix.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">{\u00b6 37} The FRA requires that all equipment be checked prior to use, and here, the trial court ruled that the locomotive was \u201cin use.\u201d Thus, it is presumed that the locomotive was checked before use and that Conrail is strictly liable for any defect discovered after the locomotive was put in use. Section 229.46, Title 49, C.F.R. provides: \u201cThe carrier <em>shall know before each trip </em>that the locomotive brakes and devices for regulating all pressures, including but not limited to the automatic and independent brake valves, <em>operate as intended </em>and that the water and oil have been drained from the air brake system.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, Klem needed only to show proof that Conrail failed to comply with a regulation issued by the FRA in order to show negligence as a matter of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">{\u00b6 38} Conrail argues that we cannot address whether this specific provision of the LIA was violated because Klem failed to specifically assert a violation of this regulation in the pleading. Conrail also maintains that even if the independent brake did not work as intended, the jury concluded that it did not create an unnecessary danger of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>{\u00b6 39} Klem did not need to specifically assert a violation of Section 229.46, Title 49, C.F.R. Conrail is strictly liable for any defect that constitutes a violation of the LIA. But here, the question of whether the independent brake \u201coperate[d] as intended\u201d was not put before the jury. The jury concluded only that the locomotive and all of its parts and appurtenances were in \u201cproper condition\u201d and \u201csafe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury.\u201d Section 20701(1), Title 49, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">D. The Complaint was Sufficient</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">{\u00b6 40} In his amended complaint, Klem alleged violations of only the FELA and the LIA. Although Klem did not allege a specific violation under the FRA, his complaint revolves around a singular defect \u2014 the independent brake on board the locomotive did not function properly; it froze and locked up. His claims that he had suffered cumulative trauma to his back and other body parts were dismissed by the trial court during summary judgment. Therefore, Conrail clearly knew that the independent brake on board the locomotive was the only defect alleged that remained following summary judgment. Conrail is a railroad that has considerable experience with the FELA, LIA, and FRA. To assert otherwise would be disingenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">{\u00b6 41} More important, claims brought under the FELA and LIA do not need to comply with Civ.R. 9. It is sufficient that the complaint place Conrail on notice of the basis of the claim, permitting it to prepare- a responsive pleading. Although Klem did not highlight Section 229.46, Title 49, C.F.R. in his complaint or pleadings as supporting his allegation that there was a violation of the LIA, his failure to do so did not constitute noncompliance with the rule. Certainly, had Klem argued the specific regulation earlier in the proceedings, he might have been in a better position to convince the jury that a violation of the LIA had occurred, because violation of this specific regulation does not also require that he demonstrate that the defect involved \u201cunnecessary danger of personal injury.\u201d Section 20701(1), Title 49, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">E. Operate as Intended</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">{\u00b6 42} Klem testified that the independent brake froze or got stuck when he used it. Section 229.46, Title 49, C.F.R. provides that \u201cthe locomotive brakes and devices for regulating all pressures, including but not limited to the automatic and independent brake valves, <em>operate as intended </em>* * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The question is whether the brake \u201coperated as intended.\u201d This phrase has not been defined in the LIA or its predecessor statute, the Federal Boiler Inspection Act (\u201cBIA\u201d), Sections 20701-20703, Title 49, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>{\u00b6 43} However, courts have addressed the use of locomotive and train brakes under a number of statutes, including the Safety Appliance Act of 1910 (\u201cSAA\u201d), Section 1, Title 45, U.S.Code, the Federal Safety Appliances Act (\u201cFSAA\u201d), Sections 20301-20306, Title 49, U.S.Code, and the BIA. Similar to the FELA and LIA, the SAA, FSAA, and BIA imposed strict liability on railroad carriers for violations of its safety standards. The SAA required that all cars be equipped with efficient hand brakes. Section 1, Title 45, U.S.Code. The FSAA imposed an absolute duty on railroads to provide and maintain certain safety systems, including power-braking systems. <em>Myers v. Reading Co. </em>(1947), 331 U.S. 477, 485, 67 S.Ct. 1334, 91 L.Ed. 1615; <em>O\u2019Donnell v. Elgin, Joliet &amp; E. Ry. Co. </em>(1949), 338 U.S. 384, 390, 70 S.Ct. 200, 94 L.Ed. 187. The BIA, now the LIA, required that brakes \u201coperate as intended.\u201d We presume that a brake that operates as intended is also one that operates efficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">{\u00b6 44} Whether a railroad failed to equip its train with efficient brakes is a question for the jury. <em>Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. Co. v. Griffith </em>(C.A.5, 1959), 265 F.2d 489. In <em>Myers v. Reading Co., </em>the Supreme Court of the United States observed that \u201c[a] railroad * * * may be found liable if the jury reasonably can infer from the evidence * * * that the hand brake * * * was not an \u2018efficient\u2019 hand brake.\u201d Id. at 482-483.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">{\u00b6 45} According to <em>Myers, </em>\u201cThere are two recognized methods of showing the inefficiency of hand brakes equipment. Evidence may be adduced to establish some particular defect, or the same inefficiency may be established by showing a failure to function, when operated with due care, in the normal, natural, and usual manner.\u201d <em>Myers </em>at 485; <em>Didinger v. Pennsylvania RR. Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1930), 39 F.2d 798, 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">{\u00b6 46} The court in <em>Myers </em>held: \u201cProof of an actual break or visible defect in a coupling appliance is not a prerequisite to a finding that the statute has been violated. Where a jury finds that there is a violation, it will be sustained, if there is proof that the mechanism failed to work efficiently and properly even though it worked efficiently both before and after the occasion in question. The test in fact is the performance of the appliance. <em>Philadelphia &amp; R.R. Co. v. Auchenbach </em>(3rd Cir.1926), 16 F.2d 550. Efficient means adequate in performance; producing properly a desired effect. Inefficient means not producing or not capable of producing the desired effect; incapable; incompetent; inadequate.\u201d <em>Myers v. Reading Co., </em>331 U.S. at 485, 67 S.Ct. 1334, 91 L.Ed. 1615.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">{\u00b6 47} Next, the court in <em>Myers </em>held: \u201c[T]he testimony of plaintiff that the brake was used in the normal and usual manner and failed to work efficiently but did so inefficiently, throwing him to the ground, is such substantial evidence of inefficiency as to make an issue for the jury. <em>Detroit, [Toledo &amp; Ironton RR.] Co. v. Hahn, </em>[(C.A.6, 1931)], 47 F.2d 59.\u201d <em>Myers </em>at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>{\u00b6 48} In <em>Myers, </em>the questions at issue were questions of fact. The jury was required to draw inferences from the evidence. From the evidence presented, the jury concluded (1) that the brake was not an efficient brake and (2) that the fact that the brake was not an efficient brake contributed to or caused injury to the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">{\u00b6 49} Here, Klem testified that the independent brake did not work when he tried it. Testimony also showed that several other Conrail employees tried using the independent brake and had difficulty with it. Duhadway conceded that a \u201chesitation\u201d meant that the independent brake was not operating as intended. The locomotive was taken out of service and \u201cblue flagged,\u201d indicating that there must be a problem with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">{\u00b6 50} Although the jury in this case concluded that the locomotive and all of its parts and appurtenances were in proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury, it did not address specifically whether the independent brake was \u201coperating as intended.\u201d Section 20701(1), Title 49, U.S.Code. Had the jury considered the issue and found that the independent brake did not \u201coperate as intended,\u201d yet reached a verdict in favor of Conrail, Klem would have been correct in seeking a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. A violation of Section 229.46, Title 49 C.F.R., is by statute a violation of the LIA. A judgment notwithstanding the verdict, however, cannot remedy a situation when the jury did not address an issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">{\u00b6 51} Accordingly, Klem\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">III. REFUSAL TO INCLUDE JURY INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">{\u00b6 52} In his second assignment of error, Klem contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-10\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cThe trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury relative to a violation of a locomotive inspection act regulation, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.46.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">{\u00b6 54} Klem asserts that he was entitled to a jury instruction based upon Duhadway\u2019s admission that the brake did not operate as intended because of the \u201chesitation\u201d of the independent brake lever.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">{\u00b6 55} Conrail advances three arguments why the trial court\u2019s refusal to submit Klem\u2019s proposed instruction was not an abuse of discretion. First, Conrail argues that Klem never specifically argued a violation of Section 229.46, Title 49, C.F.R. Next, Conrail argues that there was no testimony about Section 229.46, Title 49, C.F.R. Finally, Conrail asserts that \u201can LIA violation is only established if there is both a defect and a safety hazard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">{\u00b6 56} We disagree and find that the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the proposed jury instruction and interrogatory was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>{\u00b6 57} A trial court is not obliged to give a proposed instruction merely because counsel submitted it. <em>Jenkins v. Clark </em>(1982), 7 Ohio App.3d 93, 7 OBR 124, 454 N.E.2d 541. However, requested jury instructions should be given if they are correct statements of the law applicable to the facts of the case and reasonable minds could reach the conclusion sought by the instruction. <em>Murphy v. Carrollton Mfg. Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 585, 591, 575 N.E.2d 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">{\u00b6 58} To show reversible error, the proponent of the error must make a two-part showing. First, he must show that the trial court\u2019s refusal to give a proposed jury instruction was an abuse of discretion; that is, the refusal was arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable. See <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. Second, the proponent must demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s refusal to give the proposed instruction. Prejudicial error occurs only if the alleged instructional flaw cripples the entire jury charge. Cf. <em>State v. Penson </em>(Feb. 26, 1990), 2d Dist. No. 9193, 1990 WL 19395; <em>Schade v. Carnegie Body Co. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 207, 24 O.O.3d 316, 436 N.E.2d 1001; <em>Wagenheim v. Alexander Grant &amp; Co. </em>(1983), 19 Ohio App.3d 7, 19 OBR 71, 482 N.E.2d 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">{\u00b6 59} Because Klem did not need to specify Section 229.46, Title 49, C.F.R. in the pleadings, we reject Conrail\u2019s argument that Klem is not entitled to a jury instruction simply because the specific regulation or its language was not mentioned during the trial. Klem could have also chosen to pursue only a violation based on Conrail\u2019s broad duty to maintain. But given the fact that the issue at trial was the independent brake, the question of whether the brake \u201coperated as intended\u201d could easily have affected the jury\u2019s determination of whether an efficient brake that \u201coperate[d] as intended\u201d was also in \u201cproper condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">{\u00b6 60} Conrail\u2019s argument that the jury instruction is not needed because \u201can LIA violation is only established if there is both a defect and a safety hazard\u201d reflects only a portion of the LIA. As mentioned, a railroad can violate the LIA by either (1) failing to comply with regulations issued by the FRA or (2) breaching the broad duty to keep its locomotive\u2019s parts and appurtenances in proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury. As to Conrail\u2019s broad duty to maintain, it is correct that Klem must prove both that the independent brake was not in proper condition and that it was not safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">{\u00b6 61} Having rejected Conrail\u2019s arguments against Klem\u2019s jury instruction and interrogatory, we find that Klem was entitled to argue that the independent brake was not in efficient working condition and did not operate as intended. Klem\u2019s allegation that the independent brake was not in efficient working condition can be applied either to the specific FRA regulation or to Conrail\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>broad duty to maintain. Thus, Klem has demonstrated that the trial court\u2019s refusal to give a proposed jury instruction was an abuse of discretion. As well, Klem has demonstrated prejudice resulting from the court\u2019s refusal to give the proposed instruction. The absence of this instruction meant that the jury would consider only whether the independent brake was in proper condition \u2014 meaning that it worked \u2014 even if it didn\u2019t \u201coperate as intended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">{\u00b6 62} Accordingly, we find Klem\u2019s second assignment of error well taken. Klem is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">IV. REFUSAL TO ALLOW WITNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">{\u00b6 63} In his third assignment of error, Klem maintains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cThe trial court erred in refusing to allow witness Darrell McCabe to testify on behalf of Plaintiff during Plaintiffs case in chief, thus entitling Plaintiff to a new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">{\u00b6 65} At trial, Klem attempted to call McCabe as a witness during his case in chief, even though he had not listed McCabe as a trial witness until three weeks before trial. Conrail objected, contending that permitting McCabe to testify would constitute trial by ambush. In response, Klem argued that no surprise existed; McCabe was an individual known to Conrail, with knowledge relevant to the incident, and he should have been disclosed by Conrail in its responses to Klem\u2019s interrogatories and requests for discovery. Klem complains that Conrail\u2019s failure to disclose McCabe is evidence of its dilatory conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">{\u00b6 66} McCabe is, as Conrail concedes in its brief, a former employee who secured the event recorder (speed tape) from the locomotive following the incident. McCabe averred in his affidavit that his regular duties with Conrail included investigating breakdowns on locomotives or any injuries arising as a result of these breakdowns, and he had been involved in the investigation into the incident on board Klem\u2019s locomotive. McCabe stated that he had included his personal observations and findings in a report concerning the incident to the superintendent and the corporate-claims department in New Jersey. Klem asserts that given the extent of McCabe\u2019s involvement, there is no reason why Conrail did not disclose McCabe in its responses to Klem\u2019s interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">{\u00b6 67} Conrail disclosed six witnesses \u2014 the individual who assisted in obtaining the answers to the interrogatories and the following: Tom Szpond, trainmaster; Ralph C. Sturgall, crewmember; Dan F. Books, crewmember/brakeman; Howard Scott, yardmaster; and Bob Tondors, conductor. Only two were working with Klem at the time of the incident. Duhadway and McCabe were not among those identified by Conrail.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>{\u00b6 68} IClem claims that Conrail knew of McCabe and his role in the investigation. Once Klem became aware of McCabe, he attempted to locate McCabe, who was retired and living in Tennessee. Klem asserts that he disclosed McCabe as soon as he realized the potential importance of McCabe\u2019s testimony and insists that he should not be punished for Conrad\u2019s neglect in identifying those involved in the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">{\u00b6 69} We agree that McCabe should have been allowed to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">{\u00b6 70} McCabe\u2019s involvement was known to Conrail. The significance of McCabe\u2019s testimony was at least equal to, if not greater than, that of the individuals named in the interrogatory. Civ.R. 26(B)(1) provides, \u201cParties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party, including the * * * identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter.\u201d The obligation to supplement discovery is set forth in Civ.R. 26(E)(1), which provides, \u201cA party is under a duty seasonably to supplement his response with respect to any question directly addressed to (a) the identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters * *</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">{\u00b6 71} The civil rules were designed to provide for full discovery of all pertinent nonprivileged evidence and to allow both parties to accurately assess the merits of their cases prior to trial. <em>Bailey v. Bailey, </em>12th Dist. No. CA2004-02-017, 2004-Ohio-6930, 2004 WL 2937418, \u00b6 31, citing <em>Jones v. Murphy </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 84, 86, 12 OBR 73, 465 N.E.2d 444. See <em>Nead v. Brown Cty. Gen. Hosp., </em>12th Dist. No. CA2005-09-018, 2007-Ohio-2443, 2007 WL 1461303, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">{\u00b6 72} Conrail argues that a continuance should have been requested once McCabe\u2019s identity was discovered by Klem. Conrail contends that Klem\u2019s failure to do so precludes him from obtaining relief pursuant to Civ.R. 59(A)(1) based on an irregularity in the proceedings. See <em>Allin v. Hartzell Propeller, Inc., </em>161 Ohio App.3d 358, 2005-Ohio-2751, 830 N.E.2d 413, \u00b6 14 (consumer\u2019s failure to seek continuance in order to properly serve witness waived his right to complain that irregularity chargeable to court prevented him from having fair trial). Conrail\u2019s reliance on <em>Allin </em>is misplaced. A continuance was not needed to secure a witness. McCabe was ready and available to testify. Rather, the issue was Conrail\u2019s failure to disclose McCabe in its responses to Klem\u2019s interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">{\u00b6 73} The determination of whether a surprise or unannounced witness may testify is within the sound discretion of the trial judge, <em>Peyton v. Commonwealth of Kentucky </em>(Ky.2008), 253 S.W.3d 504, certiorari denied (2008), \u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 604, 172 L.Ed.2d 463, and is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Nakoff v. Fairview Gen. Hosp. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 254, 662 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>1, syllabus; <em>Vaught v. Cleveland Clinic Found., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 485, 2003-Ohio-2181, 787 N.E.2d 631, \u00b6 13; see <em>Yaeger v. Fairview Gen. Hosp. </em>(Mar. 11, 1999), 8th Dist. No. 72361, 1999 WL 135265.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">{\u00b6 74} The determination of whether the testimony results in a surprise at trial is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Pang v. Minch </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 194, 559 N.E.2d 1313. In the absence of surprise, there is no abuse of discretion. <em>Long v. Isakov </em>(1989), 58 Ohio App.3d 46, 51, 568 N.E.2d 707. Further, when a complaining party knows or should have known the identity of the other witness and the general nature of his testimony, a party cannot complain that they have been ambushed. See <em>Kalina v. Sagen </em>(Mar. 26, 1992), 8th Dist. No. 59761, 1992 WL 62180; <em>Cherovsky v. St. Luke\u2019s Hosp. of Cleveland </em>(Dec. 14, 1995), 8th Dist. No. 68326, 1995 WL 739608. A judgment will not be disturbed unless the abuse affected the substantial rights of the adverse party or is inconsistent with substantial justice. <em>O\u2019Brien v. Angley, </em>63 Ohio St.2d 159, 164-165, 17 O.O.3d 98, 407 N.E.2d 490</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">{\u00b6 75} Klem asserts that the trial court\u2019s decision to preclude McCabe from testifying was prejudicial and reversible error. Specifically, Klem contends that McCabe would testify to his knowledge of the investigation into the incident and the information that was collected, and to prevent McCabe from doing so would be prejudicial to Klem.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">{\u00b6 76} The trial court abused its discretion in precluding the testimony of McCabe based on the lateness of disclosure, which was no fault of Klem\u2019s and was clearly the result of Conrail\u2019s own conduct. Conrail knew of, or should have known of, McCabe\u2019s existence and the nature of his testimony. Thus, Conrail cannot claim that it was surprised. Any surprise would be a direct result of its own refusal to acknowledge the witness and his potential testimony. There is no requirement that mandates exclusion of McCabe\u2019s testimony. See <em>Jones v. Murphy </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 84, 12 OBR 73, 465 N.E.2d 444, syllabus. McCabe\u2019s testimony would have specifically addressed Conrail\u2019s investigation into the incident of November 10, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">{\u00b6 77} Therefore, Klem\u2019s third assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">V. REFUSAL TO ALLOW REBUTTAL WITNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">{\u00b6 78} In his fourth assignment of error, Klem maintains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-10\">{\u00b6 79} \u201cThe trial court erred in refusing to allow witness Darell McCabe to testify on behalf of Plaintiff in rebuttal, thus entitling Plaintiff to a new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">{\u00b6 80} Klem asserts that it has an unconditional right to present a rebuttal witness. Conrail counters that McCabe was not a rebuttal witness \u201csince his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>proffered testimony <em>primarily </em>related to matters raised not by Conrail, but by Klem and was otherwise cumulative.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">{\u00b6 81} Conrail contends that the trial court properly prevented McCabe from testifying because McCabe\u2019s testimony would be cumulative and, thus, unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">{\u00b6 82} We find that the trial court abused its discretion. McCabe should have been allowed to testify as a rebuttal witness as to those matters first addressed in Conrail\u2019s case-in-chief. Klem did not need to list McCabe as a rebuttal witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">{\u00b6 83} In <em>Phung v. Waste Mgt., Inc. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 408, 410, 644 N.E.2d 286, the Supreme Court of Ohio held: \u201cA party has an unconditional right to present rebuttal testimony on matters which are first addressed in an opponent\u2019s case-in-chief and should not be brought in the rebutting party\u2019s case-in-chief.\u201d See <em>Weimer v. Anzevino </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 720, 726, 702 N.E.2d 940 (appellant may rebut evidence adverse to her side, but that evidence must be introduced by the opposing party and not by appellant herself). See also <em>Katz v. Enzer </em>(1985), 29 Ohio App.3d 118, 29 OBR 133, 504 N.E.2d 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">{\u00b6 84} The proper scope of rebuttal testimony lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Vails </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St.2d 103, 105-106, 51 O.O.2d 133, 258 N.E.2d 225; <em>O\u2019Brien v. Angley, </em>63 Ohio St.2d at 164-165, 17 O.O.3d 98, 407 N.E.2d 490. Thus, a trial court\u2019s decision regarding the scope of rebuttal testimony will not be reversed unless the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>State v. Finnerty </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 104, 108, 543 N.E.2d 1233. See <em>In re Sadiku </em>(2000), 139 Ohio App.3d 263, 267, 743 N.E.2d 507. See also <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore, </em>5 Ohio St.3d at 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. Further, \u201cEven in the event of an abuse of discretion, a judgment will not be disturbed unless the abuse affected the substantial rights of the adverse party or is inconsistent with substantial justice.\u201d <em>Beard v. Meridia Huron Hosp., </em>106 Ohio St.3d 237, 2005-Ohio-4787, 834 N.E.2d 323, \u00b6 20. <em>O\u2019Brien v. Angley </em>at 164-165. It is based upon this standard that we review Klem\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">{\u00b6 85} Conrail argues that McCabe\u2019s testimony would have been cumulative because its witnesses James Kernans and William Honeycutt had agreed that the speed brake would not have recorded anything of material value. Conrail also argues that further testimony concerning Klem\u2019s violation of railroad rules would have been cumulative because \u201cthe jury found that Conrail was not negligent, the issue of Klem\u2019s contributory negligence was quite properly not even considered by the jury.\u201d In this case, Conrail\u2019s expert, Honeycutt, made clear that Klem\u2019s conduct contributed to his injury. Further, Conrail\u2019s witness, Kenny McIntyre, testified that he did not agree with McCabe\u2019s assessment regarding which safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>rules applied. Thus, whether Klem\u2019s conduct contributed to his injury or whether certain safety rules had been followed could clearly be rebutted by McCabe. Because McCabe\u2019s proffered rebuttal testimony counters Conrail\u2019s witnesses, McCabe\u2019s testimony could not be cumulative. Exclusion of McCabe\u2019s rebuttal testimony was prejudicial to Klem and therefore was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">{\u00b6 86} We find that Klem\u2019s fourth assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">VI. REFUSAL TO DISMISS POTENTIAL JURORS FOR CAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">{\u00b6 87} In his fifth assignment of error, Klem maintains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">{\u00b6 88} \u201cThe trial court erred in refusing to dismiss potential jurors for cause during voir dire, thus entitling plaintiff to a new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">{\u00b6 89} Klem asserts that jurors McCullough and Poston should have been dismissed for cause because they had expressed a belief that Klem had assumed the risk of injury. Klem argues that assumption of the risk has been abolished under the FELA and therefore, any juror unable to set aside that belief should have been dismissed for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">{\u00b6 90} Conrail suggests that prospective jurors can be dismissed for cause only if they reveal by their answers that they cannot be fair and impartial or will not follow the law as given them by the court. Conrail asserts that the dismissal of a juror for cause is discretionary and subject to reversal only upon an abuse of discretion. Conrail contends that the trial court\u2019s decision not to exclude jurors McCullough and Poston should not be overturned because the trial court was in the best position to observe the demeanor of the prospective jurors and to evaluate their answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">{\u00b6 91} We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">{\u00b6 92} Jurors McCullough and Poston should have been dismissed for cause. Their responses that they could follow the law could not remove lingering doubts as to whether they could be entirely unbiased given their belief that Klem had assumed the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">{\u00b6 93} It is well recognized that the \u201cright of trial by jury guaranteed by the Constitution carries with it by necessary implication the right that the jury be composed of unbiased and unprejudiced persons.\u201d <em>Papes v.

However, the right of trial by jury guaranteed by the Constitution carries with it by necessary implication the right that the jury be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>composed of unbiased and unprejudiced persons. Moreover, when the parties are entitled to a jury, the court is charged with the imperative duty of affording each party the opportunity of having an impartial jury. <em>Lingafelter v. Moore. </em>See <em>Papes v. King </em>at 233, and <em>Palmer v. State </em>(1885), 42 Ohio St. 596, 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">{\u00b6 95} Juror challenges are controlled by two statutes, R.C. 2313.42 and 2313.43. R.C. 2313.42 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">{\u00b6 96} \u201cThe following are good causes for challenge to any person called as a juror:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">{\u00b6 97} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">{\u00b6 98} \u201c(J) That he discloses by his answers that he cannot be a fair and impartial juror or will not follow the law as given to him by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">{\u00b6 99} \u201cEach challenge listed in this section shall be considered as a principal challenge, and its validity tried by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">{\u00b6 100} R.C. 2313.43 then provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-11\">{\u00b6 101} \u201cIn addition to the causes listed under section 2313.42 of the Revised Code, any petit juror may be challenged on suspicion of prejudice against or partiality for either party * * * or other cause that may render him at the time an unsuitable juror. The validity of such challenge shall be determined by the court and be sustained if the court has any doubt as to the juror\u2019s being entirely unbiased.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">{\u00b6 102} Thus, R.C. 2313.42 and 2313.43 provide for the causes for which persons called as jurors may be challenged. Civ.R. 47(B) superseded former R.C. 2313.44, which was repealed in 1971, and provides, \u201cIn addition to challenges for cause provided by law, each party peremptorily may challenge three prospective jurors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">{\u00b6 103} In <em>Parusel v.

Klem argues that pursuant to R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>2313.42(J) and 2313.43, McCullough and Poston disclosed by their answers that they could not be fair and impartial jurors or entirely unbiased. A review of the transcript from the jury voir dire reveals that McCullough and Poston had difficulty setting aside the concept of assumption of the risk. McCullough\u2019s responses fluctuate from \u201cThere\u2019s other things,\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s difficult,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t think it is good law necessarily,\u201d to \u201cProbably,\u201d when asked whether it would make Klem\u2019s case harder to prove. Similarly, Poston\u2019s answers range from \u201cYou work there for a long time, you know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d \u201cI think I can,\u201d \u201cProbably, yes,\u201d to \u201cI think I could, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">{\u00b6 106} During voir dire, the following exchange took place between Klem\u2019s attorney E.J. Leizerman and McCullough:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">{\u00b6 107} \u201cMR. McCULLOUGH: * * * people are entitled to what they\u2019re entitled to as long as there has not been wrongdoing or if people are trying to get more for what they might have been entitled to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">{\u00b6 108} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">{\u00b6 109} \u201cMR. McCULLOUGH: There\u2019s other things * * * Anytime we do a job, we have a job, we want to be able to work as long as we can, but there\u2019s times where you might not physically be able to do the job you\u2019ve been doing for a certain period of time. I mean, make it simple, like a football player in the NFL, they\u2019re entitled to whatever contract they\u2019ve signed and negotiated for, and then once they feel \u2014 or once whoever is employing them says, you know, I don\u2019t think he can play anymore. Well, I want to play. Why can\u2019t I play? I should get that money I\u2019ve been making. That\u2019s not the case. And eventually \u2014 and I think you can take that to any level of work. I mean, when you go to work you assume a responsibility and you assume a \u2014 basically a risk involved, too, with work, and then you have to understand that risk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-9\">{\u00b6 110} \u201cMR. LEIZERMAN: * * * In this case, if you were told that the law is that an employee in the United States never assumes the risk when it goes to work on a railroad, assumes no risk, if that is the law the Judge will tell you at the end of the case, can you accept that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-10\">{\u00b6 111} \u201cMR. McCULLOUGH: * * * That\u2019s difficult.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-11\">{\u00b6 112} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-12\">{\u00b6 113} \u201cMR. LEIZERMAN: If you heard at the end of this case that the railroad employee does not assume the risk of the dangers of the railroad when it goes to work for the railroad, this is one of those laws that just you disagree with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>{\u00b6 114} \u201cMR. McCULLOUGH: Yeah, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good law necessarily. I mean there should be some other protection involved. But that\u2019s the way it goes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">{\u00b6 115} \u201cMR. LEIZERMAN: Having felt that way, would it make my job just a little more difficult for me to prove my case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">{\u00b6 116} \u201cMR. McCULLOUGH: Probable \u2014 Potentially.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">{\u00b6 117} \u201cMR. LEIZERMAN: Probably?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">{\u00b6 118} \u201cMR. McCULLOUGH: Yeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">{\u00b6 119} Later, the following exchange between Leizerman and juror Poston took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">{\u00b6 120} \u201cMR. LEIZERMAN: In this case, you\u2019re going to hear that John Klem claims the railroad violated federal laws with respect to maintenance and condition of locomotives and whether they were reasonably safe to operate and whether parts and appurtenances were properly functioning on them that resulted in his injuries. Is there anyone who would listen to that law but also say, I don\u2019t know, he chose to work for the railroad, he knows what the railroad is, he gets what happens? Anybody feel like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">{\u00b6 121} \u201cMR. POSTON: I do, honestly, I do. Forty-two years after working for the railroad and you get hurt? You work there a long time, you know what you\u2019re doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-12\">{\u00b6 122} \u201cMR. LEIZERMAN: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-13\">{\u00b6 128} \u201cMR. POSTON: So yeah, I have that issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-14\">{\u00b6 124} \u201cMR. LEIZERMAN: So if the Court said \u2014 asked you to assume that he never assumes the risk when working for the railroad, you disagree with that law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-15\">{\u00b6 125} \u201cMR. POSTON: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-16\">{\u00b6 126} \u201cMR. LEIZERMAN: And as a result it would make it far more difficult for me to convince you of Mr. Klem\u2019s rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-17\">{\u00b6 127} \u201cMR. POSTON: Probably, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-18\">{\u00b6 128} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-19\">{\u00b6 129} \u201cMR. LEIZERMAN: Last thing * * * Dr. McCullough and Mr. Poston said that, at least on those issues, with assumption of the risk my job\u2019s going to be harder to prove our case simply because if that\u2019s the law, because of your beliefs; fair?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-20\">{\u00b6 130} \u201cMR. POSTON: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-21\">{\u00b6 131} \u201cMR. McCULLOUGH: (indicating).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>{\u00b6 132} Conrail\u2019s counsel, Mr. Antonini, addressed the law concerning the assumption of the risk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-4\">{\u00b6 133} \u201cMR. ANTONINI: There was also some commentary on what the law is. And likewise where you\u2019ve agreed to listen to the evidence, will you agree to listen to the law as the Judge gives it to you and not how the attorneys give it to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">{\u00b6 134} \u201cMR. ANTONINI: And in particular, Dr. McCullough and Mr. Poston, you guys were questioned at some length about your views on the jury system because of the law that Mr. Leizerman gave you this morning. Doctor, if \u2014 you are the kind of person that you are confident that you can listen to the law that the Judge gives to you and weigh that with the evidence and make a fair decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-6\">{\u00b6 135} \u201cMR. McCULLOUGH: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">{\u00b6 136} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-8\">{\u00b6 137} \u201cMR. ANTONINI: And give you our kind of persuasion of what we think you should do based on the evidence, but you\u2019re confident you can sort through that, along with the group and apply the law that the Judge gives you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-9\">{\u00b6 138} \u201cMR. McCULLOUGH: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-10\">{\u00b6 139} \u201cMR. ANTONINI: Mr. Poston, Likewise, are you the kind of person that can set aside what arguments, if they\u2019re not supported, that lawyers may make in this case and listen to the evidence and apply that to the law that the Judge gives you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-11\">{\u00b6 140} \u201cMR. POSTON: I think I can. His question to me was would his job be made tougher because of what he said. Yeah. That doesn\u2019t make my decision change, just makes his job tougher.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-12\">{\u00b6 141} \u201cMR. ANTONINI: If the law was different than what he told you it was this morning and it had different\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-13\">{\u00b6 142} \u201cMR. POSTON: There can only be one law, so I don\u2019t get what you\u2019re getting at there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-14\">{\u00b6 143} \u201cMR. ANTONINI: There are many, many other laws he did not talk about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-15\">{\u00b6 144} \u201cMR. POSTON: How do you interpret the law, I guess that\u2019s what you are asking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-16\">{\u00b6 145} \u201cMR. ANTONINI: Yeah. In other words, there was some questions this morning of you about duties and assumption of the risk. Those are things the Judge is going to tell you about. And it\u2019s not the job \u2014 in my view at least, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>that\u2019s not my job to tell you until the Judge gives you the law. Will you listen to the law that the Judge gives you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">{\u00b6 146} \u201cMR. POSTON: I think I could, yeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">{\u00b6 147} Although Antonini attempted to rehabilitate McCullough and Poston, he did not specifically address whether they could set aside their belief that Klem had assumed the risk of injury by working for Conrail. Instead, Antonini\u2019s questions dealt primarily with whether jurors could apply the law as given. McCullough was not asked by Antonini whether he could set aside his beliefs about assumption of the risk and follow the law. Poston was clearly equivocal as to whether he could do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">{\u00b6 148} The trial court rejected Klem\u2019s challenges for cause as to McCullough and Poston, observing, \u201cI\u2019m going to keep everybody on. I think they all equivocated, but I think that ultimately they all did say without equivocation, that they would follow the law and give a fair verdict. I mean everybody comes with their baggage, and we all appreciate that, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any undue prejudice with any of these potential jurors. So we\u2019re on to peremptory challenges. Anybody else for cause?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">{\u00b6 149} Klem asserts that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s denial of his challenge for cause. The denial prejudiced him, he contends, because he was required to use a peremptory challenge to prevent McCullough and Poston from being seated on the jury and, therefore, was deprived of the opportunity to use a peremptory challenge to remove other jurors from the venire.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">{\u00b6 150} A review of Ohio cases is helpful in determining whether McCullough and Poston\u2019s responses erased any lingering doubts regarding whether they could be entirely unbiased given their belief that Klem had assumed the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">{\u00b6 151} At the outset, trial courts have discretion in determining a juror\u2019s ability to be impartial. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 281, 288, 6 OBR 345, 452 N.E.2d 1323; <em>State v. Nields </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 6, 20-21, 752 N.E.2d 859. R.C. 2313.42(J) contemplates that \u201cgood cause\u201d exists for removal of a prospective juror when \u201che discloses by his answers that he cannot be a fair and impartial juror or will not follow the law as given to him by the court.\u201d A prospective juror who has been challenged for cause should be excused \u201cif the court has any doubt as to the juror\u2019s being entirely unbiased.\u201d R.C. 2313.43. <em>Nields </em>at 20-21. See <em>State v. Allard </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 482, 495, 663 N.E.2d 1277. Thus, \u201c[djeference must be paid to the trial judge who sees and hears the juror.\u201d <em>Nields </em>at 21; <em>Wainwright v. Witt </em>(1985), 469 U.S. 412, 426, 105 S.Ct. 844, 853, 88 L.Ed.2d 841, 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>{\u00b6 152} Therefore, a \u201cruling on a challenge for cause will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is manifestly arbitrary * * * so as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 31, 553 N.E.2d 576, superseded by constitutional amendment on other grounds as stated in <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 684 N.E.2d 668. Accord <em>State v. Williams </em>(1997) 79 Ohio St.3d 1, 8, 679 N.E.2d 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">{\u00b6 153} When a juror equivocates or gives contradictory answers, \u201cit is for the trial court to determine which answer reflects the juror\u2019s true state of mind.\u201d <em>State v. Group, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 248, 2002-Ohio-7247, 781 N.E.2d 980, \u00b6 66; <em>State v. Webb </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 325, 339, 638 N.E.2d 1023; <em>State v. Jones </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 339, 744 N.E.2d 1163. However, the trial judge need not accept the last answer elicited by counsel as the prospective juror\u2019s definitive word. See <em>State v. White </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 433, 439, 709 N.E.2d 140, citing <em>State v. Scott </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St.3d 92, 97-98, 26 OBR 79, 497 N.E.2d 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">{\u00b6 154} But here, the trial court itself noted that McCullough and Poston\u2019s responses were \u201cequivocal.\u201d Equivocal means \u201c[h]aving a double or several meanings,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed.1990) 542. In other words, the trial court construed McCullough\u2019s and Poston\u2019s responses during voir dire as being ambiguous and from that, it could not make a determination whether McCullough and Poston were, or were not, impartial. The trial court did not ask questions designed to elicit definitive answers. It did not ask any questions. Since it did not, the trial court did not receive any answers consistent with its ultimate decision. An equivocal answer followed by an unequivocal answer does not equal a fair and impartial juror. Because there were no assurances from the prospective jurors to the court, the trial court abused its discretion when denying Klem\u2019s challenges for cause to jurors McCullough and Poston.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">{\u00b6 155} Therefore, the trial court erred in determining that McCullough and Poston could put aside any biases or preconceived notions about assumption of the risk and confine their discussion of the case to just the evidence presented and render a verdict based on the instructions of law given by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">{\u00b6 156} In light of the uncertainty that remained regarding McCullough and Poston\u2019s ability to be entirely unbiased, we find that the trial court abused its discretion in denying Klem\u2019s motion to excuse McCullough and Poston from the jury for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">{\u00b6 157} The fifth assignment of error is therefore well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">VII. LEAVE TO AMEND COMPLAINT</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">{\u00b6 158} In his sixth assignment of error, Klem maintains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>{\u00b6 159} \u201cThe trial court erred in denying Plaintiffs post-trial motion for leave to amend complaint to conform to the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">{\u00b6 160} Klem asserts that his amended complaint more than adequately put Conrail on notice before trial that he was alleging a violation of the LIA and insists that Civ.R. 9 requires no more specificity than that which was pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">{\u00b6 161} Conrail contends that an amendment at this stage would be substantially prejudicial, asserting that the trial court properly held that Klem had failed to raise any claim under Section 229.46, Title 49, C.F.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">{\u00b6 162} We find that Klem is entitled to an order permitting him to amend his complaint because the issue of the independent brake was tried by implied consent of the parties and he is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">{\u00b6 163} Civ.R. 15(B), \u201cAmendments to conform to the evidence,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">{\u00b6 164} \u201cWhen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.

Failure to amend as provided herein does not affect the result of the trial of these issues. If evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the court may allow the pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely when the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence would prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense upon the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet such evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">{\u00b6 165} In <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Bainbridge Twp. Trustees </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 41, 5 OBR 99, 448 N.E.2d 1159, paragraph one of the syllabus, the Supreme Court of Ohio held: \u201cAn implied amendment of the pleadings under Civ.R. 15(B) will not be permitted where it results in substantial prejudice to a party. Various factors to be considered in determining whether the parties impliedly consented to litigate an issue include: whether they recognized that an unpleaded issue entered the case; whether the opposing party had a fair opportunity to address the tendered issue or would offer additional evidence if the case were to be tried on a different theory; and, whether the witnesses were subjected to extensive cross-examination on the issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">{\u00b6 166} Conrail was clearly aware that an unpleaded issue had entered the case. Although the allegation of a defective independent brake was not raised in Klem\u2019s amended complaint, it was alleged that Conrail had breached its broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>duty to maintain the locomotive in proper condition. Therefore, it was alleged that Conrad had violated the LIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">{\u00b6 167} From the very beginning of the lawsuit, Klem asserted that he was injured when the independent brake on board the locomotive failed and that he had cumulative injuries to his back and other body parts. These two distinct issues were addressed by the parties during summary judgment. As to those claims pertaining to Klem\u2019s back and other body parts, the trial court awarded judgment in favor of Conrail. The claims remaining after summary judgment concerned the injury Klem sustained to his thumb on November 10, 2003. The sole issue was the defect involving the independent brake. No other part or appurtenance on board the locomotive was alleged to have been defective or not working properly. Thus, it was clear that Klem was asserting a violation of the LIA based on a \u201cdefect\u201d of the independent brake. Conrail\u2019s defense during summary judgment and at trial was directed at the alleged defect of the independent brake and its alleged failure to comply with the broad duty set forth by the LIA. The case was not tried on a different theory- \u2014 indeed, there was only one theory: Conrail had failed to comply with the LIA. Thus, Conrail had every opportunity to subject the witnesses to extensive cross-examination on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">{\u00b6 168} We also find that Klem is entitled to an order granting him leave to amend the complaint to conform to the evidence. Because we have ordered a new trial, Conrail suffers no prejudice from the addition of a claim under Section 229.46, Title 49, C.F.R., which highlights the mechanical operation of the independent brake and asks the jury to determine whether an independent brake that is \u201coperating as intended\u201d or \u201ceffectively,\u201d differs from an independent brake that is in \u201cproper condition.\u201d The outcome could potentially change as a result of our decision that the trial court (1) erred in not permitting a jury instruction that mirrored Section 229.46, Title 49, C.F.R., (2) erred in prohibiting McCabe from testifying as a witness, (3) erred in prohibiting McCabe from testifying as a rebuttal witness, and (4) erred in refusing to dismiss potential jurors for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">{\u00b6 169} Since this matter is being remanded for a new trial, Conrail cannot show that an amendment of the complaint upon remand would be prejudicial. None of the factors in <em>Bainbridge, </em>5 Ohio St.3d 41, 5 OBR 99, 448 N.E.2d 1159, apply to give rise to any substantial prejudice at this stage. Conrail is clearly aware that Klem can argue a violation of a specific regulation of the FRA as well as a violation of the LIA. Conrail will have fair opportunity to address the specific alleged violations of the FRA and the LIA. It will also have an opportunity to extensively cross-examine the witnesses on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">{\u00b6 170} Based on the theory that cases ideally should be decided on their merits rather than on procedural technicalities, the rule articulates a liberal policy toward permitting amendments. <em>Stafford v.

CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">{\u00b6 172} We conclude that the trial court did not err in refusing to grant appellant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, because the question of whether the locomotive was equipped with an independent brake that \u201coperate[d] as intended,\u201d is a jury question. But, we conclude that the trial court erred when it failed to properly instruct the jury, refused to allow a witness to testify, refused to dismiss jurors for cause, and denied appellant leave to amend the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">{\u00b6 173} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken, but appellant\u2019s second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments of error are found to be well taken. Thus, we affirm in part and reverse in part, and we remand the cause for a new trial. Appellees are ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">{\u00b6 174} This decision and judgment supersedes and replaces the original decision and judgment filed June 18, 2010 <em>(Klem v.
