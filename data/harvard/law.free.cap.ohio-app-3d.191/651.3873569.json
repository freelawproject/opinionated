Core, from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, denying appellant\u2019s petition to contest reclassification.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">{\u00b6 2} On September 19, 1997, appellant entered a plea of no contest in the California Superior Court of Orange County to one count of committing a lewd or lascivious act with a minor, in violation of CahPenal Code 288(a). Appellant was notified that he was required to register as a sex offender pursuant to CaLPenal Code Section 290, California\u2019s Sex Offender Registration Act. In January 2004, appellant moved to Franklin County, Ohio, and subsequently registered with the Franklin County Sheriffs Department, pursuant to the provisions of R.C. Chapter 2950, Ohio\u2019s law governing the registration and classification of sex offenders. Appellant received a notice of registration duties from the Franklin County Sheriffs Department informing him that his classification under Ohio law was \u201csexually oriented offender\u201d and that he was required to register annually for a period of ten years from the date of the initial out-of-state registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">{\u00b6 3} In 2007, Ohio enacted Am.Sub.S.B. No. 10 (\u201cS.B. No. 10\u201d), Ohio\u2019s version of the Adam Walsh Act (\u201cAWA\u201d), which amended provisions of R.C. Chapter 2950. On November 30, 2007, appellant received a letter from the office of the Ohio Attorney General informing him that he had been reclassified as a \u201cTier II sex offender\u201d under the provisions of S.B. No. 10 and that he would now be required to register with the local sheriffs office every 180 days for a period of 25 years. On January 25, 2008, appellant filed a petition to contest reclassification and the application of the AWA. The state subsequently filed a memorandum against the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">{\u00b6 4} On January 5, 2009, the trial court filed a decision denying in part appellant\u2019s petition to contest reclassification. In that decision, the court addressed the issue whether the California offense of committing a lewd or lascivious act with a minor, for which appellant was convicted in 1997, was \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to the offense of gross sexual imposition under Ohio law for purposes of triggering Tier II registration obligations under S.B. No. 10. The trial court answered that question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>{\u00b6 5} The court permitted both sides to submit additional briefing before ruling on appellant\u2019s remaining constitutional challenges to S.B. No. 10. On January 30, 2009, the trial court conducted a hearing on the petition. On February 3, 2009, the trial court filed a judgment entry denying appellant\u2019s petition, rejecting all of his constitutional challenges to S.B. No. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">{\u00b6 6} On appeal, appellant sets forth the following seven assignments of error for this court\u2019s review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">First assignment of error: the trial court erred in holding that the California offense of lewd or lascivious act was \u201csubstantially equivalent,\u201d \u201cvirtually identical,\u201d or \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to Ohio\u2019s gross sexual imposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">Second assignment of error: The application of S.B. 10 to persons who committed their offense prior to the enactment of S.B. 10 violates the retroactivity clause of the Ohio Constitution, Article II, Section 28 of the Ohio Constitution, and the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution as incorporated by the Due Process Clause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">Third assignment of error: The application of S.B. 10 violates the United States Constitution\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">Fourth assignment of error: The trial court erred in finding that appellant\u2019s reclassification did not constitute impermissible multiple punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-10\">Fifth assignment of error: The trial court erred in holding that the residency restrictions of S.B. 10 do not violate appellant\u2019s right to due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-11\">Sixth assignment of error: The trial court erred in finding that retroactive application of S.B. 10 does not violate procedural due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-12\">Seventh assignment of error: The trial court erred in finding that reclassification of appellant was not a violation of the Separation of Powers Doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">{\u00b6 7} Under the first assignment of error, appellant contends the trial court erred in holding that the California offense of committing a lewd or lascivious act with a minor was substantially equivalent to the Ohio offense of gross sexual imposition. By way of background, in addition to raising various constitutional challenges to S.B. No. 10 in his petition to contest reclassification, appellant raised one nonconstitutional argument, i.e., that the California offense for which he was convicted was not \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to any Ohio \u201csexually oriented offense.\u201d While appellant raised this issue primarily in the context of whether he could be reclassified under S.B. No. 10 as a Tier II offender, we note that appellant also asserted in his petition that although \u201che has been registering in the State of Ohio since January 2004, * * * [petitioner * * * takes the position that he was never subject to Ohio\u2019s registration requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>{\u00b6 8} R.C. Chapter 2950, Ohio\u2019s Sex Offender and Notification Act, \u201cimposes a duty to register on a person who was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a sexually oriented offense in another jurisdiction if that person has a duty to register as a sex offender under the law of the other jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Miller v. Cordray, </em>184 Ohio App.3d 754, 2009-Ohio-3617, 922 N.E.2d 973, \u00b6 11. Pursuant to R.C. 2950.01(A)(11), a \u201c[sjexually oriented offense\u201d is defined to include \u201cany existing or former * * * law of another state * * * that is or was substantially equivalent to\u201d the offense of gross sexual imposition under R.C. 2907.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) defines the offense of gross sexual imposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">(A) No person shall have sexual contact with another, not the spouse of the offender; cause another, not the spouse of the offender, to have sexual contact with the offender; or cause two or more other persons to have sexual contact when any of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">(4) The other person, or one of the other persons, is less than thirteen years of age, whether or not the offender knows the age of that person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">{\u00b6 10} Cal.Penal Code 288(a) defines the offense of lewd or lascivious acts involving children:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-9\">Except as provided in subdivision (i), any person who willfully and lewdly commits any lewd or lascivious act, including any of the acts constituting other crimes provided for in Part 1, upon or with the body, or any part or member thereof, of a child who is under the age of 14 years, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions, or sexual desires of that person or the child, is guilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for three, six, or eight years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant contends that the trial court, in considering whether the offenses at issue are \u201csubstantially equivalent,\u201d was required to make an abstract elemental comparison of the California and Ohio statutes rather than engage in a fact-based approach. Appellant argues that such a comparison of the California crime of a lewd and lascivious act on a minor with Ohio\u2019s crime of gross sexual imposition (\u201cGSI\u201d) shows that they are not substantially equivalent. More specifically, appellant maintains there are four differences between the two statutes, specifically, (1) the age of the victim, (2) the offender\u2019s knowledge/intent, (3) the spousal status of the victim, and (4) the area touched on the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">{\u00b6 12} The trial court, in considering appellant\u2019s elemental-comparison argument, held in part: \u201cEmploying a strict element by element match \u2014 when the legislative goal is to attain one national sex offender registry \u2014 would impose an enormous burden on government.\u201d The court found that the test to be applied was \u201cnot so exacting\u201d as appellant advocated and that there was \u201cno meaningful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>basis to differentiate between a \u2018Lewd and Lascivious Act\u2019 in California and \u2018Gross\u2019Sexual Imposition\u2019 committed in Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">{\u00b6 13} Subsequent to the trial court\u2019s decision in the instant case, this court, in addressing a similar argument by an appellant with an out-of-state conviction, held: \u201cBy the phrase\u2019s plain and ordinary meaning, \u2018substantial equivalence\u2019 does not contemplate identical or even strict equivalence and presumes potential differences.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>184 Ohio App.3d 754, 2009-Ohio-3617, 922 N.E.2d 973, at \u00b6 15. Thus, this court rejected a \u201cstrict-or-identical equivalence standard.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">{\u00b6 14} One of appellant\u2019s contentions is that the Ohio and California statutes are not substantially equivalent because one element of Ohio\u2019s GSI statute is that the victim not be \u201cthe spouse of the offender,\u201d while California\u2019s statute pertaining to the offense of lewd or lascivious conduct with a minor does not contain the same requirement. In <em>Miller, </em>however, we rejected the contention that because an Illinois statute did not contain a nonspousal element, the statute was not substantially equivalent to Ohio\u2019s GSI statute. <em>Miller </em>at \u00b6 15. This court reasoned that under both the Ohio and Illinois statutes, \u201cit is a legal impossibility for a 13-year-old victim to be married,\u201d and thus \u201cthe fact that the Illinois statute does not contain a nonspousal requirement is not enough * * * to render it not substantially equivalent to the Ohio offense of GSI against a child under the age of 13.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">{\u00b6 15} Similarly, under California law, an unmarried minor may marry only with the written consent of one or both parents and a court order. See Cal.Fam.Code Section 302. Further, as noted in <em>Miller, </em>under Ohio law a minor is required to obtain the consent of a parent. <em>Miller </em>at \u00b6 15, citing R.C. 3101.01(A). Based upon <em>Miller, </em>we do not find the absence of a nonspousal requirement under the California statute sufficient to dictate a determination that the two statutes at issue are not substantially equivalent.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">{\u00b6 16} Appellant also contends that the Ohio GSI statute and the California statute prohibiting lewd and lascivious conduct contain disparate age elements, specifically, that the Ohio statute applies to a person less than 13 years of age, while the California statute applies to a child under the age of 14. We find appellant\u2019s argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">{\u00b6 17} Here, the purpose of both the California and Ohio statutes is to deter offenders engaged in sexual conduct with people under a certain age, and we do not deem the one-year age difference as contrary to that purpose. <em>State v. Tayse, </em>9th Dist. No. 23978, 2009-Ohio-1209, 2009 WL 692421, \u00b6 33 (comparing Pennsylvania statute proscribing statutory sexual assault to Ohio\u2019s rape statute and holding that the \u201cstatutes need not be identical if the purpose is the same\u201d). See also <em>Ex parte White </em>(Tex.Crim.App.2007), 211 S.W.3d 316, 318 (elements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Delaware statute for unlawful sexual contact, prohibiting contact with another person \u201cless than 16 years of age\u201d was \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to elements of Texas statute for indecency with a child \u201cyounger than 17 years\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">{\u00b6 18} Appellant also challenges the trial court\u2019s finding that both statutes require proof of the same mens rea. However, appellant\u2019s contention that the mens rea with respect to touching under R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) is recklessness is not supported by Ohio law. See <em>State v. Turner, </em>2d Dist. No. 22777, 2008-Ohio-6836, 2008 WL 5381956, \u00b6 59, citing <em>Starcher v. Eberlin, </em>7th Dist. No. 08 BE 19, 2008-Ohio-5042, 2008 WL 4416517, \u00b6 16-17 (R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) requires a mens rea of \u201c \u2018purposely,\u2019 not recklessness\u201d); <em>State v. Ralston, </em>9th Dist. No. 08CA009384, 2008-Ohio-6347, 2008 WL 5122127, \u00b6 17 (a defendant is guilty of gross sexual imposition if he purposely compels the victim to submit to the sexual activity described under the statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">{\u00b6 19} We also disagree with appellant\u2019s contention that knowledge (or \u201cwillfulness\u201d) of the victim\u2019s age is an element of the California law. See <em>People v. Olsen </em>(1984), 36 Cal.3d 638, 205 Cal.Rptr. 492, 685 P.2d 52 (a good-faith, reasonable mistake of age is not a defense to a charge of willfully committing lewd or lasciviousness conduct with a child under the age of 14 years). Further, this court has previously rejected the argument that recklessness is the required mental state with respect to the victim\u2019s age under Ohio\u2019s GSI statute. <em>Miller, </em>184 Ohio App.3d 754, 2009-Ohio-3617, 922 N.E.2d 973, at \u00b6 18 (\u201cno precise culpable state of mind with respect to the age of the victim is required\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">{\u00b6 20} Appellant\u2019s final contention is that Ohio\u2019s GSI statute limits touching to an erogenous zone, while California\u2019s statute does not. Pursuant to R.C. 2907.01(B), \u201csexual contact\u201d is defined to mean \u201cany touching of an erogenous zone of another, including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if the person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">{\u00b6 21} In addressing this argument, the trial court found in part that the Ohio and California statutes are substantially equivalent because both laws \u201ccontemplate sexual contact rather than penetration of the victim\u2019s body, or other features of more serious crimes.\u201d We agree. Arguably, under California law, a violation of Cal.Penal Code 288 would not require proof that the offender touched any particular part of the victim\u2019s body. See <em>People v. Martinez </em>(1995), 11 Cal.4th 434, 444, 45 Cal.Rptr.2d 905, 903 P.2d 1037 (\u201ca lewd or lascivious act can occur through the victim\u2019s clothing and can involve \u2018any part\u2019 of the victim\u2019s body\u201d). However, even under Ohio law, \u201cthe legislature intended that body parts that are not traditionally viewed as erogenous zones, may, in some instances, be considered erogenous zones.\u201d <em>State v. Miesse </em>(Aug. 18, 2000), 2d Dist. No. 99-CA-74, 2000 WL 1162027 (rejecting argument that stomach was not an erogenous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>zone because it was not among the body parts listed in R.C. 2907.01(B)). See also <em>State v. Ball, </em>4th Dist. No. 07CA2, 2008-Ohio-337, 2008 WL 274794, \u00b6 26 (\u201cWhile the mouth is not specifically among the body parts listed in R.C. 2907.01, it may, under the facts of a particular case, be considered an erogenous zone\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">{\u00b6 22} Upon review, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s determination that appellant\u2019s California conviction was for a crime substantially equivalent to GSI under Ohio law. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">{\u00b6 23} Appellant\u2019s remaining six assignments of error raise various constitutional challenges to S.B. No. 10. Following oral argument, this court entered an order staying this appeal pending resolution by the Supreme Court of Ohio of the constitutionality of the reclassification provisions of S.B. No. 10. The Supreme Court subsequently issued its decision in <em>State v. Bodyke, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 266, 2010-Ohio-2424, 933 N.E.2d 753, holding in paragraph three of the syllabus: \u201cR.C. 2950.031 and 2950.032, which require the attorney general to reclassify sex offenders whose classifications have already been adjudicated by a court and made the subject of a final order, violate the separation-of-powers doctrine by requiring the opening of final judgments.\u201d The Supreme Court concluded that severance of those two statutory provisions was the appropriate remedy, and thus the court held: \u201cR.C. 2950.031 and 2950.032 may not be applied to offenders previously adjudicated by judges under Megan\u2019s Law, and the classifications and community-notification and registration orders imposed previously by judges are reinstated.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">{\u00b6 24} This court subsequently lifted the order of stay and permitted the parties to file supplemental briefing to address the potential impact of <em>Bodyke </em>on appellant\u2019s case. Both sides have submitted supplemental briefing, and we initially address the issue whether the holding in <em>Bodyke </em>is applicable to appellant\u2019s petition to contest reclassification in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">{\u00b6 25} The state contends that appellant does not fit within the holding of <em>Bodyke. </em>Specifically, the state argues that appellant\u2019s Ohio classification arises by operation of law and that there is no separation-of-powers violation in the absence of a prior judicial classification under R.C. Chapter 2950.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">{\u00b6 26} Appellant acknowledges in his supplemental brief that a judge of an Ohio common pleas court did not determine him to be a sexually oriented offender; instead, that classification was set forth in the notice he received from the county sheriffs department. Appellant contends, however, that the court in <em>Bodyke </em>would not have selected severance as a remedy had it intended to declare R.C. 2950.031 and 2950.032 unconstitutional only \u201cas applied\u201d (rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>facially) to those offenders who had been previously adjudicated sex offenders by a judge in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">{\u00b6 27} In a recent decision, <em>State v. Hazlett, </em>191 Ohio App.3d 105, 2010-Ohio-6119, 944 N.E.2d 1220, this court considered a case in which an appellant-offender was convicted in 1980 but never judicially classified as a sexual offender, i.e., the appellant\u2019s classification arose by operation of law. Under the facts of that case, the appellant received notification by the office of the Ohio Attorney General in 2007 that he would be reclassified as a Tier III offender pursuant to S.B. No. 10. In response, the appellant filed a petition to contest reclassification. The trial court subsequently rendered a decision denying the appellant\u2019s petition to contest reclassification.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">{\u00b6 28} On appeal, this court in <em>Hazlett </em>at \u00b6 10-12, in construing the holdings in <em>Bodyke </em>and <em>Chojnacki v. Cordray, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 321, 2010-Ohio-3212, 933 N.E.2d 800, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">Here, we are presented with a defendant whose sex-offender status prior to the enactment of S.B. 10 arose not by judicial determination but, instead, by operation of law. An argument has been made that <em>Bodyke </em>is not applicable to such sex offenders, and indeed two appellate districts have so held. <em>Green [v. State, </em>1st Dist. No. C-090650, 2010-Ohio-4371, 2010 WL 3610203]; <em>Boswell v. State, </em>12th Dist. No. CA2010-01-006, 2010-Ohio-3134, 2010 WL 2653379. <em>Green </em>and <em>Boswell </em>held that where there is no prior judicial order classifying a sex offender, reclassification by the attorney general under S.B. 10 does not violate the separation-of-powers doctrine under <em>Bodyke </em>because it does not require the opening of a final court order or a review by the executive branch of a past decision of the judicial branch. <em>Green, </em>syllabus; <em>Boswell.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">We agree that this is a conceivably correct interpretation of <em>Bodyke </em>and that Bodyke\u2019s language appears to limit its separation-of-powers holding to judicially classified sex offenders and not those sex offenders classified by operation of law. However, the remedy of <em>Bodyke, </em>as later clarified and reaffirmed in <em>Chojnacki, </em>was <em>complete and total severance </em>of the provisions providing for the attorney general\u2019s authority to reclassify sex offenders. The severance makes no distinction between those classified judicially and those classified by operation of law. Moreover, after <em>Bodyke </em>was rendered, the Supreme Court was asked for clarification on this very issue, but declined to offer either reconsideration or clarification, which suggests the effect of severance is applicable to all sex offenders whether classified judicially or by operation of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">Being a court of inferior jurisdiction to the Supreme Court of Ohio, we must follow its mandates. <em>State v. Ryan, </em>10th Dist. No. 08AP-481, 2009-Ohio-3235, 2009 WL 1911863, \u00b6 48. See also <em>State v. Land, </em>3d Dist. No. 2-07-20, 2007-Ohio-6963, 2007 WL 4494776, \u00b6 9; <em>State v. Withers, </em>10th Dist. No. 08AP-39, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>2008-Ohio-3175, 2008 WL 2553085, \u00b6 13. While there is much debate over what the Supreme Court of Ohio may have meant or intended when it decided <em>Bodyke </em>and <em>Chojnacki, </em>we, as a court of inferior jurisdiction to that of the Supreme Court, are bound to follow what it did, which was sever as unconstitutional R.C. 2950.031 and 2950.032. Given that the statutory provisions authorizing the attorney general to reclassify sex offenders have been severed and excised from the Ohio Revised Code, we find the action taken by the Supreme Court in <em>Bodyke, </em>i.e., reinstating sex offenders to their sex-offender classifications as they existed prior to the implementation of the AWA, to be equally applicable here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">{\u00b6 29} Based upon this court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Bodyke </em>and <em>Chojnacki </em>in <em>Hazlett, </em>we conclude in the instant case that although appellant\u2019s prior classification (i.e., sexually oriented offender) arose by operation of law, appellant\u2019s \u201creclassification made under the severed statutes must be vacated and his prior sex-offender classification reinstated.\u201d <em>Hazlett, </em>191 Ohio App.3d 105, 2010-Ohio-6119, 944 N.E.2d 1220, at \u00b6 13. We therefore sustain appellant\u2019s seventh assignment of error, in which he asserts that his reclassification under S.B. No. 10 violates the separation-of-powers doctrine.
