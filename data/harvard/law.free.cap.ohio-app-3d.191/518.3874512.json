Under <em>Perales, </em>a court may not change custody from a parent to a nonparent without first finding that retaining custody in the parent would be detrimental to the child, i.e., the parent is \u201cunsuitable.\u201d Id. at syllabus.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After reviewing the record, we agree that some of the court\u2019s findings of fact are not relevant to the unsuitability analysis. The findings of fact related to the Heatons\u2019 \u201csafe and stable\u201d home are potentially relevant in a \u201cbest interest\u201d type analysis but not to an unsuitability analysis. We also conclude that the trial court erred to the extent that it premised its finding of unsuitability on Hazelbaker\u2019s pattern of romantic relationships and sending nude photographs to a former boyfriend. There is no evidence in the record establishing that B.P. has or is about to suffer any detriment because of her mother\u2019s sexual conduct. And finally, there is some evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s findings that Hazelbaker prevented B.P. from visiting the Heatons for a period of time and that Hazelbaker is alienated from her adult children. However, these two factors alone do not demonstrate that it would be detrimental for Hazelbaker to retain custody of her daughter. Consequently, we agree that the trial court abused its discretion when it found that Hazelbaker was an unsuitable parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">A. Events Leading Up to the Custody Dispute</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">{\u00b6 4} B.P. was born in 2000 and is the natural daughter of Robin Hazelbaker and Michael Purvis. The couple lived together for some period of time, but they were never married and eventually separated in April 2005. Purvis filed a complaint in April 2006 to establish child support and a parent-child relationship. However, he was subsequently incarcerated and failed to pursue his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">{\u00b6 5} In May 2006, the Heatons, Purvis\u2019s mother and stepfather, filed a motion for grandparental visitation. Hazelbaker, acting pro se, and the Heatons, who were represented by counsel, later reached an agreement on the \u201cmotion for grandparents rights.\u201d The agreed entry stated: \u201cThe Defendant and grandparents have agreed to share in the parenting of the child. Defendant, Robin Hazelbaker shall retain custody of the minor child. Keith and Debbie Heaton shall have visitation with the minor child every weekend or as agreed upon by the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">{\u00b6 6} Purvis was released from prison in October 2006 and began living with the Heatons. In November 2006, the Heatons filed a motion seeking custody of B.P., claiming that Hazelbaker was \u201cunfit\u201d to care for the child. On the same, day, Hazelbaker filed a petition for a civil stalking protection order against Purvis on behalf of herself and B.P. After filing for the protection order, Hazelbaker stopped sending B.P. to visit the Heatons. In December 2006, the Heatons filed a motion for contempt, arguing that Hazelbaker had withheld visitation with B.P. from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">{\u00b6 7} In December 2006, the court held a hearing on Hazelbaker\u2019s petition for a protection order. Although the Heatons were not a party to the civil-protection-order proceeding, the Heatons and Hazelbaker apparently came to a temporary agreement so that the Heatons would have visitation with B.P. over the Christmas holiday. Later, the court granted Hazelbaker\u2019s request for a protection order for herself, but denied a request that B.P. remain a protected party under the protection order.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">B. The Initial Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">{\u00b6 8} In January 2007, an initial hearing on the Heatons\u2019 custody and contempt motions occurred. In February 2007, the court issued an agreed entry granting the Heatons visitation with B.P. every other Sunday. The court also appointed a guardian ad litem for the case. Then, in April 2007, Purvis filed a new motion for custody and visitation. The court, upon the guardian ad litem\u2019s recommendation, modified the February 2007 agreed entry and granted additional visitation to Purvis and the Heatons.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Later, the guardian ad litem filed two reports with the court, the first of which recommended that the court order psychological and/or custody evaluations of the interested parties. In the second report, the guardian ad litem described custody interviews with Hazelbaker and Purvis. She stated that she had concerns about Purvis\u2019s criminal background and Hazelbaker\u2019s mental stability. Notably, she said that both the Heatons\u2019 home and Hazelbaker\u2019s home were \u201cappropriate and suitable\u201d for the child. Ultimately, the guardian ad litem recommended that Hazelbaker and Purvis be awarded shared parenting of B.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">{\u00b6 10} Dr. Eugene Smiley, a professional counselor, conducted the custody evaluations of Purvis and Hazelbaker and filed a report with the court. Purvis told Dr. Smiley that Hazelbaker was \u201cpromiscuous\u201d and that all she did was \u201csmoke and drink beer.\u201d Hazelbaker accused Purvis of being violent, volatile, and unstable. She also claimed that Purvis and the Heatons had made unfounded complaints to Adams County Children Services, apparently in an attempt to gain custody of B.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">{\u00b6 11} Dr. Smiley wrote that he was concerned that both Hazelbaker and Purvis exhibited \u201cconflicted\u201d behavior toward one another, which was having a negative effect on B.P., who was \u201cclearly and equally\u201d bonded to both parents. He believed that Purvis would benefit from anger-management courses and recommended them. Dr. Smiley also stated that he contacted Adams County Children Services and confirmed that they had conducted investigations at Hazelbaker\u2019s home. They found all claims to be unsubstantiated. Ultimately, he recommended that Hazelbaker retain custody of B.P. and that Purvis have alternating weekend visitation with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">{\u00b6 12} Dr. Smiley later filed an addendum report after interviewing the Heatons and Heather Hazelbaker, who is one of Hazelbaker\u2019s older daughters from a prior marriage. Heather was 17 years old at the time of the interview in 2007 and in the custody of Hazelbaker\u2019s ex-husband, Frank Hazelbaker. Dr. Smiley found that Heather was \u201cclearly alienated\u201d from her mother. Heather told Dr. Smiley that when she was living with Hazelbaker, as many as ten people were staying in the small house. She also claimed that her mother had posted hundreds of nude photographs of herself on the Internet. Heather described Hazelbaker as a \u201clying, cheating person who has done horrible stuff.\u201d Dr. Smiley noted that Heather could not think of one positive thing to say about her mother, but that if the allegations were true, then Hazelbaker would \u201cbe well advised to take more care in her choice of male and other companions, and to exercise more discretion when determining who resides in her home with [B.P.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">{\u00b6 13} The Heatons told Dr. Smiley that they were concerned about B.P.\u2019s welfare while she was being raised by Hazelbaker. They claimed that they were concerned for her \u201csafety, direction and support, and exposure to individuals that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>have come into contact with [B.P.j\u2019s home that do not meet with [then-] approval.\u201d Additionally, they claimed that Hazelbaker had not allowed B.P. to participate in activities \u201coutside her mother\u2019s home \u2014 no extracurricular school or church activities.\u201d After observing B.P. with the Heatons, Dr. Smiley noted that B.P. exhibited \u201ca positive and comfortable bond\u201d with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">{\u00b6 14} Dr. Smiley again stated that he was concerned about the conflicts between Purvis and Hazelbaker and that these would have a negative impact on B.P. He also noted that B.P. had a lack of contact with her three older siblings, Elisha, Nathan, and Heather. Ultimately, Dr. Smiley changed his recommendation to a shared parenting arrangement between Hazelbaker and the Heatons.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">{\u00b6 15} Dr. Smiley also filed a third addendum to his recommendations after realizing that he had forgotten to mention Purvis\u2019s status. This clarification recommended that the Heatons should have shared parenting rights with the understanding that while B.P. was with the Heatons, Purvis would have full and unsupervised visitation with B.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">C. Subsequent Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">{\u00b6 16} In late 2007 and early 2008, the court conducted a two-day hearing to resolve the pending motions. First to testify was Dr. Smiley, who reiterated many of the opinions in his custody evaluations, including his recommendation that the Heatons and Hazelbaker have shared parenting of B.P. and that Purvis be allowed unsupervised contact with B.P. while she was staying with the Heatons. Dr. Smiley stated that he had no concerns for either Purvis\u2019s or Hazelbaker\u2019s mental state as it related to their ability to parent. Dr. Smiley opined that Heather Hazelbaker came across as too \u201cone-sided\u201d but that he did not necessarily believe that she was lying about or exaggerating her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">{\u00b6 17} Frank Hazelbaker testified that he was Hazelbaker\u2019s ex-husband and, after their divorce in the late 1990s, he obtained custody of two of their children, Elisha (the oldest) and Nathan (the youngest). He later gained custody of Heather, their middle child, in March 2007. Frank stated that Hazelbaker had visitation rights with Nathan but had not exercised them.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">{\u00b6 18} Elisha explained that she lived at her mother\u2019s house for about nine months beginning in the summer of 2005. She claimed that her mother would often leave her, and she was forced to babysit the children in the house while Hazelbaker \u201cwent out.\u201d She claimed that her mother would ask her for money and then leave the house. Elisha claimed that Hazelbaker \u201cslept all the time\u201d and that there was never any healthy food in the house. Elisha also stated that she had concerns about the individuals that Hazelbaker was bringing into the house and claimed that in the nine-month period when she was staying at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Hazelbaker\u2019s, she brought home four to five men. She stated that she never observed any drug use in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">{\u00b6 19} Nathan testified that he was mad at his mother because she had placed Heather in a children\u2019s home. Nathan very rarely visited Hazelbaker\u2019s home and never observed any drug use in the home. He claimed that when he would visit, he would sometimes see men there. He was asked whether Elisha ever had to babysit him when he visited, and he said that she \u201cinfrequently\u201d babysat him. Nathan testified that he had no concerns about his mother\u2019s interactions with B.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">{\u00b6 20} Heather supplied the most damaging testimony against her mother. She testified that Hazelbaker was doing a lot of dating while she lived at the house and that there were \u201cplenty of men\u201d there. She claimed that sometimes she would go into the living room at night and find strange men there. She also stated that there was an inadequate supply of food and that her mother would bring home wine instead of food when she was depressed. She claimed that her mother drank alcohol \u201call the time.\u201d She stated that the house has no heat and no air conditioning. Heather accused her mother of trying to put her in a children-services home because she wanted to be placed in her father\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">{\u00b6 21} Heather claimed that she witnessed violence between Hazelbaker and her boyfriend, Kevin Hesler. She stated that police would often come to the house. She also stated that she witnessed her mother smoking marijuana with Hesler in the home. Heather claimed that she found one thousand sexually explicit photographs, which were freely accessible, on a computer in her mother\u2019s home. She explained that the computer had separate accounts for everyone at the home; however, the password for each account was the same. Heather stated that she found the photographs in a shared pictures folder and that there were no access restrictions on the photographs. She claimed that in certain photographs, her mother was nude, standing by a Christmas tree in the living room. Her mother\u2019s boyfriend at the time, who was a soldier in Iraq, appeared nude in a different photograph. She also claimed that there were pictures of \u201cnaked parties\u201d in which Hazelbaker was engaged in sexual acts with boyfriends and \u201cdifferent guys.\u201d Heather stated that B.P. used this computer although she did not indicate that B.P. had viewed the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">{\u00b6 22} Heather explained that she transferred these photographs to five compact discs (\u201cCDs\u201d) and that there were about 200 photographs contained on each CD. She claimed that she gave the CDs to her mother but later found one of them on her mother\u2019s desk. She turned this CD over to the Heatons, apparently to help them secure custody of B.P. Although the Heatons claimed that they had possession of the photographs on the CD, they did not introduce them into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>{\u00b6 23} Mrs. Heaton told the court about her large house, which sat on 300 acres and had six bedrooms and a pool. Mrs. Heaton told the court that she had frequent interactions with B.P. through weekend visitations between when the child was two weeks old and October 2006. When B.P. was with them on the weekends, the Heatons took her to 4-H classes and to Sunday school.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">{\u00b6 24} Mrs. Heaton testified that Hazelbaker was \u201cparanoid\u201d and would not leave the house. She claimed that Hazelbaker slept a lot and had \u201cquestionable seizure activity.\u201d Mrs. Heaton opined that B.P.\u2019s future would go \u201cnowhere\u201d if she stayed with Hazelbaker. And Mrs. Heaton stated that while B.P. was staying with her one weekend, the Adams County Sheriff was called to Hazelbaker\u2019s residence twice. She also stated that in 2006, Purvis had to watch B.P. for two weeks when Hazelbaker took a trip to Paris, France, with a boyfriend who was a soldier in Iraq.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">{\u00b6 25} Purvis testified that he had concerns about Hazelbaker\u2019s having custody of B.P. because she was \u201cunpredictable.\u201d Purvis admitted that he was on probation in Brown County for three years for a theft conviction, that he was on probation in Adams County for one year for a charge of theft by deception, and that he had been incarcerated for a parole violation for a theft conviction in Highland County.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">{\u00b6 26} On the second day of the hearing, the court heard testimony from Hazelbaker and her witnesses. Steve Darby testified that he is a guidance counselor at North Adams High School and the advisor of a 4-H group at the school. Darby testified that Heather attended 4-H meetings, and Hazelbaker brought her to the meetings when they resided together. He further testified that Hazelbaker brought B.P. with her to the meetings, that B.P. would play with the siblings of other 4-H participants, and that Hazelbaker and B.P. had a good relationship. Finally, Darby testified that B.P. participated in Lead Line classes at horse shows.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">{\u00b6 27} Winfield Rayburn, Hazelbaker\u2019s father, testified that he would babysit B.P. after she got out of preschool or kindergarten and before Hazelbaker came home from work. Winfield testified that B.P. was a pleasant and talkative child. Winfield stated that he had no concerns about the way that Hazelbaker was raising B.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">{\u00b6 28} Hazelbaker testified that she worked at Child Focus, Inc. where she coordinated services for at-risk families with young children. Hazelbaker indicated that her workplace required random drug tests and that she had never failed a drug test. She specifically denied ever taking any drugs. She claimed that there were never any \u201cstrange men\u201d in the house and denied that she slept all the time. She denied using Elisha as a babysitter so that she could go out to the bars; she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>said that she rarely if ever went out. Hazelbaker also stated that the house had heat and air conditioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">{\u00b6 29} Hazelbaker testified that B.P. had good grades while living with her. Hazelbaker stated that she took B.P. to 4-H classes in Adams County and that she took her to Lead Line horse riding classes. She produced various photographs showing B.P. participating in Lead Line classes, at home with her sisters, and on vacation with her at the Great Serpent Mound.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">{\u00b6 30} Concerning the nude photographs, Hazelbaker conceded that she sent pictures taken in 2005 to a soldier stationed in Iraq whom she met online. Hazelbaker claimed that she kept the pictures under a password-protected account and denied that all the accounts on the computer had the same password. Hazelbaker also denied that there were photographs on her computer of group sex and claimed no recollection of those events. Hazelbaker stated that she believed that Heather was angry at her because she attempted to place her in a children\u2019s home after she suspected that Heather had a drug problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">{\u00b6 31} Hazelbaker admitted that Adams County Children Services had been called to her house at least five times. She believed that Purvis and/or the Heatons had called them. She noted that Children Services investigated all the claims and found that none were substantiated. Hazelbaker admitted that she filed bankruptcy in 2007 and had 63 total creditors. However, she pointed out that 49 of these creditors were for a failed construction business with Purvis. Hazelbaker also admitted that she called the sheriffs office out to her home twice one weekend in 2006 because of a domestic dispute between Hesler and herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">{\u00b6 32} Hazelbaker explained that she kept B.P. from visiting with the Heatons one weekend because she had family coming into town from Alabama and she wanted them to meet B.P. She indicated that she had asked the Heatons whether she could keep B.P., but they had refused. She also admitted that she kept B.P. from visiting with the Heatons for approximately two months after she obtained a protection order against Purvis. However, she claimed that she kept B.P. upon the advice of the sheriffs office, which informed her that as long as the protection order was in effect, she should not send B.P. to stay with the Heatons while Purvis was living with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">{\u00b6 33} In June 2008, the court issued its decision, effectively granting custody to the Heatons and parenting time to Hazelbaker. After Hazelbaker appealed that decision, we reversed, holding, among other things, that the court must find that Hazelbaker was \u201cunsuitable\u201d before it could grant custody of B.P. to the Heatons. See <em>Purvis v. Hazelbaker, </em>181 Ohio App.3d 167, 2009-Ohio-765, 908 N.E.2d 489, at \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>D. Remand Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">{\u00b6 34} In April 2009, the court held a hearing after our remand, apparently to receive any new evidence that had arisen since the 2008 hearing. Ty Shipley testified that he was engaged to Hazelbaker, whom he had known for 20 years. Hazelbaker had been living with him at his home since December 2008, and B.P. had made overnight visits to his residence during Hazelbaker\u2019s parenting time. Shipley testified that he had observed the relationship between Hazelbaker and B.P. and it was \u201ctypical\u201d and \u201cgood.\u201d Shipley stated that he has grown children of his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">{\u00b6 35} Hazelbaker testified that B.P. has a good relationship with Shipley and that they play soccer together. She stated that there had been no police or children-services investigations at Shipley\u2019s home. Hazelbaker admitted that she had lost the home that she was living in previously to foreclosure. She stayed at her father\u2019s home for a few months before moving in with Shipley. Before she moved there, she had been in a relationship with another man for approximately three months. Their relationship ended because he died in a car accident. Hazelbaker stated that she had very little contact with the Heatons, and most of the information regarding what B.P. was doing with them was obtained through Purvis.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 36} Subsequently, the guardian ad litem issued an additional report. She found that B.P. was doing well in school and continued to thrive while in the Heatons\u2019 care. B.P. was participating in softball and going to church camp. The Heatons told the guardian ad litem that Hazelbaker had been resistant to extracurricular activities involving B.P. They claimed that Hazelbaker had brought the child to softball practice but left early, after about 45 minutes, because B.P. was not feeling well. The Heatons reported that exchanges of B.P. with Hazelbaker had been uneventful. Ultimately, the guardian ad litem recommended that the court grant custody of B.P. to the Heatons and opined that custody by either parent would be detrimental to B.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">{\u00b6 37} The court issued its decision in September 2009 and found by \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence that Hazelbaker was not a suitable parent and that her retaining custody of B.P. would be detrimental to the child. Accordingly, the court ordered that custody of the child \u201cshould remain with the grandparents, Keith and Debbie Heaton.\u201d After Hazelbaker requested findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court delayed issuing a journal entry until February 8, 2010. The entry found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">1. Defendant has without cause withheld the child from her father and her grandparents on several occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>2. The Defendant demonstrates limited parenting skills, not only because she does not seem to understand the value of the child\u2019s association with grandparents and the father but also by the alienation of her other children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">3. The grandparents have provided a safe and stable home for the child and have seen to it that the child has contact with the Defendant at all ordered times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">4. Defendant\u2019s home in Adams County was unsuitable, and although she has moved in with yet another adult male in Brown County who has a good residence, her behavior of going from one boyfriend to another causes the court to question her stability. Indeed, testimony about her having sent nude photos of herself to a previous male friend, among the other matters listed above, drew the court to the conclusion that she is not a suitable custodian for a young child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">5. The grandparents have provided a home and stability for this child when no one else was able or willing to do so, and she has thrived in their care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 38} Hazelbaker has appealed from this judgment entry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">II. Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">{\u00b6 39} Hazelbaker presents a single assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\">The trial court committed an abuse of discretion by granting custody to a nonparent when the record does not support a finding that custody to mother would be detrimental to the child, and thus that mother would be an unsuitable parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">III. Custody Disputes Involving a Nonparent</p>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">{\u00b6 40} In her sole assignment of error, Hazelbaker argues that the trial court abused its discretion by finding that she is an unsuitable parent because the record lacks competent and credible evidence that her retention of custody would be \u201cdetrimental\u201d to B.P. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-14\">A. The Parent\u2019s Paramount Right to Custody</p>\n<p id=\"b565-15\">{\u00b6 41} The right to raise one\u2019s child is regarded as essential and fundamental. See <em>In re Murray </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 155, 157, 556 N.E.2d 1169. \u201c[I]t has been deemed \u2018cardinal\u2019 that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside, first, in the parents.\u201d Id., quoting <em>Prince v.

Courts have therefore \u201csought to effectuate the fundamental rights of parents by severely limiting the circumstances under which the state may deny parents the custody of their children.\u201d <em>In re Hockstok, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 238, 2002-Ohio-7208, 781 N.E.2d 971, at \u00b6 17, citing <em>Perales, </em>52 Ohio St.2d 89, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047, at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 42} Accordingly, \u201cin a child custody proceeding [under R.C. 2151.23(A)(2) ] between a parent and nonparent, a court may not. award custody to the nonparent \u2018without first determining that a preponderance of the evidence shows that the parent abandoned the child; contractually relinquished custody of the child; that the parent has become totally incapable of supporting or caring for the child; or that an award of custody to the parent would be detrimental to the child.\u2019 <em>[Perales </em>at syllabus.] If a court concludes that any one of these circumstances describes the conduct of a parent, the parent may be adjudged unsuitable, and the state may infringe upon the fundamental parental liberty interest of child custody.\u201d <em>In re Hockstok, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 238, 2002-Ohio-7208, 781 N.E.2d 971, at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">{\u00b6 43} A \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d is \u201cevidence which is of greater weight or more convincing than the evidence which is offered in opposition to it.\u201d Blacks Law Dictionary (6th Ed.1998) 1182.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">B. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">{\u00b6 44} Although a trial court possesses broad discretion in custody matters, <em>Reynolds v. Goll </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 121, 124, 661 N.E.2d 1008, it does not have discretion to terminate a parent\u2019s right to custody when the finding of unsuitability is not supported by the record. <em>Perales, </em>52 Ohio St.2d 89, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047. Thus, we will review the record under a manifest-weight-of-the-evidence standard to see whether competent, credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding of unsuitability. See <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 280, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, cited with approval in <em>State v.

Findings of Detriment to B.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">{\u00b6 45} Hazelbaker contends that the trial court erred in concluding that she is an unsuitable parent. Generally, she argues (1) that certain findings of fact are irrelevant to the \u201cunsuitability\u201d analysis, i.e., they are actually considerations under the \u201cbest interest\u201d analysis and (2) that other findings simply do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>support the conclusion that it would be detrimental to B.P. for her to retain custody. We will review each finding of fact to determine whether (1) it is a relevant consideration under the <em>Perales </em>unsuitability analysis and (2) there is some competent and credible evidence in the record to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">1. Defendant has without cause withheld the child from her father and her grandparents on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">{\u00b6 46} Hazelbaker admits that facilitating court-approved parenting time is a best-interest analysis factor under R.C. 3109.04(F)(1), but she argues that the evidence did not demonstrate that B.P. suffered any detriment from missing court-ordered visitation time. The Heatons argue that the evidence demonstrates that Hazelbaker used B.P. as a \u201cbartering tool\u201d to get the Heatons to \u201cbend to her wishes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">{\u00b6 47} Hazelbaker did not send B.P. to stay with the Heatons one weekend in late 2006 when Hazelbaker\u2019s family visited from out of town and she wanted B.P. to meet them. And Hazelbaker discontinued visitation with the Heatons for a period of approximately two months in late 2006 after she filed for a protection order against Purvis, naming herself and B.P. as protected parties (Purvis was residing with the Heatons during this period). Hazelbaker explained that the reason she did not send B.P. to the Heatons was because a sheriffs office employee told her that if she had a protection order against Purvis that included B.P. as a protected party, she should not send B.P. where he was living.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">{\u00b6 48} The Heatons exercised visitation regularly with B.P. from 2000 up until the incidents of withholding in late 2006. In fact, Mrs. Heaton testified that the Heatons saw B.P. very freely until October 2006, even when Hazelbaker and Purvis were not in a relationship. Hazelbaker voluntarily signed paperwork so the Heatons could take B.P. with them to visit Purvis while he was incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">{\u00b6 49} There is no evidence in the record of any visitation disputes between the Heatons or Purvis and Hazelbaker following the December 2006 agreement to recommence visitation, and Hazelbaker has never been held in contempt of court for violating a visitation agreement. In fact, Purvis testified that Hazelbaker allowed him and the Heatons two days of visitation with B.P. over the Thanksgiving 2007 holiday, even though it had been her turn to spend the holiday with B.P., and that Purvis and Hazelbaker have \u201ctrick or treated,\u201d thrown a joint birthday party for B.P., and taken B.P. Christmas shopping together.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">{\u00b6 50} Although there is evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Hazelbaker withheld visitation with B.P. from the Heatons and Purvis for a period in 2006, there is no evidence that these actions have been detrimental to B.P. Significantly, none of the parties or other witnesses testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>to any detrimental effect on B.P. as a result of Hazelbaker\u2019s actions or introduced any other evidence to support such a finding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 51} We do acknowledge that a court may infer a detrimental effect on a child when a parent engages in such a pattern of withholding visitation as to demonstrate that the parent is clearly interfering in a child\u2019s relationship with her other parent or grandparents. However, there is no competent and credible evidence that such a pattern exists here. Even assuming that Hazelbaker\u2019s decision to withhold visitation from the Heatons while B.P. was listed on the protection order against Purvis was unjustified, this was a brief period in an otherwise continuous relationship between B.P. and her paternal family. Even the testimony of Mrs. Heaton and Purvis establishes that Hazelbaker generally allowed them visitation with B.P., even when it was not required by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">{\u00b6 52} We conclude that although there is some evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Hazelbaker withheld visitation without cause, the court\u2019s conclusion that these actions establish that Hazelbaker\u2019s retention of custody would be detrimental to B.P. is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">2. The Defendant demonstrates limited parenting skills, not only because she does not seem to understand the value of the child\u2019s association with grandparents and the father but also by the alienation of her other children.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">{\u00b6 53} The first aspect of this finding \u2014 that Hazelbaker failed to understand the value of B.P.\u2019s association with her grandparents \u2014 appears to be directed to the missed visitation in 2006. Thus, we decline to reexamine that finding here and rely upon our previous analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">{\u00b6 54} Concerning the alienation of her other children, Hazelbaker argues that this sort of finding is improper in the unsuitability analysis because the focus should be on the individual child in question. Stated otherwise, she contends that the record lacks competent and credible evidence that the alienation from her other children caused detriment to B.P. She further argues that the testimony of her children about her \u201cbad mothering\u201d was only relevant to the year prior to their testimony, which was received in 2007. And Hazelbaker contends that we should view Heather\u2019s testimony as \u201csuspect\u201d because Heather was angry at her.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\"> {\u00b6 55} Hazelbaker\u2019s children are clearly alienated from her. Based upon a parent\u2019s poor relationship with that parent\u2019s other children, a court might infer that it is only a matter of time until an existing good relationship with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>child in question degenerates into an unsatisfactory one. However, the standard for awarding custody to a nonparent under <em>Perales </em>is whether an award of custody to the parent <em>would </em>be detrimental to the child, not whether such an award of custody <em>could </em>be detrimental to the child in the future. In the absence of some evidence that the schism is having a detrimental effect upon B.P., the trial court could not conclude that Hazelbaker is presently an unsuitable parent to B.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">{\u00b6 56} There is certainly other testimony from Elisha, Heather, and Nathan to establish instances of limited parenting skills that may affect B.P., i.e., purchasing alcohol instead of food, excessive sleeping instead of caring for her children, going out frequently, and permitting or participating in drug usage in the home. However, the court made no findings of fact based upon any of this testimony; therefore, we can only conclude that the trial court either did not find much of the testimony credible<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or did not believe that this conduct was having a detrimental effect on B.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">{\u00b6 57} We conclude that merely being alienated from other children does not mean it would be detrimental to award custody of a different child to the parent. Therefore, we search for evidence suggesting that Hazelbaker\u2019s alienation from her other children is causing detriment to B.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">{\u00b6 58} Dr. Smiley stated in his second custody evaluation that he had \u201cconcerns\u201d about B.P.\u2019s lack of contact with Elisha, Heather, and Nathan. Apparently, due to the other children\u2019s general dislike of their mother, they would see B.P. only when she visited with the Heatons. Thus, the record contains some support for the trial court\u2019s finding that lack of contact with her half-siblings would cause some level of harm to B.P. However, because B.P. maintains a relationship with her half-siblings through the Heatons, it is unreasonable to conclude that B.P.\u2019s limited relationship with her now grown half-siblings would constitute such a detriment under <em>Perales </em>as to demonstrate that Ms. Hazelbaker is an unsuitable parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>3. The grandparents have provided a safe and stable home for the child and have seen to it that the child has contact with the Defendant at all ordered times.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">{\u00b6 59} Hazelbaker argues that the first aspect of this finding of fact, i.e., the Heatons\u2019 safe and stable home, is a proper consideration under the R.C. 3109.04(F)(1) best-interest analysis but has no import in determining whether retaining custody of B.P. would be detrimental to her under <em>Perales. </em>Hazelbaker is correct. \u201cThe <em>Perales </em>\u2018suitability\u2019 test is distinguishable from the \u2018best interest\u2019 test. Under the best interest test, the court looks for the best situation available to the child and places the child in that situation. <em>[In re </em>] <em>Lowe </em>[ (Jan. 16, 2002), Columbiana App. No. 00CO62, 2002 WL 75937]. The suitability test, on the other hand, requires a detriment to the child be shown before the court takes him/her away from an otherwise suitable parent.\u201d <em>In re Davis, </em>Mahoning App. No. 02-CA-95, 2003-Ohio-809, 2003 WL 405540, at \u00b6 12. \u201cUnder the suitability test, \u2018[s]imply because one situation or environment is the \u201cbetter\u201d situation does not mean the other is detrimental or harmful to the child.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Lowe </em>at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">{\u00b6 60} Accordingly, though there was competent and credible evidence in the record to support a finding that the Heatons\u2019 home was safe and suitable, this factor is irrelevant to the unsuitability analysis. Moreover, even if we were to assume that the implication here is that Hazelbaker\u2019s home was not safe and suitable, the record squarely contradicts such a finding. Although there were allegations that there was drug use in Hazelbaker\u2019s home in Adams County and that strange men were sometimes there, this testimony was apparently not credited by the trial court, as it made no finding in this regard. Moreover, the guardian ad litem expressly found that Hazelbaker\u2019s home was suitable for B.P. And notably, there was no evidence presented that there were any issues with Hazelbaker\u2019s current home, i.e., Shipley\u2019s residence. Shipley explained that B.P. had a room to herself while she stayed there on her visits, and the residence passed a home inspection ordered by the trial court. Accordingly, this aspect of the trial court\u2019s decision fails to support an unsuitability determination, and the trial court erred as a matter of law to the extent that it relied upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">{\u00b6 61} The trial court\u2019s finding that the Heatons ensured that B.P. had contact with Ms. Hazelbaker at all ordered times is similarly irrelevant to the unsuitability analysis. Assuming that the record contains competent and credible evidence of this finding, it is simply not pertinent to whether Hazelbaker\u2019s retaining custody would be detrimental to B.P. The focus of the unsuitability determination must necessarily be on the parent\u2019s acts or omissions. The Heatons\u2019 admirable adherence to honoring court-ordered custody arrangements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>has no logical nexus to a finding that awarding custody to Hazelbaker would be detrimental to B.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">4. The Defendant\u2019s home in Adams County was unsuitable, and although she has moved in with yet another adult male in Brown County who has a good residence, her behavior of going from one boyfriend to another causes the court to question her stability. Indeed, testimony about her having sent nude photos of herself to a previous male friend, among the other matters listed above, drew the court to the conclusion that she is not a suitable custodian for a young child.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">{\u00b6 62} Hazelbaker challenges the court\u2019s assertion that her home in Adams County was unsuitable. She points to the guardian ad litem\u2019s supplemental report, which stated that both her home and the grandparents\u2019 home were suitable. We agree that the guardian ad litem found the Adams County home to be suitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 63} In concluding that Hazelbaker was not a suitable custodian for B.P., the trial court\u2019s findings indicate two reasons it was concerned about her stability: (1) her behavior of going from one boyfriend to another and (2) her decision to send nude photographs of herself to a previous boyfriend. However, there is no evidence in the record that Hazelbaker\u2019s sexual activities had a negative impact on B.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 64} We reject the notion that having several boyfriends over a multiyear span establishes the sort of parental deficiency that could support a finding of parental unsuitability. The evidence demonstrated that one of Hazel-baker\u2019s ex-boyfriends, Kevin Hesler, may have engaged in a domestic dispute or even been violent with her. However, Hazelbaker lived with Hesler for only a four-month period in 2006. Moreover, when this dispute occurred, B.P. was in the Heatons\u2019 care. Regardless, there is no evidence in the record that Hazelbaker\u2019s romantic relationships had any detrimental effect on B.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">{\u00b6 65} The nude photographs clearly demonstrate that Hazelbaker exercised poor judgment in 2005. But again, there was no competent and credible evidence presented either at the preremand hearing or the postremand hearing demonstrating that these nude photographs caused any detriment to B.P. While it was undoubtedly unwise for Hazelbaker to store nude photographs of herself on a computer that her young daughter could potentially access, there was no competent and credible evidence in the record demonstrating that B.P. suffered any <em>actual, direct harm </em>from the existence of these photographs. Accordingly, the trial court abused its discretion to the extent that it relied upon the mother\u2019s behavior of having several boyfriends over a five-year period and possessing nude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>photographs on her computer to justify its decision that Hazelbaker was an unsuitable parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">5. The grandparents have provided a home and stability for this child when no one else was able or willing to do so, and she has thrived in their care.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">{\u00b6 66} Hazelbaker contends that this finding of fact does not support the trial court\u2019s decision that she is an \u201cunsuitable\u201d mother because the evidence also showed that she had provided a home and stability for the child and that the child has thrived in her care. She further argues that the guardian ad litem\u2019s report found that both her home and that of the Heatons were appropriate and suitable for the child. Additionally, Hazelbaker points to Dr. Smiley\u2019s report, which indicated that B.P. felt safe and secure while living with Hazelbaker. Ultimately, Hazelbaker contends that the trial court simply determined that the Heatons\u2019 home provided a better home environment for B.P., a consideration not appropriate in determining whether she was suitable to raise her own child.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 67} Concerning the first aspect of this finding of fact \u2014 the Heatons\u2019 home \u2014 \u25a0 we again defer to our analysis concerning finding-of-fact three. Accordingly, we reject this finding as supportive of the trial court\u2019s unsuitability determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">{\u00b6 68} Finally, the court\u2019s finding that \u201cno one was able or willing\u201d to provide a home or stability for B.P. is simply unsupported by the record. There is no evidence that Hazelbaker was unable or unwilling to provide a home for B.P. In fact, Hazelbaker has consistently fought to maintain custody of B.P. while providing the Heatons with visitation opportunities. Neither her home in Adams County nor her current residence in Brown County has been deemed unsuitable for B.P. to reside in.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">D. Totality of Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">{\u00b6 69} We recognize that the trial court\u2019s discretion in custody matters should be accorded the utmost respect; however, we find that the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that retention of custody by Hazelbaker would be detrimental to B.P. is simply not supported by competent and credible evidence. Although the trial court made factual findings in support of its decision, some of these findings were simply irrelevant because they pertained only to a \u201cbest interest\u201d analysis that was inapplicable here. Other findings do not sustain the unsuitability determination because there is no evidence that B.P. has suffered or would suffer any detriment by a continuation of custody with Hazelbaker. In fact, the testimony from all witnesses established that B.P. is a happy, healthy child who performs well in school and loves all the adults in her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>{\u00b6 70} Furthermore, although there is certainly evidence demonstrating that Hazelbaker is not a flawless parent, this is not the standard for an unsuitability finding under <em>Perales. </em>A review of other cases involving unsuitability findings reveals far more substantial evidence to support a finding that parental custody is detrimental to a child. See, e.g., <em>In re Z.A.P., </em>177 Ohio App.3d 217, 2008-Ohio-3701, 894 N.E.2d 342 (while child lived with mother, he had serious behavior problems and took several medications for behavior; child claimed physical abuse by mother\u2019s live-in boyfriend; mother\u2019s house was dirty and in disarray; several unrelated individuals lived in the house including a known \u201cdruggie\u201d; child had no structure at mother\u2019s home; child would be \u201cemotionally devastated\u201d if forced to return to home; and child\u2019s behavior had significantly improved and he had been removed from medications while he lived outside of mother\u2019s home); <em>In re A.W.-G., </em>Butler App. No. CA2003-04-099, 2004-Ohio-2298, 2004 WL 1040696 (mother unable to maintain employment and housing, child experiences rash due to lack of hygiene while in mother\u2019s care, mother does not consistently provide care for child\u2019s medical issues); <em>Karr v. Dunn, </em>Pickaway App. No. 03CA22, 2004-Ohio-928, 2004 WL 370427 (mother returned to work when child was three weeks old without arranging childcare, failed to provide financial support for child, abandoned child for several weeks, lived in six homes over four-year period, and failed to provide consistent medical care for child; also, home lacked electricity and running water and was unsanitary).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">{\u00b6 71} We conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that Hazelbaker is an unsuitable parent because her retention of custody of B.P. would be detrimental to B.P. is not supported by the record. The trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusion is based on findings that are irrelevant to the analysis or unsupported by competent and credible evidence of detriment. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s decision to award custody to the Heatons was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b573-8\">McFarland, P.J., and Kline, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A_h\">Harsha, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-16\">. The trial court's entry refers to the grandparents \"retaining\u201d custody rather than custody being \u201cawarded\u201d to them. Previously, the trial court had awarded custody to the grandpar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>ents, but we reversed this decision after concluding that the trial court applied the wrong legal standard. <em>Purvis v. Hazelbaker, </em>181 Ohio App.3d 167, 2009-Ohio-765, 908 N.E.2d 489. Upon remand, the trial court granted the grandparents\u2019 request to retain custody of B.P. pending the court's redetermination of the custody dispute between the Heatons and Robin Hazelbaker. We assume that this procedural history is the basis for the trial court\u2019s use of the word \"retaining\u201d rather than \"awarding\u201d when the court reexamined the issue. Thus, the effect of the court's most recent entry was to grant custody to the grandparents, and we refer to the trial court\u2019s decision as an award of custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-8\">. We note that under <em>Perales, </em>parental unsuitability may also be established if the court finds that the parent has (1) abandoned the child, (2) contractually relinquished custody of the child, or (3) become incapable of supporting or caring for the child. However, none of these additional findings establishing unsuitability are relevant in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b565-16\">. Although a party to this matter, Purvis did not file a brief. Subsequent to the court\u2019s journal entry awarding custody of B.P. to the Heatons, Purvis filed a new motion for change of custody and now claims that Debbie Heaton \"manipulates [his] daughter's time so that [his] parenting time is limited.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b568-11\">. We do not suggest that contempt sanctions for withholding visitation must be based upon a finding of detriment. However, contempt of court is not the issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\">. There were conflicts in the testimony of the three older children. For example, Elisha testified that she frequently babysat her younger siblings so that Hazelbaker could go out, but Nathan testified that Elisha infrequently babysat him during their visits. Heather testified that she observed drug use by Hazelbaker and her then boyfriend, but Elisha testified that she never observed any drug use in the home. There were also instances of conflict between Hazelbaker\u2019s children and other evidence in the record. For example, Heather testified that there was no heat or air conditioning in Hazelbaker\u2019s home, but the guardian ad litem report found the home to be adequate. Additionally, although Hazelbaker was apparently reported to and investigated by Adams County Children Services on multiple occasions, the agency never concluded that the home was inadequate or lacking basic necessities such as food.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
