Boyle, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Timothy Biro, appeals his conviction of leaving the scene of an accident, in violation of R.C. 4549.02(A), which carried a \u201cfurthermore\u201d clause elevating the offense to a third-degree felony as a result of the victim dying. He raises the following six assignment of errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">{\u00b6 2} \u201c[I] The trial court erred when it refused to allow the defense to qualify officer Gilbert as an accident [expert] and ask him about his conclusion that the front of Mr. Biro\u2019s vehicle struck the bicycle while it was on the ground and did not strike a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">{\u00b6 3} \u201c[II] Mr. Biro is only guilty of a misdemeanor violation of R.C. 4549.02 because the indictment does not allege a felony violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c[III] The jury verdict form only supports a misdemeanor conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c[TV] The jury was incorrectly instructed regarding the elements of the furthermore clause in Count Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c[V] The combination of errors discussed in assignments II through IV constitute a structural error that requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c[VI] The evidence is insufficient to sustain a felony conviction of R.C. 4549.02.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">{\u00b6 8} After a thorough review of the facts and applicable law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">Procedural History and Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b237-14\">{\u00b6 9} The grand jury indicted Biro on two charges: (1) aggravated vehicular homicide, in violation of R.C. 2903.06(A)(2)(a), and (2) failure to stop after an accident, in violation of R.C. 4549.02(A). The second count also carried a furthermore clause, stating that the accident in question resulted in the death of the victim. The charges arose out of Biro\u2019s vehicle allegedly colliding with the victim, who was on a bicycle and who died as a result of the collision. Biro pleaded not guilty to the charges, and the matter proceeded to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-15\">{\u00b6 10} The state presented the testimony of two eyewitnesses, Loshanda Mollica and Jujuan Mays. Mollica testified that the victim was riding his bicycle across East 55th Street toward Woodland when Biro\u2019s vehicle collided with him, causing the victim to bounce off Biro\u2019s car, hit the ground, and go partially underneath Biro\u2019s vehicle, where she believed that he was run over by the rear of the car. Mays testified that she saw that the victim and Biro were about to collide, so she looked away, but that she heard the collision. Mays saw Biro\u2019s vehicle clear the intersection in front of her, slow down for a few seconds, and then proceed to accelerate and continue on East 55th Street. Mays, along with her husband, who was driving, followed Biro\u2019s vehicle and called 9-1-1, providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>the police with Biro\u2019s license plate number. She further testified that her husband flashed the lights of their vehicle in an attempt to stop Biro.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">{\u00b6 11} The state also produced forensic evidence that supported the eyewitnesses\u2019 testimony that Biro\u2019s vehicle had contact with the victim\u2019s bike and the victim. Specifically, the state established that the paint smear found on Biro\u2019s vehicle was consistent with the paint damage on the bike, that the black transfer material found on the surface of the vehicle was consistent with the composition of the bike\u2019s brake lever, and that there was a consistency of patterns between the sidewall and pedal of the bike and the undercarriage of Biro\u2019s vehicle. The state further introduced evidence that the victim\u2019s sweatshirt bore a tire pattern that had class characteristics consistent with the tire of Biro\u2019s vehicle. The coroner\u2019s testimony also revealed that the victim died from blunt trauma that caused extensive internal bleeding and that the victim\u2019s injuries were consistent with having been run over by a car.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">{\u00b6 12} The state also called Richfield Police Officer Robert Gilbert, who testified that he heard the radio call regarding a possible hit-and-run by a vehicle registered to Biro. Gilbert then stopped Biro, who was driving to his home in Hudson. Biro was escorted to the Richfield Police Department, where a breath-alcohol test was administered, revealing a blood-alcohol content of .014 milligrams per liter, under the legal limit of .08.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">{\u00b6 13} On cross-examination, Gilbert testified that Biro appeared to be going the speed limit, that he seemed surprised to be pulled over, and that once he was informed of the basis of the stop, i.e., suspected involvement in an accident, he was \u201cnoticeably upset.\u201d Gilbert further testified that he anticipated that Biro\u2019s vehicle would have had a headlight out based on the alleged accident because \u201cwhen a motor vehicle strikes a person or objects with today\u2019s plastic lights they break pretty easily and it would damage one of them.\u201d Gilbert testified, however, that the only noticeable damage that he observed was (1) an indentation on the left-hand side in the bumper cover and (2) a broken driving light in the lower left-hand corner of the motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">{\u00b6 14} After the state\u2019s presentation of its case-in-chief, the trial court granted Biro\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion as to the aggravated-vehicular-homicide count but denied Biro\u2019s motion as to the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">{\u00b6 15} The trial proceeded on the charge of failure to stop after an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">{\u00b6 16} The defense presented a character witness who testified that Biro is one of the \u201cmost honest, open, truthful, caring persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">{\u00b6 17} Biro also testified in his own behalf. According to him, he recalled that at the intersection of East 55th and Woodland, he \u201chit a bump that felt similar to what you would expect if you hit a pothole.\u201d Immediately following, he slowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>down, looked in his left side mirror, and observed car lights behind him \u201cbut nothing else.\u201d He never saw a bicycle or person lying on the ground. He then proceeded to drive home but was ultimately pulled over in Richfield. He testified that he had no idea that his vehicle was involved in an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">{\u00b6 18} The jury returned a guilty verdict on the second count and further found that the victim died as a result of the accident, thereby elevating the offense to a third-degree felony. The trial court sentenced Biro to one year of community-control sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">{\u00b6 19} Biro now appeals his conviction. For the ease of discussion, we will address Biro\u2019s assignments of error out of order.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Misdemeanor versus Felony Conviction under R.C. 4549.02</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">{\u00b6 20} Biro\u2019s second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments of error all relate to former R.C. 4549.02<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the penalty provision contained in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">{\u00b6 21} The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-10\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(A) In case of accident to or collision with persons or property upon any of the public roads or highways, due to the driving or operation thereon of any motor vehicle, the person driving or operating the motor vehicle, having knowledge of the accident or collision, immediately shall stop the driver\u2019s or operator\u2019s motor vehicle at the scene of the accident or collision and shall remain at the scene of the accident or collision until the driver or operator has given the driver\u2019s or operator\u2019s name and address and, if the driver or operator is not the owner, the name and address of the owner of that motor vehicle, together with the registered number of that motor vehicle, to any person injured in the accident or collision or to the operator, occupant, owner, or attendant of any motor vehicle damaged in the accident or collision, or to any police officer at the scene of the accident or collision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">{\u00b6 23} Pursuant to former R.C. 4549.02(B), \u201c[wjhoever violates division (A) is guilty of failure to stop after an accident, a misdemeanor of the first degree,\u201d but \u201cif the violation results in the death of a person,\u201d the violation becomes a third-degree felony offense. The statute, however, does not define the word \u201cresults.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">{\u00b6 24} In his second assignment of error, Biro argues that the indictment lacked the proper language to constitute a felony offense as defined in former R.C. 4549.02(B). It stated as follows: \u201cFurthermore, the accident in question resulted in the death of Terrell Jones.\u201d Biro argues that the use of the word \u201caccident\u201d was erroneous because the statute requires a showing that the \u201cviolation\u201d resulted in death. He further argues in his third and fourth assign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>ments of error that this same deficiency was carried through in the jury-verdict form and jury instruction, thereby resulting in the jury convicting him of only a misdemeanor. He also argues that the cumulative effect of these errors constitute structural error that requires a reversal. And finally, he argues in his sixth assignment of error that the state failed to present sufficient evidence to sustain a felony conviction as defined under former R.C. 4549.02(B). We, however, find Biro\u2019s arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">{\u00b6 25} The underlying rationale in support of Biro\u2019s five assignments of error is that a violation of former R.C. 4549.02(A), failure to stop after an accident, is only a misdemeanor offense under former R.C. 4549.02(B) unless the defendant\u2019s act of leaving the scene results in death, as opposed to the accident itself resulting in death. But aside from the fact that Biro failed to raise any argument below related to these issues, this court has previously addressed this exact argument and rejected it. See <em>State v. Osborne, </em>8th Dist. No. 88453, 2007-Ohio-3267, 2007 WL 1848946.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">{\u00b6 26} Contrary to Biro\u2019s assertion, <em>Osborne </em>is right on point and controlling. In <em>Osborne, </em>we recognized that \u201cthe statute seeks to hold the offender responsible for his ensuing actions.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 23. We expressly rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the language of former R.C. 4549.02(B) required the state to prove that the defendant\u2019s failure to stop and report resulted in the victim\u2019s death in order to establish his guilt of a third-degree felony. Id. at \u00b6 18-23. Instead, in order to sustain a third-degree felony, the state must prove that the accident resulted in the victim\u2019s death. Id.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, \u201c[t]he statute does not require that the failure to stop directly causes the victim\u2019s death.\u201d <em>State v. McGraw, </em>4th Dist. No. 08CA3009, 2008-Ohio-6134, 2008 WL 5046811, \u00b613.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">{\u00b6 27} Accordingly, consistent with our holding in <em>Osborne, </em>Biro\u2019s second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">{\u00b6 28} In his first assignment of error, Biro argues that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing his efforts on cross-examination to qualify the state\u2019s witness, Officer Robert Gilbert, as an expert in accident reconstruction and elicit Gilbert\u2019s opinion as to the accident. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">{\u00b6 29} At trial, the state had identified and called Officer Gilbert as a fact witness in its case-in-chief. During cross-examination, Biro\u2019s counsel attempted to establish that Gilbert was an expert in accident reconstruction. Defense counsel intended to question Gilbert about his expert conclusions regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>position of the victim\u2019s bicycle when it was hit by Biro\u2019s vehicle. The trial court prohibited this line of questioning for two reasons: (1) defense counsel never provided an expert report to the state and (2) Gilbert \u201cnever had a second look at the car after he stopped the car and walked around it.\u201d Biro\u2019s defense counsel proffered Gilbert\u2019s excluded testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cHe would have testified that, had he been allowed to testify, he would have testified that the dent in the right front portion of Mr. Biro\u2019s car was consistent with striking the pedal of the bike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cHe also would have testified that the evidence was not consistent with the bicycle \u2014 with Mr. Biro\u2019s car striking a person. And also that the bike was already on the ground when Mr. Biro\u2019s car struck it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cAnd I think that as I related to the court, we didn\u2019t have a report, and it\u2019s my understanding if there is a report it must be conveyable. If there is no report then obviously you don\u2019t have to produce that report.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">{\u00b6 33} After hearing the proffer, the trial court maintained its exclusion of any expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">{\u00b6 34} Biro argues that the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow Gilbert\u2019s opinion testimony deprived him of his due-process rights under the United States Constitution because he was prevented from presenting testimony that was critical to his defense. He specifically argues that Gilbert\u2019s expert testimony would have undermined the state\u2019s eyewitness testimony establishing that the victim was still on the bike when the collision occurred, and, significantly, it would have supported Biro\u2019s own testimony that he did not see the victim on a bike. The state counters that Biro\u2019s defense counsel failed to comply with Crim.R. 16 and therefore the exclusion of the testimony was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">{\u00b6 35} The trial court has broad discretion in regulating discovery. <em>State v. Scudder </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 263, 269, 643 N.E.2d 524. \u201cThe purpose of discovery rules is to prevent surprise and the secreting of evidence favorable to one party. The overall purpose is to produce a fair trial.\u201d <em>Lakewood v. Papadelis </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 511 N.E.2d 1138. When a discovery violation occurs, the trial court should impose the least severe sanction that is consistent with the purposes of the discovery rules. Id. We -will not disturb the trial court\u2019s choice of remedy absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Apanovitch </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 26, 514 N.E.2d 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\"> {\u00b6 36} The Ohio Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that \u201cthe trial court has authority to enter pretrial orders regarding discovery.\u201d Further, \u201c[discovery beyond what the rules require is at the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 119, 559 N.E.2d 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>{\u00b6 37} Biro argues that the trial court erroneously excluded Gilbert\u2019s testimony on the basis that he failed to provide an expert report because former Crim.R. 16 or Loc.R. 21.1(B) of the Court of Common Pleas of County County imposes no such duty in criminal cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While we agree that former Crim.R. 16 imposes no duty to provide a written expert report and that this court has previously held that Loc.R. 21.1(B) does not apply in criminal cases,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Biro ignores a critical fact in the proceedings below: the trial court specifically set a deadline for the defense\u2019s expert report to be provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">{\u00b6 38} On April 15, 2009, Biro\u2019s defense counsel moved for a continuance of the trial date set for April 22, 2009, because he needed additional time to secure a different expert. The trial court granted the continuance, converting the trial date into a pretrial. Following the pretrial, the trial court reset the trial for June 3, 2009, and issued a discovery order, stating: \u201cDefense expert report due 5/20/09.\u201d Defense counsel never objected to this order nor raised any argument on appeal related to the trial court\u2019s express requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">{\u00b6 39} The state contends that Biro\u2019s defense counsel never responded to the state\u2019s request for discovery. We find no discovery responses filed by Biro in the record. Thus, aside from failing to comply with the court\u2019s express order regarding the submission of an expert report prior to trial, defense counsel never even notified the state that it intended to use Gilbert as an expert without a report. Contrary to Biro\u2019s assertion, we do not read the trial court\u2019s order as requiring an expert report only if he intended to introduce one at trial. Indeed, former Crim.R. 16 requires the production of a report under such circumstances. In light of the trial court\u2019s explicit order regarding an expert report, it is clear to us why the court refused to allow Gilbert to testify as an expert: Biro had not prepared a report or provided one to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">{\u00b6 40} Thus, under the circumstances of this case, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing the defense\u2019s request to qualify Gilbert as an expert and elicit his expert opinions on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">{\u00b6 41} We further note that the record does not convince us that Gilbert would have even been qualified to render the opinion proffered by defense counsel. Even assuming that Gilbert is an expert in accident reconstruction, there is no evidence that he was qualified to opine specifically that the victim\u2019s bike was already on the ground when Biro struck it. Indeed, Gilbert did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>conduct any type of investigation in this case, and his opinion was based solely on his cursory review of the damage to Biro\u2019s vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">{\u00b6 42} But even assuming that Gilbert was qualified to testify as an expert and that the defense was entitled to offer his testimony, we find that the exclusion of his testimony was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cAn error in the admission or exclusion of evidence is properly considered harmless error if it does not affect a substantial right of the accused.\u201d <em>State v. Condon, </em>152 Ohio App.3d 629, 2003-Ohio-2335, 789 N.E.2d 696, \u00b6 80, citing Crim.R. 52(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">{\u00b6 43} The state produced two eyewitnesses who observed the victim riding his bicycle up until the collision. Indeed, one eyewitness testified in detail as to the collision, including stating that the victim \u201csmacked\u201d the side of Biro\u2019s car, bounced off the car, and ultimately was run over by the back of Biro\u2019s car. Gilbert did not observe the accident, and any opinion that he would have offered was based solely on his brief examination of the vehicle when he pulled it over. He even admitted that he did not observe the undercarriage of the vehicle, noting that \u201cit would be something you would do on a post crash examination of a motor vehicle.\u201d Thus, even if the defense would have been able to establish that Gilbert was qualified to render an opinion, we fail to see what weight, if any, the opinion would have carried given the overwhelming evidence contradicting that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">{\u00b6 44} The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b243-9\">Kilbane, P.J., and Blackmon, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-13\">.
