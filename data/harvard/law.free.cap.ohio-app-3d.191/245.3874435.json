The case was dismissed by the trial court on speedy-trial grounds on December 23, 2009. The state of Ohio brings this appeal, arguing that appellee\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were not violated. After a thorough review of the record and the apposite law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">{\u00b6 2} On November 13, 2007, after appellee failed to appear at a pretrial before the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, a capias warrant was issued. While in the Mahoning County jail in the custody of the United States Bureau of Prisons, appellee sent notice to the trial court of his availability and requested that the criminal case move forward.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This notice was received on February 11, 2009. Appellee included his federal prison identification number, his home federal prison institution in Kentucky, and a certificate of service indicating that the notice was also sent to the prosecutor. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss the criminal case pursuant to R.C. 2941.401 on August 13, 2009, based on the state\u2019s failure to bring him to trial within the 180-day time frame set forth therein. This motion was initially denied by the trial court on October 16, 2009. However, on December 23, 2009, the trial court dismissed the case for violating appellee\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial. The transcript of the hearing consists of one page where the trial court found that \u201cthe defendant did substantially comply with 2941.401.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">{\u00b6 3} The state appeals, arguing two errors: \u201c[Appellee\u2019s] speedy trial rights are not violated under statutory grounds\u201d and \u201c[appellee\u2019s] speedy trial rights are not violated under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>R.C. 2941.401</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">{\u00b6 4} The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, guarantee a criminal defendant the right to a speedy trial. <em>State v. O\u2019Brien </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 7, 516 N.E.2d 218. In <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 514, 523, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101, the United States Supreme Court declared that with regard to fixing a time frame for speedy trials, \u201c[t]he States * * * are free to prescribe a reasonable period consistent with constitutional standards * * To that end, the Ohio General Assembly enacted R.C. 2945.71 in order to comply with the <em>Barker </em>decision. See <em>State v. Lewis </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 624, 591 N.E.2d 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">{\u00b6 5} When a criminal defendant is incarcerated on an unrelated matter, the speedy-trial provisions in R.C. 2945.71 are tolled pursuant to R.C. 2945.72(A). Those incarcerated with untried criminal proceedings against them are not required to let those proceedings languish. When a defendant is incarcerated in a state correctional institution, the provisions of R.C. 2941.401 take effect. <em>Cleveland v. Adkins, </em>156 Ohio App.3d 482, 2004-Ohio-1118, 806 N.E.2d 1007, \u00b6 6. According to this statute, \u201c[w]hen a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment <em>in a correctional institution of this state, </em>and when during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in this state any untried indictment, information, or complaint against the prisoner, he shall be brought to trial within one hundred eighty days after he causes to be delivered to the prosecuting attorney and the appropriate court in which the matter is pending, written notice of the place of his imprisonment and a request for a final disposition to be made of the matter.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">{\u00b6 6} Because appellee was in prison in Kentucky in the custody of the federal government, the provisions of R.C. 2941.401 do not apply. See <em>State v. Centafanti, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 275, 2008-Ohio-6102, 898 N.E.2d 45. In reversing a Fifth District decision applying R.C. 2941.401 to a federal prisoner, the Ohio Supreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he trial court order and the opinion of the court of appeals in this case were premised upon the application of R.C. 2941.401. Because appellee was incarcerated in a federal prison in Ohio rather than in a \u2018correctional institution of this state,\u2019 see R.C. 2941.401 and 2967.01, R.C. 2941.401 does not apply.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Id. at \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>{\u00b6 7} This case is complicated in that appellee was in a municipal jail when the notice was sent to the trial court and the prosecutor\u2019s office. However, the Sixth District has correctly held that in order to take advantage of this statute, one must be in a \u201cprison of this state\u201d and specifically excluded municipal jails from the scope of the statute. <em>State v. Siniard, </em>Huron App. No. H-03-008, 2004-Ohio-1043, 2004 WL 413328, \u00b6 13. See also R.C. 2967.01. This view flows from the plain language of the statute. Therefore, appellee was not eligible under the terms of the statute to invoke the 180-day provision under R.C. 2941.401. Appellee was a federal prisoner and was required to comply with Ohio\u2019s codification of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (\u201cLAD\u201d), R.C. 2963.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">{\u00b6 8} In the state\u2019s second assignment of error, it contends that appellee did not comply with the IAD and is therefore not entitled to its protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">{\u00b6 9} This act was introduced \u201cto encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of * * * charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints * * * \u201d across all member states. R.C. 2963.30, Article I.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">{\u00b6 10} According to this act, a federal prisoner must be brought to trial within 180 days following the delivery of written notice to the appropriate trial court and prosecutor\u2019s office accompanied by \u201ca certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.\u201d R.C. 2963.30, Article 111(a). Article 111(b) requires the prisoner to send written notice requesting final disposition to the \u201cwarden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of him.\u201d This official is then required to send written notice to the appropriate locations along with a report listing the information in Article 111(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">{\u00b6 11} In <em>State v. Quinones, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 425, 2006-Ohio-4096, 860 N.E.2d 793, \u00b6 17, this court reaffirmed that substantial compliance with R.C. 2963.30 is the appropriate prism through which to view prisoners\u2019 actions to determine whether they properly avail themselves of the 180-day period. \u201c \u2018Substantial compliance\u2019 requires the defendant to do \u2018everything that could be reasonably expected.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State v. Ferguson </em>(1987), 41 Ohio App.3d 306, 311, 535 N.E.2d 708. Further, \u201c[t]he applicable standard of review requires us to \u2018 \u201cindependently determine, as a matter of law, whether the trial court erred in applying the substantive law to the facts of the case.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 10, quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>State v. Gill, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82742, 2004-Ohio-1245, 2004 WL 528449, \u00b6 8, quoting <em>State v. Williams </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 538, 543, 641 N.E.2d 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">{\u00b6 12} We hold that appellee did substantially comply with the IAD even though notice was not sent to the authorities charged with appellee\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>State v. Pierce </em>(Feb. 15, 2002), Cuyahoga App. No. 79376, 2002 WL 337727, \u00b6 4, this court found that notice forwarded by an inmate\u2019s attorney to the trial court and the prosecutor\u2019s office seeking to be brought to trial within 180 days was sufficient. In <em>State v. Levy, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 83114, 2004-Ohio-4489, 2004 WL 1902534, \u00b6 33, this court again found that notice mailed to the appropriate trial court and prosecutor could qualify as substantial compliance with the IAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">{\u00b6 14} The record reflects that appellee\u2019s notice was received by the trial court and the prosecutor\u2019s office, and the state could have found appellee and brought him to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">{\u00b6 15} Appellee provided enough information to invoke the IAD and the right to be brought to trial within 180 days. The notice contained his name, federal prison identification number, the institution where he could be found, and a request for trial on the charges pending in Cuyahoga County. This notice was actually received by the trial court and the prosecutor\u2019s office. The trial court properly granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss for violation of his speedy-trial rights, even though the court relied on an inapplicable statute. The decision was ultimately correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b284-11\">Kilbane, P.J., and Cooney, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-12\">. Appellee was ultimately transferred to the U.S. Penitentiary in Pine Knot, Kentucky.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-9\">. R.C. 2967.01(A) defines \"[sjtate correctional institution\" as \"any institution or facility that is operated by the department of rehabilitation and correction and that is used for the custody, care, or treatment of criminal, delinquent, or psychologically or psychiatrically disturbed offenders.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
