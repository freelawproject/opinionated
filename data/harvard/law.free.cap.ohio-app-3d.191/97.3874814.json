Boyle, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">{\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant, the state of Ohio, appeals from a judgment of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, Juvenile Division, dismissing a complaint against defendant-appellee, N.I., after it determined that it was in the \u201cbest interest of the child and community.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">{\u00b6 2} In August 2009, a complaint for rape was brought against N.I., \u201ca child of about the age of 13.\u201d In January 2010, the trial court found that the state had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>proved the complaint beyond a reasonable doubt and found N.I. to be delinquent by having committed rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">{\u00b6 3} In March 2010, N.I. moved the court to reconsider its finding of delinquency or to dismiss the complaint pursuant to his best interest under Juv.R. 29(F)(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">{\u00b6 4} After holding a dispositional hearing, the court found that \u201csubstantial grounds exist to mitigate the delinquent child\u2019s conduct\u201d and ordered the complaint against N.I. be \u201cdismissed pursuant to Juv.R.29(F)(2)(d) as the court finds that the dismissal is in the best interest of the child and community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">{\u00b6 5} It is from this judgment that the state moved for leave to appeal pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A), which this court granted. In its sole assignment of error, the state maintains:</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion when it dismissed the complaint pursuant to Juv.R. 29(F)(2)(d).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">{\u00b6 7} The state may appeal a juvenile court\u2019s delinquency decision only in limited circumstances. Section 3(B)(2), Article IV, Ohio Constitution; R.C. 2945.67; <em>State ex rel Leis v. Kraft </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 34, 10 OBR 237, 460 N.E.2d 1372. Pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A), the state \u201cmay appeal as a matter of right any decision * * * of a juvenile court in a delinquency case, which decision grants a motion to dismiss all or any part of an indictment, complaint, or information, a motion to suppress evidence, or a motion for the return of seized property or grants post conviction relief * * * and may appeal by leave of the court to which the appeal is taken any other decision, except the final verdict * * * of the juvenile court in a delinquency case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">{\u00b6 8} Thus, \u201c[p]ursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A), the General Assembly has given the courts of appeals discretionary authority to decide whether to hear an appeal from a decision adverse to the state other than a final verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Bistricky </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 157, 159, 555 N.E.2d 644, citing <em>State v. Fisher </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 22, 517 N.E.2d 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">{\u00b6 9} Here, the trial court dismissed the complaint against N.I. after the dispositional hearing, concluding that it was in N.I.\u2019s best interest to do so. Although the state normally has the right to appeal a decision by the trial court granting a motion to dismiss, in this case the trial court\u2019s decision to do so was a \u201cfinal verdict\u201d to which double jeopardy attached. <em>In re Arnett, </em>3d Dist. No. 5-04-20, 2004-Ohio-5766, 2004 WL 2426258, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">{\u00b6 10} In <em>Arnett, </em>the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>{\u00b6 11} \u201cIn <em>Breed v. Jones, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated that \u2018in terms of potential consequences, there is little to distinguish an adjudicatory-hearing * * * from a traditional criminal prosecution.\u2019 <em>Breed v. Jones </em>(1975), 421 U.S. 519, 580, 95 S.Ct. 1779, 44 L.Ed.2d 346 (holding that after adjudicating a case in juvenile court, the subsequent filing of the same charges in \u2018adult\u2019 court violated the defendant\u2019s right against double jeopardy). Furthermore, the Court announced that \u2018[j]eopardy attached when respondent was \u201cput to trial before the trier of the facts,\u201d that is when the Juvenile Court, as the trier of the facts, began to hear evidence.\u2019 Id. at 531 [95 S.Ct. 1779, 95 S.Ct. 1779] (citing <em>United States v. Jorn </em>(1971), 400 U.S. 470, 479, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543) (internal citations omitted). See, also, <em>State v. Penrod </em>(1989), 62 Ohio App.3d 720, 724, 577 N.E.2d 424.\u201d <em>Arnett </em>at \u00b6 20.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">{\u00b6 12} Here, there is no question that N.I. was \u201cput to trial before the trier of the facts,\u201d and that the trier of fact \u201cbegan to hear evidence.\u201d Indeed, the trier of fact heard all of the evidence and found N.I. to be delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">{\u00b6 13} Thus, a \u201c[Juv.R.] 29(F)(2)(d) dismissal effectively stands as an acquittal of the charges. As a result, the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment and Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution of the State of Ohio prevents the State from initiating any further criminal proceedings against [the juvenile] based on the allegations stated in this complaint.\u201d <em>Arnett, </em>2004-Ohio-5766, at \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">{\u00b6 14} Even when there is a final verdict, however, an appellate court may review substantive rulings of law when it is presented with an underlying legal question that is capable of repetition yet evading review. <em>State v. Bistricky, </em>51 Ohio St.3d 157, 555 N.E.2d 644, at syllabus. But if there is no \u201cunderlying legal question that is capable of repetition yet evading review,\u201d then the appellate court would be merely issuing advisory opinions and potentially impliedly commenting on the final verdict, which it cannot do. See, e.g., <em>State v. Brown </em>(Jan. 24, 2000), 5th Dist. No. 1999CA00188, 2000 WL 94084.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">{\u00b6 15} Here, the state concedes that the principles of double jeopardy bar the retrial of N.I. because the juvenile court\u2019s dismissal in effect resulted in his acquittal. But the state maintains that the juvenile court\u2019s actions \u201craise a substantive legal issue, capable of repetition, and should be addressed by this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">{\u00b6 16} The question before this court then is whether the state\u2019s appeal presents a substantive law issue that does not affect the verdict. Although we initially granted the state leave to appeal in this case, after further review, we find that there is no underlying substantive legal issue for us to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>{\u00b6 17} \u201cSubstantive law\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he part of the law that creates, defines, and regulates the rights, duties, and powers of parties.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 1470.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">{\u00b6 18} In its brief, the state does not explicitly point us to a legal question it wants us to answer. Rather, it argues that the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the complaint against N.I. for myriad reasons. But if we were to delve into these alleged abuse-of-discretion reasons, we would be required to engage in a factual analysis of this case \u2014 which we will not do. See <em>In re Tripplett </em>(Dec. 10, 1999), 11th Dist. No. 98-L-161, 1999 WL 1314666.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">{\u00b6 19} Accordingly, because a final verdict rather than a substantive legal issue is challenged in this matter, we are without jurisdiction and must therefore dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b135-8\">Blackmon, P.J., and Jones, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-13\">. The state originally requested that the record on appeal include the complete transcript pursuant to App.R. 9(B). But it later amended its praecipe pursuant to App.R. 9, requesting that only the original papers and exhibits be included, as well as a certified copy of the docket and journal entries. Thus, there is no transcript of any of the proceedings on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
