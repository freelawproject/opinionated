Burkart, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, that modified the amount of monthly spousal support that he owes to plaintiffappellee, Gail P. Burkart. Gail cross-appeals from the same judgment, and she also appeals the judgment denying her March 9, 2009 motion to compel. Because the trial court lacked jurisdiction to decide James\u2019s motion for modification, we vacate the judgment granting that motion. We reverse the judgment denying Gail\u2019s motion to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-15\">{\u00b6 2} The trial court granted the parties a divorce in an agreed judgment entry decree of divorce filed January 3, 2002. The divorce decree stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-16\">Commencing January 1, 2002, [James] shall pay, as and for spousal support, the sum of $5,300.00 per month * * *. The Court <em>shall </em>retain jurisdiction to modify this spousal support provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-17\">(Emphasis sic.) Within ten months of the entry of the divorce decree, James moved for a modification of his spousal-support obligation. James asked the trial court to reduce the amount that he owed in spousal support because the income he received through his landscape architectural business had \u201csubstantially declined given the nature of the economy, especially after September 11, 2001.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AB8\">{\u00b6 3} A magistrate conducted an evidentiary hearing on James\u2019s motion on June 22, 2004. Over a year later, the magistrate issued her decision. First, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>magistrate found that James\u2019s income had dropped significantly since the parties\u2019 divorce. According to the magistrate, James had earned approximately $190,000 in 2001, but in 2003 he had earned only $80,263. Second, the magistrate found that Gail had not presented sufficient evidence to prove that James\u2019s decline in income was contemplated at the time of the divorce. Third, after considering the R.C. 3105.18(C)(1) factors, the magistrate concluded that a decrease in the amount of spousal support to $2,239 per month was reasonable and appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">{\u00b6 4} Gail objected to the magistrate\u2019s decision. In an October 24, 2006 judgment entry, the trial court sustained some of Gail\u2019s objections and overruled others. The trial court held that the magistrate had erred in calculating James\u2019s 2003 income. The trial court found that in 2003, James had taken a $33,000 shareholder\u2019s draw from James Burkart Associates, Inc. (\u201cJBA\u201d), the S corporation through which James operated his landscape architectural business. The trial court characterized the $33,000 withdrawal as gross income, and it added that amount to the wages and benefits that James received from JBA to arrive at James\u2019s 2003 income. Combining James\u2019s gross wages, estimated yearly benefits, profit from JBA, and the $33,000 withdrawal from JBA, the trial court concluded that James\u2019s 2003 income totaled $131,565.64.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">{\u00b6 5} Although the trial court\u2019s calculation of James\u2019s 2003 income exceeded the magistrate\u2019s calculation, the trial court concurred with the magistrate\u2019s determination that James had suffered a substantial decline in income. Additionally, the trial court deemed credible James\u2019s testimony that he did not foresee the decline in income at the time of the divorce. Finally, after considering the amount of each party\u2019s income and the parties\u2019 relative earning abilities, the trial court modified the spousal-support award to $3,530 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">{\u00b6 6} James appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment to this court, and he argued that the trial court erred in attributing the $33,000 withdrawal to him as income. <em>Burkart v. Burkart, </em>173 Ohio App.3d 252, 2007-Ohio-3992, 878 N.E.2d 41. James contended that the $33,000 withdrawal was not income but a partial repayment of a loan that James had previously extended to JBA. We concluded that the trial court abused its discretion when it assumed that the $33,000 withdrawal came from JBA\u2019s gross receipts via proceeds JBA had received from customers. Id. at \u00b6 24-25. Because conjecture is an improper basis on which to compute a party\u2019s income, we remanded the matter \u201cto ensure that the trial court [was] not awarding [Gail] more spousal support than it would have awarded in the absence of conjecture concerning the $33,000 draw.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">{\u00b6 7} Upon remand, Gail filed a motion for contempt, asserting that James was in contempt of court for failing to pay her the full amount of spousal support set in the divorce decree. As Gail pointed out in this March 9, 2009 motion, James had admitted to unilaterally reducing the amount of the spousal-support pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>ments to approximately $2,000 per month beginning in January 2003.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gail requested that the trial court find James in contempt for underpaying; she also asked the court to set the amount of the arrearage that James owed. Additionally, Gail sought interest on the arrearage and an award of her costs and expenses in defending against the motion for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">{\u00b6 8} On September 1, 2009, the trial court conducted a hearing on the issues raised by the remand and Gail\u2019s motion for contempt. Both James and Gail presented evidence during that hearing. On March 9, 2010, the trial court issued a judgment that reconsidered Gail\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision and ruled on Gail\u2019s contempt motion. In deciding the objections, the trial court relied on evidence of the parties\u2019 incomes in 2006, 2007, and 2008, instead of the 2001, 2002, and 2003 income figures that formed the basis of the October 24, 2006 judgment. Using the more recent yearly incomes, the trial court set James\u2019s spousal-support obligation at $3,120.38 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">{\u00b6 9} With regard to Gail\u2019s motion in contempt, the trial court concluded that it lacked a valid basis on which to find James in contempt of court. Thus, the trial court denied the motion. The trial court did not address the existence or amount of any arrearage, and it did not rule on Gail\u2019s request for costs and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">{\u00b6 10} Both James and Gail now appeal from the trial court\u2019s March 9, 2010 judgment. James assigns the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">[ 1] The trial court erred in setting the level of spousal support effective November 1, 2002 based upon the court\u2019s averaging determination of defendant\u2019s income for the years 2006, 2007, and 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-9\">[ 2] The trial court erred in setting the level of spousal support by applying the percentage of the original support order as representing the defendant\u2019s 2003 income without considering or addressing the criteria mandated in Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 3105.18(C)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">{\u00b6 11} On cross-appeal, Gail assigns the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-11\">1. The trial court erred by not ruling on whether it had jurisdiction to consider cross appellee\u2019s motion to modify spousal support. The trial court had no such jurisdiction. <em>Mandelbaum v. Mandelbaum </em>(2009), 121 Ohio St.3d 433, 2009-Ohio-1222, 905 N.E.2d 172.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>2. The trial court erred by failing to specifically determine cross appellee\u2019s 2003 income and make specific findings as to how the court arrived at said determination especially with respect to a $33,000.00 payment cross appellee received in that year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">3. The trial court erred by failing to rule on issues of arrearages, judgment on arrearages, statutory interest and costs even though cross appellant raised these matters by properly filed motions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">{\u00b6 12} Because Gail\u2019s first cross-assignment of error challenges the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to modify the spousal-support award, we will consider it first. By her first cross-assignment of error, Gail argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because James failed to establish that an unforeseen, substantial change in circumstances had occurred. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">{\u00b6 13} Pursuant to R.C. 3105.18(E):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">[I]f a continuing order for periodic payments of money as spousal support is entered in a divorce or dissolution of marriage action that is determined on or after January 1, 1991, the court that enters the decree of divorce or dissolution of marriage does not have jurisdiction to modify the amount or terms of the * * * spousal support unless the court determines that the circumstances of either party have changed and unless one of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">(1) In the case of a divorce, the decree * * * contains a provision specifically authorizing the court to modify the amount or terms of * * * spousal support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">(2) In the case of a dissolution of marriage, the separation agreement that is approved by the court and incorporated into the decree contains a provision specifically authorizing the court to modify the amount or terms of * * * spousal support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">Interpreting this provision, the Supreme Court of Ohio has held that a trial court lacks jurisdiction to modify a prior order of spousal support unless (1) the decree of the court expressly reserved jurisdiction to make a modification, (2) the court finds that a substantial change in circumstances has occurred, and (3) the court finds that the change was not contemplated at the time of the original decree. <em>Mandelbaum v. Mandelbaum, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 433, 2009-Ohio-1222, 905 N.E.2d 172, paragraph two of the syllabus. If these three jurisdictional prerequisites are met, then a court must determine whether spousal support is still necessary and, if so, in what amount. <em>Sweeney v. Sweeney, </em>10th Dist. No. 06AP-251, 2006-Ohio-6988, 2006 WL 3825251, \u00b6 23; <em>Grosz v. Grosz, </em>10th Dist. No. 04AP-716, 2005-Ohio-985, 2005 WL 534901, \u00b6 11; <em>Georgenson v. Georgenson, </em>10th Dist. No. 03AP-390, 2003-Ohio-7163, 2003 WL 23024538, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\"> {\u00b6 14} The party who seeks a modification of spousal support bears the burden of showing that a modification is warranted. <em>Burkart, </em>173 Ohio App.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>252, 2007-Ohio-3992, 878 N.E.2d 41, at \u00b6 21; <em>Friesen v. Friesen, </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-110, 2008-Ohio-952, 2008 WL 603191, \u00b6 38; <em>Sweeney </em>at \u00b6 23; <em>Georgenson </em>at \u00b6 11. This evidentiary burden is double-pronged. <em>Joseph v. Joseph </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 734, 736-737, 702 N.E.2d 949. First, the moving party must present evidence proving the jurisdictional prerequisites \u2014 the reservation of continuing jurisdiction in the decree and the existence of a substantial change in circumstances not anticipated at the time of the divorce. <em>Peters v. Peters, </em>12th Dist. No. CA2009-04-037, 2009-Ohio-5929, 2009 WL 3723008, \u00b6 15; <em>Carlisle v. Carlisle, </em>180 Ohio App.3d 569, 2009-Ohio-215, 906 N.E.2d 483, \u00b6 10; <em>Eckstein v. Eckstein, </em>9th Dist. No. 03CA0048-M, 2004-Ohio-724, 2004 WL 299032, \u00b622. Second, the moving party must adduce evidence demonstrating that the existing award of spousal support is no longer appropriate and reasonable. <em>Churchia v. Churchia, </em>11th Dist. No. 2008-G-2846, 2009-Ohio-1486, 2009 WL 819252, \u00b6 13; <em>Eckstein </em>at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">{\u00b6 15} Generally, appellate courts afford trial courts wide latitude in deciding spousal-support issues. <em>Sweeney </em>at \u00b6 22; <em>Georgenson </em>at \u00b6 12. Appellate courts thus review the modification of spousal support under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Booth v. Booth </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 142, 144, 541 N.E.2d 1028; <em>Wilder v. Wilder, </em>10th Dist. No. 08AP-669, 2009-Ohio-755, 2009 WL 418771, \u00b6 10; <em>Grosz </em>at \u00b6 9. \u201cThe term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">{\u00b6 16} In the case at bar, Gail acknowledges that the divorce decree specifically authorized the trial court to modify the spousal-support award. Consequently, Gail concedes that James satisfied the first jurisdictional prerequisite. Gail, however, contends that James failed to present evidence establishing the two other jurisdictional prerequisites.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">{\u00b6 17} First, Gail challenges the magnitude of the change in circumstances that James experienced. Gail contends that a \u201ccorrect\u201d calculation of James\u2019s 2003 income would reveal that James\u2019s income did not substantially decline between 2001 and 2003. According to Gail, a \u201ccorrect\u201d calculation would include the $33,000 withdrawal from JBA that James made in 2003. In its October 24, 2006 judgment, the trial court added the $33,000 withdrawal to James\u2019s 2003 income and computed his annual income at $131,565.64. Thus, even under the income calculation Gail espouses, James\u2019s 2003 income dropped by approximately one-third when compared to his $190,000 income in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c[I]n order to merit any adjustment, the change in the parties\u2019 economic situation must be of such a degree as to be described as \u2018drastic.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number><em>Mottice v. Mottice </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 731, 734, 693 N.E.2d 1179. Here, when a party\u2019s income declined by one-third in the period since the divorce, the trial court acted well within its discretion in concluding that a drastic change in circumstances had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">{\u00b6 19} In addition to being substantial, the change in circumstances also must be unforeseen. <em>Mandelbaum, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 433, 2009-Ohio-1222, 905 N.E.2d 172, at paragraph two of the syllabus. Gail argues that James faded to present any evidence demonstrating that he did not contemplate a substantial drop in his income at the time of the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">{\u00b6 20} In its October 24, 2006 judgment, the trial court addressed Gail\u2019s contention that \u201cby filing his Motion to Modify Spousal Support on November 1, 2002, only ten months after the Decree of Divorce was journalized, [James\u2019s] alleged change in circumstances was foreseeable at the time of the divorce and, thus, does not warrant modification.\u201d The trial court rejected this argument, finding credible James\u2019s testimony that a substantial decline in income was unforeseeable at the time of the divorce. However, James never testified that he did not anticipate a substantial drop in income in late 2001 (when he agreed to the terms of the divorce decree) or early 2002 (when the trial court journalized the divorce decree). In fact, James testified that in late 2001, he perceived a downturn in the landscape architectural business. James foresaw that this downturn would lead to a decline in his income, and he raised this issue prior to the entry of the divorce decree. During direct examination, James and his attorney engaged in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">Q: Jim, I want to go back then, and I want to touch on some of this. This is a decline of several hundred [thousand] dollars in terms of gross revenues from 2001 to 2002. What happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">A: Well, this was brought up at the original divorce trial. I tried to tell everybody that business was starting to slow down, we were at the time very fortunate we were working on several large projects of very lucrative projects for Ohio University which was for their football field. We had Easton Town Center going on, and several other nice large projects. Even prior to the divorce settlement we were starting to see a big slack, especially in the commercial market. And then when 9/11 hit, that absolutely stopped most things. As the economy dropped, and everybody is aware the economy dropped, as it got bad in certain areas, and unfortunately they were my areas, what I really found out was that a lot of other landscape architects, engineers, which are all my competition, are obviously trying to go after the same projects. So where I would go in and interview and have one or two competitors there to compete with, we find we were getting 20 or 30 compet\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>tors coming from around the United States. And projects I was sure I was going to get, I was losing them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">{\u00b6 21} On cross-examination, Gail\u2019s attorney elicited the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT8\">Q: And if I understand what you testified to [earlier,] * * * you brought it up at the original divorce that there was going to be this decline in your income, and those were concerns that you raised at the time of this agreement, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">A: I believe that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">{\u00b6 22} James, as the moving party, bore the burden of proving that he did not contemplate a substantial decline in his income at the time of the divorce. James did not meet this burden. The record is devoid of any evidence indicating that in late 2001 and early 2002, James was unaware that his income would soon substantially decrease. Moreover, James\u2019s testimony suggests that he actually anticipated earning less in the future. Given the state of the record, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that the evidence established an unforeseen, substantial change in circumstances. The trial court, therefore, lacked the jurisdiction to modify the spousal-support award.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">{\u00b6 28} In arguing to the contrary, James maintains that this court should not apply <em>Mandelbamn </em>retroactively. In <em>Mandelbaum, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio addressed whether a trial court could modify spousal support without a finding that a substantial change in circumstances had occurred that was not contemplated at the time of the original decree. The court held that a trial court lacks the jurisdiction to modify a spousal-support award absent such a finding. <em>Mandelbaum, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 433, 2009-Ohio-1222, 905 N.E.2d 172, at paragraph two of the syllabus. While <em>Mandelbamn </em>marked the first occasion that the Supreme Court of Ohio addressed this issue, this court has long held that modification of a spousal-support order requires a finding of a substantial change in circumstances that was not contemplated at the time of the order. See id. at \u00b6 17, quoting <em>Leighner v. Leighner </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 214, 215, 515 N.E.2d 625. In this case, therefore, the resolution of the jurisdictional issue does not require a retroactive application of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">{\u00b6 24} Our conclusion that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to modify the original spousal-support order renders the trial court\u2019s judgment on James\u2019s motion void. Given the lengthy history of this litigation, we regret having to reach this result. However, subject-matter jurisdiction is a condition precedent to a court\u2019s ability to hear a case. <em>State ex rel. Jones v. Suster </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 70, 75, 701 N.E.2d 1002. See also <em>Cheap Escape Co., Inc. v. Haddox, L.L.C., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 493, 2008-Ohio-6323, 900 N.E.2d 601, \u00b6 6 (\u201c \u2018Subject-matter jurisdiction of a court connotes the power to hear and decide a case upon its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>merits\u2019 and \u2018defines the competency of a court to render a valid judgment in a particular action\u2019 \u201d). If a court acts without jurisdiction, then any judgment by that court is void. <em>Jones </em>at 75. An appellate court cannot allow a judgment rendered in the absence of jurisdiction to stand merely for the sake of convenience or efficiency. <em>Morrison v. Allstate Indemn. </em>Co. (C.A.11, 2000), 228 F.3d 1255, 1261 (holding that subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be \u201csupplanted by considerations of convenience and efficiency\u201d); <em>Laughlin v. Kmart Corp. </em>(C.A.10, 1995), 50 F.3d 871, 874 (holding that \u201c \u2018subject matter jurisdiction is not a matter of equity or of conscience or of efficiency,\u2019 but is a matter of the \u2018lack of judicial <em>power </em>to decide a controversy\u2019 \u201d [emphasis sic]).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">{\u00b6 25} Moreover, Gail\u2019s failure to challenge the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction in the prior appeal does not alter the outcome of this appeal. \u201c \u2018Because subject-matter jurisdiction goes to the power of the court to adjudicate the merits of a case, it can never be waived and may be challenged at any time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rosen v. Celebrezze, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 241, 2008-Ohio-853, 883 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 45, quoting <em>Pratts v. Hurley, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 81, 2004-Ohio-1980, 806 N.E.2d 992, \u00b6 11. See also <em>Jones </em>at 75, 701 N.E.2d 1002 (holding that \u201c[a] jurisdictional defect cannot be waived\u201d and that \u201cthe lack of jurisdiction can be raised at any time\u201d); <em>State ex rel.

E.2d 789 (\u201cthe issue of subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be waived and therefore can be raised at any time during the proceedings\u201d); <em>In re Palmer </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 194, 196, 12 OBR 259, 465 N.E.2d 1312 (\u201cIn questions of subject-matter jurisdiction a theory of waiver cannot be invoked even where the jurisdictional issue was not raised in a timely fashion\u201d); <em>Cohen v.

Consequently, even when a party waits until a second appeal to challenge the trial court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction, an appellate court cannot rely on the waiver doctrine to avoid consideration of the jurisdictional question.

DaimlerChrysler Corp. </em>(C.A.6, 2005), 157 Fed.Appx. 813, 817 (same). Because \u201ca trial court\u2019s ability to revisit a spousal support award is a jurisdictional issue not subject to waiver,\u201d we must determine whether the trial court possessed subject-matter jurisdiction over this matter, regardless of Gail\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>untimely assertion of the issue. <em>Ballas v. Ballas, </em>7th Dist. No. 08 MA 166, 2009-Ohio-4965, 2009 WL 3003982, \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">{\u00b6 26} We conclude that because James failed to adduce any evidence proving that he did not anticipate the substantial decline in his income, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to modify the original spousal-support award. Accordingly, we sustain Gail\u2019s first cross-assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">{\u00b6 27} Given our ruling on Gail\u2019s first cross-assignment of error, we need not address James\u2019s assignments of error or Gail\u2019s second cross-assignment of error. These three assignments of error challenge the merits of the trial court\u2019s decision, and our conclusion that the trial court lacked jurisdiction renders moot all arguments going to the merits. Accordingly, we overrule James\u2019s two assignments of error and Gail\u2019s second cross-assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">{\u00b6 28} By Gail\u2019s third cross-assignment of error, she argues that the trial court erred in failing to (1) determine the amount of James\u2019s arrearage and (2) rule on her request for interest on the arrearage and her court costs and expenses. As we stated above, Gail\u2019s March 9, 2009 motion for contempt asked the trial court to specify the amount of James\u2019s arrearage given his failure to pay the full $5,300 in monthly spousal support as required by the divorce decree. Additionally, Gail sought an award of interest on the arrearage and the costs of defending against the motion for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">{\u00b6 29} In response to this assignment of error, James contends that the trial court neither heard nor ruled on Gail\u2019s March 9, 2009 motion. James is wrong. At the September 1, 2009 hearing, the parties argued the March 9, 2009 motion for contempt and submitted evidence regarding the amount of monthly spousal support that James had previously paid. In its March 9, 2010 judgment, the trial court denied Gail\u2019s motion for contempt. However, the trial court did not refer to or rule upon Gail\u2019s request that it set an arrearage amount and award her interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">{\u00b6 30} If a trial court fails to rule on a request for relief contained in a motion, an appellate court will presume that the trial court denied the requested relief. <em>Swinehart v. Swinehart, </em>5th Dist. No. 06-COA-020, 2007-Ohio-6174, 2007 WL 4105634, \u00b6 26 (presuming an implicit denial of a party\u2019s request for attorney and expert fees contained within a motion for relief from judgment based on the trial court\u2019s silence on the issue). See also <em>State ex rel. The V Cos. v. Marshall </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 467, 469, 692 N.E.2d 198 (holding that an appellate court ordinarily presumes that a trial court overruled a motion when the trial court fails to explicitly rule on the motion). Consequently, a trial court\u2019s failure to rule on request for relief contained in a motion is not, ordinarily, a reason for reversal. <em>Vahdati\u2019bana v. Scott R. Roberts &amp; Assoc. Co., L.P.A., </em>10th Dist. No. 07AP-581, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>2008-Ohio-1219, 2008 WL 713936, \u00b6 14 (\u201cthe failure to rule on the motion is not, by itself, a basis for us to reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment\u201d). As the trial court\u2019s failure to rule cannot constitute error, we will instead construe Gail\u2019s cross-assignment of error as an attack on the trial court\u2019s implicit denial of her request for a determination of the arrearage and an award of interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">{\u00b6 31} At the time the trial court decided Gail\u2019s motion for contempt, it had just reduced James\u2019s spousal-support obligation to $3,120.38 per month, and it made that reduction retroactive to November 1, 2002 (the date James filed his motion for modification). According to the evidence adduced at the two evidentiary hearings, the amounts James actually paid in monthly spousal support between November 1, 2002, and March 9, 2009 (the date Gail filed her contempt motion), varied. For the first year after the divorce, James paid $5,300 per month, as directed by the original divorce decree. James unilaterally reduced the spousal-support payment to $2,000 per month in January 2003, and he remitted that amount each month until July 15, 2005 (the date the magistrate rendered her decision). Then, from July 15, 2005, James paid at least $2,239 per month (and perhaps as high as $2,609.75 per month). Comparing these actual payment figures to the $3,120.38 monthly payment ordered by the trial court, we cannot escape the conclusion that James owed an arrearage. Therefore, we find that the trial court erred in denying Gail\u2019s request that it determine the amount of James\u2019s arrearage.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">{\u00b6 32} Although Gail states that she is clearly entitled to a judgment for interest on the arrearage amount and costs, she presents no argument explaining why she is entitled to that relief. The appellant, not the appellate court, must construct the legal arguments in support of an appeal. <em>State ex rel. Petro v. Gold, </em>166 Ohio App.3d 371, 2006-Ohio-943, 850 N.E.2d 1218, \u00b6 94. \u201c \u2018An appellate court need not guess at undeveloped claims on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kuper v. Halbach, </em>10th Dist. No. 09AP-899, 2010-Ohio-3020, 2010 WL 2638520, \u00b686, quoting <em>Allen v. Allen, </em>10th Dist. No. 04AP-1341, 2005-Ohio-5993, 2005 WL 3009238, \u00b6 27. With no argument to consider, we must conclude that the trial court did not err in denying Gail interest and costs. Accordingly, we sustain Gail\u2019s third cross-assignment of error to the extent that it posits error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to calculate James\u2019s arrearage, but we overrule Gail\u2019s third cross-assignment of error to the extent that it claims error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to award Gail interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">{\u00b6 33} For the foregoing reasons, we sustain Gail\u2019s first cross-assignment of error, overrule as moot Gail\u2019s second cross-assignment of error and James\u2019s two assignments of error, and sustain in part and overrule in part Gail\u2019s third cross-assignment of error. We reverse the portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment denying Gail\u2019s motion for contempt, and we vacate that portion of the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>judgment ruling on James\u2019s motion for modification. We remand this matter to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, so that it can set the amount of James\u2019s spousal-support arrearage.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Judgment reversed in part and vacated in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b215-5\">Bryant and McGrath, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-12\">. During the September 1, 2009 hearing, James testified that he had paid at least $2,239 a month in spousal support since the issuance of the magistrate's decision. James\u2019s attorney stated that at the time of the September 1, 2009 hearing, James was paying spousal support in the amount of $31,317 per year, or $2,609.75 per month. Regardless of whether James remitted $2,239 or $2,609.75 per month, neither figure matched the $5,300 in spousal support that the original divorce decree ordered James to pay.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
