Before doing so, however, Englewood failed to afford Turner any administrative remedies concerning either its nuisance or demolition determination. Turner brought a \u201ctakings\u201d claim against Englewood, seeking to recover damages for the city\u2019s violation of her right to procedural due process of law. But a jury concluded that Englewood\u2019s demolition was justified, finding that the building was a nuisance and that abatement by demolition was reasonably necessary. Englewood then asked the trial court to declare that it was entitled under its Building and Housing Code, as well as under the Revised Code, to collect the cost of demolition from Turner. The trial court entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">{\u00b6 2} Turner appeals only the declaratory judgment. Turner contends that Englewood\u2019s violation of her right to due process of law should preclude the city from collecting its demolition costs. Turner also alleges that Englewood failed to follow the demolition procedures in its own Codified Ordinances, and she contends that this failure, too, should preclude Englewood from collecting its costs. We agree with Turner\u2019s allegation and contentions and will reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">{\u00b6 3} Turner owns real property in Englewood, Ohio, on which (before it was demolished) a dilapidated nursing home sat. In early July 2003, Englewood\u2019s housing officer identified structural defects and other conditions that violated the Building and Housing Code of the city\u2019s Codified Ordinances, rendering the building a nuisance. The housing officer sent Turner a notice of violation, as well as an order that gave her 30 days in which to either fully abate the nuisance or work out an abatement plan with the city. Turner did neither. Later that July, the Englewood city council adopted a resolution that affirmed the housing officer\u2019s nuisance and abatement determinations. Around three months later, on October 30, 2003, Englewood filed in the court of common pleas a nuisance-abatement action against Turner that asked the court to order abatement. Englewood moved for summary judgment. In December 2004, the trial court sustained Englewood\u2019s motion after concluding that Turner could not contest the nuisance determination. The court found that Turner had failed to exhaust the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>administrative remedy available to her in (former) section 1454.17 of the Building and Housing Code: \u201cDeterminations of Council in conjunction with the administration of this chapter may be appealed only to the Court of Common Pleas. Council shall hear appeals from rulings of the Housing Officer.\u201d Englewood Codified Ordinances (\u201cE.C.O.\u201d) 1454.17(b). The court said that Turner could have appealed the housing officer\u2019s notice to the council or she could have appealed the council\u2019s resolution to the common pleas court. The trial court ordered Turner to abate the nuisance within 30 days. The court said that if Turner failed to abate, Englewood could move to hold her in contempt and submit evidence of how much it would cost the city to abate and repair the nuisance on Turner\u2019s behalf. The next month, January 2005, Turner filed a separate action that challenged the council\u2019s resolution, an action that the trial court consolidated with Englewood\u2019s. Englewood then moved for summary judgment on Turner\u2019s complaint, and the court sustained the motion. Turner appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">{\u00b6 4} While we were considering Turner\u2019s appeal, in September 2005, Englewood sent Turner\u2019s attorney a short letter that declared the city\u2019s intent within 30 days to demolish the building. Turner sought a stay of execution from the trial court, and the court agreed to stay its judgment if Turner posted a $75,000 supersedeas bond.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Turner moved this court to modify the amount, but we denied the motion, unable to conclude that the trial court had abused its discretion. Turner did not post the bond, and, in December 2005, Englewood began demolition, which was completed by the beginning of January 2006 at a total cost of $63,991.15. No one informed us that the building was demolished.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">{\u00b6 5} In May 2006, we reversed the trial court\u2019s two grants of summary judgment for Englewood. See <em>Englewood v. Turner, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 41, 2006-Ohio-2667, 858 N.E.2d 431 <em>(Turner </em>I). We found that Turner had no administrative remedy that she could have exhausted. Despite the provision in the Building and Housing Code that suggested some sort of appeal, we found that the code provided no procedure for such an appeal, nor did it contain a provision for a hearing or other opportunity to present evidence. We also found that Turner was never informed that she had a right to a hearing. Finally, we concluded that despite section 1454.17\u2019s authorization, under the Administrative Procedure Act, council resolutions were not subject to common-pleas-court review. We remanded the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">{\u00b6 6} On remand, Turner moved to amend her complaint. She wanted to add a counterclaim that sought compensation for Englewood\u2019s taking of her property without due process of law. Turner also wanted to add a declaratory-judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>claim that the $63,991.15 lien attached to her property was invalid \u2014 a lien that Englewood was using to collect its demolition costs. In June 2007, the trial court overruled Turner\u2019s motion, finding it moot in light of the fact that she had failed to post the bond and the building had already been demolished. The court then concluded that its judgment was satisfied and any claims that Turner could raise were moot, so it dismissed the case. Turner again appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">{\u00b6 7} In September 2008, we again reversed, holding that the trial court should have allowed Turner to both add a takings claim and seek a declaratory judgment that the lien was invalid. See <em>Englewood v. Turner, </em>178 Ohio App.3d 179, 2008-Ohio-4637, 897 N.E.2d 213 <em>(Turner </em>II). We first determined that a property owner may recover damages from a municipality for the latter\u2019s taking of property (using its police powers) without due process of law. We then said, citing <em>Turner I, </em>that \u201cTurner was not afforded proper administrative remedies regarding abatement of the nuisance.\u201d <em>Turner II </em>at \u00b6 37. We said that \u201cthere has never been a judicial determination of a public nuisance, nor did Turner have an opportunity to be heard at an administrative level with a judicial review of whether a public nuisance existed.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 54. And we said that while statutory law allows municipalities to collect demolition costs by placing a hen on the property, courts have permitted challenges based on claims of nonliability. Id. at \u00b6 55. In remanding the case, we said that the burden was on Englewood to prove that it was justified in destroying Turner\u2019s building.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">{\u00b6 8} Also in <em>Turner II, </em>we rejected Englewood\u2019s argument that Turner had an opportunity to be heard but failed to post the bond that would have prevented the demolition. We found that the trial court\u2019s nuisance-abatement judgment did not expressly authorize demolition. Rather, it said that if Turner failed to abate, Englewood could move for a contempt order and submit evidence of the costs associated with abatement and repair \u2014 neither of which Englewood did. We also found that the trial court\u2019s judgment mentioned only abatement and repair, saying nothing about demolition. We concluded that at the very least, a factual question existed concerning the judgment\u2019s meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">{\u00b6 9} Finally, in <em>Turner II, </em>we noted Englewood\u2019s apparent failure to follow its own demolition procedures found in the Building and Housing Code. We observed that Englewood amended the procedures in 2004 and added a provision (among others) specifically for situations in which the housing officer determines that a nuisance should be demolished. The provision directs the officer to send a \u201cdemolition notice of violation\u201d and specifies the contents of the notice. We found that Englewood sent only a letter of intent that failed to contain most of the required information.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">{\u00b6 10} On remand, Turner amended her complaint, and the case proceeded to trial on her takings claim. A jury concluded that Englewood was justified in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>demolishing Turner\u2019s building. The jury found that Englewood had proved by clear and convincing evidence both that the building did constitute a nuisance and that abatement by demolition was reasonably necessary. Englewood then moved for a declaratory judgment that it was entitled to demolition costs under section 1454.11 of the Building and Housing Code, as well as under R.C. 715.261. On February 3, 2010, the trial court entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">{\u00b6 11} Turner appeals now for a third time, appealing only the declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">{\u00b6 12} Turner presents two assignments of error that in essence allege one error: the trial court is wrong that Englewood is entitled to its demolition costs. The court is wrong, Turner contends, for two reasons. One, argued in the first assignment of error, Englewood should be precluded from collecting its costs because it deprived Turner of her right to due process of law. And, two, argued in the second assignment of error, Englewood should be so precluded because the city failed to follow its own procedures for demolishing a nuisance. We agree with both reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">A. No due process, no demolition costs</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">{\u00b6 13} Section 1454.11 of the Building and Housing Code, along with R.C. 715.261, permits Englewood to collect nuisance-abatement costs. But the right to these costs presupposes that abatement was valid \u2014 substantively and procedurally. The jury determined that Englewood was justified in demolishing Turner\u2019s building, that Englewood did not take Turner\u2019s property in violation of the substantive law. But Englewood accomplished the justified action by violating procedural law, which was not justified. Issues under the substantive law were determined by the jury; separate issues under the procedural law are determined here.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>Turner II, </em>we identified the pertinent consequence that a city incurs if it takes property absent due process of law. We said (quoting the Eighth District) that if a city deprives a property owner of due process of law, \u201c \u2018the city will be precluded from receiving its demolition costs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Turner II </em>at \u00b6 34, quoting <em>Cleveland v. W.E. Davis Co. </em>(July 18, 1996), Cuyahoga App. No. 69915, 1996 WL 403337, *6; see <em>Cincinnati v. York Masons Bldg. Assn., </em>Hamilton App. Nos. C-080003 and C-080019, 2008-Ohio-4271, 2008 WL 3878320, at \u00b6 41 (holding that because the property owner was <em>not </em>denied its right to due process, the city <em>could </em>collect its demolition costs under its building code and the Ohio Revised Code). Specifically, despite the fact that the demolition was lawful under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>substantive law, a city may not collect the costs of the demolition if the deprivation led to the demolition.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">{\u00b6 15} We have previously found that Englewood deprived Turner of procedural due process of law. In <em>Turner </em>/, we found that before her building was demolished, \u201cTurner * * * was provided with no notice of any right to a hearing or to present evidence.\u201d <em>Turner I </em>at \u00b6 20. We said in <em>Turner II </em>(quoting the Eighth District) that \u201c \u2018where a city has failed to provide a property owner with an opportunity for hearing or appeal prior to the razing of property, the city has denied the owner due process of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Turner II </em>at \u00b6 34, quoting <em>W.E. Davis Co. </em>at *6. A hearing before a taking \u2014 especially a taking-by-demolition \u2014 is critical. \u201cThe hearing affords the interested party the opportunity to appear and be heard in person, or by an attorney, in opposition to the proposed demolition of the building, and to do all of the following: (1) Present the party\u2019s position, arguments, and contentions; (2) offer and examine witnesses and present evidence in support; (3) cross-examine witnesses purporting to refute the party\u2019s position, arguments, and contentions; (4) offer evidence to refute evidence and testimony offered in opposition to the party\u2019s position, arguments, and contentions; and (5) proffer any such evidence into the record, if the admission of it is denied by the director of buildings and inspections.\u201d <em>York Masons </em>at \u00b6 45 (Painter, J., dissenting). Turner was entitled to an opportunity, at least, to persuade Englewood not to destroy her building; Englewood failed to afford her one.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">{\u00b6 16} Englewood\u2019s failure paved the way for it to demolish Turner\u2019s building. Englewood did so without affording Turner a single administrative remedy, which \u201crequires, at a minimum, notice, a hearing, and an opportunity to introduce evidence.\u201d <em>Turner I </em>at \u00b6 13, citing <em>State ex rel. McArthur v. DeSouza </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 25, 27, 599 N.E.2d 268. Englewood\u2019s destruction after deprivation precludes collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">{\u00b6 17} The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">B. Englewood failed to follow its own demolition procedures, which rendered the demolition unauthorized</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">{\u00b6 18} As noted above, in late 2004, Englewood amended its Building and Housing Code and added administrative remedies for property owners. Pertinent here are sections 1454.09 and 1454.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">{\u00b6 19} Section 1454.09 directs the housing officer to send a \u201cdemolition notice of violation\u201d to all interested parties. See E.C.O. 1454.09(a). This section also dictates the notice\u2019s contents: (1) a description of the nuisance property, (2) a description of the conditions that constitute a nuisance, (3) notice that the owner has 30 days either to demolish the nuisance or work out a demolition schedule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>with the city, and (4) the date and time (within 30 days of the notice date) that a prescheduled adjudicatory hearing will be held before the Property Maintenance Hearing Board (\u201cthe board\u201d). E.C.O. 1454.09(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">{\u00b6 20} As we said above, in <em>Turner II, </em>we found that Englewood failed to provide Turner with notice that complied with this section: \u201cInstead of sending a demolition notice complying with these requirements, Englewood\u2019s attorney sent Turner\u2019s attorney a \u2018courtesy\u2019 letter in September 2005, indicating that the city intended to proceed to demolish the existing structures on Turner\u2019s land within 30 days. None of the matters outlined in section 1454.09 were mentioned, other than the fact that Englewood intended to demolish the property described as 20 North Union Road.\u201d <em>Turner II </em>at \u00b6 48. Critically, Englewood also failed to hold the mandatory hearing. The failure to comply with its own procedures led Englewood to demolish Turner\u2019s building without proper authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">{\u00b6 21} The council, by resolution, authorized the demolition, but the council does not have jurisdiction over this matter. In the amendments to section 1454.18, council ceded jurisdiction to the board, \u201cdelegat[ing] to the Board the adjudicatory power to review demolition notices of violation as set forth in Section 1454.09(b).\u201d E.C.O. 1454.18(c). The board is directed, after the hearing, to issue a written decision \u201cas to whether the Housing Officer\u2019s decision as set forth in the notice of violation should be affirmed, reversed, or otherwise modified in whole or in part.\u201d E.C.O. 1454.18(k). Section 1454.09, too, states that it is \u201c[t]he Board [that] shall affirm, reverse, or modify the determinations made by the Housing Officer in the demolition notice of violation, including the existence of the nuisance and the demolition remedy deemed necessary by the Housing Officer, in accordance with Section 1454.18.\u201d E.C.O. 1454.09(b). Section 1454.18 plainly states that it is the board\u2019s decision that authorizes any abatement action. See E.C.O. 1454.18(k).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>{\u00b6 22} When Englewood amended its Building and Housing Code in 2004, the city established for itself a clear path to follow after the housing officer determines that nuisance property should be demolished. Yet here, Englewood inexplicably failed to follow that path. Instead, the council usurped the board\u2019s authority, having no jurisdiction to affirm the housing officer\u2019s determinations or authorize abatement of Turner\u2019s building. Englewood\u2019s destruction after usurpation also precludes collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">{\u00b6 23} The second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">{\u00b624} Because of its procedural misdeeds, Englewood is not entitled to its demolition costs. The assignments of error having been sustained, the declaratory judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b42-8\">Grady and McFarland, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b42-9\">Matthew W.
