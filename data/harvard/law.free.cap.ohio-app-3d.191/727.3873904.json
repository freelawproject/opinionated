Development. Donofrio, a leasing consultant, entered into an oral agreement with C.T.W. to provide consulting services for the leasing of commercial space developed by C.T.W. After the termination of Donofrio\u2019s services, a dispute arose over the amount of compensation still owed to him. The magistrate awarded damages of $32,000 to Donofrio, $12,000 of which was for work performed from May through August 2005. C.T.W. filed timely objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision with the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas. In reviewing the magistrate\u2019s decision, the trial court found that a subsequent agreement had resolved the disputed payment for the May-August period, and based on this conclusion the trial court subtracted $12,000 from the damages award. Donofrio\u2019s appeal contests the lower court\u2019s elimination of part of the recommended award.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">{\u00b6 2} Donofrio asserts that the trial court was unable to modify the magistrate\u2019s decision because the reasoning used by the trial judge was not set forth in the objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Donofrio\u2019s contention is without merit. Pursuant to Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(b), a trial court retains the ability to review and modify a magistrate\u2019s decision regardless of the content of any objections that have been filed. Even though the objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision did not address the trial court\u2019s ultimate basis for its modification, the trial court was permitted to employ its own reasoning and analysis in issuing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">{\u00b6 3} Donofrio further questions the legality of the trial court\u2019s modification, first, by arguing that the trial court\u2019s modification was against the manifest weight of the evidence. There is no basis to this argument. Donofrio\u2019s testimony established that the dispute over the money owed from May to August 2005 had been resolved, and he also submitted documentary evidence that supported the trial court\u2019s damages formulation. On appeal, an appellate court must determine only whether competent, credible evidence exists to support the trial court\u2019s decision. It would be difficult to argue that Donofrio\u2019s own submissions do not meet that deferential standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">{\u00b6 4} Donofrio also questions the legality of the modification by claiming that the court should not have relied on evidence that was introduced as part of C.T.W.\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. This argument is also unpersua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>sive. Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(d) allows the trial judge to accept additional evidence when resolving objections to a magistrate\u2019s decision. Furthermore, there is little in the record to suggest that the trial court actually relied on any additional evidence when it made its final ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant has not established reversible error in the trial court proceedings, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">{\u00b6 6} Donofrio is the owner and sole proprietor of Market Street Leasing, a leasing consultancy company based in Youngstown, Ohio. C.T.W. is the owner and developer of the Westford Lifestyle Community, a master-planned community located in Canfield, Ohio. After preliminary discussions in April 2004, Donofrio entered into an agreement with C.T.W. to provide consulting services in order to secure commercial tenants for the Westford Commons shopping center, a retail space located within the Westford Lifestyle Community.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">{\u00b6 7} Donofrio prepared a written version of the parties\u2019 proposed agreement and submitted it to C.T.W. C.T.W. never executed the document. In accordance with their oral negotiations, however, C.T.W. began paying Donofrio in May 2004. Pursuant to their oral agreement, Donofrio received $6,000 per month for his services. Payment continued, uninterrupted, through the following year. In May 2005, C.T.W. did not pay Donofrio for the first time. Though Donofrio continued to work for C.T.W., nonpayment persisted through August of that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">{\u00b6 8} In September 2005, the parties orally agreed on a new contract, whereby Donofrio would be paid $3,000 per month for his services. Donofrio received payment in ten of the following 14 months. Donofrio\u2019s employment was terminated by C.T.W. in October 2006. After his termination, Donofrio sent a letter to C.T.W. listing alleged outstanding payments in the total amount of $30,940. C.T.W. did not respond to the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">{\u00b6 9} Donofrio filed a breach-of-contract suit seeking the unpaid money in the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas on February 21, 2007. After mediation in the matter failed, a bench trial was held on March 13, 2009, before a magistrate. At the conclusion of the trial, the magistrate asked that parties submit posttrial briefs in lieu of closing arguments. The magistrate emphasized that the posttrial briefs should focus on what each party believed was the appropriate amount of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">{\u00b6 10} On May 14, 2009, after posttrial briefs had been received, the magistrate released his decision. As part of the decision, he awarded Donofrio $12,000 for work performed from May through August 2005, $12,000 for work performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>from September 2005 through October 2006, and $4,000 for his efforts on several liquor-license petition drives during the 2006 primary and general election cycles.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">{\u00b6 11} C.T.W. filed timely objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision on June 1, 2009. On June 11, 2009, the trial court, apparently unaware of those objections, adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendations and entered judgment against C.T.W. Due to its unresolved objections, C.T.W. filed a motion to vacate the trial court\u2019s judgment entry on June 17, 2009. The trial court sustained the motion and vacated its judgment entry. A hearing date was then set to resolve C.T.W.\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">{\u00b6 12} On July 13, 2009, the trial court again entered judgment against C.T.W., modifying the magistrate\u2019s decision in part and adopting it in part. Finding that a subsequent agreement between the parties had resolved the dispute over payment for the period of May through August 2005, the trial court modified the decision by eliminating the magistrate\u2019s $12,000 damages award for that period. Affirming the remainder of the decision, the trial court added the remaining damage amounts and entered a $16,000 judgment against C.T.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">{\u00b6 13} This appeal followed on August 11, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">{\u00b6 14} Analysis of Donofrio\u2019s assignments of error will be conducted in logical rather than numerical order.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe trial court erred in modifying the magistrate\u2019s decision based upon an alleged resolution of the dispute, when the objections to magistrate\u2019s decision did not raise the issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">{\u00b6 16} Appellant contends that the trial judge relied on an argument for eliminating $12,000 from the magistrate\u2019s decision that was improper because it was not raised by C.T.W. in its objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Appellant argues that according to Civ.R. 53(D), a party waives any error that is not specifically raised in objections to a magistrate\u2019s decision. A brief review of the process of reviewing a magistrate\u2019s decision is in order before we can resolve this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">{\u00b6 17} When a trial court refers a matter to a magistrate, subject to the scope of the trial court\u2019s referral, the magistrate prepares a decision on the matter. Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(a). This decision, however, is not a final judgment. A trial court must act on a magistrate\u2019s decision in order to give the recommendation the force of law. Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(a) (\u201cA magistrate\u2019s decision is not effective unless adopted by the [trial] court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">{\u00b6 18} Because a magistrate\u2019s decision is not effective unless adopted by the trial court, the parties are afforded the opportunity to object to the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>before its potential adoption. The parties have 14 days to file objections once a magistrate\u2019s decision is filed. Civ.R. 58(D)(3)(b)(i). If objections are timely filed, a trial court must rule on those objections. Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(d). If no objections are filed, a trial court is permitted to simply adopt the magistrate\u2019s decision as part of its judgment. Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">{\u00b6 19} The filing or failure to file objections, however, does not prevent the trial court from reviewing the magistrate\u2019s decision. Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cAction on magistrate\u2019s decision. <em>Whether or not objections are timely filed, </em>a court may adopt or reject a magistrate\u2019s decision in whole or in part, with or without modification. A court may hear a previously-referred matter, take additional evidence, or return a matter to a magistrate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">{\u00b6 21} Even if a trial court refers a matter to a magistrate, it retains the ability to employ its own judgment in the case, according to Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(b). The trial court judge retains jurisdiction and may exercise its own decision-making power in several ways. If objections are filed, the court must rule on those objections. It may then offer its own analysis on the same subjects. <em>O\u2019Bryan v. K &amp; H Co. Lakeshore Apts., </em>181 Ohio App.3d 741, 2009-Ohio-1417, 910 N.E.2d 1071, at \u00b6 30; see also <em>Schultz v. Wurdlow, </em>10th Dist. No. 09 AP 301, 2010-Ohio-1140, 2010 WL 1060648, at \u00b6 12. If no objections are filed or if the filed objections do not raise a particular issue, the trial court can simply proceed with its own analysis. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">{\u00b6 22} In its objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, C.T.W., employing the same argument it had advanced at trial, argued that Donofrio had been an at-will employee. The company argued that Donofrio\u2019s employment was therefore terminable at any time. According to C.T.W., when Donofrio accepted employment with another corporation in May 2005, his employment with C.T.W. was in effect terminated. C.T.W. concluded that it was improper to award $12,000 to Donofrio for a period of time that Donofrio was not employed. The trial court, in its judgment entry, agreed that C.T.W. did not owe Donofrio for the May-August 2005 period, but it reached this result on separate grounds. The trial court instead found that Donofrio and C.T.W. had resolved the prior wage dispute in their September 2005 employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">{\u00b6 23} Donofrio argues that the trial court\u2019s modification was improper because it was based on grounds outside those raised in objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision. C.T.W. had objected to the decision because it alleged Donofrio was an at-will employee. The company did not assert that a subsequent agreement had resolved the disputed payments. Donofrio contends that the trial court could modify the magistrate\u2019s decision only subject to C.T.W.\u2019s specific objection regarding Donofrio\u2019s alleged at-will status.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>{\u00b6 24} Appellant\u2019s argument is incorrect. As explained above, Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(b) allows a trial court to modify a magistrate\u2019s decision whether or not objections have been raised regarding the basis for the modification. Although Donofrio omits any discussion of Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(b), the rule plainly permits the modification of the magistrate\u2019s decision on the basis of the trial court\u2019s own review and determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">{\u00b6 25} Donofrio also argues that a party\u2019s failure to raise an objection to the magistrate\u2019s decision at the trial court level waives that party\u2019s ability to raise the issue on appeal. Donofrio is correct, but it does not help him in this appeal. If a party does not file an objection to a magistrate\u2019s decision regarding a particular issue, he or she is unable to raise as error on appeal the court\u2019s adoption of any factual or legal conclusion that was part of the magistrate\u2019s decision. Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)(iv). In the instant case, if C.T.W. had filed this appeal and was currently trying to argue new objections on appeal, it would be unable to do so. Here, however, Donofrio is the party appealing the lower court\u2019s actions, and C.T.W. is merely responding to appellant\u2019s arguments with possible reasons that might explain why the trial court, in its discretion, ruled as it did. C.T.W. cannot have waived assignments of error on appeal because it is not raising any errors. C.T.W. believes that the trial court\u2019s judgment is correct and is merely defending that judgment. Therefore, Donofrio\u2019s argument has no bearing on the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">{\u00b6 26} For all these reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Assignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-8\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThe trial court\u2019s decision that the disputed payments for the months of May, June, July, and August 2005 were resolved by agreement of the parties to accept $3,000 per month beginning in September of 2005, was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">{\u00b6 28} Donofrio argues that the trial court\u2019s modification of the magistrate\u2019s decision is against the manifest weight of the evidence. On appeal, an appellate court may reverse a trial court\u2019s modification only if it finds the modification to be an abuse of discretion. See <em>Arrow Fin. Servs. v. Kuzniak, </em>7th Dist. No. 06 MA 133, 2007-Ohio-2191, 2007 WL 1334546, citing <em>Wade v. Wade </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 414, 419, 680 N.E.2d 1305; see also <em>Marchel v. Marchel, </em>160 Ohio App.3d 240, 2005-Ohio-1499, 826 N.E.2d 887, at \u00b6 7. \u201c \u2018 \u201c[A]buse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140, quoting <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>{\u00b6 29} The standard of review for arguments regarding the manifest weight of the evidence is quite deferential. \u201cJudgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 280, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578. In this inquiry, a trial court\u2019s findings are presumed to be correct by an appellate court. <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 10 OBR, 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273. Because we defer to the trial court, appellate decisions finding lower court judgments against the manifest weight of the evidence are rare.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">{\u00b6 30} The dispute centers on a service agreement between the parties contained in two oral contracts, the first negotiated in May 2004, and the second formed in September 2005. The elements of a contract, whether oral or written, are well known:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c \u2018A contract is generally defined as a promise, or a set of promises, actionable upon breach. Essential elements of a contract include an offer, acceptance, contractual capacity, consideration (the bargained for legal benefit and/or detriment), a manifestation of mutual assent and legality of object and of consideration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kostelnik v. Helper, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-2985, 770 N.E.2d 58, at \u00b6 16, quoting <em>Perlmuter Printing Co. v. Strome, Inc. </em>(N.D.Ohio 1976), 436 F.Supp. 409, 414.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">{\u00b6 32} At trial, C.T.W. argued that Donofrio had terminated the contract in May 2005 by accepting a consulting position with another company. The company argued that the relationship was not reestablished until separate negotiations in September 2005 resulted in the formation of a new oral contract for Donofrio\u2019s consulting services. Donofrio, however, argued that his acceptance of a second job in May did not sever his work with C.T.W. He further argued that because C.T.W. never communicated to him that his services were no longer needed, he continued to work diligently for the company throughout the disputed May-August 2005 period.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">{\u00b6 33} The parties then negotiated a new contract in September 2005. The magistrate found that the parties had intended this new agreement to apply to the period of May through August 2005, as well. In this new oral agreement, Donofrio contracted to provide the same services he had provided under the previous agreement at a reduced rate of $3,000 per month. Therefore, the magistrate recommended compensation for the four unpaid months at the $3,000 per month rate. The trial court, however, determined that the September 2005 agreement had also resolved the prior dispute by simply absolving C.T.W. of any payment obligations resulting from the disputed period. There is no question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>that a prior contractual obligation may be discharged by a subsequent agreement, whether through novation, abandonment, release, settlement, or simple modification of the original agreement. <em>Snell v. Salem Ave. Assoc. </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 23, 32, 675 N.E.2d 555; <em>Citizens Fed. Bank, F.S.B. v. Brickler </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 401, 407, 683 N.E.2d 358; <em>Connelly v. U.S. Steel Co. </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 448, 452, 53 O.O. 350, 119 N.E.2d 843. In this case, the subsequent agreement was an oral agreement, and establishing the terms of an oral agreement is largely a factual determination made by the trier of fact. <em>Stanton v. Holler, </em>7th Dist. No. 07 BE 29, 2008-Ohio-6208, 2008 WL 5058995, \u00b6 15, citing <em>Rutledge v. Hoffman </em>(1947), 81 Ohio App. 85, 86, 36 O.O. 405, 75 N.E.2d 608. The trial court reviewed all the evidence that was before the magistrate, including the transcript of the magistrate\u2019s hearing, and made its own factual findings based on that evidence. In reviewing a magistrate\u2019s decision, the trial court is not bound by the findings made by the magistrate unless no transcript is filed of the magistrate\u2019s hearing. <em>Breece v. Breece </em>(Nov. 5, 1999), 2d Dist. No. 99-CA-1491,1999 WL 999759; <em>DeSantis v. Soller </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 226, 590 N.E.2d 886. A trial court\u2019s factual findings are presumed to be correct on appeal. See <em>Seasons Coal, </em>10 Ohio St.3d at 80, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273. We must only determine whether there is competent, credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">{\u00b6 34} The \u201c[t]erms of an oral contract may be determined from \u2018words, deeds, acts, and silence of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kostelnik, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-2985, 770 N.E.2d 58, at \u00b6 15, quoting <em>Rutledge, </em>81 Ohio App. 85, 36 O.O. 405, 75 N.E.2d 608, at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">{\u00b635} At trial, Donofrio explained that as part of their original May 2004 agreement, the parties had negotiated a so-called earn-out provision. The earn-out provision entitled C.T.W. to reimbursement for up to one half of Donofrio\u2019s salary based on commissions earned under the same agreement. To illustrate, under the May 2004 agreement, Donofrio was slated to earn $6,000 per month for a yearly total of $72,000. According to the agreement, he also stood to earn commissions on any leases secured by C.T.W. as a result of his services. In a complicated arrangement, however, the first $36,000 worth of commissions was essentially waived by Donofrio. C.T.W. was required to pay Donofrio only for commissions in excess of $36,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">{\u00b6 36} During the first year of his employment, however, Donofrio did not earn commissions in excess of $36,000. Because C.T.W. was unhappy with his performance, Donofrio appears to have attempted to mollify the company by modifying the earn-out provision. In his early testimony, Donofrio explained that as part of the September 2005 agreement, he applied the unpaid compensation owed him for the May-August 2005 period \u2014 pursuant to the new contract\u2019s rate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>$12,000 in total \u2014 to the earn-out amount. \u201cSo I \u2014 as a way of settling this agreement, I\u2019m including that $12,000 in more or less a payment to him.\u201d On cross-examination, he reaffirmed the pledge. \u201cThe 12,000, I mentioned to Chuck that I would forgo getting that if he would, you know, just agree to pay me the 3000 * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">{\u00b6 37} Not only did Donofrio testify twice that the September 2005 agreement had resolved the dispute over compensation for the May-August 2005 period, he also offered written evidence that confirmed his admissions. During trial, Donofrio offered into evidence a letter sent by him after his termination to Charles Whitman, president of C.T.W. The letter lists the compensation and fees C.T.W. still owed him as a result of their agreement. In the letter, he specifically states that the balance owed for the May-August 2005 period was $0. The zero sum, he explained, reflected the result of the September 2005 modification of the original earn-out provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">{\u00b6 38} On appeal, Donofrio claims that there was no agreement to resolve the unpaid compensation for the May-August 2005 period. This assertion, however, appears to directly conflict with the evidence offered by Donofrio himself at trial. Nothing offered on appeal suggests that Donofrio\u2019s own submissions were not competent or credible. Because competent, credible evidence supports the trial court's determination, there is no reversible error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">{\u00b6 39} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Assignment of Error No. 3</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-9\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cThe trial court erred in relying upon the affidavit of Charles Whitman attached to the objections to find that the parties resolved the four disputed months of payment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">{\u00b6 41} In support of its objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, C.T.W. attached an affidavit of Charles Whitman, president of C.T.W. Donofrio, relying on Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(b), protests this attachment. Civ.R. 53(E), however, was removed from Civ.R. 53 by amendment in July 2006. The amendment reorganized Section (E) as part of section (D) in the current version of Civ.R. 53. Because Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(d) retains the language of former Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(b), Donofrio\u2019s claim can be analyzed under the current rule. Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(d) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-11\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cBefore so ruling [on objections], the court may hear additional evidence but may refuse to do so unless the objecting party demonstrates that the party could not, with reasonable diligence, have produced that evidence for consideration by the magistrate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>{\u00b6 43} Donofrio asserts that this rule requires the court to preclude Whitman\u2019s affidavit unless C.T.W. demonstrated that it could not, with reasonable diligence, have produced that evidence at trial. Whitman, as president of the company, testified extensively at trial. Whitman's failure to testify about the issues regarding C.T.W.\u2019s objections, Donofrio argues, was simply inattentive trial preparation on the part of C.T.W. The information in Wdiitman\u2019s posttrial affidavit, with reasonable diligence, could and should have been presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">{\u00b6 44} Donofrio misreads the rule. Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(d) does not require courts to preclude additional evidence. Rather, the rule merely permits courts to preclude additional evidence if they wish to do so. The language of Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(d) is quite clear in this regard: \u201c[T]he court may hear additional evidence but may refuse to do so * * In the instant case, the trial court could have refused to accept Whitman\u2019s affidavit because of his previous testimony, but Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(d) did not require the court to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">{\u00b6 45} WTiether an affidavit is the type of evidence that could be admitted in support of objections to a magistrate\u2019s decision and how such an affidavit should be introduced as evidence are completely different questions. The parties do not address these matters in any detail, but we will assume for the sake of argument that there may be some problem with the way the affidavit was submitted. Even with this assumption, there is no reversible error in this case. Donofrio argues that the sole basis for the trial court\u2019s modification is contained in Whitman's attached affidavit. If WTiitman\u2019s affidavit had been disallowed, he argues, the trial court would not possess sufficient grounds for the modification of the magistrate\u2019s decision. A review of the affidavit, however, does not support his contention. WTiitman\u2019s posttrial affidavit offers little, if any, relevant information regarding the compensation for the disputed period. Wfiiile the trial court determined that the September 2005 agreement resolved the pay issue, WTiitman\u2019s affidavit reargues C.T.W.\u2019s oft repeated contention that Donofrio had been an at-will employee. As explained above, the trial court\u2019s modification of the magistrate\u2019s decision stems from Donofrio\u2019s own admissions during the trial proceedings, and not from any theory about at-will employment. Even if WTiitman\u2019s affidavit was disallowed, there is substantial competent, credible evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">{\u00b6 46} Finally, if there was a problem with how the affidavit was submitted as evidence, the trial judge in a bench trial is presumed to know the law, and it is further presumed that a judge will consider only relevant, material and competent evidence in arriving at a judgment. <em>E. Cleveland v. Odetellah </em>(1993), 91 Ohio App.3d 787, 794, 633 N.E.2d 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">{\u00b6 47} For these reasons, Donofrio\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">{\u00b6 48} Donofrio\u2019s three assignments of error are meritless. Despite Donofrio\u2019s assertions, Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(b) permits the trial court to modify a magistrate\u2019s decision beyond issues raised in the objections. Secondly, the trial court\u2019s modification, finding that the disputed payments for the May-August 2005 period were resolved by a subsequent agreement, was not against the manifest weight of the evidence because competent, credible evidence, Donofrio\u2019s own testimony, supported the modification. Lastly, although Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(d) would have allowed the trial court to reject additional evidence, such as Charles Whitman\u2019s affidavit, the rule does not require the trial court to do so. For all the aforementioned reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b773-7\">Vukovich, P.J., and DeGenaro, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
