For the following reasons, the trial court\u2019s order in case No. 09-CR-327 will be affirmed, the order in case No. 09-CR-44 will be reversed, and Anderson\u2019s sentence will be modified to reflect 174 days of jail-time credit, consistent with the amount ordered in case No. 09-CA-327.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">{\u00b6 2} Anderson was arrested on January 1, 2009, after he failed to comply with a police officer\u2019s order to stop his vehicle and fled at a high rate of speed. On January 13, 2009, Anderson was indicted on one count of failure to comply with an order or signal of a police officer. Clark C.P. No. 09-CR-20. The docket for that case reflects that bond was set at $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">{\u00b6 3} On January 21, 2009, Anderson was charged with possession of heroin, possession of crack cocaine, possession of powder cocaine, and two counts of trafficking in powder cocaine. Clark C.P. No. 09-CR-44. The trial court set bond at $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">{\u00b6 4} Due to an error in the indictment in case No. 09-CR-20, Anderson was reindicted on April 20, 2009, for failure to comply with an order or signal of a police officer. Clark C.P. No. 09-CR-327. At arraignment, bond was again set at $25,000. The trial court later dismissed case No. 09-CR-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">{\u00b6 5} In June 2009, Anderson pleaded no contest to possession of heroin, possession of crack cocaine, and possession of powder cocaine in case No. 09-CR-44, and to failure to comply with an order or signal of a police officer in case No. 09-CR-327.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">{\u00b6 6} Anderson was sentenced in both cases on June 19, 2009. In case No. 09-CR-44, he was sentenced to one year for possession of heroin, seven years for possession of crack cocaine, and four years for possession of powder cocaine, to be served concurrently for a total of seven years; Anderson\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended for five years, and he was ordered to pay an aggregate fine of $12,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">{\u00b6 7} In case No. 09-CR-327, Anderson was sentenced to one year in prison and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for nine years. Anderson\u2019s sentence was to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed in case No. 09-CR-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-13\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court awarded jail-time credit in both judgment entries. In case No. 09-CR-44, the court credited Anderson with \u201cjail time served since June 19, 2009 [the date of the sentencing hearing] until conveyance to the penitentiary system.\u201d In case No. 09-CR-327, the court credited Anderson with \u201cjail time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>served since January 1, 2009 [the date of his arrest on the failure to comply charge] until conveyance to the penitentiary system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">{\u00b6 9} Anderson was continuously incarcerated in the Clark County Jail from January 1, 2009, until his conveyance to the London Correctional Institution on June 24, 2009, as ordered in case No. 09-CR-44. With respect to case No. 09-CR-327, the sheriff conveyed Anderson by \u201cpapers only\u201d on June 30, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">{\u00b6 10} On August 5, 2009, Anderson filed a \u201cMotion for Correction of Jail Time Credit\u201d in both case Nos. 09-CR-44 and 09-CR-327. He argued that he should have received 174 days of jail-time credit, representing the time that he had spent in the Clark County Jail from January 1, 2009, until June 24, 2009, in both cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following a hearing on September 15, 2009, the trial court denied the motions without explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">{\u00b6 11} Anderson appeals from the denial of his motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">{\u00b6 12} Anderson\u2019s sole assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe trial court errored [sic] in denying defendant-appellant\u2019s postsentence motion for jail time credit. A trial court is mandated to grant jail time credit where a defendant was confined for any reason arising out of the case while in leiu [sic] of bond.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">{\u00b6 14} Anderson claims that the trial court erred in denying his motions for jail-time credit. He asserts that because his sentences in the two cases were run concurrently, he should have been credited with 174 days of jail-time credit (January 1, 2009 to June 24, 2009) in both cases and that his release date from prison should be January 1, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">{\u00b6 15} Anderson relies upon <em>State v. Fugate, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 261, 2008-Ohio-856, 883 N.E.2d 440, to support his contention. In <em>Fugate, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio addressed whether a defendant who is sentenced concurrently on multiple charges is entitled to have jail-time credit applied toward all terms of incarceration. The court noted that jail-time credit is governed by R.C. 2967.191 and the Ohio Administrative Code, and it clarified how credit is to be applied when multiple terms are imposed concurrently rather than consecutively. The court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>{\u00b6 16} \u201cWhen a defendant is sentenced to consecutive terms, the terms of imprisonment are served one after another. Jail-time credit applied to one prison term gives full credit that is due, because the credit reduces the entire length of the prison sentence. However, when a defendant is sentenced to concurrent terms, credit must be applied against all terms, because the sentences are served simultaneously. If an offender is sentenced to concurrent terms, applying credit to one term only would, in effect, negate the credit for time that the offender has been held. To deny such credit would constitute a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Therefore we hold that when a defendant is sentenced to concurrent prison terms for multiple charges, jail-time credit pursuant to R.C. 2967.191 must be applied toward each concurrent prison term.\u201d <em>Fugate </em>at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">{\u00b6 17} Discussing <em>Fugate, </em>we have held that \u201cthe date on which a subsequent offense was committed is irrelevant to the analysis and result the holding in <em>Fugate </em>requires.\u201d <em>State v. Cole, </em>Montgomery App. No. 23327, 2009-Ohio-4580, 2009 WL 2855890, \u00b6 13. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cSo long as two or more sentences are imposed concurrently, the jail-time credit applicable to each sentence applies to all sentences imposed. Whether the terms of the sentences are identical, as in the present case, or of different lengths, as in <em>Fugate, </em>their respective jail-time credits apply to each term of incarceration made concurrent. On that basis, any shorter jail-time credit for one sentence is subsumed into the longest jail time credit available for any of the concurrent sentences. Otherwise, the defendant is denied the credit to which he is entitled for that longer term.\u201d Id.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">{\u00b6 19} Although the state acknowledges our reasoning in <em>Cole, </em>it argues that we must affirm the trial court on the ground that Anderson failed to request a transcript of the September 15, 2009 hearing, and \u201cthe justification by the trial court in denying Anderson\u2019s motion is not before this Court.\u201d We find the state\u2019s argument to be unpersuasive. The record reflects the essential facts for this court to determine, as a matter of law, whether Anderson should have received 174 days of jail-time credit, in both cases, for time spent in jail in lieu of bond. Although we do not know what occurred at the September 15, 2009 hearing, we see no reason, given the issue presented, why a transcript of that hearing is necessary to address Anderson\u2019s assignment of error. If the state considered the transcript to be necessary, it could have sought to have Anderson file the transcript or it could have ordered the transcript itself. App.R. 9(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">{\u00b6 20} According to the record, Anderson was jailed on January 1, 2009. Bond was set in both criminal cases, and there is no indication in the record that Anderson was released on bond. To the contrary, in case No. 09-CR-327, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>court credited Anderson with \u201cjail time served since January 1, 2009 until conveyance to the penitentiary system,\u201d which occurred on June 24, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">{\u00b6 21} Because Anderson\u2019s one-year sentence in case No. 09-CR-327 was to be served concurrently with his seven-year sentence in case No. 09-CR-44, the respective jail-time credits apply to each term of incarceration. As we stated in <em>Cole, </em>the shorter amount of jail-time credit (the amount in case No. 09-CA-44) should have been subsumed into the longest jail-time credit available for any of the concurrent sentences, i.e., the 174-day period in case No. 09-CA-327. The trial court erred when, having imposed concurrent sentences in case Nos. 09-CR-44 and 09-CR-327, it failed to credit Anderson for the 174 days of jail time to which he was entitled in case No. 09-CR-327 against the sentence the court imposed in case No. 09-CR \u2014 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">{\u00b6 22} The assignment of error is sustained as to case No. 09-CR-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">{\u00b623} Because the court ordered 174 days of jail-time credit (January 1, 2009 \u2014 June 24, 2009) in case No. 09-CR-327, the assignment of error with respect to that case is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">. {\u00b6 24} Because the court ordered 174 days of jail-time credit in case No. 09-CR-327, the trial court\u2019s denial of Anderson\u2019s motion to correct the credit in that case will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">{\u00b6 25} The trial court\u2019s denial of Anderson\u2019s motion to correct jail-time credit in case No. 09-CR-44 will be reversed. Anderson\u2019s sentencing entry will be modified to reflect 174 days of jail-time credit, consistent with the amount of credit ordered in case No. 09-CR-327. The case will be returned to the trial court on our special mandate to modify the sentencing entry and to notify the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction of the modified sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b167-12\">Fain and Osowik, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b167-13\">Thomas J. Osowik, J., of the Sixth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-13\">. Anderson's motion did not indicate his scheduled release date from prison, although his brief states that he will be released on June 16, 2016. The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (\"ODRC\u201d) website reflects that Anderson\u2019s seven-year term began on June 24, 2009, and expires on June 16, 2016. Accordingly, it appears that the ODRC has calculated Anderson's release date based on eight days of jail-time credit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
