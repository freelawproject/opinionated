Strickland, pro se.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b107-7\">Preston, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">{\u00b6 1} Petitioner-appellant, Brian C., appeals the judgment entry of the Crawford County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, finding that consent from the biological father, appellee, Joseph Michael Strickland (\u201cStrickland\u201d), was required before the adoption of his minor child could take place. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">{\u00b6 2} The facts of this case are largely not in dispute. O.N.C. is the biological child of Anita C. and Strickland. Anita and Strickland were never married. However, on January 2, 2002, the Crawford County Juvenile Court designated Anita as the sole residential parent of O.N.C. and ordered Strickland to pay Anita the sum of $165.76 per month for the support of O.N.C. Subsequently, sometime at the end of 2006, Strickland became incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">{\u00b6 3} On December 8, 2009, a petition seeking the adoption of O.N.C. was filed by her stepfather, Brian C., in the Crawford County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division. The petition alleged that consent from the child\u2019s biological father, Strickland, was not required, because Strickland had failed, without justifiable cause, to provide for the maintenance and support of the child in the year immediately preceding the filing of the petition. Along with the petition for adoption, Anita filed a written consent to the adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">{\u00b6 4} A hearing on the petition was held on March 2, 2010. Only the testimony of Tina Howell, who was the caseworker for the Crawford County Department of Job and Family Services, Child Support Unit, was presented at the hearing. Howell testified that part of her duties at the department was to monitor child-support payments, seek work orders from the court if those payments were not being made, and then monitor the compliance of the work orders if issued. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>this particular case, Howell said that since January 22, 2002, Strickland had been ordered to pay $165.76 per month for the support and maintenance of O.N.C. As of February 2010, the total amount of the arrearage payments due from Strickland was $7,672.02. In particular, with respect to the payments made by Strickland from December 8, 2008 through December 8, 2009, Howell stated that Strickland had paid only $86.89.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result, Howell stated that based on her case file, for the period of December 8, 2008, through December 8, 2009, Strickland was not substantially current in his child-support obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">{\u00b6 5} On cross-examination, Howell acknowledged that prior to December 2008, Strickland had been close to being current on his child-support payments and that as a result of his incarceration at the end of 2006, Strickland\u2019s income had dramatically changed. Moreover, Howell acknowledged that despite Strickland\u2019s incarceration, he was still paying around 25 percent of what he was receiving as his state pay. Nevertheless, Howell stated that even though he was incarcerated, the department considered him to be voluntarily unemployed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">{\u00b6 6} At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court issued an order bifurcating the issues of parental consent and best interests of the child, and granted Brian C. one week in which to file a written argument of the facts and applicable law pertaining to the issue of whether consent from Strickland was required. Strickland\u2019s counsel had already filed her written argument and brief at the commencement of the hearing. In Brian C.\u2019s written argument, he argued that consent from Strickland was not necessary based on the amended language in R.C. 3107.07(A), which had recently become effective on April 7, 2009. Specifically, he argued that consent from Strickland was not required if he had faded to provide \u201cmore than de minimis\u201d maintenance and support for his child. Since it was clear that Strickland had contributed only $86.89<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the entire one-year period preceding the adoption petition, Brian C. argued that Strickland had clearly not provided \u201cmore than de minimis\u201d maintenance and support, and thus his consent to the adoption was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">{\u00b6 7} On March 12, 2010, the trial court issued its decision finding that consent from the biological father, Strickland, was required. Moreover, the trial court found that since Strickland had contributed something, even if it was only 1.6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>percent of his total obligation, his contribution was sufficient to require consent before the adoption petition could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">{\u00b6 8} Brian C. now appeals and raises one assignment of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Assignment of Error</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">The trial court\u2019s finding that the consent of the biological father was required is contrary to the April 7, 2009 amendment to O.R.C. \u00a7 3107.07.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">{\u00b6 9} In his only assignment of error, Brian C. argues that the trial court erred in finding that Strickland\u2019s consent was required despite the new language in R.C. 3107.07(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">{\u00b6 10} At issue here is the interpretation of the most recent amendment to R.C. 3107.07(A), which sets forth when consent from a child\u2019s biological parent is not required before adoption petition may be granted. In particular, the question is whether the phrase \u201cprovide more than de minimis\u201d pertains to both a biological parent\u2019s contact with the child and the maintenance and support of the child, or pertains only to the biological parent\u2019s contact with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">{\u00b6 11} Statutory interpretation involves a question of law, and thus, our review is conducted under a de novo standard of review. <em>Dawson v. Dawson, </em>3d Dist. Nos. 14-09-08, 14-09-10, 14-09-11, and 14-09-12, 2009-Ohio-6029, 2009 WL 3806251, \u00b6 45, citing <em>State v. Wemer </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 100, 103, 677 N.E.2d 1258. Consequently, we review the decision without deference to the trial court\u2019s interpretation. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">{\u00b6 12} Parental consent is generally required before an adoption petition can be granted. However, R.C. 3107.07 sets forth those circumstances under which parental consent is not required. Prior to the newest amendment, R.C. 3107.07(A) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-12\">A parent of a minor, when it is alleged in the adoption petition and the court finds after proper service of notice and hearing, that the parent has failed without justifiable cause to communicate with the minor or to provide for the maintenance and support of the minor as required by law or judicial decree for a period of at least one year immediately preceding either the filing of the adoption petition or the placement of the minor in the home of the petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9r\">However, effective April 7, 2009, the language in R.C. 3107.07(A) was modified by the legislature and now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-13\">A parent of a minor, when it is alleged in the adoption petition and the court, after proper service of notice and hearing, finds <em>by clear and convincing evidence </em>that the parent has failed without justifiable cause <em>to provide more than de minimis contact </em>with the minor or to provide for the maintenance and support of the minor as required by law or judicial decree for a period of at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>least one year immediately preceding either the filing of the adoption petition or the placement of the minor in the home of the petitioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">(Emphasis added.) As illustrated above, with respect to the amended statutory provision, the legislature clarified that the evidentiary standard was clear and convincing evidence, substituted the word \u201ccontact\u201d for \u201ccommunicate,\u201d and added the qualifying phrase \u201cto provide more than de minimis.\u201d It is this particular qualifying phrase that is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">{\u00b6 13} Here, Brian C. alleged in his adoption petition that Strickland had failed to provide maintenance and support as required by judicial decree for O.N.C. At trial, Brian C. argued that consent from Strickland was not necessary based on the new statutory language in R.C. 3107.07(A). Specifically, he argued that under the new statutory language, as long as he showed by clear and convincing evidence that Strickland had failed to provide \u201cmore than de minimis\u201d maintenance and support for his child, then Strickland\u2019s consent was not required for the adoption. Since Strickland had contributed only $86.89<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the entire one-year period preceding the adoption petition, he had clearly failed to provide \u201cmore than de minimis\u201d maintenance and support, and thus, his consent to the adoption was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">{\u00b6 14} The trial court disagreed with Brian C.\u2019s interpretation of the statutory language, and found that \u201cthe qualifying adjective of \u2018de minimis\u2019 must be applied to only the communication/contact side and could not be interpreted as also applying to the support side.\u201d The trial court also acknowledged that while Strickland had paid only 1.6 percent of his total yearly obligation, under this precedent, because Strickland had provided <em>some </em>support, it was sufficient to require consent for the adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">{\u00b6 15} Brian C. claims that the trial court erred in interpreting the new statutory language. In particular, he claims that the phrase \u201cto provide more than de minimis\u201d pertains to <em>both </em>a parent\u2019s contact <em>and </em>a parent\u2019s maintenance and support of their child, and thus, he only had to show that Strickland had failed to provide more than a de minimis amount of maintenance and support. Again, because Strickland had paid only $32.39 in child support, or 1.6 percent of his total yearly obligation, it is clear that he had failed to provide more than a de minimis amount of support, and thus, Brian C. claims that he was not required to obtain Strickland\u2019s consent for the adoption. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">{\u00b6 16} The primary goal of statutory interpretation is to arrive at the legislative intent. <em>Bailey v. Republic Engineered Steels, Inc. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 38, 39, 741 N.E.2d 121. The starting point is the statute\u2019s language; if the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>is plain and unambiguous, the inquiry is over, the language must be applied as written, and there is no need for the court to apply further rules of statutory interpretation. Id., citing <em>Provident Bank v. Wood </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St.2d 101, 105, 65 O.O.2d 296, 304 N.E.2d 378; <em>State ex rel. Savarese v. Buckeye Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 543, 545, 660 N.E.2d 463. However, when the statute\u2019s language is ambiguous, the court may consider several factors, \u201cincluding the object sought to be obtained, circumstances under which the statute was enacted, the legislative history, and the consequences of a particular construction.\u201d Id. at 40, citing R.C. 1.49; <em>State v. Jordan </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 488, 492, 733 N.E.2d 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">{\u00b6 17} We recognize that there is a split among the appellate districts as far as what level of support is necessary to satisfy R.C. 3107.07(A)\u2019s \u201cmaintenance and support\u201d provision for requiring a biological parent\u2019s consent before an adoption of their child. Some districts, including this one, have held that any meager contribution constitutes sufficient maintenance and support for requiring a biological parent\u2019s consent. <em>In re Adoption of Allonas, </em>3d Dist. No. 3-01-27, 2002-Ohio-2723, 2002 WL 1299766; <em>Celestino v. Schneider </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 192, 616 N.E.2d 581 (6th Dist.) (minimal support payment provided by natural father was sufficient to preserve his consent as jurisdictional prerequisite to child\u2019s adoption); <em>Vecchi v. Thomas </em>(1990), 67 Ohio App.3d 688, 588 N.E.2d 186 (2d Dist.) (child could not be adopted without biological father\u2019s consent since biological father had made support payments totaling $130 during one year preceding filing of adoption petition, which prevented finding that he had failed to provide for maintenance and support of minor child). However, other districts have adopted a more objective test, in which trial courts consider the totality of the circumstances outside just whether the biological parent gave some amount of money. <em>In re Crandall, </em>1st Dist. No. C-060770, 2007-Ohio-855, 2007 WL 625009, \u00b6 19-20 (finding that even though parent had made some payments, the biological parent had voluntarily quit her job and so the trial court\u2019s finding that she had failed without justifiable cause to provide adequate support and maintenance was supported by competent, credible evidence); <em>In re Adoption of Kilbane </em>(1998), 130 Ohio App.3d 203, 719 N.E.2d 1012 (8th Dist.) (finding that biological parent had failed to support child without justifiable cause since biological parent did not make any support payments until just prior to filing of adoption petition and biological parent\u2019s claims that he was unemployed throughout most of the year were contradicted by other evidence); <em>In re Adoption of Wagner </em>(1997), 117 Ohio App.3d 448, 690 N.E.2d 959 (11th Dist.) (finding that biological father had failed, without justifiable cause, to provide maintenance and support for his minor child since biological father paid less than 3 percent of his income in support even though he had sufficient income, and biological father failed to obtain employment commensurate with his level of education). Compare <em>Gorski v. Myer, </em>5th Dist. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>No. 2005CA00033, 2005-Ohio-2604, 2005 WL 1242168, \u00b6 17 (finding that biological father had provided sufficient maintenance and support, and consent was required when biological father saw the child every other weekend and provided the child with food, clothing, and toys) with <em>Garner v. Greenwalt, </em>5th Dist. No. 2007 CA 00296, 2008-Ohio-5963, 2008 WL 4918231, \u00b6 32-33 (finding <em>Gorski </em>distinguishable and finding that in this case evidence failed to establish that appellant provided support and maintenance for children, and thus, consent was not required when even though biological mother had some income and provided occasional necessities, adoptive parents provided children with food, clothing, educational necessities, and medical attention a majority of the time).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">{\u00b6 18} Unfortunately, despite Brian C.\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the recent amendment to R.C. 3107.07(A) fails to clarify what level of support is necessary to require a biological parent\u2019s consent to an adoption. In fact, when looking at the plain language of the statute, we believe th\u00e1t it is still not clear what amount of support is necessary to require a biological parent\u2019s consent. We note that the repeated use of the word \u201cprovide\u201d leads us to believe that \u201cde minimis\u201d applies only to a parent\u2019s contact. The statutory language prescribes that consent is not necessary when \u201cthe parent has failed without justifiable cause <em>to provide </em>more than de minimis contact with the minor or <em>to provide </em>for the maintenance and support of the minor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 3107.07(A). Because the statute repeats the word \u201cprovide,\u201d we believe that contact and maintenance/support are to be treated separately; and because \u201cde minimis\u201d follows only the failure to provide contact to one\u2019s child, we believe that contact and maintenance/support are to be treated differently so that \u201cde minimis\u201d pertains only to a parent\u2019s contact. This interpretation is consistent with courts\u2019 treatment of R.C. 3107.07(A). Courts have made it clear that because R.C. 3107.07(A) is written in the disjunctive, then <em>either </em>failure to communicate/contact <em>or </em>failure to support during the one-year time period is sufficient to negate the need for a biological parent\u2019s consent. <em>In re Adoption of McDermitt </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 301, 304, 17 O.O.3d 195, 408 N.E.2d 680. As a result, an adoption petitioner need only establish the biological parents failure to contact <em>or </em>failure to support, not both. <em>In re Adoption of Rodabaugh, </em>3d Dist. No. 5-05-33, 2006-Ohio-1419, 2006 WL 759707, \u00b6 9, fn. 1, citing <em>In re Adoption of Miller, </em>3d Dist. Nos. 8-02-22 and 8-02-23, 2003-Ohio-718, 2003 WL 354941, \u00b6 16. Therefore, along with our interpretation of the statutory language based on the repeated use of the word \u201cprovide,\u201d applying the qualifying phrase only to the word \u201ccontact\u201d would also be appropriate given prior courts\u2019 treatment of R.C. 3107.07(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">{\u00b6 19} Additionally, the legislative history of R.C. 3107.07(A) further supports our conclusion that the legislature intended the qualifying phrase of \u201cmore than de minimis\u201d to pertain only to a biological parent\u2019s contact. In 2008, the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Assembly enacted Sub.H.B. No. 7 (effective April 7, 2009), which amended the requirements for bypassing consent from a biological parent when granting an adoption petition. Prior to the final version discussed above, the bill originally provided for when the biological parent had to fail to \u201cregularly communicate\u201d or \u201csignificantly provide for the maintenance and support\u201d of their child. (127th General Assembly Sub. H.B. No. 7, as introduced.) This was the version that was passed in the House; however, it was ultimately amended by the Senate Health, Human Services, and Aging Committee. In particular, the committee replaced the House amendment\u2019s language that the biological parent failed to \u201cregularly communicate\u201d with the language that the biological parent failed to \u201cprovide more than de minimis contact\u201d with the minor child. (See Synopsis of Senate Heath, Human Services, and Aging Committee Report to Sub. H.B. No. 7, Legislative Service Commission, 127th General Assembly, Dec. 15, 2008). Furthermore, the committee also eliminated the qualifying term \u201csignificantly,\u201d which had qualified the biological parent\u2019s failure to provide for the maintenance and support, thereby leaving it the same as it had been before the amendment. Id. It was this particular version, without a qualifying phrase pertaining to \u201cmaintenance and support,\u201d that was ultimately enacted and became effective April 7, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">{\u00b6 20} In light of the version of the bill passed by the House, it is clear that the legislature\u2019s original intent was to have qualifying phrases for both a parent\u2019s contact and a parent\u2019s maintenance and support. However, the Senate committee amended the House\u2019s version by changing the qualifying phrase with respect to a parent\u2019s contact (\u201cmore than de minimis\u201d) and totally eliminated the qualifying phrase with respect to a parent\u2019s maintenance and support. Had the legislature intended the qualifying phrase to apply to both a parent\u2019s contact and to maintenance and support, it would have included the qualifying phrase in the statute. Instead, the committee amended the bill so that the qualifying phrase pertained only to a parent\u2019s contact, and it eliminated any other reference to a parent\u2019s maintenance and support. And it was ultimately this version (without a qualifying phrase for a parent\u2019s maintenance and support) that was enacted and effective at the time Brian C. filed his adoption petition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>{\u00b6 21} Overall, based on the above, we find that R.C. 3107.07(A)\u2019s qualifying phrase \u201cmore than de minimis\u201d pertains only to a biological parent\u2019s contact with the minor child and does not modify a biological parent\u2019s maintenance and support of their minor child. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s interpretation was not in error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">{\u00b6 22} Brian C.\u2019s assignment of error is, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">{\u00b6 23} Having found no error prejudicial to the appellant herein in the particulars assigned and argued, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b114-8\">Willamowski, P.J., and Shaw, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\">. The trial court noted in its judgment entry that the actual total amount paid by Strickland from December 8, 2008, through December 8, 2009, was $32.39 and not $86.89. When adding all of the individual monthly payments testified to by Howell, we agree that despite Howell's testimony, the actual total amount paid by Strickland supported by the record was only $32.39.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b108-8\">. Again, the record indicates that Strickland only paid $32.39 in child-support payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b110-10\">. Again, the record indicates that Strickland paid only $32.39 in child-support payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b113-6\">. Furthermore, we note that there is proposed legislation pending before the 128th General Assembly, which seeks to further amend the language in R.C. 3107.07(A). In particular, submitted S.B. No. 189 in its current version adds a provision specifically defining the phrase \u201cde minimis\u2019' and indicates that \u201cde minimis\u201d was intended to apply only to a parent\u2019s contact: \"A parent has provided more than de minimis contact with the minor if the parent has contacted the minor an average of one time per month during the year immediately preceding the filing of the adoption petition or the placement of the minor in the home of the petitioner.\u201d (128th General Assembly Sub.S.B. No. 189.) Moreover, the proposed bill attempts to clarify what it means to have failed to provide \u201cmaintenance and support\u201d to a child: \"a parent has failed to provide for the maintenance and support of the minor as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>required by law or judicial decree if the parent paid less than twenty-five per cent of the amount owed under a court child support order for the minor during the preceding time period without justifiable cause.\u201d Id. This proposed bill, while not binding authority, further clarifies the legislature's intent that the phrase \"de minimis\u201d in the amendment at issue applied only to a parent\u2019s contact with their child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b114-17\">. We note that Brian C. does not specifically challenge the trial court\u2019s finding that Strickland had provided some support, which was enough to require his consent, based on this court\u2019s prior decision in <em>In re Adoption of Alionas, </em>3d Dist. No. 3-01-27, 2002-Ohio-2723, 2002 WL 1299766. Therefore, we decline to discuss the precedential value of our prior decision at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
