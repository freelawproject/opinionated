Boyle, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Charles Waiters, appeals the amount of restitution the trial court ordered him to pay as part of his sentence. Waiters raises two issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">{\u00b6 2} \u201c[1.] The trial court erred when it imposed a $14,674.23 restitution order without an adequate evidentiary basis for the amount imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">{\u00b6 3} \u201c[2.] The trial court erred in failing to hold an adequate restitution hearing when the defendant disputed the amount.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">{\u00b6 4} Finding merit to his appeal, we reverse and remand for an evidentiary hearing on the amount of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Procedural History and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">{\u00b6 5} The grand jury indicted Waiters on nine counts: one count of theft, in violation of R.C. 2913.02; one count of having a weapon while under a disability, in violation of R.C. 2923.13; and seven counts of tampering with records, in violation of R.C. 2913.42. The indictment alleged that Waiters stole between $5,000 and $100,000 from the Cuyahoga County Metropolitan Housing Authority (\u201cCMHA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">{\u00b6 6} Waiters originally pleaded not guilty, but later withdrew his plea and pleaded guilty to theft, an amended count of attempt to tamper with records, and having a weapon while under a disability. The other counts were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">{\u00b6 7} After reciting the plea agreement to the court, the prosecutor stated: \u201cThe state would request $14,674.23 in restitution.\u201d Waiters\u2019s defense counsel then agreed that the prosecutor\u2019s recitation of the plea agreement was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">{\u00b6 8} Waiters also signed a written plea agreement as outlined by the state. This form included a provision titled \u201cFurther Agreements by Defendant.\u201d Under this provision, Waiters agreed to \u201cpay restitution in amount of $14,674.23.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">{\u00b6 9} At Waiters\u2019s sentencing hearing, defense counsel explained to the court that Waiters understood that he should have reported his income, but that he did not consistently earn money from his other jobs. Then defense counsel stated: \u201cThat\u2019s why these charges came forth. I don\u2019t think it was a large sum of money involved. I\u2019m not sure of the amount. But I clearly don\u2019t think it was \u2014.\u201d The trial court interrupted defense counsel and said, \u201cThey\u2019re claiming over $14,000.\u201d Defense counsel replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-14\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c$14,000. And I know in pre-trying the case with [the prosecutor] one of my concerns always was how they computed this money, where they came up with this figure that you just indicated of $14,000. I\u2019m not clear that their math is \u2014 or addition is the best addition employed here, but that\u2019s what they say it is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>{\u00b6 11} The trial court sentenced Waiters to three years of community-control sanctions. Regarding the restitution amount, the trial court stated: \u201cAnd based on the victim\u2019s statement, restitution in the amount of $14,674.28 will be assessed in this * * * case. I\u2019m going to ask the Probation Department to review the restitution amount with the victim to see if that\u2019s really accurate. * * * Unless it\u2019s shown that that\u2019s not the correct amount, then I will keep it at this rate. If there\u2019s some reduction that\u2019s appropriate, then I\u2019ll make it.\u201d In the sentencing entry, the trial court ordered that $14,674.23 be paid to the victim as restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">{\u00b6 12} The standard of review for determining whether the trial court properly ordered restitution is abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Carrino </em>(May 11, 1995), 8th Dist. No. 67696, 1995 WL 277103. \u201c \u2018The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d * * * implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140, quoting <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Restitution</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">{\u00b6 13} Although R.C. 2953.08(D) provides that a defendant may not appeal a jointly recommended sentence imposed by the court, that section specifically provides that it applies only \u201cif the sentence is authorized by law.\u201d When a court imposes a sentence pursuant to a plea agreement and any part of that sentence is not authorized by law, the exception to appealability in R.C. 2953.08(D) does not apply. See <em>State v. Underwood, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 365, 2010-Ohio-1, 922 N.E.2d 923, paragraph two of the syllabus, \u00b6 18. Therefore, a jointly recommended sentence may be reviewed to determine whether it was authorized by law. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">{\u00b6 14} We also are aware that agreement to, or failure to dispute or object to, a restitution amount when entering a plea has been held to constitute a waiver of the hearing procedures required by R.C. 2929.18(A)(1). See <em>State v. Cook, </em>6th Dist. No. OT-07-020, 2008-Ohio-89, 2008 WL 114976 (failure to object to amount at sentencing results in waiver); <em>State v. Stewart, </em>3d Dist. No. 16-08-11, 2008-Ohio-5823, 2008 WL 4831476 (failure to object to trial court\u2019s award of restitution waives all but plain error). Nonetheless, public policy requires that the judiciary charged with sentencing be adequately informed. See <em>State v. Hess </em>(Dec. 24, 1991), 4th Dist. No. 515, 1991 WL 286052. It is a trial court\u2019s duty to ensure that it has the necessary information before it to comply with the sentencing statutes. <em>State v. Newman, </em>11th Dist. No. 2002-A-0007, 2003-Ohio-2916, 2003 WL 21310323, \u00b6 12. Thus, when a defendant has been convicted of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>crime, the trial court is required to abide by the statutory requirements in R.C. 2929.18 when imposing restitution, even when accepting the terms of a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) provides that financial sanctions may include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cRestitution by the offender to the victim of the offender\u2019s crime * * * in an amount based on the victim\u2019s economic loss. * * * If the court imposes restitution, at sentencing, the court shall determine the amount of restitution to be made by the offender. If the court imposes restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, * * * and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">{\u00b6 17} Thus, prior to imposing restitution, a trial court must determine the amount of restitution to a reasonable degree of certainty, ensuring that the amount is supported by competent, credible evidence. See <em>State v. Warner </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 31, 69, 564 N.E.2d 18. It is also well settled that there must be a \u201cdue process ascertainment that the amount of restitution bears a reasonable relationship to the loss suffered.\u201d <em>State v. Williams </em>(1986), 34 Ohio App.3d 33, 34, 516 N.E.2d 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cDocumentary and/or testimonial evidence must be introduced to demonstrate the victim\u2019s economic loss. <em>State v. Webb, </em>173 Ohio App.3d 547, 2007-Ohio-5670, 879 N.E.2d 254; <em>State v. Marbury </em>(1995), 104 Ohio App.3d 179, 661 N.E.2d 271. Furthermore, because R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) states that the trial court\u2019s order of restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim, and double recovery would amount to an impermissible economic windfall for the victim, the evidence introduced to demonstrate the actual economic loss suffered by the victim must take account of any offsets to the victim\u2019s economic loss and any mitigation of damages * * *. <em>State v. Martin </em>(2000), 140 Ohio App.3d 326, 747 N.E.2d 318; <em>State v. Christy, </em>Wyandot App. No. 16-06-01, 2006-Ohio-4319, 2006 WL 2390273.\u201d <em>State v. Bowman, </em>181 Ohio App.3d 407, 2009-Ohio-1281, 909 N.E.2d 170, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">{\u00b6 19} In this case, although a plea agreement was reached and accepted, the restitution amount must still be reasonably related to the actual amount of damages or economic loss suffered. The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) includes a police report documenting the amount of income Waiters allegedly earned during the years he received CMHA housing. The PSI states: \u201cAccording to the police report, the total amount of theft that the offender owed to CMHA * * * for 6-27-02 through 2-2005 was $14,674.23.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>PSI further explains that \u201cthe amount is the subsidy paid to CMHA by HUD for the offender to reside at this residence.\u201d And in the \u201cVictim\u2019s Version and Restitution\u201d of the PSI, it states that a victim-impact statement was sent to CMHA, but that CMHA never returned it.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">{\u00b6 20} Under many, if not most circumstances, we agree that a plea agreement may constitute a waiver of an appellant\u2019s challenge to the amount of restitution. In this instance, however, nothing in the record provides any guidance or evidence from which the trial court could have determined whether the amount of restitution was reasonably related to the loss suffered by the victim. Although the trial court stated that \u201cbased on the victim\u2019s statement, restitution in the amount of $14,674.23 will be assessed,\u201d the record establishes that CMHA never made a victim\u2019s statement. Indeed, we are not even sure that CMHA is the victim in this case, as it is not clear that it suffered economic loss. Rather, HUD appears to be the entity that suffered economic loss (although HUD was not named in the indictment). And if Waiters paid $14,674.23 to CMHA, it would receive double the income it should have received from Waiters\u2019s tenancy, which would amount to a windfall for CMHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">{\u00b6 21} Accordingly, we find that there is no competent, credible evidence in the record to establish the restitution amount. Waiters\u2019s first assignment of <em>error </em>is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">{\u00b6 22} In his second assignment of error, Waiters argues that the trial court erred by not holding a hearing on the restitution amount. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">{\u00b6 23} The restitution statute makes clear that \u201c[i]f the court decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold a hearing on restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount.\u201d R.C. 2929.18(A)(1). Here, defense counsel stated at the sentencing hearing that he was not sure that the amount of restitution was correct. Although this was not a formal objection, it was sufficient to put the court on notice that the restitution amount was in dispute. As we stated previously, it is the court\u2019s duty to ensure that the restitution amount is correct. R.C. 2929.18(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">{\u00b6 24} Waiters\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">{\u00b6 25} We therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case for the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine the appropriate amount of restitution Waiters should pay, if any, and also to what victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b761-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Celebrezze, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b761-4\">Cooney, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b761-5\">Colleen Conway Cooney, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AYJ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">{\u00b6 26} I respectfully dissent. Waiters entered a plea agreement in which he agreed to the amount of restitution. He was sentenced in September 2007 and never disputed the amount until he filed this delayed appeal two years later. He was given three years of community-control sanction that should now be concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">{\u00b6 27} R.C. 2929.18(A) allows the court to order restitution based on a presentence investigation report, as was done in the instant case. No hearing was required because Waiters and his counsel made no objection. See <em>State v. Jarrett, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 90404, 2008-Ohio-4868, 2008 WL 4356160. Therefore, I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
