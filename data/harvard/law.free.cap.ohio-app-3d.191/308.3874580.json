Masters Jr. (\u201cMelvin\u201d), and plaintiffappellee Goldie M. Masters, n.k.a. Goldie Collins (\u201cGoldie\u201d), were married on August 2,1985. They had two sons, Nicholas and Christopher. The parties were divorced by decree entered January 7, 2003. The parties executed an agreed entry that was incorporated into the decree of divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">{\u00b6 2} The divorce decree designated Melvin as the residential parent and legal custodian of the children. The decree provided that Goldie was to maintain health insurance for the children. Melvin was to pay the first $100 per child in uninsured medical expenses, including copayments and deductibles, each calendar year. Uninsured medical expenses in excess of $100 per child each calendar year were to be divided equally between the parties. Melvin was designated to receive any reimbursement from the health-insurance provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">{\u00b6 3} The decree stated, \u201cHusband shall consult Wife in all major decisions affecting the education or health care of their minor children. Major decisions by Husband on all education and health care issues shall be made only after consultation between the parties. If the parties do not reach an agreement on a major issue after discussing, Husband as residential parent will make the decision.\u201d The decree further stated, \u201cDue to the financial circumstances of the parties, and the fact that any changes in Wife\u2019s income will have little if any effect on the amount of child support to be paid, the parties agree, and the Court finds, that it is in the best interest of the children to use the attached worksheet until Husband obtains employment, at which time the Court will have jurisdiction to recalculate support and to resolve the issue of whether or not Husband shall provide secondary health insurance for the minor children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">{\u00b64} Throughout 2004 and until May 1, 2005, Goldie maintained health insurance for the children through her employer\u2019s insurance plan. Melvin submitted all medical expenses to Goldie\u2019s employer\u2019s insurance carrier until August 2004. He notified Goldie of her share of the uncovered medical expenses, but he received no payment. Melvin remarried in August 2004, and the children were added to the health-insurance coverage provided by his new wife\u2019s employer. Melvin did not consult Goldie or seek court permission before adding the children to his new wife\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">{\u00b6 5} After May 1, 2005, Goldie\u2019s employer provided a high-deductible health-insurance policy through United Health Care. Under Goldie\u2019s new insurance, the yearly deductibles were $3,000 for each individual and $6,000 per family. No prescription coverage was available until the deductibles were met. Employees were permitted, but not required, to contribute pre-tax dollars to a health savings account, which could be used to pay medical expenses. Pre-tax dollars were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>permitted to be used to pay for medical expenses for anyone who was covered under another insurance policy. Therefore, because the children were covered under Melvin\u2019s new wife\u2019s policy, Goldie would not be permitted to contribute pre-tax dollars to a health savings account to pay their uncovered medical expenses. It is undisputed that after May 1, 2005, it was financially beneficial to the parties for the children to use the health insurance provided by Melvin\u2019s new wife\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">{\u00b6 6} Between January 1, 2004, and June 30, 2005, Melvin incurred uncovered medical expenses on behalf of the children. It is undisputed that Goldie\u2019s share of those expenses was $1,912.54, which she has refused to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">{\u00b6 7} On August 25, 2005, Melvin filed a motion for contempt against Goldie, alleging that she had violated the divorce decree by failing to pay her share of the children\u2019s uncovered medical expenses. Goldie filed a motion for contempt against Melvin on December 5, 2005, alleging that Melvin had violated the decree by failing to consult her regarding major decisions involving the children\u2019s medical care. Goldie argued that \u201cmajor decisions\u201d included whether to cover the children under Melvin\u2019s new wife\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">{\u00b6 8} After a series of hearings, the magistrate determined that both Melvin and Goldie had \u201cunclean hands,\u201d Goldie for failing to pay her share of the uncovered medical expenses, and Melvin for failing to seek court approval and to consult Goldie before adding the children to his new wife\u2019s insurance policy. The magistrate dismissed both motions for contempt, stating that because both parties \u201ccame before the Court with unclean hands,\u201d the court should \u201cleave them as they are.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">{\u00b6 9} Goldie did not object to the magistrate\u2019s decision. Melvin filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. With one exception, the trial court overruled Melvin\u2019s objections. The court\u2019s entry stated, \u201cWife has failed without good cause to comply with the order of this court regarding the payment of her share of medical expenses incurred on behalf of her two sons from January, 2004 through June 18, 2005. Husband has failed without good cause to comply with the orders of this court requiring Wife to maintain primary health insurance for Nicholas and Christopher Masters and to consult with Wife on major issues involving their health care.\u201d The court denied both motions for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">{\u00b6 10} Melvin has appealed, raising one assignment of error for our review, which alleges that the trial court erred in overruling his objections, in adopting, with one exception, the magistrate\u2019s decision, and in denying his motion for contempt. An appellate court applies an abuse-of-discretion standard in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision whether to hold a party in contempt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">{\u00b6 11} Melvin first argues that the trial court erred in determining that he had violated the divorce decree by adding his children to his new wife\u2019s insurance policy without first obtaining the court\u2019s permission. The magistrate found that the unambiguous language in the divorce decree placed Melvin \u201cunder an affirmative duty to invoke the continuing jurisdiction of the court\u201d before adding the children to his new wife\u2019s insurance policy. Further, the magistrate found that Melvin \u201cwas required to comply with the court order which stated that [Goldie] was to maintain health insurance coverage for their sons until such time as that order was modified by the court.\u201d The trial court adopted these findings, determining that the decree dictated that Goldie \u201calone\u201d was required to provide health insurance for the children and that Melvin had \u201cattempted to unilaterally modify the terms of the decree\u201d by adding the children to his new wife\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">{\u00b6 12} The order in the divorce decree is directed to Goldie, requiring her to maintain health insurance for the children. A review of the plain language of the decree shows that the court did not order that Goldie was to be the \u201csole\u201d provider of health insurance for the children. Because Melvin was unemployed at the time the decree was entered, the court did not order him to provide insurance coverage. The decree stated that once Melvin became employed, the trial court \u201cwould resolve the issue of whether\u201d Melvin was required to provide health insurance. But nothing in the decree precluded him from voluntarily obtaining health insurance for his children or required him to seek permission of the court before doing so. We hold that the trial court erred in determining that Melvin had violated the divorce decree by adding his children to his new wife\u2019s insurance policy without first obtaining the court\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">{\u00b6 13} Melvin next argues that the trial court erred in determining that he had violated the divorce decree by adding his children to his new wife\u2019s policy without first consulting Goldie. The parties\u2019 agreed entry, which was incorporated into the decree of divorce, stated that Melvin \u201cshall consult [Goldie] in all major decisions affecting the education or health care of their minor children\u201d and that \u201c[m]ajor decisions by [Melvin] on all education and health care issues shall be made only after consultation between the parties.\u201d The decree further provided that Melvin was to make the decision if the parties could not reach an agreement on a \u201cmajor issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">{\u00b6 14} The magistrate noted in his decision that \u201c[t]he word \u2018major\u2019 is not defined by the Ohio Revised Code. Nor is the word defined by the parties within the context of their agreement to consult on major medical decisions involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>their sons.\u201d Citing the \u201cMerriam Webster Online Dictionary,\u201d the magistrate defined \u201cmajor\u201d as \u201cgreater in dignity, rank, importance, or interest\u201d and determined that the decision to add the children to Melvin\u2019s new wife\u2019s policy was \u201ca major decision about which [Melvin] was required to consult with [Goldie] prior to making.\u201d The trial court adopted that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">{\u00b6 15} We believe that the magistrate\u2019s focus on the definition of \u201cmajor\u201d was misplaced. The question as we see it is not whether the decision to add the children to Melvin\u2019s new wife\u2019s policy was a \u201cmajor decision,\u201d but whether it was a decision \u201con health care issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">{\u00b6 16} The language in question appears in the parties\u2019 agreed entry of December 9, 2002, which was ultimately incorporated into the divorce decree. The decree does not define \u201chealth care issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. 3119.29(A)(3) defines \u201chealth care\u201d in the context of the calculation of child-support obligations as \u201csuch medical support that includes coverage under a health insurance plan, payment of costs of premiums, co-payments, and deductibles, or payment for medical expenses incurred on behalf of the child.\u201d But the parties were not addressing support obligations in the part of the agreement relating to consultation on \u201chealth care issues.\u201d The support provisions appear in a different part of the decree. Further, employing the R.C. 3119.29(A)(3) definition would require that Melvin consult Goldie only on issues involving the payment of medical expenses incurred on behalf on the children and not on issues involving the actual medical treatment administered to them. A reading of the \u201cconsultation\u201d language in context clearly shows that the parties did not intend such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">{\u00b6 18} R.C. 1337.11, which deals with powers of attorney for health care, states, \u201c \u2018Health care\u2019 means any care, treatment, service, or procedure to maintain, diagnose, or treat an individual\u2019s physical or mental condition or physical or mental health.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold that the parties intended to adopt the more traditional definition of \u201chealth care\u201d contained in R.C. 1337.11, and that \u201cmajor decisions on health care issues\u201d as contemplated in the decree of divorce involved decisions concerning the actual medical treatment administered to the children by healthcare professionals and not issues relating to health-insurance coverage for that treatment. Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the provision in the divorce decree requiring Melvin to consult with Goldie regarding \u201cmajor decisions\u201d \u201con health care issues\u201d is separate from the health-insurance provisions of the decree, indicating that health-insurance issues were not to be included in \u201cmajor decisions\u201d on \u201chealth care issues.\u201d We hold that the trial court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>determining that Melvin had violated the divorce decree by adding the children to his new wife\u2019s health-insurance policy without first consulting Goldie.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">{\u00b6 19} We hold that the trial court abused its discretion in denying Melvin\u2019s motion for contempt against Goldie on the basis that Melvin had violated the decree by adding his children to his new wife\u2019s health-insurance policy without obtaining the court\u2019s permission and without consulting Goldie. The assignment of error is sustained. The trial court\u2019s judgment denying Melvin\u2019s motion for contempt is reversed, and this cause is remanded for the trial court\u2019s reconsideration of Melvin\u2019s contempt motion in light of our holding in this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b348-7\">Hildebrandt and Mallory, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\">.
