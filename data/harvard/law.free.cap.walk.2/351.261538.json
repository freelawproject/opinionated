D. 1878 (Pamphlet Laws 184), proceedings in equity were commenced to No. 1 May Term, 1879, in this Court, at the suit of Peter Walsh, to ascertain the indebtedness of said township, and to apportion the same among the several boroughs carved out of the old Township of Blakely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-7\">The said indebtedness was duly ascertained, and oh the 17th day of February, A. D. 1881, the Court entered a decree apportioning to the said Borough of Archbald $8,741.07 of said indebtedness, and ordered that the sums apportioned to the several boroughs be paid by a special tax within three years, and that the said boroughs, by their proper officers, should assess and levy in the month of April in each year of the said three years, beginning with April, A. D. 1881, a tax of ten mills on the last assessed valuation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-8\">The said act of Assembly and the said suit in equity are hereby made part of this ease stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-9\">The amount of said special.tax assessed upon the lands aforesaid, for the year 1881, was paid by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-10\">The amount of said tax assessed upon said lands for the year 1882, to wit: $112.18, was paid by the plaintiffs, and the amount assessed for the year 1883, to wit: $124.10 was paid by plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-11\">Although the three annual assessments directed by the Court have been made, yet the part of said township indebtedness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>apportioned to said borough, has not been fully paid thereby, and it is agreed that a further assessment of ten mills will be necessary, and that the amount to be assessed upon said land will be $124.10 for the current year 1884.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-4\">If the Court be of opinion that defendants were not and are not bound to pay any of said taxes for said year 1882,1883 and 1884, then judgment to be entered for the defendants for costs..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-5\">Either party to have the right to sue out a writ of .error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-6\">The Court decided in favor of the defendants in the following opinion, per:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b351-7\">Hand, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-8\">Upon the facts of this case stated judgment must be entered for the defendants. It is not necessary to enter into an extended exposition of the law in this matter. The act of 12 J une, 1878, P. L. 184, giving the Court power to act, did not change the character of the taxes to be levied. It was passed alone for the purpose of ascertaining the indebtedness and apportioning it among the several boroughs. After the sale all taxes that were not then encumbrances were liable to be paid by the purchasers. None of the taxes paid by the plaintiffs were encumbrances until after the title had passed any more than any borough tax thereafter assessed would have been. The proceedings and order and decree of the Court did not, within the meaning of the Act, make a lien, nor an assessment nor an encumbrance. The ordinary and proper authorities levied and assessed the tax. The Court simply provided under the Act of Assembly a mode and a time for the proper municipality to pay its debts. The defendants were only liable for the taxes of 1881, the year in which their conveyance was made, and were not liable for the years .1882, 1883 nor 1884.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-9\">Judgment is entered on the case stated in favor of the defendants for costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Plaintiffs then sued out a writ of error complaining of the entry of judgment in favor of the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-4\"><em>S.
