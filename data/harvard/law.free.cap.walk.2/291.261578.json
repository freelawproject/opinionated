The right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>eminent domain, and the powers which flow from it, must be conceded to exist in the Commonwealth alone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-3\">If we are to find the lawful authority for the defendant company to construct and maintain a railroad upon Lafayette street, we must seek it in the grants which the Commonwealth has Itself either expressly or impliedly made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-4\">The first step in this inquiry, is to search the statute book, and learn what the legislature has declared in the several acts which compose the general law of the State under which the defendant corporation has been organized.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-5\">The act of February 19th, 1849, section 10, P. Laws 83, says : \u201cAnd provided further, <em>that whenever any company shall locate its road in and upon any street or alley in any city or </em>borough, ample compensation shall be made to the owners of lots fronting upon <em>such street or alley </em>for any damages they may sustain by reason of any excavation or embankment made in the construction of such road, to be ascertained as other damages are authorized to be ascertained by this act.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-6\">Before the passage of this act it had been held that no damages could be recovered for any injury to property abutting upon a street so lawfully occupied where land itself or part of it was not taken. And even this act still left the owner of such property remediless for any injury caused by such occupation when there was no change of grade.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-7\">The same act (section 12) provides for the construction of the \u00a1road at the crossing of other roads so as not to impede travel, but is silent as. to what precaution shall be taken not to impede travel where the railroad is located upon a street as contemplated in the tenth section.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-8\">The same act (section 13) recognizes the right of any railroad company to occupy a turnpike or other public road longitudinally ; but provides that if necessary to change the site of the same it \u201cshall reconstruct the same on the most favorable location, and in as .perfect a manner as the original road.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-9\">This command to reconstruct .was, however, never supposed to apply to streets in populace towns, where such authority to locate streets would be absurd and impracticable. That it is not so ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>plicable was conceded in the case of The Pittsburg, Virginia and Charlestown Railroad Company vs. Commonwealth, 12 <em>W. </em>N. C. 280, and also in the brief submitted by the plaintiffs in this-case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-3\">In the act of April 4th, 1868, P. Laws 62; which is supplementary to the act of 1849, it was deemed necessary to provide that the act should not be construed so as to authorize <em>the formation of street passenger railway companies to construct railways under or by virtue of its provisions in any city or borough of this Commonwealth.\u201d </em>And the same section contains the further saving clause, \u201c <em>That it shall not authorize any corporation formed under this act to enter upon and occupy any </em>street, <em>lane, or alley in any incorporated city </em>in this Commonwealth without the consent of such, city having first been obtained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-4\">From this saving clause it will be observed boroughs are-omitted. If then but for this exception, railroads could have-been laid upon the streets of cities without their consent, as seems-to have been conceded by the legislature, then <em>boroughs </em>must still be open to such invasion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\">The act of 1849, section 10 declares that \u201cThe president and directors of such companies shall have power and authority\u201d * <em>* </em>to survey, ascertain, locate, fix, mark, and determine-such route for a railroad <em>as they may deem </em>expedient, not however, passing through any <em>burying ground </em>or <em>place of worship, </em>or any <em>dwelling-house in the occupancy of the owner or owners thereof without his, her, or their consent.\u201d </em>How easy and obvious it would have been to insert also a restriction as to the public streets of a town if a general restriction as to them had been intended. The omission is significant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-7\">The inference from these several sections of the general railroad law seems irresistable that no such prohibition was designed, and that to occupy such streets is an implied power under the general law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-8\">The construction of railroads iras been encouraged by the-public policy of our State, for reasons which the development of the country by their means abundantly justifies. They are most useful when brought nearest to the centres of business. To lay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>the tracks upon one of the streets of a populace town through which it may-pass on its route may iu most cases be regarded a commercial necessity, if the convenience of the general public and the interests of traffic are to be subserved. To go around the town rather than through it, thus avoided approach to its manufactories and marts of trade, would often be at the sacrifice of both the town and the railroad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-3\">\u25a0By laying the railroad tracks on one of the streets the road can be brought to where it is most wanted, and the uses of a local and comparatively insignificant highway may be thus made subservient to uses more enlarged and far-reaching in their beneficial results. And generally, too, with the least practicable injury to private property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-4\">In further support of the conclusion reached, it is important also to consider the prohibition in the act as to passing through any burying ground or place of worship, or <em>any dwelliny-house in the occupancy of the owner without his consent. </em>How can a railroad corporation locate its road through the built-up part of a borough except through some street, without encountering the buildings through which it is prohibited from passing? It is no answer to say it may buy its way; for the occupying owner of every dwelling is armed by the same act with an absolute veto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-5\">But it does not follow that the implied powes of a railroad company to locate its road upon a street can be exercised at the absolute discretion of the company under any and all circumstances. The defer\u00ed dant corporation, although authorized to locate and construct its road between the <em>termini </em>designated in its charter by such route \u201cit may deem expedient,\u201d it will nevertheless be confined to a reasonable exercise of its chartered powers so as to avoid unnecessary or unreasonable injury to other public highways; and for any plain abuse of its powers in this regard it may be restrained by injunction. Within these limitations, the opinion of this Court is that a railroad company chartered under the general railroad laws of chis Co mmonwealth has the implied right to pass through a borough lying upon its lawful route, by locating its tracks longitudinally upon one of the public streets of such borough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>It is said that the Supreme Court of this State has never so decided in any case which turned directly upon this point. But it must be conceded that the Supreme Court has in several cases clearly foreshadowed, and even directly declared, such an interpretation\u2019of the act in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A13\">In Struthers vs. The Dunkirk, Warren and Pittsburg Railway Company, 6 Norris 282, the Supreme Court announced the same construction of the law which is here applied. The case turned upon the question as to the implied authority of the defendant corporation under the general act of 1849 (which had been made part of its charter) to occupy with its tracks a public street in the Borough of Warren. The terminus to be reached was \u201cany given point in the town of Warren,\u201d but there was no express grant to the company to occupy any street in that town for that purpose. The company constructed its road along High street, one of the public streets .of said borough. On the trial the plaintiff offered to prove that no necessity or good reason existed for building defendants\u2019 road along that street; that a route shorter in distance and of easier curvature was attainable at but a small increase of expense, and by which the defendants\u2019 road could have reached its terminus, and made its connection without occupying any portion of High steeet, or any other street longitudinally, and working much less injury to both public and private interests. The Court rejected this testimony, and directed the jury to find a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-4\">The Supreme Court affirmed this ruling ; and declared without a dissenting opinion, that <em>\u201cthe location was made in the exercise of an undoubted right.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-5\">It is contended that this is inconsistent with the decision of the Supreme Court in The Pennsylvania Railroad Appeal, 8 W. N. C., 313. But this is not so, I think, if the circumstances of the latter case are considered. In that case it was only decided (and by a divided Court) that the necessity for the act complained of was not great enough to justify one railroad in removing the previously located and constructed tracks of another, for no reason more urgent than its own convenience. Besides, \u00edd the latter case, the decision was not made upon a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>struction of the general railroad act of 1849, but of an act of March 12th, 1873, P. Laws 253, conferring certain special powers upon the Pennsylvania Railroad Company for the special purpose set forth in that act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-3\">In Cake vs. The Philadelphia and Erie Railroad Company, 6 Norris 307, it was conceded that by the act of 14th April, 1864 (P. L. 414), extending to that corporation the provisions of the general act of 19th February, 1849, it acquired the right to lay its tracks upon streets in towns, although the case itself turned upon other points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-4\">In the ease of the Commonwealth vs. The Erie and North East Railroad Company, 3 Casey 339, although the decision was against the railroad company, because of the express limitations of its charter, Chief Justice Black says: <em>\u201cSo also when an act of incorporation directs a road to be made between certain termini, by such route as the grantees of the privileges shall think best, it may be located on an intervening street or other common highway, if in the judgment of the directors it be necessary or expedient to do so.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-6\">In Cleveland and Pittsburg Railroad Company vs. Speer, 6 P. F. S. 333, the company was by its charter authorized to construct a railroad <em>\u201con the most direct and least expensive route to some point in the direction of Pittsburg on the State-line between Ohio and Pennsylvania.\u201d </em>The company was further authorized by act of assembly.to extend its road from the State line, and continue it up the valley of the Ohio river. .As the Borough of Manchester laid across the valley it was necessary to pass through it; but, although not a word in the charter gave any express grant to occupy a street, it was held that the company <em>had the implied right to do so, even although the street selected might not be the most direct or inexpensive location.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-7\">In this case the defendant corporation is authorized to locate and construct its road from its Philadelphia terminus to Phoenix-ville by way of the valley of the Schuylkill river upon such route <em>as they may deem expedient.\u201d </em>The adjacent Boroughs of Norristown and Bridgeport lie across the whole valley like the Borough of Manchester in the case last quoted.' It is necessary to pass through the one or the other of these boroughs. The route selected as the m.ost expedient lies through Norristown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>along Lafayette street, to the occupation of which the authorities representing the local community have invited the defendants, as the <em>most eligible and convenient route </em>not only for the railroad company itself, but also for the general public.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-3\">The defendant corporation has therefore a lawful right to construct its tracks upon Lafayette street, observing however, the conditions which it accepted with the ordinance passed by the town council of the Borough of Norristown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-4\">II. &gt; <em>We </em>now approach the second branch of this case, in which the plaintiffs interpose their corporate rights as the owners and the occupiers of a large lot of ground extending along Lafayette street to part of which they claim title, extending to the middle of the street. This they say is one of their franchises, and cannot be invaded by the defendant corporation; that, therefore, whatever rights the defendants may have to lay their road upon Lafayette street, as against the other property owners whose lots abut upon that street, they have no such rights along that side of the street upon which the property of the plaintiffs fronts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\">The land of the plaintiffs for which this immunity is claimed is for the most part an open and unoccupied lot composed of different adjacent tracks purchased at different times from various owners, and held unimproved for many years. It fronts upon public streets on all its sides, and is traversed by one of them, laid out but not yet opened through it. As situated at present it is surrounded by open streets on its four sides, Lafayette street being one of them. Upon one end of the Lafayette street front the plaintiffs have an engine-house, with a blank wall on that street, the entrance to it being from the yard within. There is no claim on the part of the plaintiffs to any exclusive right or easement in Lafayette street, or that it was not a public street long before they acquired any property fronting upon it. But the reversionary title to part of the street in case of its vacation they claim to own, and complain that the improvements which some day they intend to ereetupontheirpremises will be cramped and made less accessible by reason of the partial occupation of the street by the defendant corporations tracks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">The mere statement of these facts, with an inspection of the draft of the property of the plaintiffs, and its surroundings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>ought to be a sufficient answer to this objection. The franchise which the plaintiffs claim to be-invaded is hardly deserving of the name. There is no interference with the corporate functions of the plaintiffs as a railroad corporation; no encroachment upon any grant to them by the Commonwealth for the purpose of their road ; no taking of any property in their actual possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-3\">But even the taking of railroad property by another corporation is often justified in law. Railroad companies are invested with vast and arbitrary powers, not, however, for their own sakes merely, but for the public good they are supposed to sub-serve, and which is the only justification for the grant of their extensive privileges. For the same reason they in their turn are-sometimes called upon to surrender something for the general good.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-4\">There is much learning in the books upon this subject, and many adjudicated cases. I do not think, however, that on this, occasion any elaborated discussion of these authorities is required. The general principles established are :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-5\">1. That there is no implied contract by the State in a charter to a turnpike, bridge, or railroad company, that their property shall be exempt from the common liability of the property of individuals t\u00f3 be taken for public use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-6\">2. That a franchise belonging to a corporation is only entitled to the same protection as other property; and must be surrendered up for the public use like any other property upon compensation, when demanded by the sovereign authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-7\">3. That the grant of land for one public use must yield to that of another more urgent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-8\">4. That the second grant need not be an express grant; but may arise by implication from necessity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-9\">\u2022See Springfield vs. Connecticut River Railway, 4 Cushing 71; Richmond Railway vs. Louisiana Railway, 13 Howard 71 ; \"White River Turnpike Co. vs. Vermont Central R.

It is not the mission of a railroad to destroy these, but rather to build them up. When we come to Washington street we find it occupied by the tracks of the plaintiff\u2019s railroad. Between Washington and Lafayette streets the space is occupied by the passenger and freight depots, turntables and engine houses of the plaintiffs ; also by a large church property, and dwelling-houses. Passing beyond Lafayette street we come to a still more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>populous part of the town lying between Lafayette street and Egypt street, which is the main business street of the borough. Between these streets are still more numerous dwelling-houses, industrial establishments, and a burying ground. On the opposite side of Egypt or Main street the grade rises rapidly until it soon becomes impracticable, except by means of deep cuts. And in the intermediate space are numerous dwellings occupied by their owners, and more churches. If we come back to Lafayette street we find a grade through the built-up portion of the street already for the most part well adapted to the purpose, and requiring but slight changes; and a locality where the uses \u25a0 of the railroad can be best turned to account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-3\">III. There has been a question raised . as to the damages which may be claimed by the plaintiffs from the construction of the road of defendants on Lafayette street; the defendants maintaining that the injuries of the plaintiffs, if any be suffered, can only be of a consequential nature, and that the plaintiffs having never accepted the provisions of the new Constitution, under which alone such damages can be claimed, are not within its protection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-4\">But the Court cannot now make this discrimination against the plaintiffs, who in' their bill pray the Court to restrain the defendants until they have paid or secured to the plaintiffs\u2019 compensation for the injuries they have sustained, or are likely to sustain.

These plaintiffs own two entire squares of ground in the Borough of Norristown, bounded by Washingtown, Mill, Lafayette and Franklin streets. A portion of this property was deeded to the Philadelphia, G-ermantown and Norristown .Railroad Company in the year 1852 and a portion to the Philadelphia and Reading in 1872. The plaintiffs\u2019 title to all that portion of the lot between Franldin street and a point about one hundred feet west of the western line of Walnut street, extends to the centre line of Lafayette street.

The ordinance, however, provides that the width of the street between the curb lines shall be increased to thirty-eight feet, and each of the sidewalks narrowed to six feet. This will leave a cartway of nine feet on each side of the defendant\u2019s, railroad, to be paved with Belgian blocks at their expense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-5\">On November 1st, 1882, the ordinance was duly accepted by the defendant railroad company, and, subject to its conditions, they began the construction of their railroad upon Lafayette street. On June 1st, 1883, the Philadelphia, Norristown and Phoenixville Eailroad Company, under the provisions of the act of March 24th, 1865, entitled \u201cAn act supplementary to an act regulating railroad companies, approved February 19 th, 1849,\u201d was consolidated with two other railroad companies called respectively, \u201cThe Phoenixville, Pottstown and Eeading Eailroad Company,\u201d and \u201cThe West Chester and Phoenixville Eailroad Company,\u201d also organized under the act of April 4th, 1868; the first named for the purpose of building a railroad from Phoenixville to Eeading, and the latter a line of railroad from West Chester to Phoenixville, and a new corporation was thereby created by the name of \u201cThe Pennsylvania Schuylkill Valley Eailroad Company,\u201d the defendants aforesaid, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>rights, powers and liabilities lawfully, resulting from such consolidation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-3\">Upon the eighth day of June, 1883, the contractor for that portion of the road, John T. Dyer, the other defendant, began the construction of the defendants\u2019 railroad upon Lafayette street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-4\">A single track was hastily laid, occupying the southermost part of the twenty feet right of way granted by the ordinance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-5\">IJpon June 9th, 1883, the plaintiffs applied for an injunction, preliminary, restraining the defendants from constructing their railroad upon any part of Lafayette street, or, in the alternative from entering upon Lafayette street, between Franklin and Mill streets, for that purpose' until compensation should be made for the damage done, or likely to be done, or ample security should be tendered therefor to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-6\">After hearing and argument of counsel the Court made the following decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ajl\">\u201cAnd now, July 8th, 1883, the prayer for a preliminary injunction enjoining and restraining the defendants from laying and constructing their railroad tracks on any part of Lafayette street, between Franklin and Mill streets, is refused. But the said defendants are restrained and enjoined from proceeding with their said work until they shall have tendered the said plaintiffs a sufficient bond with adequate security to secure said plaintiffs from any damages sustained, or likely to be sustained by them from the construction of said railroad by the defendants upon Lafayette street, between Franklin and Mill streets in the Borough of Norristown.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-8\">On July 14th, 1883, the plaintiffs amended (without prejudice to their rights) their original bill filed by striking out paragraph XI., which stated that the defendants had made no compensation unto the plaintiffs for the damage done or likely tobe done, by reason of said construction of their railroad, nor had tendered security therefor, and also withdrawing their second prayer for an injunction in the alternative, and for security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>The defendant\u2019s railroad, as now constructed upon Lafayette street, between Mill and Franklin streets, consists of a single track, occupying the southermost portion of the twenty feet wide right of way granted by the ordinance. Heavy planking is laid on either side of the rails even with their top surfaces all along the line of their road between said streets. The distance from the building line to the present curb line, not as yet set back, upon the south side is twelve feet. The distance from this curb line to the southern rail is 475 feet (see plan marked \u201cH. C. B., No. 3\u201d), part of which is occupied by the planking on that side of the rail, which is about one and a half feet wide. The rest of the distance to the curb line is paved with Belgian blocks. The space between the rails is occupied partly by the planking laid down on the inside of the respective rail, and even with their top surfaces, and partly by the cinder filled in between the planking as shown in the plan marked \u201cH. C. B. No. 3.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-3\">On the northern side of the northern rail, planking one and a half feet wide is again laid, and from the.planking to the present curb line the street is paved with Belgian blocks.

The present distance from the curb line to the building line being twelve feet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-4\">At present but slight disadvantage is occasioned by the presence of the railroad track, which can easily be crossed, and free communication had to the plaintiffs\u2019 property anywhere along the line of the road between JFranklin and Mill streets. But as the defendants have not relinquished the right to lay two tracks upon the twenty feet wide right of way granted by the ordinance, and 'as the ordinance only obliges them to plank Lafayette street at the street crossings, should the present planking wear out, or be removed, and not replaced, or should another track be laid without planking, access to the plaintiffs\u2019 property in question from the northern side of Lafayette- street, between Franklin and Mill streets, except at the street crossings, could be had only by crossing ordinary \u201cT\u201d rails laid upon \u2022cross ties. This would be impracticable for horses and wagons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-5\">Access, however, can be had from north of Lafayette street between said streets, by crossing the defendants\u2019 track at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>planked street crossings and using the nine feet wide cartway. This cartway, when the defendants\u2019 road is in operation, will be too dangerous from its proximity to moving trains, and too narrow for general use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-3\">But access can be had as heretofore to the plaintiffs\u2019 property upon crossing defendants\u2019 track by way of Franklin street, between Lafayette and Washington streets on the eastern end, by way of Mill street, between Lafayette and Washington streets-on the western end, and by the opening of Walnut street through the plaintiffs\u2019 property to their land on either side of that extended street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-4\">The master has been requested by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to find as a fact, that it is contemplated by them to erect a freight depot upon the land in question, which depot is to be in all one hundred and fifty feet long and fifty feet wide, at a distance of about one hundred feet east of Mill street, facing Lafayette, and so much within the line of Lafayette street as to permit teams, \u25a0to back up and stand without obstructing that street. The unloading and receiving tracks to run along the southern front of the projected depot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-5\">And also to find as a fact that other portions of the property in question are to be used for a coal dump ; access to which would be from Lafayette street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-6\">The master refuses, from the evidence before him, to find these as facts. He finds as a fact, however, that the property in question was acquired by the plaintiffs for the purpose of extending their railway facilities when the same might be required and that such an intention is manifested by the purchase of the laud convenient and suitable for such purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-7\">But no intention of a specific appropriation of the land in question has been shown, either by evidence of the actual beginning of work upon the proposed structures, or evidence of any orders from the proper officials of the road to their subordinates therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-8\">The master, after due deliberation, has adopted the views expressed in the elaborate opinion of the Court upon its refusal to grant the preliminary injunction in this case, and which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>opinion lie desires to be considered as incorporated with this report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-3\">The master suggests that a final decree be made by the Court refusing the prayer of the plaintiffs\u2019 bill and dismissing the \u25a0same; and that the plaintiffs be ordered to pay the costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-4\">Upon exceptions to the master\u2019s report, the Court confirmed \u25a0.said report and made the following decree : \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-5\">And now, April 2, 1884, this cause came on to be heard on the report of the master, and was argued by counsel, whereupon upon due consideration it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that that the plaintiff\u2019s bill be dismissed, with costs to be paid by the plaintiff:'.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-6\">The complainant then appealed to the Supreme Court, complaining of the action of the Court below in holding that the Pennsylvania Schuylkill Valley Railroad Company could occupy Lafayette street with its tracks.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b307-7\"><em>Mesers.
