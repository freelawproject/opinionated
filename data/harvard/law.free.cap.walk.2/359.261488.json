No. 343 January Term, 1885.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-6\">The following extract from the adjudication and distribution of the Orphans\u2019 Court upon the accounts of the executors of Samuel Sheeler, deceased, gave rise to this controversy, viz :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-7\">In the distribution of decedent\u2019s estate it becomes necessary to put a construction on his will. So far as the advancements to his son Henry and the advancement to his late daughter Sarah, and the debt due the estate by her husband, Augustus Holler, are concerned, the will is simple and clear. Their advancements and her husband\u2019s debts will have to be treated in making distribution as advancement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-8\">The will in its third item employs language as follows: \u201cAll my children shall have equal shares, share and share alike.\u201d In its fifth item it makes use of language as follows: \u201cIf any one of my children at the time of my decease is indebted to my state by note, bond, or in my family book, or otherwise, then it shall be taken from their share or shares such amount or sum and if any of my sons-in-law are indebted\" to my estate and is unable to pay the same, then it shall-be taken from their children\u2019s share.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-10\">Under the third item of his will the testator appears to\" have been anxious to have all his children receive an equal portion of his estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-11\">Under fourth item he gave to his grandchildren the portion of their deceased parent respectively.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-12\">Under the fifth item he appears to se k to further equalize the shares among his several children by including the indebtedness to his estate of his sons-in-law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-13\">Taking the whole will .into consideration, I find that his general intent was to divide his entire estate, including debts of his sons-in-law, equally among children ; and. the grandchildren of deceased parents to receive their respective share , vnd \u25a0 that his children, as well as his grandchildren, take subject, to advance-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>meats and debts of his children, as also of all debts due the estate by his sons-in-law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-4\">It is a well established principle in construing wills, that after the general intent of the testator has been found, particular ones in direct conflict therewith fall.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-5\">It is a grave question what the testator meant to promulgate by the fifth item, by the words \u201cfrom their children\u2019s share.\u201d At first view it might be supposed he intended his grandchil-. dren. But such a construction would be entirely at variance with the general spirit and intent of other portions of his will. In my opinion the words \u201ctheir wives or\u201d have been omitted between the words \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201ctheir children.\u201d If they had been inserted, the will would be intelligible and comprehensible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-6\">Distribution will be made in accordance with the views and principles expressed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-7\">In accordance with the views above expressed, the Court deducted from the share of Rebecca Weidman, a daughter of the testator, $621.10 the balance due on a judgment obtained by Samuel Sheeler against H. B. Weidman, the husband of Rebecca Weidman, who then appealed complaining of the decree of the Court in this respect.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b358-8\"><em>J.

B. Weidman were sons-in-law of the testator. Holler\u2019s wife, Sarah, who was a daughter of the testator, died before the execution of the will. After directing that all his property should be converted into money, the testator made the following provisions, which are all that require notice in determining the question presented in this appeal, namely, shall the indebtedness of Ii. B. Weidman be taken from the legacy due to his wife ?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">\u201c3. All my children shall have equal shares, share and share alike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">\u201c4. The children of my son Isaac', deceased, and my daughter Sarah, deceased, shall have their parents\u2019 share, in equal shares, except Charles Henry, my son\u2019s son, shall have two dollars to the others one dollar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">\u201c5. If any one of my children, at the time of my decease, is indebted to my estate, by note, bond, or in my family book, or otherwise, then it shall be taken from their share or shares such amount or sum, and if any one of my sons-in-law are indebted to my estate, and is unable to pay the same, then it shall be taken from their children\u2019s share.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">\u201cThe question in expounding a will is not what the testator meant, but what is the meaning of his words. * * The will must be expressed in writing, and that writing only \u25a0 is to be considered. And in construing that writing, the rule is, to read it in the ordinary and grammatical sense of the words, unless some obvious absurdity, or some repugnance with the declared intentions of the writer, to be extracted from the whole instrument, shall follow from so reading it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">We are not pursuaded that any such absurdity or repugnance exists in this will. On the contrary, the meaning of the words seems plain, unless there should be an attempt to reconcile them with an intention not apparent upon the reading of the whole instrument. In the clause, \u201cif any one of my Sous-in-law are indebted to my estate, and is unable to pay the same, then it pbp.ll be taken from their children\u2019s share,\u201d there is nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>absurd ; nor is the intent doubtful. One of the testator\u2019s sons-in-law* had children, and a bequest of a share was expressly made to those children. In relation to him and his children the clause needs no interpretation. Other words could not make it plainer, that if Holler is indebted, and is insolvent, the debt shall be deducted from his children\u2019s legacy. If the clause be not strictly grammatical, its sense is in nowise obscure. Had Hebecca Weidman died before the decease of the testator then, her children would be entitled to the share bequeathed to her, and the clause would also apply to them and H. B. Weidman.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Nothing in the will warrants the inference that by mistake the words \u201cand their wives or,\u201d were omitted from said clause. To insert them would be making a new provision affecting the legacy of Mrs. Weidman. The.will clearly shows that the testator remembered the status of each member of his family, and his will, -with regard to each, is expressed. But it is itrged that said clause, in its l'elation to Weidman, is repugnant to the third item of the will, which declares that the testator\u2019s children shall have equal shares. But the whole instrument must be taken together, the third, fourth, and fifth items must be read with reference to each other \u2014 not one alone \u2014 and then there is no repugnancy, unless an exception to a general direction be called a repugnancy, instead of what it is. Thus read, the testator gives equal shares to his children, except that the sum of the indebtedness of each child to his estate shall be \u2022 deducted from his or her share, and the indebtedness of each insolvent son-in-law shall be deducted from the share of his children ; but it is no where said that the indebtedness of a son-in-law shall be deducted from the share of his wife, the testator\u2019s only surviving daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We are of opinion that the learned judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court erred in refusing Hebecca Weidman a full distributive \u25a0share under the will, without deducting therefrom the indebtedness of H. B. Weidman to- the testator\u2019s estate. The record will be remitted that the decree of distribution may be corrected so as to accord with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Decree reversed, record to be remitted for further proceedings, costs to be paid by the executors out of the estate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
