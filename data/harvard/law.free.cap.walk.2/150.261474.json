Bickel, the president of the Co.; William M. Bickel, hi* brother, the secretary and treasurer of the Co., and John F. Bickel, the son of' John M. Bickel. The first count charged the defendants with a-conspiracy to take and keep the proceeds of a certain lot of ground on Diamond street, the property of the Co., and that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>pursuance thereof they converted the same to their own use. The second count charged a similar conspiracy and conversion, as to the profits of a paving contract on the Callowhill street bridge, whieti profits belonged to the Co. by virtue of its ownership of the Alexander Miller Improved Wood Pavement, which was the pavement laid on said bridge. The third count charged a conspiracy to secrete the books of the Co., &amp;c. The fourth count charged a conspiracy to cheat the Co. out of a $500 ground rent. The trial resulted in a verdict in favor of William M: Bickel, one of the defendants; and against the other two defendants, John M. and John P. Bickel for $5,777.36. John M. Bickel and John P. Bickel then took a writ of error and assigned twelve specifications of error as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-3\">1.

Bickel and John P. Bickel, Nos. 2632 and 1381, of December Term, 1871 respectively, were obtained upon notes, which were a consolidation of various notes and obligations, against said Philadelphia Wood Paving Company, in favor of John M. Bickel, John P. Bickel, James II. Carman, L. S. Pilbert and others, that it was understood and agreed by said Bickel, at the time of said consolidation, that upon the sale of the personalty of the company on execution upon judgments to be obtained, the plaintiffs would purchase it, unless it otherwise brought a fair price, and re-sell it at the best price to be obtained, and account for the proceeds, that they did so buy it, and re-sell .it, and received and retained a sufficient sum to satisfy their portions of said judgments, long prior to the attempted appropriation hy them, of the proceeds of the wrongful sale of the lots on Diamond street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-6\">\u201cUnder this offer plaintiff\u2019s witness Dr. L.

It was \u201cagreed it should then be resold and whatever it brought should \u201cbe divided among the creditors of the company \u2014 that it was \u201cresold, some to John G. Moore for six hundred dollars. And \u201cWilliam T.

I offer that record for the purpose of showing that the suit was brought in the name of J. F. Bickel, and was subsequently amended by adding the name of John M.

Then <em>by </em>the record it is offered to prove that the judgment -was marked to the use of J. F.

Bickel for the recovery of dam igos alleged to have resulted from a fraudulent combination, by them to defraud the plaintiff of its moneys and other property. From the evidence, from the charge of the Court, and the statements of counsel, what the plaintiff undertook to establish, and did, in whole or In part, establish to the satisfaction of the jury, may be summarized as follows: That John M. Bickel, who was the president \u2022of the company, received the purchase money of a certain lot of ground, belonging to the company, and fraudulently disposed of It to his own use, and that of his sou, John M. Nickel. That the defendants fraudulently appropriated to a like use the proceeds of a contract for the right to use, on the Callowhill street bridge, the \u201cAlexander Miller Wood Pavement.\u201d In addition to these charges, we have a detail by Dr. Filbert of an arrangement between the Biekels aiid certain creditors by which their several claims were consolidated into two judgments, known as the \u201cBickel judgments.\u201d Further, that the parties afterwards Agreed that the personal property should be sold on a <em>fi. fa., </em>and If it should not bring its full value, it was to be bid in by one of the creditors, and upon resale, the proceeds were to be applied in satisfaction of the judgments. That thg property was so bidin by John M. Bickel, and afterwards by him resold at a large advance, but the money thus realized was not credited on the judgments. Again we have the purchase by the defendants or \u25a0one of them, of a judgment against the plaintiff in the sum of $1,060 known as the \u201cBarker judgment,\u201d for about one hundred dollars, and which was marked to the use of John F. Bickel, the son: the charge of $450 of this in the cash book, and an attachment, presumably for the balance on themselves. In addition to this, in the same cash book, appear entries of the payment of the two Bickel judgments in full. From this condensed history -of the case it is very obvious that a good deal of explanation, as -well as denial was required in order to make their conduct look even passably honest. If, indeed there was a willful con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>cealmont of tlie $5,500, raised from the sale of the lots; or if that money was applied to judgments already paid by the previous sale of the personal property, there was a gross fraud per- \u2022 petrated upon the company. So, if the Barker judgment was p irehased, in the maimer detailed, for the joint benefit of the president, John M. Bickel, and his son, any attempt to collect the whole of it from the company, was in like manner fraudulent ; Hill vs. Frazier, 22 Pa. 320. There is therefore, enough in this case, without reference to the alleged fraudulent conduct of the defendants in the matter of the paving contract, to justify the charge of the Court and the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\">\u00a5e next turn our attention to the specifications of error. All these are without merit. The first, because there is a negative answer to the question to which exception' was taken, hence no\" harm -was done. The second, because it -was part of the plaintiff\u2019s case to show how the Bickel judgments were made up, and also, the agreement of the creditors, therein interested, as to the application of the proceeds, of the sale of personal property. lhe third, because the style of the Filbert judgment showed that both the defendants were interested in the resale of the personal <em>l </em>roperty. The fourth is good for nothing, inasmuch as it takes exception to the Barker judgment, already referred to in detail, and which was properly admitted. The fifth, for the reason that the Sellers\u2019 letters were \u2019admitted, in connection with Barker\u2019s testimony, for the sole and only purpose of proving the price paid for the judgment. Even admitting that the admission of these letters for this purpose was wrong, yet as the fact was proved both by Barker and Bickel, the error was harmless. Neither can the sixth assignment be sustained, for the allowing of new matter to be brought out on cross-examination, is a subject addressing itself to the sound discretion of the Court, hence not reviewable ; Jackson vs. Litch, 62 Pa. 451. At most, however, this was a mere question of time, for, as the witness being examined was a party to the suit, under the second section of the Act of April 15th, 1869, P. Laws. 30, the plaintiff could have recalled him for cross-examination, hence the defendant would have gained nothing by having the examination deferred. The seventh, eighth and ninth are passed as containing nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>worthy of special notice. \u25a0 The tenth anl eleventh are also without merit. It was proper to prove a meeting of the company in the year 1875, and, that of this John M. Bickel liad notice. That the notice was informal was of no consequence ; opportunity was afforded him of attending the meeting had he seen fit to do so, and this was all he- had a right to require. The twelfth assignment we pass with the remark, that if attorneys suppose a Court has no right to interpose, and put orderly questions to a witness, during his- examination, either for its own information, the advancement of justice, or, as in this case, to give the witness an opportunity for explanation, they are very much mistaken. The question put by the Court afforded the witness an opportunity for explanation and self justification, and was altogether proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Judgment affirmed..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
