Wolfe, the plaintiff, on the 27, Apr. 1883, caused a capias ad respondendum to issue out of Common Pleas of Lan- \u2022 caster County, having first made and filed an affidavit, as required by the rule or court, and on the same day, John H.

On the 28th of Apr., 1883, the said Edward E. Yohn, defendant, presented his petition to the Court of Common Pleas, setting forth the above facts, and also, that the said defendant was, at the time of issuing said capias^ and had been for more than two years, prior thereto, a resident in this commonwealth, and was possessed of a clear estate, and dwelling house, worth 50 pounds, current money of America being a clear estate ; claiming, that said defendant was privileged from arrest, under the act of Assembly of 1724, and \u201925, Pur. Dig. page 48, PI. 46, being a freeholder, and further praying the court to abate the writ of capias ad respondendum, and allow said defendant 30 shillings cost to be paid by said jfiaintiff. The \u25a0court granted the prayer of the petition, and directed a rule to be entered, returnable forthwith, and made it absolute. On May 1, 1883, the court granted a rule on Edward E. Yohn to show cause why the said ordter should not be rescinded, and the said writ of capias ad respondendum reinstated, and the said 30 shillings .refunded to said plaintiff by said defendant, which said rule on argument was discharged on Aug. 18, 1883, in the following opinion per.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b74-4\">Patterson J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-5\">'The Rule above cited must be discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-6\">That the old statute of 1725 in reference to the issuing any writ of arrest against a defendant exempt from arrest, is still in force cannot be doubted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-7\">The Court was well satisfied of that on April 28, 1883, when the Defendant in the above action on that day, first showing that the writ of <em>capias </em>has been issued on the preceding day \u2014 the 27th \u2014 made his motion on affidavit filed, alleging his freehold, {which was not disputed) that the said writ be abated, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-8\">Accordingly the Court holding, under that statute, that \u201ca free-holder who is privileged from arrest on a <em>capias </em>will be \u25a0entitled uuder such circumstances to have the writ quashed,\u201d the Order abating the writ was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-9\">That said old statute of 1725 was operative ever since the Act of 1838 seems to have been the unform judgment of the Courts from that period up the present time. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>In the absence of any decisions of the Supreme Court we must be governed by our convictions and the decisions of the lower Courts; the. latter have been unformly. in the same direction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-4\">We refer to some : See\u2014 Blakiston <em>vs. </em>Potts, 2 Miles 388, decided in 1840.

Capias had been served September 20,1881, returnable October 1st, 1881. \u201cRule to quash <em>capias </em>made absolute,\u201d and the Court added that \u201cin the absence of any decision of the Supreme Court we considered it to be a hardship to limit the Defendant in entering his claim of freehold.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-11\">The only exception seems to be when a <em>privileged </em>and <em>unprivileged </em>person unite, in a joint trespass, and both are sued in one action: the former loses his privilege \u2014 Beale <em>vs. </em>Hoag <em>et. at </em>13 W.

Laws 458 ; which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>also provides, that all former laws, which were repealed or supplied, by the 4th and 5th sections of the act of June 13, .1836, are revived as fully and effectually, as if specially reinstated. Lynd vs. Biggs, 1 Clark, 18, decides that the act of 1725 is in force. See, also, Blakiston vs. Potts, 2 Miles, 388; Dobson vs. Fitzpatrick, 2 W. N. C. 186; Buckman vs. Jones, 3 W. N. C. 302; Ingersoll vs. Campbell, 10 W. N.

Laws 164, P. Dig; 63 Pl. 47, lhas never been repealed. As it remains in full force it controls this 'case. The act rests on sound reason. In a civil action arrests should not be encouraged when ample security is otherwise given to the plaintiff for the collection of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"A7\">Judgment Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
