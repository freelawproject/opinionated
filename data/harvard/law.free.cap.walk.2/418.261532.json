No. 227, January Term, 1884</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ax\">There was an appeal by the plaintiff, from the judgment of Justice Andrew Plertzog. Richard Drew had dealings with the firm of A. W. and John EL Gans, who were in the lumber business, and other dealings with A. W. Gans, merchant. A. <em>W. </em>and J. EL Gans sued Drew before the Justice of the Peace, claiming $67 to be due them. The parties appeared and then concluded to leave all matters in dispute and variance, as far as partnership is concerned, in the lumber business, while A. W. Gans and J. EE. Gans were running the saw mill in partnership to the arbitrament of A. W. Scott and Andrew EEertzog, Esqs., and, if they disagree, they are each to choose a third man, whose decision \u25a0 shall be final and conclusive, without writ of .certiorari or appeal. After hearing, the arbitrators found an award for the defendant for $165.78., and costs of suit. A. <em>~W. </em>and J. EE. Gans then appealed from this judgment, and filed a transcript in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Common Pleas. Drew then took a rule to show cause why the appeal should not be stricken off, because they had' agreed to leave it to arbitrators, without the writ of certiorari or appeal. In answer to this rule, the plaintiffs filed an affidavit, that the \u25a0award in this case is founded, in part, upon matters on account, \u2019which did not belong to, nor in any way concern the partnership claims between A. W-. and J. II. Gans, and Richard Drew, hut were altogether separate and apart from said partnership \u25a0claims and business, and that the said award is, therefore void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-4\">Testimony was taken upon this rule. The Coprt directed the appeal to be stricken off.
