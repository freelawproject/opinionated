Bivins against George Hench to recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>some installments on sixty shares of People\u2019s Freight Railway stock. In subscribing, the following clause had been inserted in the subscription: \u201cNo assessments to be made on this stock \u2022unless the Sherman\u2019s Valley route is taken and for work actually done in grading.\u201d Some assessments had been made and paid, but the road was finally sold out by the Sheriff, not being completed. The Court held that the plaintiff\u2019 was bound to show that the work done in grading was worth more than the amount collected before he could recover. The Court also allowed the amount paid the engineer for services while Bivins was grading, but did not allow plaintiff\u2019 to show a debt due to the engineer for locating the road. The Court also rejected evidence of plaintiff i- show the costs of collecting and printing, &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-3\">J. <em>H. </em>Graham, <em>Esq., </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGS\">argued that Hench was bound to pay the installments when called; Miller vs. Pittsburg and Connellsville R.

It declared inter alia that no assessment should be made unless \u201cfor work actually done in grading.\u201d This agreement was one which the parties had an undoubted right to make. It was not contrary to public policy nor in conflict with any statute. The defendant was not willing to pay in advance. He therefore stipulated he should not pay until the work was actually done. The doing of the grading was to precede the making of any assessments for him to pay. The learned judge ruled the case correctly according to the letter and spirit of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
