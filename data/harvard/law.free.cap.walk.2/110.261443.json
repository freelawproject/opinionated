No. 72 Jan. T., \u201984.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOP\">On June 3rd, 1857, the plaintiff insured his barn and contents In the defendant Co. for $1,275. In Oct., 1866, the barn and contents were destroyed by fire, and this action was brought upon the policy to recover damages for the loss. The defendant upon the trial, alleged as a matter of defence, that the plaintiff had failed to pay his assessments, when due, and that such failure worked a forfeiture of his policy. The defendant under objection, was allowed to show, that notice of two assessments, which the plaintiff had not paid, were inserted in two German newspapers, published respectively in Berks and Lehigh Counties. The by-laws of the Company provided for notice by publication and on failure to pay, rights under the policy should be lost. The plaintiff alleged, that he had never seen the notice, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>question is, whether a newspaper publication of an assessment levied by Mutual Fire Ins. Co. is a sufficient notice to a member to work a forfeiture of his policy, in the event of his failing to pay suck assessment. The charge of the Court was to the effect that such failure to pay, defeated the right to recover, after the published notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-4\">Verdict for defendant on the 5th Sept., 1882.

No doubt exists in regard to the assessments having been made in due form, and that payment thereof was not made. There was also evidence which justified the jury in finding that the plaintiff in error had actual notice of the assessments. We find no error in the assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
