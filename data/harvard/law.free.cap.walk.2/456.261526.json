No. 123 July Term, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-6\">The son of plaintiff in error drove his horse to the Tacony station of defendant with a passenger. The horse became frightened at the passenger train and ran away, along the public road ahead of the train. This road is in sight of the track and crosses it twice in about one hundred yards. At the first crossing the engineer allowed the horse to pass in front of him, but then turned on the steam; and the engine struck the horse at the second crossing. During the trial plaintiff proposed to ask a witness whether \u201cthe horse took the road that any horse would probably take.\u201d The following question was also asked : \u201cIf the engineer had exercised reasonable caution and care would this accident have occurred.\u201d The Court ruled out both questions, and directed a non-suit. Watson then took a writ of error complaining of the rejection of the testimony offered and the non-suit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b454-8\"><em>B.

Whether the horse took the road he probably would take, was a question for the jury, to be determined upon the circumstances, rather than upon the mere opinion of the witness as to what a horse might. do. The question was\" very indefinite and not founded on the facts. We cannot say there was error in refusing-to allow it to be answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The train was rightfully travelling the company\u2019s track. But it can scarcely be said that a frightened horse, rushing madly across it, even though in the route of a public highway, is crossing in a proper manner. It would be improper of course to run him down with the engine, or not to take proper precaution' to avoid unnecessary injury. This precaution the engineer took, when the horse first crossed the railroad track by coming to a full stop of his train, before reaching the crossing. But after the horse had crossed, and was passing along a road of three outlets, one of \u25a0which turning off at right angles recrossed the track, it cannot be pronounced evidence of negligence, that the engineer put on a full head of steam to continue his trip. He had a right to proceed, and was not bound to presume that the horse would recross the track within five hundred feet. Whistling was of no importance. . It could be no signal of warn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>ing to a horse, and would only have increased his fright if ha were near.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\"We discover no evidence of negligence to be submitted to a jury; and the</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
