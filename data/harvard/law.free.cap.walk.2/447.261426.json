No. 286 January Term, 1885.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-14\">This was an action of trespass brought by W. C. Garey vs. N. K Woodward. It appeared that in February and March, 1883, O. A. Seeley delivered at Dushore Switch and other places in Dushore certain lumber which he had sold to N. K. Woodward. A part of these shipments were stored at \u201cHadley Avenue.\u201d On the 2d of May, W. C. Garey issued a writ of replevin against Seeley, commanding the Sheriff to replevy \u201csixty thousand feet of hemlock lumber at Dushore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Switch, of the value of $420;\u201d to which return was made: \u201cReplevied as within commanded, and summoned the defendant May 3d, 1883, and property replevied delivered to plaintiff.\u201d In June, 1883, Woodward removed the lumber, which was lying at Iladley avenue, and Garey brought this action of trespass against him to recover its value. The replevin- suit -was tried in December, 1883, on a plea of property in Woodward and others, and resulted in a verdict for Garey, upon which judgment was entered March 31st, 1884. To this a writ of error was taken, and, while it was pending, (sinc\u00e9 reported 109 Pa. 301) the action of trespass was tried.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-4\">The plaintiff claimed that his title to the lumber was established by the verdict and judgment in the replevin suit; but, as the writ and return did not show that the property at Hadley Avenue was involved in that suit, he called the Sheriff, and proved by Mm that it was a part of that which he replevied. The defendant objected to the record because it was between other parties, and because a writ of error was pending ; and to the parol evidence because the return. showed for itself what was done under the writ. The evidence being admitted, the defendant excepted. He attempted to cross-examine the Sheriff as to the amount of lumber replevied, and the exact place where it was situated, which was excluded as irrelevant and an exception sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-5\">The defendant offered 'to show that a writ of error to the judgment in the replevin suit was pending, wherefore it could not be said that anything was yet determined thereby ; but the Court refused, to admit it. Testimony was also excluded tending to show that the Sheriff' had said to other persons that the lumber at Hadley Avenue was not included in the replevin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-6\">The verdict was for the plaintiff, for $97.55.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-7\">\u201cWoodward then took a writ of error. ' The first and second assignments of error were to the admission of the record of the replevin suit and the parol testimony of the Sheriff; the third to the refusal to permit the cross-examination; the fourth to the rejection of the writ of error ; and the sixth, eighth and ninth to the exclusion of the proposed contradiction of the Sheriff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>Messrs.

Eor that purpose he gave in evidence the record of an action of replevin, brought by him in 1883 against O. A. Seeley tor sixty thousand feet of hemlock lumber. This record evidence was supplemented by oral testimony of the Sheriff who executed the writ, tending to prove that the lumber now in controversy was part of the larger lot replevied by him in that case! The admission of this evidence, both record and oral, is assigned for error. We are satisfied, however, that it was neither incompetent nor irrelevant, and hence the first and second assignments are not sustained. The issue in the action of replevin, involving, as it appears to have done, the title of plaintiff below to the lumber replevied, as against both the defendant therein and the defendant in this suit, was determined in his favor ; but, inasmuch as it did not appear by the record that the lumber now in controversy was embraced in the action of replevin, it was necessary for him to prove the fact <em>aliunde ; </em>and for that purpose the Sheriff was called, not to contradict or correct any error in his return, but to identify the lumber as part of the larger lot replevied and delivered to plaintiff in the writ,-as set forth in his return indorsed therein. The command of the writ was to replevy sixty thousand feet of hemlock lumber at Dushore\u2019s Switch, etc.', and the Sheriff\u2019s return thereto was, \u201cReplevied as within commanded * * * * and property replevied delivered to plaintiff.\u201d It was undoubtedly competent for the plaintiff to identify the property thus replevied, and prove, if he could by the Sheriff or any other competent witness, that the lumber now in controversy was part thereof; but it is equally clear that the witness called by him was subject to cross-examination, in like manner as any other witness, for the purpose of testing his recol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>lection and the accuracy of his statements. The fact that he was the Sheriff, by whom the writ of replevin was executed, can make no possible difference in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The avowed purpose of the offer, referred to in the third ' specification, was to show, by cross-examination of the Sheriff, that the lumber which is the subject of 'this action of trespass, \u201ccould not have been embraced in the writ of replevin upon which he made his return.\u201d This was objected to because it was not cross-examination, and for the further special reason \u201cthat it is entirely immaterial to this issue, the only question being whether the lumber testified to was actually included in the lot of lumber replevied by the Sheriff, and delivered to the plainfiff in this issue, and which was found by a jury to belong to the plaintiff, the defendant in that issue having pleaded property in F. I. Page and N. K. Woodward.\u201d There is no merit in either of these objections. The second is a reason in favor rather than against the offer. It is true, as therein stated, that the only question was whether the lumber in controversy was embraced in the replevin. The object of the proposed cross-examination was to show that it was not, and for that purpose we think it was clearly proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">For similar reasons, the offers covered by the sixth, eighth and ninth specifications were erroneously excluded. Sufficient ground was laid to warrant the admission of the testimony suggested by these offers. It is unnecessary to notice the remaining assignments of error. Neither of them is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Judgment reversed and a <em>.venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
