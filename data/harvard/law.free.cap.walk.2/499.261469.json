The assignee had, under an order of Court, made a sale of Berrell\u2019s property clear of judgments, for such a price that neither claim would be paid. Melcher\u2019s judgment was for $1,000, and was prior to the Saving Fund judgment foils,832.50. The association then made a proposition to Melcher that they would try to have the sale set aside, if he would release his claim for $200. He signed the following paper r \u201cJany. 2, \u201977. I do this day agree to take from proceeds from the sale two hundred dollars from the said sale for my claim which I do hold at present from John Berrell and Edward Berrell, his son, which I do hold $1,000 against both properties. I do agree to take from the Jenkingtown Building Association, in case they buy the two properties of John Berrell,' Sr., to take for my balance two hundred dollars, to be in full. Adam Melcher.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-4\">The association then employed' counsel and had the sale set aside, and at the second sale they ran it up to an amount sufficient to pay Melcher\u2019s judgment and nearly $1,300 of their own claim. They tendered Meleher the $200 before the second sale. He refused to accept.\u201d The auditor who distributed the fund held that the writing did not constitute an agreement binding upon the parties. Standing alone it seems wanting in the essential parts to make it an agreement. There is but one party <em>to </em>it. The association does not agree to pay the plaintiff $200. There is no mutuality expressed in it. There is no agreement on the part of the association with the plaintiff* at all. It is nothing more than a proposal on the part of the plaintiff to the association to take $200 for his judgment under the representations made by them. It was not accepted by them at the time, and if construed as a proposed contract, it must have been acceded to by both parties at the time it was written. At the time the engagement was all on one side, and before the other side went to make it mutual or binding the plaintiff had a right to withdraw his offer, which in this case he did.\u201d The auditor thereupon awarded payment of the judgment in full to Melcher, who collected it. The Abington Building Association then brought an action of assumpsit for the amount of the judgment, less $200, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ugainst Melchor. Tlie judge (Ross) directed a verdict for the defendant, and promised to dispose of the legal questions upon the motion for a new trial. Tie died without rendering a decision, and his successor declined to grant a new trial without hearing argument or delivering an opinion. The association then took a writ of error, complaining of the action of the Court in directing a verdict for defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b499-4\">G. <em>R.
