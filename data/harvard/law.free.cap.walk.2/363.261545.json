Stroud, &amp; Son, against William Stroud, the surviving partner, and against a creditor, to whom the latter had assigned the firm assets. By amendment the administrator of Morris R. Stroud, the deceased partner was added as a party complainant. The-bill, set forth, that the firm of Morris R, Stroud &amp; Son, had been composed of Morris R. Stroud and William Stroud.- That Morris R. Stroud had died; that the firm was insolvent, at the time of his death; that William Stroud, thereafter, while liquidating the business, had, without consultation, with the other creditors, or representatives of the deceased partner, assigned all the assets of the firm, to one creditor. Complainants prayed for an injunction against the transfer of the assets, under this, assignment, a discovery and account of said assets, and the appointment of a receiver. The answer substantially admitted the above facts, but averred that the transfer to the preferred creditor was a bona fide sale of the assets, for a fair price, which was paid by giving a credit to the firm on their indebtedness, to the extent of such price. The- Court dissolved the injunction, (12 W. N. C. 419 ;) and afterwards on Nov. 24, 1883 dismissed the bill, on bill and answer. Russell and others, creditors of the firm of Morris R. Stroud, then appealed, and assigned for error, that the Court' erred in dismissing complainants bill, and in not entering a decree for complainants, 'on the bill and answer-filed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-8\"><em>John </em>G. <em>Johnson Esq., </em>for appellants</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApR\">argued, that the surviving partner of an insolvent firm, after its dissolution, by reason of the death of his co-partner, could not assign all its assets to a creditor, aware of such insolvency, to the exclusion of all the other creditors, from participation in the administration of the same. During the existence of a partnership, it is not within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>the power of one partner, against the wishes of his co-partner, to .assign all the assets to a trustee, for the benefit'of creditors ; McNutt vs. Strayhorn, 39 Penna. 273; Dickinson vs. Legare, 1 Dessau 537; Pearpoint vs. Graham, <em>4 </em>Washington C.

Stroud, William'-Stroud became sole surviving partner, and as such, the entire legal title to the partnership assets vested in him ; Lindley on Partnership, 1045 notes; Gratz vs. Bayard, 11 S. &amp; R. 41. The Act of April 17, 1843, P. L. 273 only prevented a partner preferring in an assignment; Worman vs. Wolfersberger, 19 Penna. 59. A partner may prefer any creditor he chooses,provided he does not do it by means of an assignment; Wilson vs. Berg, 88 Penna. 171; Heberton vs. Jepherson, 10 Penna. 124; York County Bank vs. Carter, 38 Penna. 446; Bentz vs. Rockey, 69 Penna. 71; Mellon\u2019s Appeal, 1 Gr. 212; Miners\u2019 National Bank\u2019s Appeal, 57 Penna. 193; Wallace vs. Wainwright, 87 Penna. 263.

He is entitled to the exclusive possession and control thereof. He may sell and dispose of the whole assets or any part thereof in payment of the debts of the firm. The payment of ouc creditor is no fraud on the other creditors. It is true that the Act of April 17, 1843, P. Laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>273, prohibits preferences in assignments for the benefit of creditors ; yet it does not prevent a debtor by a conveyance or transfer of property, to prefer any of his creditors,, although he may thereby hinder or prevent his other creditors from collecting just demands. To defeat a transfer to a creditor accompanied by a delivery of possession, there must be an actual intent to hinder or delay the other creditors; Bentz vs. Rockey, 69 Pa. 71; Wilson vs. Berg, 88 Pa. 167. In this case the payment was made in good faith, to apply on an unquestioned debt against the firm. The surviving partner had a right to so appropriate the assets of the firm. It follows that the Court committed no error in dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
