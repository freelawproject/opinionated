C. J. Tilghman held, under the Act of March 27,1790, 2 Smith\u2019s Laws 520, that these officers were not entitled to the expenses which are simply incidental to the office and not to the building. Fuel is not within the meaning of that Act or the Act of April 15, 1834, P.

Fuel is essential to the comfort of the officer, not to the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Judgment affirmed. \u25a0</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
