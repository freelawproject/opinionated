An affidavit, of defence was filed, to the effect, that the said Co., instead of keeping and maintaining the sluices in good order and repair, have caused them to be closed up, or blinded, thereby causing the water to lay for a long time, on the meadows owned by the-plaintiff in error, by means of which he has been greatly damaged by the loss of his crops, &amp;c. On the 22d of Dec., 1883, the-Court made the rule for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defence absolute, and assessed the damages at $84.40. Farrell then took a writ of error, complaining of the action of the Court in entering the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-6\"><em>Charles H. </em>Downing, Esq., for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeY\">argued that if the company did not furnish the proper drainage they are not entitled to recover the taxes or assessments for doing that which they have failed to do.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-7\"><em>Jos.
