No. 58, January Term, 1885.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-8\">This was an appeal from an order of Court, refusing to open a judgment entered on a warrant of attorney in a judgment note for $340.00. Levi Anderson and Jonathan Anderson were the defendants, and Lydiani \"Wallet was the plaintiff. The judgment was afterwards transferred to Jehu Madden. It seems that the note as originally given was usurious, and a credit for the usury was allowed under direction of the Court. Another allegation of the Andersons was that Jehu Madden, along with T. L. TJttley, was indebted to Levi Anderson to the amount of $84.00; and they claimed a set-off to that extent, and paid the balance into the Sheriff\u2019s hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-9\">The indebtedness to Anderson was incurred sixteen years before the judgment was assigned to Madden, and consisted of a note on which suit had been brought and judgment obtained against TJttley; but Madden was not served, and he further alleged that he had a defence to the note, because Anderson gave TJttley (who was the principal debtor) time when he might have collected the debt, and TJttley afterwards became insolvent. Anderson further alleged that there was an agreement that the judgment note should not be entered up in Court; but Madden .denied any knowledge, of this alleged agreement. The Court made the following order: \u201cOctober 1,1884, Rule discharged on condition that plaintiff enters credit for usury of six dollars at the date of judgment note, otnerwise rule made absolute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Anderson then took this \u25a0 appeal, assigning the foregoing decree for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-4\"><em>L.

The only fact proved to justify the opening of the judgment was the illegal interest charged in the note; Beaty vs. Bordwell, 10 Norris 438. That interest has been deducted and the appellants fully discharged therefrom. If all the other alleged equities did exist they are not to be asserted by \u25a0opening the judgment. No motion was made to strike off' the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>judgment. If it had been the evidence is insufficient to justify such action. The other alleged claims are not the subject of set off against the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
