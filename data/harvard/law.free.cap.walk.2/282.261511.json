No. 9 January Term, 1885. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-6\">This was an appeal by Christian Stolz from a decree of the Court awarding a fund realized by a Sheriff\u2019s sale of the property of the Union Foundry and Manufacturing Co. to Keppelman to use of Wanner &amp; Streng. The agreement of sale of the Union Foundry and Manufacturing Oo. stock contained the following clause: \u201cThe parties to this agreement covenant with each other in manner following, (the said corporation covenanting for itself, its successors and assigns, and the other parties for themselves, their heirs, executors and administrators)\u2019\u2019 &amp;c. The facts of the case are contained in an opinion awarding the fund to Keppelman to use of Wanner &amp; Streng, which was delivered August 9, 1884 per:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b280-8\">Hagenman, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-9\">The defendant company was a corporation with a capital of $20,000, divided into 200 shares of the par value of $100 each. John Id. Keppelman was the owner of 100 shares, and Christian Stolz and Id. C. L. Crecelius were the owners of the other 100 shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-10\">There were two mortgages against the real estate of the defendant company, one of $10,000 and the other of $2,500. On the first day of October, 1881, said Keppelman sold his 100 shares to the defendant company by an agreement with said defendant company and the other two stockholders, Stolz and (Creceliiis for $10,000, payable in notes as follows: One note-payable Oct. 1, 1888, for $1,000. One note payable April 1,, 1884, for $1,000. One note payable April 1, 1885, for $2,000. One note payable April 1,1886, for $2,000. One note payable April 1,1887, for $2,000. One note payable April 1, 1888., for $2,000, said notes were all dated Oct. 1,1881,' with interest payable quarterly. It was further provided that in case of the default of the payment of the interest, or of any of the said notes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>for the space of two months after such interest or notes became due, then the whole amount shall be due and payable, and a judgment for the same was then authorized to be entered against said defendant company. The first note due Oct. 1, 1883, was. not paid, and on December 4, 1883, a judgment was entered against said defendant company for $10,250 in favor of .John Keppelman, for use of said Wanner and Streng, the holders of the notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-5\">On the 3rd of Nov.,-1883, said Christian Stolz brought suit-against said defendant, and on the 24th of Nov., 1883, recovered judgment for $6,016.14 on notes which were principally given since October, 1881.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-6\">The agreement of sale further provided that the parties of the second part, to wit: the defendant company, Christian Stolz and H. O. L. Crecelius, agree that the Union Foundry and Manufacturing Company shall and will not during the continuance-of the indebtedness hereby created, (the said note of $10,000) nor until all the notes aforesaid shall have been paid with interest, make, execute or issue any bond or mortgage, nor confess, any judgment nor create any lien in any form upon the property of the company beyond the amount of lien indebtedness ' now existing, to wit: the amount of a first mortgage of $10,000, and of a second mortgage of $2,500, as aforesaid. As Keppelman was taking notes without a judgment or mortgage to secure them,, it is obvious he was stipulating against any other liens against the defendant company\u2019s property until his notes were paid. Whilst this agreement would not prevent any stranger from obtaining a judgment against, the defendant company for any indebtedness then existing or thereafter created, yet Stolz or Crecelius, the only other stockholders, could not in any manner take or acquire a lien of any kind against the defendant company\u2019s property to the prejudice of Keppelman. It would be a-fraud on him to permit Stolz,.as President of defendant com-pany, sign anote in favor of himself, obtain a judgment on it to-the injury of Keppelman, after he, Stolz, had covenanted with Keppelman against it. The j udgment of Stqlz against the defendant company may be good as to all others, but it cannot take precedence of Keppelman-in this distribution. The rule in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>favor of Keppelman for the use of Warmer and Streng is made absolute, and the rule on behalf of Stolz is discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-4\">A rule was also taken by Chas. H. Schaeffer, Henry Grim and two sons, Sigmund Schwante, Frank Reeser, William Langner, William Moser, Valentine Rickenbach, William Foreman, Charles Wertz and Ezra Schmohl, laborers, why the sum of $5240-100 should not be distributed to them. There was no evidence submitted to\u2019establish their claim, \u25a0or what either one of them was entitled to receive for.any work-which they had performed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">The rule is discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-6\">Stolz then appealed to the Supreme Court complaining of the the action of the Court helow in not awarding the fund to him.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-7\"><em>C. G. </em>Derr, and <em>H. A. Yundt, Esqs., </em>for appellant</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFa\">argued that it was not the intention to covenant that suit should not be \"brought and judgment obtained; but that the company should \u25a0not voluntarily increase its indebtedness.

The appellent seeks to claim in direct antagonism to his agreement with the appllee. He signed that agreement \u25a0not only as an officer of the Union Foundry and Manufacturing \u2022Company but also bound himself personally, and \u201chis heirs, executors and administrators.\u201d We therefore concur with the learned judge, in holding that the appellant cannot set up the judgment he afterwards obtained, to the injury of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
