Navis and now has in his hands as proceeds thereof the sum of four hundred eighteen and thirty-seven one-hundredth dollars \u2022($418.37),being the amount realized by such sale less costs. Now, for the purpose of determining the right of said several parties plaintiff to the moneys, or any part thereof, so as aforesaid in the hands of the said defendant, it is hereby agreed that all matters concerning the distribution thereof be referred to Henry B.

Upon the completion of his duties the said Henry B.

Evidence and exceptions attached to said agreement filed December 27, 1883.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-4\">The referee made a report and exceptions were filed thereto, and were sustained by the Court in the following opinion, per</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b324-5\">Boxer, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-6\">Jefferson J. Davis was the lessee of a stone quarry from J. M.. Shainline, and carried on the business of quarrying stone for-building purposes. A warrant to distrain for rent in arrear was issued by the landlord, and also executions by judgment, creditors, under which certain personal property, consisting of cars, carts, stone truck, sledges, drills, <em>et </em>cetera, used in carrying on the quarry were seized and sold by the Sheriff as the property of Jefferson J. Davis. The sale realized the sum of $418.37 after payment of costs. In the distribution of the fund in the . Sheriff\u2019s hands, the landlord claims a preference for rent; and twenty-six quarrymen, whose aggregate claims amount to more than the entire fund, claim a preference for arrears of wages.. (Bobert McClellan also claims -the fund as the owner of the. goods sold ; but it is manifest that he has no standing here, the-property having been levied upon and sold as the property of Jefferson J. Davis.) The parties entered into an amicable agreement of reference, reserving the right to file exceptions to the report of the referee upon the distribution of the fund by him,, as if to the report of the auditor appointed by the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-7\">The referee awarded to the landlord, J. M. Shainline, a prefer- ' ence covering the amount of rent in arrear, viz: The sum of $248.50, and the balance, over the cost of the reference, he awards <em>pro rata </em>to the laborers for the wages due them, which reaches. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>but 10J per cent, of their respective claims. \"Was this distribution in accord with the true intent and meaning of the Act of April 9,1872, P. L. 47, allowing a preference for wages, and its several supplements ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-4\">If these claimants for wages belong to a class of laborers, which are to be preferred at all under the Acts referred to, they are entitled to a preference before the landlord, by the supplement to the Act of 1872, approved 12 June, 1878, P.. L. 207; which expressly so declares. As the Act of 1872 originally stood, and as it was repeatedly' construed by the Courts, the wages of labor preferred were only those due to the beneficiaries named in the Act from persons, or chartered companies, who employed <em>miners, mechanics </em>or <em>clerks ; </em>and unless due from some person or chartered company in whose business <em>miners, mechanics </em>or <em>clerks </em>were employed, laborers were excluded from any preference under the Act. This construction resulted inevitably from the strict grammatical reading of the Act; although it is hard to understand how the added employment of a mechanic, miner or clerk by the debtor, could enlarge the merit of the laborer. But the law was so written, and so interpreted. So in Sullivan\u2019s Appeal, 27 P. F. S., 107 (1874), a cook in a hotel was excluded. In Allen\u2019s Appeal, 32 P. F. S., 302 (1875), the <em>clerk </em>of a hotel was excluded along with the other hotel employees ; although \u201cclerks\u201d were seemingly named in the Acts as if protected themselves and intended to protect others by their presence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-5\">But the Supreme Court held that the words <em>'\u25a0'\u25a0other </em>business,\u201d used in the Act, must refer to some business <em>\u201cejusdum generis </em>with those named, to wit: \u201cworks, mine or manufactory.\u201d And Pardee\u2019s Appeal, 4 Outerbridge, 408 (1882), followed, confining the protection of the Act to the limitations mentioned in Allen\u2019s Appeal, <em>supra.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-6\">But now we have a new Act upon the subject, that of June 13,1883, P. L. 117, which necessitates a new reading. . It declares in effect, that the Act of 1872 shall be no longer restricted as it once was ; but shall embrace a large number of additional bene- ' ficiaries, such as \u201cservant girls at hotels, boarding houses, restaurants, or in private families, or other servants and helpers, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>and about houses of entertainment and private houses, porters, hostlers, all persons employed in and about livery stables, laundrymen and washerwomen, seamsters and seamstresses employed by merchant tailors, milliners, dressmakers, clothiers, shirt manufacturers, and clerks employed in stores* hands, printers and apprentices hired for wages or salary.\u201d An analysis of the new Act will make it evident that some of the same phrases which occur in the original Act, and are repeated in the supplement, but with different context, require a new rendering. It is more than any Court, however learned, can accomplish, to interpret the Act of 1883 in strict accordance with good grammar and good sense, and at the same time in conformity to the construction which some of the same phraseology in the Act of 1872 has already received. Can it in the light of the last Act, any longer be, that the employer of the preferred laborer must likewise be the operator of a mine or manufactory, or works <em>ejusdem generis? </em>Could it have been intended by the Legislature that the wages of the servant girls, washerwomen, sewing women, porters and hostlers, mentioned in the Act, shall be preferred only due by persons likewise employing \u201cclerks, miners or mechanics ?\u201d The title of the last Act itself excludes such a conclusion; for it declares its object to be to amend the Act of 1872 \u201cso that wages of servant girls, washerwomen, clerks and others shall be preferred and first paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the property of insolvent debtors owing wages to such servants or employees.\u201d It will be observed that the declared intention of the Act is general, that these preferred wages \u201cshall be first paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the property of. <em>insolvent </em>debtors,\u201d without reference to the descriptions of their operations in business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-4\">TIow, then (keeping this in view), can the Act of 1883 be best made to read in accordance with the consistent use of the People's English ? I answer by simply referring the troublesome clause restricting the class of employers to where it seems most reasonably to belong; namely to <em>chartered, companies. </em>This can be accomplished by the judicious use of two semi-colons; so that the Act would read, thus \u2014 \u201cdue ***** from any pei\u2019son or persons; or chartered company employing clerks, miners, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>mechanics or laborers, either as owners, lessees, contractors, or under owners of any works, mines, manufactory, or other business where clerks, miners or mechanics are employed ; whether at so much <em>per diem </em>or otherwise,\u201d &amp;c. According to this reading the preferred wages might be due from <em>any person or persons ; </em>but if due from a <em>\u201cchartered </em>company,\u201d then the restriction still remains which limits the preference to business carried on by the company where \u201cclerks, miners or mechanics are employed,\u201d but eliminated from the remainder of the sentence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-4\">I cannot say that this rendering frees the language of the Act from all just criticism ; but it accomplishes the important object of removing the absurdity inseparable from any other reading. In the construction of statutes any liberty may be taken with the punctuation which will aid us in arriving at a reasonable interpretation. Common sense should prevail over strict grammatical rules, and punctuation should not control. Gyger\u2019s Estate, 65 Pa. St. 311; Cushing vs. Warwick, 9 Gray 382; Hamilton vs. Steamboat Hamilton, 16 Ohio, N. S. 432; Sedgwick on construction of Statutory law, 225, note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-5\">It is easy to apply to any other reading of the Act of 1883 than here indicated the <em>redtieiio ad absurdam. </em>Eor example, how would it sound, by a slight pharaphrase, to say that wages due or hereafter to become due for labor and services rendered by any servant girls at hotels, boarding houses, restaurants, or in <em>private </em>families, or to other servants and helpers in and about said houses of entertainment, and private houses, shall be preferred: Provided, however, the employer shall in each case also operate a mine, manufactory some or similar establishment where clerks, <em>miners or mechanics </em>are employed ? Such reading would be quite as strange when applied to some of the other protected classes mentioned in the Act, such as hostlers, porters and washerwomen. It cannot be supposed that the Legislature could have intended a distinction so absurd, if by any reasonable construction of its language the Act can be made to read otherwise. Under the rendering here suggested, and adopted, the claimants of wages earned by their labor in the quarry are clearly entitled to be preferred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>But their case might, even under the acts of 1872 aud 1878, have been rested on the ground that they were employed in a business of a permanent nature carried on exteusively by as many as twenty-six laborers, aiid that they were actually \u201cminers,\u201d if the most extensive application of that term be adopted, as in such case it may be deemed proper. Webster defines a miner to be \u201cone who mines ; a digger for metals and other minerals.\u201d Aud to mine, he says, is \u201cto dig a mine or pit in the earth ; ta dig in the earth for minerals.\u201d Building stones are minerals,, though not metals; and excavations for building stone are generally distinguished from metallic mines by being called quarries. Still they are a species of mine, and it is no abuse or perversion of language to include them in that designation in the construction of such a statute. The business carried on in this instance was extensive enough to require the keeping of books of account. There does not appear to have been a clerk employed by that name ; but the foreman kept books, in which he kept accounts of the men\u2019s time. This was a clerical act, by whomsoever pelformed. The books containing the accounts of the shipments of stone,seem not to have 'been offered in evidence, and are not, considered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-5\">And now, April 7,1884, the report is referred back to the referee with instructions to state a distribution in accordance with this opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-6\">The referee then made a second report, in conformity with the order of Court. The second report was confirmed, and John, athan M. Shaiuline, the landlord, then took an appeal, complaining of the action of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-7\">\n<em>J. P. H.
