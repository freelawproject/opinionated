Miller, deceased, and Mary Miller, widow of Joseph Miller, deceased; for farming instruments, wagons and cattle, &amp;c., to the value of $200. A case stated was submitted to the Court as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-11\">Joseph A. Miller, in February, 1877, expected to become the tenant of the farm of Jacob Bower, the plaintiff, after April of that year, Jacob Bruch being in possession as tenant to April 1, 1877.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-12\">Joseph A.

Miller, and in consideration to secure him, the said Jacob Bower, that all the said goods and chattels should be his, the said Jacob Bower\u2019s, until the said notes, amounting to upwards of two hundred dollars, should be-fully paid and discharged by the said Joseph A. Miller.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-5\">The goods and chattels remained upon the farm of the said Jacob Bower, in the possession of Jacob Bruch, without any change, until Bruch moved away in 1877, when the said Joseph A.

Miller.\u201d The administrator refused to deliver them up, whereupon on October 2, 1878, the plaintiff-caused the writ in this case to be issued, and on October 3, 1878, the said defendants gave a property bond to the Sheriff, and retained the said goods and chattels.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-10\">On November 14,1878, a large portion of the said goods and chattels, valued at $125, among others, were valued and appraised and set apart for the widow under her claim of exemption. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>rest of said goods and chattels, amounting to $75, were included in the general inventory, which was filed in the Register\u2019s office, November 15,1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-4\">On November 4,1878, the widow\u2019s inventory was duly filed in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Northampton County, and confirmed \u2022'\u25a0'\u25a0nisiand afterwards confirmed absolutely without exception thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-5\">The goods and chattels retained by the administrator, were -converted into money and applied in the administration of the. estate, and accounted for in the final account of the said administrator, duly filed March 1, 1880, confirmed nisi, and afterwards \u25a0confirmed absolutely by the said Orphans\u2019 Court, without exception thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-6\">If the Court be of opinion under this state of facts that the plaintiff is entitled to recover all the goods and chattels named in the writ, then judgment to be entered for plaintiff', \u2022and against the defendants, for the sum of two hundred dollars, provided, however, that in case the Court be of opinion that the plaintiff was only entitled to the goods and chattels taken by the widow under her claim of exemption, then judgment to be entered for plaintiff and against the defendants for the sum \u2022of one hundred and twenty-five dollars, otherwise judgment to be entered in favor of said defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-7\">The costs to follow the judgment, and either party reserving the right to sue out a writ of error thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-8\">The Court below entered judgment in favor of the defendants \u2022on May 28, 1883, in the following opinion per:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b387-9\">Schuyler, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-10\">At the close of the argument of this ease stated, the counsel for the plaintiff moved to amend the record \u201cby striking out from the names of defendants the assignation and description \u2022\u2018administrator of Joseph A. Miller, deceased,\u2019the same having been inserted in the praecipe and writ by mistake and inadvertence.\u201d The counsel for the defendants vigorously objected to \u2022our taking any such liberty with the case stated, which he contended was a solemn agreement between the parties, which the \u25a0Court has no right to change.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>We think there is force in this Objection. True, the motion to amend does not purport to interfere with the case stated directly, but it does so interfere indirectly. By the case stated Peter Bepsher agrees that in a certain event judgment may go against him as \u201cadministrator of Joseph A. Miller, deceased.\u201d If the amendment is allowed, the judgment thus entered would stand against him individually. This he did not agree to, and there may be many good reasons why he should not. Be this as it may, we do- not think we have any power to change the contract of the parties in the manner proposed, and the motion to amend must therefore be denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-4\">It does not follow that we are powerless to relieve a party who has entered into an agreement for a case stated through mistake- or inadvertence. In a proper case we would not hesitate to compel the opposite party to agree to a correction of the mistake,, under the penalty of having the case stated dismissed in the-event of a refusal, a practice which seems to be countenanced in Whitesides vs. Bussell, 8 W. and S. 47. But in the present case we do not feel warranted in proceeding to this extremity,, inasmuch as under our view of the law, the amendment asked for by the plaintiff would not avail him even if it were allowed\u00bb</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-5\">Suppose it to be allowed. The action would still stand against two joint defendants, calling for a joint judgment, even if we-were not restricted by the express terms of the case stated from entering any other. To sustain such a judgment there must be evidence of a joint possession and detention by the defendants of the property mentioned in the writ. It is a familiar principle that liability of parties to a suit is fixed at the impetration of the writ. Now the writ of replevin was issued October 2, 1878. On that day Peter Bepsher was in the exclusive possession of all the property in dispute, and he alone refused to deliver it up. This co-defendant\u2019s connection with the property dates from the next day when they joined in the claim property bond. Under these circumstances it is not easy to see what there is upon which tobase a joint judgment against the defendants, and if there were nothing else in the case we think it would be our duty to give judgment in their favor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>But we prefer to rest our decision upon less technical grounds. The facts are within a very narrow compass. The property in dispute originally belonged to one Jacob Bruch, who was tenant on the farm of plaintiff. Joseph A. Miller succeeded Bruch as tenant April 1, 1877. In contemplation of that event Bruch, in February, 1877, held a public vendue at which Miller purchased the disputed property, Bruch retaining possession until the following first day of April. Miller gave his notes for the purchase money payable in ten months from the day of sale. The plaintiff became surety on these notes, upon the express agreement with Miller, that the property should belong to the plaintiff until Miller paid the notes. The plaintiff paid the notes before maturity, and in August, 1878, Miller died insolvent, being still the tenant of the plaintiff, and still having the disputed property in his possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AvA\">Upon this state of facts the learned counsel for the plaintiff argued with much zeal and ingenuity that the sale from Miller to the plaintiff was valid even as against the credit of the former, although wholly unaccompanied by a transfer of possession, either actual or symbolical. The theory is that Miller himself, being out of possession at the time of the sale to the plaintiff, he could not deliver a possession which he never had and that the law never requires impossibilities ; that by the terms of the sale everything that Miller had, passed and vested in the plaintiff, and nothing more should be expected. It will be noticed that the fact that Miller did not get possession for <em>two months </em>after this transactioh is of no significance. If the argument is sound then, if Miller got possession two hours or even two minutes after the bargain between him and the plaintiff, the plaintiff\u2019s title would have been just as good. It is easy to be seen where such an argument carried to its logical results would lead us, and how, under such a construction, <em>Slat. </em>13, <em>Miz., </em>which has stood the test of three centuries, would suddenly become worse than a dead letter upan the statute book.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ALBh\">But it would be affectation on our part to pursue this branch of the case further in view of the language of GHbson J. in Clow vs. \"Woods, 5 S. and R. 280, in commenting on Meggot vs. Mills, 1 Ld., Raym 286, a ease in its essential facts wonderfully like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>the present. \u201cMeggot vs. Mills\u201d says that great Judge \u201cis a ease wholly irreconcilable with principle, and. I apprehend not lav The assignor purchased the goods with moneys borrowed !f rom his landlord, and as a security made a bill of sale to the landlord, but retained possession. What was that but to create on personal property, a lien existing separately from the possession, which the law abhors ? Lord Holt went upon the ground that the possession was according to the terms of the agreement, and the contract fair, and so indeed it was between the parties, <em>but it was deceptive as to the public ; </em>and a creditor ought not to be suffered to secure himself, by means that may <em>ultimately </em>work an injury to third persons. The object of the parties might have been attained without any (at least with less) risk to the public, by the landlord himself becoming the purchaser in the first instance, and permitting the tenant to have the use of the property, in which case the transaction would have been a safe and fair one, <em>and that course should have been </em>pursued.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-4\">There remains to be considered but one other point, made on behalf of the plaintiff. After the writ of replevin was issued the administrator set aside to his co-defendant, who is the widow of Joseph A. Miller $125 worth of the property in dispute, and inasmuch as Mary Miller is not a creditor, it was argued that as against <em>her </em>the title to the property is in the plaintiff. Even if this were a sound legal proposition it is not clear that it can be successfully asserted against Mrs. Miller in a joint action against her and the administrator brought more than a month before the goods were set aside to her, and &gt;rought before she had possession of any part of the property in dispute. But is the proposition sound ? We have attempted to show that the sale from Miller to the plaintiff was void as against the creditors of the former. If this be so, then Miller, having died insolvent and in possession of all the property included in the attempted sale, at the instant of his death the <em>whole </em>of the property passed into the custody of the law for administration, and the plaintiff had no right to undertake to administer any part of it for the satisfaction of his own debt; Eater vs. Steinruck, 4 Wr. 505. The law recognizes the right of the widow to have $300 worth of such property set aside for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>her use, and when it is once set aside to her, the Courts will see that she is protected in the enjoyment of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-4\">And now, May 28, 1883, judgment is entered in favor of the defendants with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-5\">Bower then took a writ of error, complaining of the refusal of the Court to amend the writ, and in entering judgment for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-6\"><em>C.
