They were insolvent since August 15th. The creditor who seeks to prove was ignorant of this fact. On August 15th the bankrupts were not indebted to the creditor. Subsequent to that time the sales by the creditor to the bankrupts and the payments by the bankrupts to the creditor were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-5\">Sales to Bankrupts by Creditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-6\">Aug. 17,1901.

Wyman, 49 C. C. A. 574, 111 Fed. 726, that no preference was given. The trustee contends, however, that only those advances made by the creditor after the last payment received by the creditor from the bankrupts are to be taken into account in determining whether a preference was received or not. The contrary was decided by this court in Re Topliff (D. O.) 114 Fed. 323, and no sufficient reason has been shown in the learned and elaborate brief of counsel for the trustee to overrule the decision there reached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-20\">The facts in the other cases submitted, viz., In re Woodward, Ex parte Atlas Chemical Co., were substantially the same, and no preference was given in either case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-21\">The judgment of the referee is reversed, and the claims are allowed proof.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-22\">Harry J.
