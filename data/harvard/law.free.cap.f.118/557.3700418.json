The company pleaded the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-4\">At the first trial Leslie proved the contract, his patents, the company\u2019s manufacture of a large number of machines like one or another of four models produced to the jury, refusal to pay royalty or to relinquish the patents, and introduced expert testimony tending to prove that each of the models embodied one or more of the essential principles covered by one or more of the patents. The company offered expert testimony to prove that none of the models embodied any of the essential principles covered by Leslie\u2019s patents, either in identical construction or mechanical equivalents. The court rejected the proffered evidence, charged the jury, in effect, that the company could not hold the patents and at the same time escape the payment of royalties by altering the form of its machines, and directed a verdict for Leslie. The judgment was reversed by this court in Sewing Mach. Co. v. Leslie, 24 C. C. A. 107, 78 Fed. 325.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-5\">At the second trial Leslie introduced substantially the same evidence as at the first. The company introduced a great deal of evidence to show the state of the prior art, and expert testimony to the effect that none of its models embodied any of the essential principles covered by the Leslie patents. The court charged the jury, in effect, that under the prior art there was no room for the application of the doctrine of mechanical equivalents to the company\u2019s models, and directed a verdict for the company. On a record that did not contain the proof made of the' prior art, the judgment was reversed by this court in Leslie v. Sewing Mach. Co., 39 C. C. A. 314, 98 Fed. 827.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-6\">At this the third trial Leslie made out substantially the same case as before. The company exhibited the prior art quite fully; introduced expert testimony to the effect that in view of the prior art Leslie\u2019s claims must be limited strictly to the very means detailed, and that, so limited, they do not cover any of the company\u2019s models; and also produced evidence tending to show that the changes were made in good faith, and not merely to escape the payment of royalty. No evidence was introduced to sustain the counts of the declaration other than the one for royalty. At the end of Leslie\u2019s evidence in chief, and again at the conclusion of all the evidence, the company moved the court to dismiss the cause for want of jurisdiction. The company further moved the court to direct a verdict in its favor. The cause was submitted to the jury, who returned a verdict in Leslie\u2019s favor. The company duly excepted to the giving and refusal of various instructions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-7\">The assignments of error present the questions of jurisdiction, of the propriety of refusing to direct a verdict, and of the correctness of instructions given and refused.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b590-8\">John Dane, Jr., and Charles S.

That the state court had jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the counts for wrongfully failing to make the required number of machines and for wrongfully refusing to surrender the patents after demand plaintiff in error does not controvert, but contends that since these counts, though not dismissed, were not supported by evidence, they cannot be considered; that the subject-matter of the remaining count was not within the jurisdiction of the state court; and that, as soon as this state of things became apparent, it was the duty of the federal court to dismiss the action. If it be conceded that jurisdiction depends solely on the count for royalties, nevertheless we think the motion was rightly denied. Plaintiff in error admits that if it and Leslie agreed on the construction of the patents the case of Albright v. Teas, 106 U. S. 613, I Sup. Ct. 550, 27 L. Ed. 295, would be decisive, but insists that their contention over the applicability of the prior art and its effect in limiting Leslie\u2019s claims transmutes the cause into one of exclusively federal cognizance. In any action upon contract for royalties, the plaintiff produces the contract, his patents, and the machines made by the defendant. The contract being proven, the question is, do the defendant\u2019s machines embody any of the essential principles covered by the patents? To determine this, it is necessary both that the patents and the defendant\u2019s machines be construed. Otherwise no intelligent comparison can be made. So the plaintiff introduces evidence on both points, but only to sustain his one contention, that the defendant has failed to pay a sum due under the contract. The interpretation of the patents as well as of the machines is necessary to a proper construction of the contract, but obviously is only incidental to that one purpose. The patents are construed, not as independent grants to which the defendant is a stranger, but as a part of the contract into which he entered. Now if, under a plea of the general issue, the defendant chooses to controvert the plaintiff\u2019s evidence only on the one point, and not on the other, how can it logically be said that the defendant\u2019s partial denial has changed the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action? A reduction of the contention to this form is, we think, its sufficient answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">To solve the questions presented by the remaining assignments, it is necessary to understand the former decisions in this cause; for it is a familiar \u00e1nd entirely righteous rule that a court of review is precluded from agitating the questions that were made, considered, and decided on previous reviews. The former decision furnishes \u201cthe law of the case\u201d not only to the tribunal to which the cause is remanded, but to the appellate tribunal itself on a subsequent writ or appeal. Roberts v. Cooper, 20 How. 467, 481, 15 L. Ed. 969: \u201cThere would be no end to a suit if every obstinate litigant could, by repeated appeals, compel a court to listen to criticisms on its opinions, or speculate of chances from changes in its members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">In Sewing Mach. Co. v. Leslie, 24 C. C. A. 107, 78 Fed. 325, it was ruled that the court\u2019s charge to the effect that the company could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>refuse to surrender the patents and at the same time escape the pay.ment of royalties by altering the form of its machines was erroneous, that the company was not limited to making machines employing the Leslie patents, and that royalties were to be paid only on such machines as did embody some essential principle covered by the patents. That ruling, right or wrong, was binding on the parties not only in the trial court, but also in this court in subsequent proceedings. The decision, however, did not undertake to say in advance what kind of evidence the company might use to support its denial of royalties due.</p>\n<p id=\"A2y\">In Leslie v. Sewing Mach. Co., 39 C. C. A. 314, 98 Fed. 827, as already stated, the court charged the jury in effect that under the prior art there was no room for the application of the doctrine of mechanical equivalents to the company\u2019s models, and. directed a verdict for the company. The judgment was reversed qn a record that contained the plaintiff\u2019s case, but did not disclose the evidence of the prior art on which the trial court had ruled that the plaintiff\u2019s case was incontrovertibly overcome. The court said: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">\u201cWhen a finding has been directed in favor of the defendant In a case, and the bill of exceptions, though not purporting to contain all the evidence, contains a statement of evidence in behalf of the plaintiff sufficient on every issue to have justified' a verdict in his favor, the rule (that the bill of exceptions must contain all the evidence) manifestly ought not to apply, especially if it be apparent that the action of the court was the result of a misapprehension of the bearing and force of the proof adduced. It is plain that there was such an error in this case. Upon the evidence set out in the bill of .exceptions the plaintiff was entitled to recover on one paragraph of the declaration a stipulated sum for each machine manufactured by the defendant, if those machines involved \u2018any of the essential principles covered by the patents.\u2019 The question was taken from the jury because in the judgment of the court, as stated in its charge, the claims of each of the patents \u2018are restrictive by the terms of the patents, and, in view of the clearly shown prior art, to such an extent that the doctrine of mechanical equivalents cannot be invoked in this case.\u2019 That was to treat the case as if there were no contract between the parties, and the question were simply of infringement by a wrongdoer. * * * The contract is explicit, and in our opinion excludes any inquiry into the prior art for the purpose of limiting the scope of the patents. It contains the express stipulation that Leslie \u2018shall not be held to guaranty the validity of said patents or any of them, or to protect said second party against infringement \u2022 thereof, but all royalties hereunder shall cease upon the date of a decree of any court of competent jurisdiction declaring the invalidty of said patent or patents\u2019; and it is further provided that the \u2018second party shall not be obliged to make rotary shuttle sewing machines like any model that has been or may be constructed or settled upon as a standard, but it may from time to time make such changes as may seem to it expedient; but no such alteration or change shall relieve the second party from the payment of royalties, as hereinafter provided, so long as the machine made by it involves any of the essential principles covered by the patents of the first party.\u2019 This last expression clearly means that changes or alterations which should introduce only equivalents of the original elements should not relieve the second party from the payment of the stipulated royalties, and like the other provision that all royalties should cease on the date of'a decree declaring the invalidity of the patents is inconsistent with the proposition of the court that' the doctrine of mechanical equivalents could not be invoked in the ease. To the same effect in our former opinion we said: \u2018Leslie was unwilling to guaranty the validity of his patented inventions, or to protect the company in their use should they prove to infringe upon another\u2019s protected rights. This risk was assumed by the company, upon the condition, however, that the payment of royalty should cease when a competent court should declare the invalidity of the invention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>The company contends that a licensee has the same right as an alleged infringer to go into the prior art for the purpose of limiting the scope of the patent; that in the present case the prior art shows that the elements in Leslie\u2019s combinations were old; that the elements in the company\u2019s combinations come nearer to the prior art than to Leslie\u2019s; and that, Leslie\u2019s claims and the company\u2019s models being properly interpreted in the light of the prior art, there can be no valid insistence upon mechanical equivalency. On this the corollary is predicated that the expressions in the opinion that \u201cthe contract excludes any inquiry into the prior art for the purpose of limiting the scope of the patents\u201d and \u201calterations which introduce only equivalents of the original elements do not relieve the company from the payment of the stipulated royalties\u201d are mere dicta. On the contrary, these pronouncements lie at the heart of the decision. The bill of exceptions contained evidence for Leslie \u201csufficient on every issue to have justified a verdict in his favor.\u201d If this had not been decided to be so the directed verdict against him would have been allowed to stand. The bill of exceptions did not contain the evidence relating to the prior art, introduced by the defense. The court was therefore bound to presume that the strongest possible defense in that respect had been made, that the prior art showed that the elements in Leslie\u2019s combinations were old, that the elements in the company\u2019s combinations came nearer to the prior art than to Leslie\u2019s, and that, Leslie\u2019s claims and, the company\u2019s models being properly interpreted in the light of the prior art, there could be no valid insistence upon mechanical equivalency. In this state of the record a reversal required the court to hold that a licensee stands on a footing different from an infringer\u2019s; that the infringer is not bound by the patentee\u2019s ex parte statement of his claims; that the licensee comes into contract relation with the claims; that, by the contract in this case, Leslie did not guaranty the validity of the patents nor agree to protect the company against infringements, but royalties should cease upon a competent court\u2019s decreeing the invalidity of the patents; that the company was therefore required to accept Leslie\u2019s claims as he made them or let them alone; that the prior art therefore could not be inquired into for the purpose of limiting the scope of the claims; and that therefore the use of machines which embodied mechanical equivalents of Leslie\u2019s claims as he made them would not relieve the company from the payment of the stipulated royalties. We think it clear that the criticised portions were far within the necessities of the decision. This construction of the contract left it open for the company on the last trial to introduce evidence, if it had any, that the machines in question did not employ the mechanical equivalents of Leslie\u2019s claims as he made them, the prior art being left entirely out of view. And if we were to agree with counsel that the reasoning is all wrong, and involves \u201can obvious inversion of logic,\u201d it would not change the result that such is the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">At the last trial Leslie again produced the contract, his patents, the machines made by the company, and expert testimony that, without taking the prior art into account, the machines embodied the mechanical equivalents of several of Leslie\u2019s claims as stated in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>patents. As decided on the last preceding writ of error, this made a case for Leslie \u201csufficient on every issue to have justified a verdict in his favor.\u201d The .expert testimony for the company with reference to the interpretation of Leslie\u2019s claims and the company\u2019s machines, and the comparison of the two, was based wholly and explicitly upon the prior art as a foundation. The remaining evidence of the company was to the point that the changes were made in good faith and not merely to escape the payment of royalty. This was irrelevant. If the company had in fact abandoned the use of the Leslie patents, the reason was entirely immaterial. There was, therefore, under the former decision, no evidence that was legally sufficient to meet Leslie\u2019s case. Consequently there would have been no error in directing a verdict for Leslie. And so it becomes of no concern what instructions the court gave or refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The situation is not at all changed by the fact that, after the court had indicated that he would exclude all evidence touching the prior art, Leslie withdrew his objection, and the court thereupon allowed the evidence to go in. If Leslie had been defeated, manifestly he would be estopped to predicate error on the admission of the evidence. But the fact that he was willing to take his chances before the jury does not authorize the company to require us to give an effect to the evidence different from what it was entitled to under the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">In addition to the foregoing considerations, we are inclined to believe that, on the contract and the whole record, the right result has been reached, and that intermediate errors, if any, should therefore be disregarded. If the company wants to contest with Leslie on the footing of an infringer, let it reassign the patents and continue the making of its present models.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
