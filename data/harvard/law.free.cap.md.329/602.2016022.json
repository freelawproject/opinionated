At the time the garnishment was initiated, \u00a7 11-603, which was enacted by Ch. 818 of the Acts of 1989, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azg\">\u201c(a) <em>Spousal </em>property.\u2014(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a garnishment against property held jointly by husband and wife, in a bank, trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>company, credit union, savings bank, or savings and loan association or any of their affiliates or subsidiaries is not valid unless both owners of the property are judgment debtors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection does not apply unless the property is held in an account that was established as a joint account prior to the date of the entry of judgment giving rise to the garnishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">(b) <em>Property held in </em>trust.\u2014A garnishment against property held in a bank, trust company, credit union, savings bank, or savings and loan association, or any of their affiliates or subsidiaries, by one party in trust for that party and another party or parties, is not valid unless all of the parties are judgment debtors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">(c) <em>Joint </em>Accounts.\u2014(1) If property held jointly in an account in a bank, trust company, credit union, savings bank, or savings and loan association, or any of their affiliates or subsidiaries, is garnished, and less than all of the persons named on the account are the judgment debtors, the garnishee may pay into the court from which the writ of garnishment has been issued the lesser of the amount of the judgment or the amount held in the .account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">(2) If the garnishee makes payment into the court as provided under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the garnishee may not be held liable to the judgment creditor or to any person named on the account for wrongful dishon- or or for any other claim relating to the garnishment.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">In September of 1979, Ruth Ellen Pearce, the appellee, was awarded a $113,500 judgment against John G. Micka in the Circuit Court for Howard County as damages resulting from his legal malpractice. $96,000 of the judgment was for compensatory damages and $17,500 was awarded in punitive damages. See <em>Pearce v. Micka, </em>62 Md.App. 265, 489 A.2d 48 (1985). Micka did not have malpractice liability insurance to cover the judgment and has avoided any substantial payment of the judgment up to this point.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">On January 15, 1990, Micka and his wife, Paula, sold their home at 333 Frostwork Road in Columbia, Maryland for $215,251. They purchased the home in 1976 and held it as tenants by the entireties. The couple received a net settlement of $108,130 which was dispersed in two checks. The first check was drawn to Paula Micka and deposited in her account at Provident Bank. The balance was paid by a second check for $53,065.35 drawn to John G. and Paula Micka. They opened a new account with Maryland National <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Bank, the appellant, on January 17, 1990, and deposited the funds there. At trial, Mr. Micka testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\">\u201cWell I, I had gone to Provident, I had asked Provident if they could, if they had an account that could be held by husband and wife, subject to withdraw [sic] by either, that on the death of one the balance went to the survivor, and that because it was held by husband and wife couldn\u2019t be attached because there was a judgment against me. And I found that that wasn\u2019t possible at Provident\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">MR. KERR: Object, move to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">\u201cA. So I went to Maryland National, which was right down the street. At Maryland National, I found that that was possible, that they had an account that fulfilled my requirements and my requirements were from my prior understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">\u201cQ. And so those were the same requirements you just enumerated for Provident? Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">\u201cA. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-10\">\u201cQ. That is, held jointly by you and your wife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-11\">\u201cA. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-12\">\u201cQ. With the right of survivorship, death of either one of you the balance would be paid\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-13\">\u201cA. The balance, yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-14\">\u201cQ. And that it would not be attachable for the debts of any one of you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-15\">\u201cA. Yes sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-16\">The agreement which the Mickas signed when opening the account at Maryland National provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-17\">\u201cThe bank is authorized to rely on any one of the signatures below for transacting business on this account. If this account has multiple owners: (1) the account shall be considered held jointly by each owner in trust for one another; (2) each owner shall be fully liable for all obligations arising under the terms of the account; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>(3) any balance in the account at the death of any owner shall belong to the surviving owner(s).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">The signature card containing that agreement was signed by John G. and Paula Micka under the declaration: \u201cJOINT ACCOUNT\u2014SUBJECT TO THE RIGHT OF EACH OWNER TO WITHDRAW.\u201d The garnishment of that Maryland National account is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">On June 18, 1990, Ruth Pearce filed a Request for A Writ of Garnishment with the Clerk of Court for Howard County, seeking garnishment of the Maryland National account. The writ directed Maryland National to hold \u201c[a]ny [accounts on which Judgment Debtor\u2019s name appears, including account No. 960-126-100\u201d and to file a written answer within 30 days of service. The Writ of Garnishment was served on June 20, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">On August 2, 1990, Maryland National filed an answer, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">\u201cIt confesses that it holds assets of the defendant consisting of an interest in a joint deposit account, however, the joint nature of this account precludes garnishment for the satisfaction of the judgment entered against the defendant in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Pearce filed a response on August 7, 1990, contesting that answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">At the time the writ was served on Maryland National, the Mickas\u2019 account balance was $33,237.79. The Mickas continued to have access to the funds which were used for household expenses and tuition for their son until July 10, 1991, when Maryland National filed an amended answer where it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">\u201cIt confesses that it holds assets of the defendant in an account owned by two (2) or more persons, one (1) or more of whom but fewer than all of whom, are judgment debtors. Garnishee is holding assets consisting of money market account no. 0960126100 with a balance of $8,636.45, pending further order of the Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-645(g), the case came to trial on January <em>2, </em>1992, before Judge Raymond J. Kane, Jr., who ruled that the Mickas\u2019 account was a \u201cspousal account,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> under \u00a7 ll-603(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. The court agreed with Pearce that because her judgment against John G. Micka preceded the opening of the Mickas\u2019 account at Maryland National, the account was subject to garnishment, even though Pearce was a judgment creditor of only one of the account owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The court entered judgment in favor of Pearce and against Maryland National for $33,237.79, the amount in the Mickas\u2019 account the day the bank was served with the Writ of Garnishment, plus $667.96 in interest that accrued on that principle sum through July 23, 1990, when the account reached its highest balance. Maryland National appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued our writ of certiorari prior to consideration of the case by the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">On appeal, Maryland National Bank argues two theories for reversal. First, that the Mickas opened the Maryland National account with monies held as tenants by the entirety, and therefore, the account could not be attached or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>garnished by a creditor of only one spouse. Second, that the Mickas\u2019 account was a jointly owned account, which each held in trust for the other, protected from garnishment for the individual debt of either by \u00a7 ll-603(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. It will not be necessary for us to address Maryland National\u2019s first argument since we agree with its second contention and shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The treatment of multi-party bank accounts in trust form has long been a matter addressed by the common law. In <em>Milholland v. Whalen, </em>89 Md. 212, 43 A. 43 (1899), our predecessors delivered the seminal decision on the treatment of such accounts. In that case, Miss Elizabeth O\u2019Neill opened a bank account at the Metropolitan Savings Bank in April, 1895. The pass-book included the language: \u201cMetropolitan Savings Bank, in account with Miss Elizabeth O\u2019Neill. In trust for herself and Mrs. Mary Whalen, widow, joint owners, subject to the order of either; the balance at the death of either to belong to the survivor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213, 43 A. at 43. Miss O\u2019Neill retained the passbook in her possession. At Miss O\u2019Neill\u2019s death, both her executor, Charles W. Milholland, and Mrs. Whalen claimed the account balance. The trial court awarded the funds to the beneficiary of the trust as against the estate. The estate appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The Court held that the declaration in the account was sufficient to create a trust:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">\u201cIn Maryland it is not requisite that the <em>cestui que trust </em>should be notified of the declaration or establishment of the trust. It is the donor\u2019s act which originates the trust, and it is the intention with which he does the act that is material. The entry, unexplained, is a sufficient declaration of trust, because it indicates an intention to establish a trust; but this may be rebutted. Possession by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>depositor of the bank-book in no way detracts from the force of the entry; because it is a possession by the trustee and does not denote that no beneficial interest had been given to the <em>cestui que trust. </em>If the delivery of the money to a bank to be placed to the credit of the depositor in trust for another, and the declaration of the trust, as evidenced by the entry made pursuant to the settlor\u2019s instructions, constitute and evidence a valid trust, then no act of the depositor in subsequently withdrawing the money can affect the rights of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>unless the power to withdraw be reserved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 216, 43 A. at 44 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">\u201cWithout multiplying illustrations, or overburdening this opinion with further references, those just given suffice to show that such a deposit as we are now dealing with, constitutes a valid declaration of trust, in the absence of contravening proof; and that when a trust is thus created the rights of the beneficiary become fixed, even though the settlor retains the bank-book in his possession. Nor does the circumstance that the depositor makes himself a beneficiary jointly with another, prevent the trust from attaching to the fund. A trust is not rendered void by the appointment of a beneficiary as trustee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 218, 43 A. at 45.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">This Court has consistently applied <em>Milholland </em>when dealing with joint bank accounts in trust form. <em>See, e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number><em>Arbaugh v. Hook, </em>254 Md. 146, 150-51, 254 A.2d 187, 189-90 (1969) (estate rebutted presumption that decedent\u2019s landlady had right of survivorship in joint account when account language expressed survivorship by evidence that decedent intended joint account to create special trust for definite and limited purpose terminating at his death); <em>Shirk v.

Savings Bank of Baltimore, </em>175 Md. 136, 199 A. 872 (1938). In that case, the judgment-creditor, Fairfax, attempted to garnish a Savings Bank of Baltimore account owned jointly by the judgment-debtor, Brazier, and his wife. The account agreement described the account as: \u201cHoward E. Brazier, in trust for self and Nellie M. Brazier, joint owners, subject to the order of either, balance at the death of either to belong to the survivor.\" <em>Id. </em>at 138, 199 A. at 874. The initial deposit in that account was the residue of a similarly worded trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>account held jointly by Brazier and his mother which passed to Brazier upon her death. The Braziers later deposited into the account the proceeds of a mortgage on investment property which they held as tenants by the entireties.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Fairfax attempted to garnish the account to satisfy a judgment awarded in a tort action arising from an automobile accident where Mr. Brazier\u2019s negligence resulted in Fairfax\u2019s injuries. The Court held that Fairfax could not reach the account because Brazier\u2019s ownership was contingent on his surviving his wife. Judge Parke explained for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">\u201cThe debtor beneficiary, therefore, has, during the joint lives of himself and wife the contingent right of survivor-ship in the trust fund; and the use or power of withdrawal in common with his wife, which either may exercise independently of the other. By the plain language of the declaration of trust the interest of the husband in the corpus of the trust is contingent upon his survival of his wife. So, the interest is uncertain and contingent in the sense that none of the deposit or trust may ever become due and payable to the husband. Such an interest is not subject to attachment as it is not within the scope of [Art. 9], Section 10.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 141, 199 A. at 875. The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">\u201cIt is apparent that if the husband had died after the attachment was issued, the judgment creditor would have no right against the funds or corpus, and the wife would receive, use, and enjoy her absolute estate in severalty in all of the personalty. The attaching creditor could not compel the husband as beneficiary to deprive the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number><em>cestui que trust </em>of the benefit of her right of survivor-ship by a present appropriation of the whole or any part of the trust fund so held for their benefit. A valid trust may not be diverted from its uses by attachment. The reason is that rights of the husband as a <em>cestui que trust </em>are determined by the terms of the deed of trust in which the equitable interest of the husband is not several, and may not be made or become several in the husband except if and when so made conformably with the terms of the declaration of trust. Since no event has occurred nor any power been exercised, within the contemplation of the trust, to make either the depositary or the husband as fiduciary liable as debtor to the husband personally in any amount, there are no ascertainable property rights or credits subject to the writs of attachment laid in the hands of the two garnishees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 142-43, 199 A. at 875-76 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">This Court has subsequently cited <em>Fairfax </em>as the rule governing garnishment of accounts and other property where the judgment debtor has a contingent interest. In <em>Hopkins Place Savings Bank v. Holzer, </em>175 Md. 481, 2 A.2d 639 (1938) a trust account was established with the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">\u201cJohn H. Holzer, in trust for himself and Elizabeth Holzer, joint owners, subject to the order of either, the balance at the death of either to belong to survivor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXl\"><em>Id. </em>at 483, 2 A.2d at 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">At a later date, John Holzer borrowed funds from the bank without his wife\u2019s knowledge and deposited the proceeds in the trust account. He pledged the trust account as collateral and deposited the passbook with the bank. The bank charged the trust account for interest payments. It was not until after her husband\u2019s death when she encountered difficulty in withdrawing funds from the account that Mrs. Holzer discovered the loan and pledge of the bank account. She sought to recover the entire balance of the trust account, including that portion collateralized to secure her husband\u2019s note. Judgment was granted in her favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>and the bank appealed. The Court concluded that the loan was simply an agreement between John Holzer and the bank, that the bank had knowledge of the terms of the trust account and was estopped from acting against the terms of the account, and that there was no evidence that the wife gave her husband or the bank permission to use the trust account for collateral. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">\u201cThe power of one joint tenant to withdraw funds deposited in trust for the benefit of the joint tenants, and, so, altogether or in part, to defeat the trust does not by inference confer the power of one joint tenant to pledge for his own debt the interest of himself and his joint tenant in such a deposit. A power may not be implied which would destroy the trust created for a purpose clearly in conflict with the design of its creation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 489, 2 A.2d at 643. <em>See also FICO, Inc. v.

There, a husband and wife had two checking accounts and a savings account at Equitable Trust Co., all of which were held jointly, in trust for one another, subject to the order of either, and payable upon death to the survivor. A judgment creditor of the wife caused an attachment to be laid in the hands of the bank. Purporting to act pursuant to Md.Code (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol.), Art. 11, \u00a7 103,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>impounded all of the accounts in which the wife had an interest, including the three accounts she held jointly with her husband. As a result, the bank dishonored checks drawn by the husband and wife on their joint checking accounts, and they sued the bank for \u201cwrongful dishonor and conversion.\u201d The bank\u2019s demurrer to their declaration was sustained without leave to amend, and they appealed from the judgment entered on that order. The Court of Special Appeals reversed. The late Chief Judge Gilbert, speaking for the court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-4\">\u201cThe message of the Court of Appeals of Maryland, delivered to banking institutions and attaching creditors, through the medium of <em>Fairfax v. Savings Bank of Baltimore, </em>175 Md. 136, 199 A. 872 (1938), was crystalline. In the <em>Fairfax </em>case, the Court held that in the absence of fraudulent conduct by a husband and a wife, a judgment creditor who has a claim against one spouse, but not both, may not attach a joint bank account, in trust for another, and subject to the order of either. The right to withdraw from the account, the Court said, is \u2018a reserved personal right of each, and beyond the control of the other, and, therefore, whether it shall be exercised depends wholly upon the individual will of each severally motivated.\u2019 175 Md. at 144, 199 A. at 876.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\"><em>Id. </em>46 Md.App. at 689, 420 A.2d at 1264.

Equitable asserted that the statute is directed toward accounts in which the debtor is the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>or part owner. It follows then, the way Equitable reads the statute, that <em>Fairfax </em>has been rendered nugatory by the 1951 act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-4\">\u201cWe do not share Equitable\u2019s view of the effect of the statute.

Under the House version, all joint accounts of a husband and wife would have been exempt from attachment by a judgment creditor of either. The Senate version, on the other hand, would have rendered all joint accounts subject to garnishment by a judgment creditor of any one of the joint owners except that it exempted those joint accounts which were in trust form. The conference committee resolved the conflict between the two versions exempting from garnishment those joint accounts held by husband and wife which were opened prior to the date of the judgment giving rise to the garnishment. At the same time the conference committee distinguished between joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>accounts and those which were created in trust form. Thus, where an attachment is based on a judgment entered prior to the opening of the account, we discern the legislative intention to limit the garnishment of joint accounts of husband and wife by a judgment creditor of either to those accounts which are not in trust form.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Finally, we reject the notion that Ch. 818 of the Acts of 1989 was intended to abrogate the well established rule of <em>Fairfax v. Savings Bank of Baltimore, supra, </em>which was grounded upon the validity of a trust established in a bank account recognized in <em>Milholland v. Whalen, supra. </em>In contrast, we observe that the General Assembly enacted Ch. 578 of the Acts of 1992, amending various sections of the Financial Institutions Article, to address comprehensively the classification and effect of multi-party accounts in financial institutions in this State. Since many of the provisions of that act changed the common law of this State, the General Assembly provided in \u00a7 2 of Ch. 578 that it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">\u201c[I]s intended to alter the common law, including <em>Whalen v. Milholland, </em>89 Md. 199, 43 A. 45 (1899), <em>Milholland v. Whalen, </em>89 Md. 212, 43 A. 43 (1899) and their progeny, as it applies to all deposit accounts in financial institutions that are established in the name of one or more parties, whether or not in trust, or with survivorship rights, or with payable on death rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">We conclude that the account opened by the Mickas at Maryland National Bank was in trust form within the meaning of <em>Milholland v. Whalen, supra. </em>The account agreement provided the recognized entry which \u201cunexplained is a sufficient declaration of trust, because it indicates an intention to establish a trust.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216, 43 A. at 44. Furthermore, Mr. Micka testified at trial of his intention to open an account for the use of both him and his wife while protecting the deposit from attachment by his creditors. In doing so the Mickas committed no fraud upon Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Pearce since they were depositing proceeds of the sale of tenants by the entireties property, which had been protected from Mr. Micka\u2019s creditors, into another form of jointly owned property which was also protected from his creditors. Ms. Pearce presented no evidence at trial to rebut the presumption of a trust as required by <em>Milholland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">We further conclude that the Mickas\u2019 account met the description of a trust account set forth in \u00a7 ll-603(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article which provides in part that \u201c[a] garnishment against property held ... by one party in trust for that party and another party or parties, is not valid unless all of the parties are judgment debtors.\u201d Mr. and Mrs. Micka held the account jointly, subject to the order of either, in trust for one another. We hold that their account was not subject to garnishment by a judgment creditor of Mr. Micka.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLEE</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-8\">. \u00a7 11-603 was amended by Ch. 117 of the Acts of 1991, which rewrote subsection (c) to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">\u201c(c) <em>All accounts in the name of 2 or more </em>persons.\u2014(1) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section and regardless of the relationship between or among the persons, if property held in an account in the name of 2 or more persons at a bank, trust company, credit union, savings bank, or savings and loan association or any of their affiliates or subsidiaries is garnished, and fewer than all of the persons named on the account are the judgment debtors, the garnishee may answer the writ of garnishment by stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1DW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>(1) That the property is held in an account at the garnishee in the name of 2 or more persons, 1 or more of whom but fewer than all of whom, are judgment debtors; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">(ii) The amount held in the account at the time the writ of garnishment was served on the garnishee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">(2) If the garnishee answers as described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the garnishee shall hold the lesser of the amount of the judgment or the amount in the account subject to an entry of a court order releasing the property held by the garnishee or a final judgment in the garnishment proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">(3) If the garnishee answers and holds property as provided under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the garnishee may not be held liable to the judgment creditor or to any person named on the account for wrongful dishonor or for any other claim relating to the garnishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">This amendment applied to \"garnishments initiated on and after July 1, 1991.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b665-11\">.

It's not by inadvertence that they came up with this language and quite frankly for whatever reason the legislature believed appropriate, I construe 11-603 to say that the legislature saw fit to treat all spousal accounts alike. Now whether they\u2019re joint trust accounts or not, and for whatever reason the legislature saw fit to treat spousal accounts, that might be in trust, differently from, from accounts that other individuals or co-owners might, might have in trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">We note that the caption to \u00a7 11-603(a), <em>\u201cSpousal property,\u201d </em>was supplied by the publisher of the Maryland Code and not the words of the Legislature.

In that case Elizabeth O\u2019Neill had on deposit to her own credit in the Savings Bank of Baltimore the sum of $2,100.42. On May 6, 1891, she closed that account and used the money to open another in the same bank with this designation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-Z\">\u201cElizabeth O\u2019Neill and Maty Whalen.
