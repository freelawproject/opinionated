The phrase appears first in \u00a7 9-101 under the subtitle \u201cDefinitions.\u201d Subsection (b) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAn\">\u201cAccidental personal injury\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-10\">(1) an accidental injury that arises out of and in the course of employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-11\">(2) an injury caused by a willful or negligent act of a</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-12\">third person directed against a covered employee in the course of the employment of the covered employee____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">\u201c \u2018Covered employee\u2019 means an individual listed in Subtitle 2 of [the Act] for whom a person ... is required by law to provide coverage under [the Act].\u201d \u00a7 9-101(f). The Act applies to an employer \u201cwho has at least 1 covered employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>ee.\u201d \u00a7 9-201(1). Generally, \u201can individual ... is a covered employee while in the service of an employer under an express or implied contract ... of hire.\u201d \u00a7 9-202(a). Ordinarily, \u201ceach employer of a covered employee shall provide compensation in accordance with [the Act]\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-E\">to the covered employee for an accidental personal injury sustained by the covered employee____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">\u00a7 9-501(a)(l). \u201cAn employer is liable to provide compensation in accordance with subsection (a) of [\u00a7 9-501], regardless of fault as to a cause of the accidental personal injury.\u201d \u00a7 9-501(b). The Act commands that it \u201cshall be construed to carry out its general purpose.\u201d \u00a7 9-102(a). It declares: \u201cThe rule that a statute in derogation of the common law is to be strictly construed does not apply to this [Act].\u201d \u00a7 9-102(b) These dictates are to assure that the Act\u2019s benevolent purpose as remedial social legislation will be effectuated. <em>Alitalia Linee Aeree Italiane, et al. v. Tornillo, </em>329 Md. 40, 617 A.2d 572, 576 (1993); <em>Lovellette v. City of Baltimore, </em>297 Md. 271, 282, 465 A.2d 1141 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Carol Belcher sought compensation under the Act. Upon a plenary hearing, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission disallowed her claim. She took her cause to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The court ruled in accord with the Commission. Belcher sought relief in the Court of Special Appeals. We intervened before the intermediate court entertained the case and, on our own motion, certified it to us for resolution. 328 Md. 35, 612 A.2d 897 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">We learn of the circumstances leading to Belcher\u2019s claim for compensation through the transcript of the hearing before the Commission and from a statement of facts gleaned from that transcript and agreed upon by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Belcher was employed as a secretary for T. Rowe Price Foundation, Inc. Her desk was in the northwest corner of the top floor in downtown Baltimore\u2019s IBM building. Another office high-rise was being erected next to the IBM building, and the din of nearby construction made its way into Belcher\u2019s workplace. Occasionally she had trouble hearing people on the phone. At times the floor beneath her would vibrate, and things would bump on the roof. Overall, the intrusions were barely tolerable. Then on the morning of 11 April 1991 disaster struck. A three-ton beam being hoisted by a construction crane broke loose and tumbled some twenty feet, crashing without warning through the thick concrete roof over Belcher\u2019s head. It landed five feet from where she sat at her desk tending to the day\u2019s business. The sound was deafening; it was if a bomb had exploded. The lights in the office went out; pipes and wires were ripped apart; debris sifted over her and her surroundings; concrete dust went down her throat. \u201cI couldn\u2019t move. I could not get up to move out of the way.\u201d Her employer immediately sought trauma counsel-ling for her. The counselling proved to be ineffective. She \u201csuffered sleep disturbances, nightmares, heart palpitations, chest pain, and headaches as a result of the occurrence.\u201d She came under the care of a psychiatrist, Alan H. Peck, M.D., for \u201cevaluation and treatments for the emotional/mental trauma [she] suffered as a result of this injury, this accident.\u201d She saw him some twenty-two times. Dr. Peck\u2019s reports were introduced into evidence at the hearing. His initial report, under date of 8 May 1991 included a history of the accident. When the beam fell</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVd\">[s]he was frozen in fear, did not know what had happened and wondered if it had been a bomb. She was quite shaken. She seemed to have had some amnesia for the next several hours but was told that she was shaking, chain smoking and holding onto the walls. She was, at that point, quite cold and may have been in shock. Concrete pieces were all over her bodice. There are still some nuggets present on her desk. She went home early <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>that day, quite upset, could not sleep, and ironed the entire night. She returned to work the next day and found she could not look up at the building although she did enter it and try to do her job. She has had serious emotional problems since this incident which have been quite bothersome for her. Prior to the incident she saw herself as a very solid woman in control who enjoyed the ability to have some say over her life and was proud of her work history particularly at the T. Rowe Price Company. She has raised three children and always felt that she could take care of whatever came her way. Now she is upset over the fact that she is unsure and her chest constantly hurts as does her shoulder. Headaches occur and she often has dry mouth. She is fearful of a heart attack. She feels like she may explode. She has panic attacks at work and sometimes has to leave the area. She is fearful that she may not be able to return. She has had ongoing nightmares, waking up screaming several times and, in each nightmare, she herself has been killed. She finds she now is easily startled and has become quite irritable with loved ones particularly her children which bothers her. She has had some weight gain, a loss of senses and, at times feels \u201cas if she is dead\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Dr. Peck in his last report before the hearing, stated that he had first seen her \u201cfor symptoms of a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of a work related incident____\u201d He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">In addition to some physical problems, the most important aspect has been the overwhelming psychological problems for Miss Belcher.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">He opined that Belcher \u201csuffers a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of this incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">He concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-9\">According to the Guides of the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, 3rd Edition of the American Medical Association, Miss Belcher suffers a Class 3 impairment or moderate impairment where \u201cimpairment level are incom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>patible with some but not all useful function,\u201d or a 40% psychiatric disability as a result of this incident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">There was no evidence that Belcher had received treatment for any purely physical condition, or for any of her physical manifestations.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The Commission issued an order which set out that a hearing had been held on the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">1. Did the employee sustain an accidental personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">2. Is the disability of the employee the result of an accidental personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">The Commission found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-9\">the claimant did not sustain an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment as alleged to have occurred on 11 April 1989; and finds that the disability of the claimant is not the result of the alleged accidental injury....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">The Commission disallowed Belcher\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">The Commission\u2019s disallowance of Belcher\u2019s claim prompted her appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. She asserted that the holdings of the Commission were erroneous. Each side filed a motion for summary judgment. After hearing arguments from counsel at the hearing on the motions, the judge found it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As6S\">hard to believe with all the Workmen\u2019s Compensation cases that have passed through these courts and the courts of the State of Maryland, that there has not been a case that is on all fours with this____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-14\">He thought that the issue presented was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlP\">whether or not a purely mental condition is compensable where there is no physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-15\">He deemed it to be \u201creally a simple issue, but complicated to interpret----\u201d He suggested that \u201c[o]ne could argue either side of this ... very comfortably, ... as both [coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>sel] have,\u201d and \u201c[b]ased on what I have read, the courts could go in either direction, quite honestly.\u201d He recognized that the Act is to be liberally construed under the law, but he warned, \u201cliberal construction does not change the meaning of the words.\u201d He iterated: \u201cThere has not been a case such as this ... when there is no medical treatment but purely mental treatment.\u201d He doubted that in such circumstances the Act permitted compensation. He opined that the Court of Special Appeals had so indicated in <em>Le v. Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, </em>80 Md.App. 89, 560 A.2d 42 (1989), but, he observed, the Court of Appeals has not spoken on the matter. He concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-4\">\u201cAs I am bound by the law and not a law writer, I will [in accord with <em>Le,] </em>abide by what I believe the law is today. And for that reason [Belcher\u2019s] Motion for Summary Judgment will be denied. The [employer\u2019s] Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">It is apparent that the Commission as well as the circuit court relied on the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals in reaching its holdings. The case was argued at length at the hearing before the Commission and the hearing ended on these words by counsel for the employer: \u201cI rely upon the Thach Le case.\u201d As far as the Commission and the circuit court were concerned, they were governed, in our silence on the matter, by the law announced in <em>Le </em>by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The \u201cThach Le\u201d case, <em>Le v. Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, </em>80 Md.App. 89, 560 A.2d 42, to which the employer\u2019s counsel referred and the circuit court cited, was an action seeking damages for the torts of false arrest, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Court for Montgomery County held that the exclusivity clause of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> precluded the action. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the employer. The Court of Special Appeals reversed, but it did so for a reason not relied on by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">The question in the view of the Court of Special Appeals was whether non-physical tortious acts committed against Thach Le by a fellow employee fell within the ambit of the then-styled Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act so as to preclude direct suit against the employer. It reasoned that since \u201c[tjhere was no claim for any physical injuries\u201d to Le, his claim was not compensable under the Act. Therefore, it did not fall within the ambit of the Act at all, and thus the exclusivity provision was not applicable. 80 Md.App. at 90, 560 A.2d 42. The intermediate appellate court took the position that \u201ctort actions are not barred by [the Act] when the essence of the injury is non-physical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92, 560 A.2d 42. It stated that this Court, in interpreting \u201caccidental injury\u201d under the Act, has held that the term \u201cmeans <em>physical injury </em>to the person caused by some unusual condition or occurrence in the employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 560 A.2d 42 (emphasis in original). It was the intermediate appellate court\u2019s notion that an injury is compensable only when there is an accidental physiological change arising out of and in the course of employment. <em>Id. </em>at 91, 560 A.2d 42. In other words, the absence of a physiological change or physical harm or damage precludes a finding that an injury under the Act occurred. <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the employer and gave this explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>The quiddity of false arrest, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress is non-physical. Those torts are ordinarily outside the scope of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Since they are not within the Act, the statute does not protect the employer from actions grounded on those particular torts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">80 Md.App. at 93, 560 A.2d 42. The intermediate appellate court pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">Neither the Court of Appeals nor [the Court of Special Appeals] has heretofore addressed the question of whether non-physical injury torts are within the ambit of the Act____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 92, 560 A.2d 42.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">We reviewed the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Federated Stores v. Le, </em>324 Md. 71, 595 A.2d 1067 (1991) on our grant of certiorari. We affirmed the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals but rejected its reasons. Instead, we looked to \u00a7 44 of Art. 101 (now in revised form as \u00a7 9-509(d) of the Labor and Employment article) which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>If injury or death results to a workman from the deliberate intention of his employer to produce such injury or death, the employee, the widow, widower, child, children or dependents of the employee shall have the privilege either to take under this article or have cause of action against such employer, as if this article had not been passed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">We construed \u00a7 44 as decisive of the issue. We held that \u201cunder the facts of this case, the circuit court should not have granted [the employer\u2019s] motion for summary judgment. ...\u201d 324 Md. at 87, 595 A.2d 1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">So it was that we had no need to determine whether injuries psychological, emotional or mental in nature, as distinguished from those purely physiological, were within the purview of the Act. The status of such trauma under the Act was left in limbo by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The question of the compensability of injuries under the Act which are in essence psychological, emotional or mental, as distinguished from those which are purely physiological in nature, is now squarely before us. This Court is not bound by the decisions of the Court of Special Appeals, although we have ofttimes found them to be persuasive. So it behooves us to determine the propriety of the intermediate appellate court\u2019s statutory interpretation of \u201cinjury\u201d as used in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">As we have seen, the Act does not define \u201cinjury\u201d in terms of physical or mental trauma, and what the Legislature intended in that respect is not apparent from the language of the Act. So we are called upon once again to divine what the Legislature meant when it spoke of \u201caccidental personal injury.\u201d We turned first to see how our predecessors on this Court viewed the term \u201caccidental personal injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">We began our review with <em>Schemmel v. Gatch &amp; Sons etc. Co., </em>164 Md. 671, 166 A. 39 (1933) and then examined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>what we believe to be a fair sampling of cases touching on the question decided thereafter. We then reviewed discussions of \u201cinjury\u201d in the context of compensation under the Act in the following cases: <em>Moller Motor Car Co. v. Unger, </em>166 Md. 198, 170 A. 777 (1934); <em>Geipe, Inc. v. Collett, </em>172 Md. 165, 190 A. 836 (1937); <em>Jackson v. Ferree, </em>173 Md. 400, 196 A. 107 (1938); <em>Foble v. Knefely, </em>176 Md. 474, 6 A.2d 48 (1939); <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co. v. Zapf, </em>192 Md. 403, 64 A.2d 139 (1949); <em>Kelly-Springfield Co. v. Daniels, </em>199 Md. 156, 85 A.2d 795 (1952); <em>Caled Products Co., Inc. v. Sausser, </em>199 Md. 514, 86 A.2d 904 (1952); <em>Greenwalt v. Brauns Bdg. Sp. Corp., </em>203 Md. 313, 100 A.2d 804 (1953); <em>Stancliff v. H.B. Davis Co., </em>208 Md. 191, 117 A.2d 577 (1955); <em>Beth. Steel Co. v. Golombieski, </em>231 Md. 124, 188 A.2d 923 (1963); <em>Giant Food, et al. v. Gooch, </em>245 Md. 160, 225 A.2d 431 (1967); <em>Mize v. Beauchamp Associates, </em>245 Md. 583, 227 A.2d 5 (1967). In the cases we have surveyed, it seems that the Court did not have occasion to address directly the nature of an injury per se. They focus, in the main, on whether an injury was \u201caccidental\u201d rather than on its composition. So in <em>Schemmel, </em>164 Md. at 680, 166 A. 39, the Court spoke of an \u201caccident\u201d but it did so in terms of \u201cany mischance resulting in physical injury to the bodily tissues____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\"><em>Geipe, </em>172 Md. at 171, 190 A. 836, was more informative. The Court observed that an \u201caccidental personal injury\u201d within the scope and meaning of the statute need not be caused by physical impact or direct injury to the body. Such an injury may be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">a nervous shock that produces not a mere emotional impulse but a physiological injury as the proximate effect of an unforeseen or unexpected event____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-8\">In <em>Jackson, </em>173 Md. at 403, 196 A. 107, the Court stated: Such an injury as the statute contemplates means any fortuitous, casual, and unexpected happening which causes personal disability or death....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>Daniels, </em>199 Md. at 159, 85 A.2d 795, indicated that an injury is accidental \u201ceven without any external happening of an accidental nature.\u201d But physical trauma was present. The Court explained that an accidental injury may be the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXL\">sudden and unexpected rupture of some portion of the internal structure of the body, as cerebral hemorrhage or apoplexy, or the failure of some essential function of the body, as heart failure or paralysis, brought about by the exertion of the employee while engaged in the performance of his duties, or by the conditions of the employment. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The Court in <em>Sausser, </em>199 Md. at 520, 86 A.2d 94, spoke of an \u201caccidental personal injury\u201d in terms of \u201ca physical injury____\u201d and in <em>Greenwalt, </em>203 Md. at 318, 100 A.2d 804, the Court opined that the meaning of \u201caccident\u201d in Workmen\u2019s Compensation cases \u201cincludes any mishap which results in physical injury....\u201d <em>Golombieski, </em>231 Md. at 129, 188 A.2d 923, citing to <em>Schemmel </em>and <em>Zapf </em>pointed out that under the Act</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay_\">the meaning of \u201caccidental\u201d has been extended to include the rupture of an aneurysm and other internal injuries in order to give the word a more liberal construction in harmony with the general intent of the law and make the injury compensable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">This Court has further held that symptoms of injury can follow the incident by some lapse of time and still be considered the natural result of an \u201caccident.\u201d In other words, the harm does not have to be immediate or coincide with the accident. <em>Unger, </em>166 Md. at 203, 206-207, 170 A. <em>777.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">We gather from these cases that our predecessors embraced, with some qualifications, for the Workers\u2019 Compensation act the common law\u2019s notion that an injury solely to one\u2019s mind is <em>damnum absque injuria </em>unless accompanied by physical harm. We indicated, however, that the physical injury need not be caused by physical impact or harm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>directly to the body but may be the result of a nervous shock. Furthermore, the injury need not be externally apparent, but may be to the internal structure of the body, as for example, cerebral hemorrhage, apoplexy, heart failure or paralysis. The symptoms of injury need not be immediately apparent but may follow the accident by some lapse of time. Some of the cases may be viewed as suggesting that psychological injuries may be comp\u00e9nsable when they result in physiological trauma, but none of them expressly answer the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The matter of injuries of a mental or emotional nature arises in tort actions founded in negligence and in actions under the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, (see note 2, <em>supra). </em>In the absence of a textually demonstrable legislative intent to exclude from compensability those accidental injuries that result in mental harm alone and in the lack of a definitive answer in our Workers\u2019 Compensation cases, we turn to tort cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">We culled the following cases: <em>City Pass. Ry. Co. v. Kemp., </em>61 Md. 74 (1883); <em>P., B. &amp; W. R. Co. v. Mitchell, </em>107 Md. 600, 69 A. 422 (1908); <em>Green v.

Vance, </em>286 Md. 490, 408 A.2d 728 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">In <em>Kemp, </em>61 Md. at 81, the Court referred to the general rule that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-8\">in actions of tort [founded on negligence] the wrong-doer is liable for all the direct injury resulting from his wrongful act, and that too although the extent or special nature of the resulting injury could not, with certainty, have been foreseen or contemplated as the probable result of the act done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-9\"><em>Mitchell, </em>107 Md. at 607, 69 A. 422, found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>[t]he weight of authority both of text books and of decided cases supports the view that there can be no recovery of damages for mere fright or mental suffering, caused by negligence, unconnected with physical impact or injury. This conclusion has generally been reached in reliance upon the remoteness of the damage as well as the inexpediency of opening the door to claims difficult of precise proof or disproof and from their nature easy of simulation and liable to exaggeration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">The Court refrained from expressing any opinion upon the adequacy of mere fright or its results, when unaccompanied by physical impact or injury, as a cause of action for damages, because in \u201c[its] judgment there is sufficient evidence in the record before us to go to the jury ... physical impact and injury to the [injured person being] contemporaneous with her fright____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 607-608, 69 A. 422. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">While the physical impact or injury requisite for the purpose under discussion must be actual it need not be such as to occasion an external wound or bruise. Severe and even incurable internal injuries, of which there is no immediate visible or external evidence, may be produced by violence or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 608, 69 A. 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">The circumstances in <em>Green, </em>111 Md. 69, 73 A. 688, were remarkably like the circumstances in the case now before us. The defendants were blasting rocks in the vicinity of Rebecca Green\u2019s dwelling. She testified that the first blast</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aml\">knocked nearly half the plastering from the wall of the room she was in, and part of the ceiling; none of it then fell on her, though some fell on [another woman\u2019s] child. It seemed to lift the house up and then let it fall. It broke every glass in the window except one. It threw the table upside down. It broke two dozen jars belonging to [her] in the cellar of the house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">111 Md. at 73, 73 A. 688. Ten days later</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKC\">a stone burst through the roof and ceiling and came down through [Rebecca\u2019s] bed, mattress and spring, and broke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>the slats and rollers. It weighed 22 pounds. That blast tore the window sash out, broke some in two, and threw them across the room.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><em>Id. </em>Her reaction is recounted on pages 73 and 74 of 111 Md., 73 A. 688. She and her husband did not sleep in that bed for six weeks after that. They were \u201cin terror all night of being killed.\u201d She said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-5\">[M]y nerves were completely broken down through fright, and I was not able to do my work. Before that time I was in ordinary health, and never was nervous. Since then I have had no health at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Her doctor attended her for \u201cthis nervousness,\u201d seeing her daily the latter part of April, and thereafter every week or so until fall. According to her doctor she \u201cdeveloped nervous prostration\u201d which he attributed to the shock of the blasting. Her husband testified that \u201chis wife had become a nervous wreck; that she was thirty years of age, and before this blasting had always attended to all her household duties, but since then has been unable to do so.\u201d The question relevant to our inquiry was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJx\">Does a cause of action lie for physical injury resulting from fright and nervousness, caused by the wrongful acts of [another]?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYB\">There is a wide divergence of judicial opinion as to whether a cause of action will lie for actual physical injuries resulting from fright and nervous shock caused by the wrongful acts of another____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">111 Md. at 77, 73 A. 688. But, the Court posited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-10\">[I]t may be considered as settled, that <em>mere fright, without any physical injury resulting therefrom, </em>cannot form the basis of a cause of action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-11\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-12\">This is so, because mere fright is easily simulated, and because there is no practical standard for measuring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>suffering occasioned thereby, or of testing the truth of the claims of the person as to the results of the fright. But when it is shown that a <em>material physical injury </em>has resulted from fright caused by a wrongful act, and especially, as in this case, from a constant repetition of wrongful acts, in their nature calculated to cause constant alarm and terror, it is difficult, if not impossible, to perceive any sound reason for denying a right of action in law, for such physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The Court quoted at length from <em>Kemp, </em>61 Md. 74, and set out the general rule recognized in <em>Kemp:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\">\u201c[T]he general rule is, in actions of tort like the present, that the wrongdoer is liable for all the direct injury resulting from his wrongful act, and that too, although the extent or special nature of the resulting injury could not, with certainty, have been foreseen or contemplated as the probable result of the act done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 78. The Court looked with approval at <em>Sloane v. Southern Cal. R. R., </em>111 Cal. 668, 44 P. 320 (1896), in which there was no physical impact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-8\">\u201cThe real question presented ... is, whether the subsequent nervous disturbance of the plaintiff was a suffering of the body or of the mind. * * * The nerves and nerve centres of the body are a part of the physical system, and are not only susceptible of lesion from external causes, but are also liable to be weakened and destroyed from causes primarily acting upon the mind. If these nerves, or the entire nervous system are thus affected, there is a physical injury thereby produced; and if the primal cause of this injury is tortious, it is immaterial whether it is direct, as by a blow, or indirect, through some action upon the mind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">111 Md. at 79, 73 A. 688. The Court conceded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afq\">that the numerical weight of authority supports the general rule that there can be no recovery for nervous affections unaccompanied by contemporaneous physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>injury, but the sounder view, in our opinion, is, that there are exceptions to this rule, and that where the wrongful act complained of is the proximate cause of the injury, within the principles announced in <em>Kemp\u2019s Case, supra, </em>and where the injury ought, in the light of all the circumstances, to have been contemplated as a natural and probable consequence thereof, the case falls within the exception and should be left to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 81, 73 A. 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The Court referred to <em>Denver &amp; R. G. R. Co. v. Roller, </em>100 F. 738 (9th Cir.1900), in which the jury was instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-7\">\u201cIf great fright was a reasonable and natural consequence of the circumstances in which the collision aforesaid, with the ensuing wreckage, explosion and conflagration, placed the plaintiff, and if she was actually put in fright by those circumstances, and injury to her health was a reasonable and natural consequence of such fright, and was actually and proximately occasioned thereby, then said injury is one for which damages are recoverable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">111 Md. at 82, 73 A. 688. The <em>Green </em>Court declared that \u201cft]he reasoning upon which that conclusion was reached is, in our opinion, sound....\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Roller </em>Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-10\">We all know, by common knowledge, that serious results may naturally follow from bodily injuries, without breaking an arm, or leg, or bones of the body. The body and mind are so intimately connected that the mind is very often directly and necessarily affected by physical injuries. A nervous shock, without a blow to the person, might, under some circumstances, be so great as to cause bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">100 F. at 748. We have set out <em>Green </em>in such detail because it is much cited, quoted and relied upon in our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>opinions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><em>Harris, </em>121 Md. 254, 88 A. 282, was a case which looked to <em>Green </em>in holding that there can be injuries from fright without physical impact. The injury in <em>Harris </em>was the result of a fall caused by the shock and fright produced by the sudden loud blowing of a locomotive whistle and escape of steam. <em>Hobbs, </em>129 Md. 9, 98 A. 239, was another <em>Green-</em>based case. A woman in a hospital bed was harassed by a debt collector to the extent that she went into shock. She was so mentally disturbed that she suffered convulsions. The convulsions caused severe hemorrhaging so that the surgery which had been performed on her had to be performed again. The court held that the loan company was liable for all of her injuries. Twenty-two years after <em>Green, </em>we decided <em>Roch, </em>160 Md. 189, 153 A. 22. The manager of a grocery store, as a joke, sent Roch a package containing a dead rat. She alleged that when she saw the rat, instead of the loaf of bread she had been expecting, she</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6Xx\">became very sick and ill in body and mind, fainted and fell with great force to the floor, and as a result thereof her nervous system suffered and still is suffering excruciating physical pain and mental anguish and other injuries were then and there sustained by her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 191, 153 A. 22. The Court flatly declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-6\">Under the decisions of this Court damages may be recovered for physical injuries caused by fright or shock.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALV\"><em>Id. </em>The Court cited to <em>Green, Kemp, Harris </em>and <em>Hobbs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\"><em>Bowman, </em>164 Md. 397, 165 A. 182, nourished the seed planted in <em>Green. </em>Williams was at home, his wife was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>the kitchen and his two children were in the basement. From a window in the front of the house, Williams saw a large truck loaded with coal coming down a steep icy hill. Out of control, the truck crashed into the stone foundation of the side of the house. Williams did not sustain any physical impact nor did the violent jar to the house cause him to fall.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-4\">The fright of the plaintiff and his alarm for the safety of his two young sons occasioned by this accident were, however, such a shock to his nervous system that he fell to the floor of the dining room immediately after the impact of the truck with the fabric of the house, and was carried into the kitchen in a weak and hysterical condition. The doctor was sent for, and the plaintiff remained in bed for two weeks under regular medical treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7R\">164 Md. at 399, 165 A. 182. Williams was unable to work for six months.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-5\">From a state of normal health, [Williams] immediately became and continued quite weak and nervous, as was manifested to his family physician and an expert consultant in nervous disorders, by tangible evidence not susceptible of simulation, and by the absence of any physical reason for his condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-6\"><em>Id. </em>The Court observed that \u201cthe primary effect upon the personality of [Williams] was the fright it caused him, since his person was untouched____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 401, 165 A. 182. The Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-9\">In fright a man\u2019s whole being reacts. The shock to his nervous system is reflected in instinctive excitement and intensive action of the muscles and organs of the body, and so it is clear that the mental state has a corresponding physical accompaniment, although there has been no impact suffered. \u201cThe fear\u2019s as bad as falling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-10\"><em>Id. </em>The Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-11\">When fear exists, the nervous and physical reactions, although probably differing in degree, are fundamentally identical, whether the fear is purely subjective, as when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>is for the victim\u2019s own safety, or is objective, as when the fear is for the victim\u2019s wife, child, relative, friend, or even a stranger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><em>Id. </em>The Court concluded: \u201c[I]f a party suffers an injury, as loss of health, of <em>mind, </em>or of life, through fear of safety for self [or members of his family], a recovery may be had for the negligent act of another....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The Court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-7\">the nervous shock or fright sustained by [Williams] was based on reasonable grounds for apprehension of an injury to [him] and his children, and was one which naturally produced physical deterioration as distinguished from those shocks which primarily work on the moral nature, to the exclusion of actual physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 402, 165 A. 182. The Court read <em>Green, Harris, Hobbs </em>and <em>Roch </em>as having</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-9\">settled the principle that a plaintiff can sustain an action for damages for nervous shock or injury caused, without physical impact, by fright arising directly from defendant\u2019s negligent act or omission, and resulting in some clearly apparent and substantial physical injury, as manifested by an external condition or by symptoms clearly indicative of a resultant pathological, physiological, or <em>mental state.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 404, 165 A. 182 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\"><em>Mahnke, </em>197 Md. 61, 77 A.2d 923, applied the rulings in <em>Green </em>and <em>Bowman. </em>It noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-12\">At the beginning of this century, the numerical weight of authority in this country supported the rule that a plaintiff cannot recover for nervous affections unaccompanied by contemporaneous physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">197 Md. at 69, 77 A.2d 923. But it reminded, citing <em>Green:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgI\">In 1909, however, this Court adopted the rule that where the wrongful act complained of is the proximate cause of the injury and the injury ought to have been contemplated in the light of all the circumstances as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>natural and probable cause thereof, the case should be left to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-4\"><em>Id. </em>In <em>Mahnke, </em>as in <em>Bowman, </em>there were no physical injuries inflicted, only severe psychological trauma. Her physiological harm was, as set out in <em>Bowman, </em>no more than a physical result which ordinarily flows from a severe mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">In any event, <em>Vance, </em>286 Md. 490, 408 A.2d 728, clarified the matter. One of the questions presented in <em>Vance </em>was whether, under the \u201cphysical injury\u201d test set forth in <em>Bowman, </em>damages may be recovered for emotional distress resulting from a negligent misrepresentation. <em>Id. </em>at 492, 408 A.2d 728. The Court discussed <em>Green, Roch </em>and <em>Bowman </em>and cited to <em>Mahnke. </em>The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-6\">We think it clear that <em>Bowman </em>provides that the requisite \u201cphysical injury\u201d resulting from emotional distress may be proved in one of four ways. It appears that these alternatives were formulated with the overall purpose in mind of requiring objective evidence to guard against feigned claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">286 Md. at 500, 408 A.2d 728. \u201cThe first three categories,\u201d the Court explained, \u201cpertain to manifestations of a physical injury through evidence of an external condition or by symptoms of a pathological or physiological state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The fourth category, however, permits proof of a \u201cphysical injury\u201d by evidence indicating a <em>\u201cmental </em>state____\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The Court formed this conclusion consistent with the holdings in <em>Green, Bowman </em>and <em>Roch. Id. </em>The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-10\">In the context of the <em>Bowman </em>rule, therefore, the term \u201cphysical\u201d is not used in its ordinary dictionary sense. Instead, it is used to represent that the injury for which recovery is sought is <em>capable of objective determination.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACX\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted, emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">The type of evidence of a mental state resulting in an injury \u201ccapable of objective determination\u201d was illustrated by the distress suffered by Muriel Vance. She and Arnold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Vance, married in a religious ceremony, lived together for 18 years and had two children. Then Arnold left Muriel for another woman. She sought a decree awarding her alimony and child support. Arnold opposed the action on the ground that at the time of his marriage to Muriel he had not been divorced from his first wife and, therefore, his marriage to Muriel was void. It appeared that Arnold originally believed that his decree of absolute divorce from his first wife was final, and had told Muriel that he was free to marry her. About one month after their marriage, Arnold discovered that his divorce decree had not become final until after his marriage to Muriel. Arnold never told Muriel that their marriage was a nullity. She did not discover it until Arnold sought to annul the marriage 20 years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">The evidence at trial was that the disclosure that Muriel\u2019s twenty-year marriage was void had a devastating effect on her.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-5\">She went into a state of shock, engaged in spontaneous crying and for a period seemed detached and unaware of her own presence. She was unable to function normally, unable to sleep and too embarrassed to socialize. In addition to experiencing symptoms of an ulcer, Muriel suffered an emotional collapse and depression which manifested itself in her external condition, <em>i.e., </em>her significantly deteriorated physical appearance\u2014unkempt hair, sunken cheeks and dark eyes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 501, 408 A.2d 728. We held that this evidence was \u201clegally sufficient to establish symptoms of a mental state evidencing a physical injury within the meaning of the <em>Bowman </em>standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-8\">The evidence showed that Muriel suffered an objectively manifested, definite nervous disorder of a magnitude similar to the mental distress established in <em>Green, Bowman, </em>and Rock____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-9\">[T]he evidence was sufficient to support a jury finding that Muriel was physically injured as a foreseeable result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>of [Arnold\u2019s] negligent misrepresentation concerning his marital status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Arnold argued that because Muriel adduced no medical evidence to support her claim for mental distress, the case should not go to the jury. We observed that although use of medical testimony may be advisable to establish mental distress, such testimony is not always required. <em>Id. </em>at 502-503, 408 A.2d 728. The Court ruled that such testimony was not necessary in the case before it to recover for mental distress in the light of the evidence adduced. <em>Id. </em>The Court also rejected Arnold\u2019s claim that the only proper way to show causation is through medical testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 503, 408 A.2d 728. The Court pointed out that it had \u201cpermitted plaintiff lay persons to testify to their physical injuries and mental distress without supporting medical testimony.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing to <em>Tully v. Dasher, </em>250 Md. 424, 244 A.2d 207 (1968) (nervousness, headaches, upset stomach). <em>Tully, </em>the Court pointed out, relied on <em>Wilhelm v. State Traffic Comm., </em>230 Md. 91, 185 A.2d 715 (1962), which distinguished between situations where the cause of injuries need not be proved by expert testimony, and situations that require medical proof. <em>Vance </em>quoted <em>Wilhelm </em>230 Md. at 99, 185 A.2d 715:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">\u201cThere are, unquestionably, many occasions where the causal connection between a defendant\u2019s negligence and a disability claimed by a plaintiff does not need to be established by expert testimony. Particularly is this true when the disability develops coincidentally with, or within a reasonable time after, the negligent act, or where the causal connection is clearly apparent from the illness itself and the circumstances surrounding it, or where the cause of the injury relates to matters of common experience, knowledge, or observation of laymen____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">286 Md. at 503, 408 A.2d 728. \u201cThese occasions,\u201d we noted in <em>Vance,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-8\">were distinguished from situations involving complex medical questions, and especially cases turning on purely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>subjective symptoms or in instances where there is a significant temporal lapse between the disability and the negligent act. In the second type of situation proof of causation must be by expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\"><em>Vance\u2019s </em>explication of <em>Bowman </em>is, at this time, the definitive Maryland case on mental distress as the basis of damages in negligent tort actions. It carefully traced the evaluation of that concept. The traditional rule, formulated in the nineteenth century, did not permit damages solely for mental distress. <em>Vance, </em>286 Md. at 496, 408 A.2d 728.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APL\">Instead, damages for mental distress had a parasitic status; recovery was dependent upon an immediate physical injury accompanying an independently actionable tort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL6\"><em>Id. </em>Furthermore, \u201c[t]he early cases generally denied recovery for mental distress when the alleged personal injury resulted solely from the internal operation of mental or emotional stresses____\u201d <em>Id. </em>There developed an exception to this rule when there was physical impact upon a person coincident in time and place with the occasion producing the mental distress. <em>Id. </em>496-497, 408 A.2d 728. The \u201cimpact rule,\u201d on occasion, was stretched to extreme limits to permit recovery for mental distress, and we rejected the rule in <em>Green, Id. </em>at 497, 408 A.2d 728. As we have seen, <em>Green </em>adopted \u201ca rule\u2014later characterized as the \u2018modern rule\u2019\u2014 which permitted recovery of damages for negligent infliction of mental distress if a \u2018physical injury\u2019 results from the commission of a tort, regardless of impact.\u201d <em>Id. Roch, </em>as we have noted, stated that \u201cdamages may be recovered for physical injuries caused by fright or shock.\u201d 160 Md. at 191, 153 A. 22. Then <em>Bowman </em>was decided. It was accepted as \u201cthe leading Maryland case on the recovery of damages for negligently inflicted emotional distress____\u201d <em>Vance, </em>286 Md. at 499, 408 A.2d 728. <em>Vance </em>elaborated on the term \u201cmental state\u201d suggested in the more liberal <em>Bowman </em>rule. <em>Vance </em>posited that in addition to the ways of proving the requisite \u201cphysical injury\u201d resulting from emotional distress, which pertain to manifestations of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>physical injury through evidence of an external condition or by symptoms of a pathological or physiological state, the requisite \u201cphysical injury\u201d may be proved \u201cby evidence indicative of a \u2018mental state\u2019 ... capable of objective determination.\u201d 286 Md. at 500, 408 A.2d 728. It, thus, defined \u201cphysical injury\u201d to include demonstrable emotional distress. We take this as the present status of the law of Maryland\u2014in tort actions, damages may be recovered for emotional distress capable of objective determination. In other words, under <em>Vance\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cphysical injury\u201d, damages resulting from harm psychological in nature may be obtained, independent of physiological harm, provided the cause and effect of psychological harm are established.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">The <em>Vance-Bowman </em>standard went far to dispel the fear that the right to damages for emotional distress would open the floodgates to feigned claims. Those opposing the right argued that, upon the ground of expediency, the right should be denied, because of the damages of opening the door to fictitious litigation and the impossibility of estimating damages. <em>Green </em>answered this argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">The argument from mere expediency cannot commend itself to a Court of justice, resulting in the denial of a logical legal right and remedy in <em>all cases, </em>because in <em>some </em>a fictitious injury may be urged as a real one. The <em>apparent </em>strength of the theory of expediency lies in the fact that nervous disturbances and injuries are sometimes more imaginary than real, and are sometimes feigned, but this reasoning loses sight of the equally obvious fact that a nervous injury arising from actual physical impact is as likely to be imagined as one resulting from fright without physical impact, and that the former is as capable of simulation as the latter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">111 Md. at 81, 73 A. 688. (emphasis in original). W. Page Keeton, <em>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts </em>(5th ed. 1984), recognized the problem as very real, but as one that must be met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-7\">Mental disturbance is easily simulated, and courts which are plagued with fraudulent personal injury claims may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>be unwilling to open the door to an even more dubious field. But the difficulties may not be insuperable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 54, p. 361. Keeton pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-5\">Not only fright and shock, but other kinds of mental injury are marked by definite physical symptoms, which are capable of medical or other objective proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-6\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). He suggested:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-7\">It is entirely possible to allow recovery only upon satisfactory evidence and deny it when there is nothing to corroborate the claim, or to look for some guarantee of genuineness in the circumstances of the case. The problem from this perspective is one of adequate proof, and it is not necessary to deny a remedy in all cases because some claims may be false.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-8\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). Keeton also looked to the effect on the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-9\">And where the concern is to avoid imposing excessive punishment upon a negligent defendant, it must be asked whether fairness will permit leaving the burden of loss instead upon the innocent victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-10\"><em>Id. Vance </em>adequately answered the troubling basic policy issues surrounding the definition of the limits of liability for negligently inflicted emotional harm by requiring that such harm be capable of objective determination. Such an objective determination provides reasonable assurance that the claim is not spurious. Where this assurance can be found, so that the mental distress appears to be real and serious, there is no good reason to deny recovery. Where such assurance is not found, recovery should be denied. <em>See </em>Keeton, \u00a7 54, p. 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">We have traced the development of the law of Maryland as interpreted in our judicial opinions concerned with liability for negligently inflicted mental harm, from a standard limiting such liability to purely physical trauma to a standard permitting recovery for damages for trauma resulting from purely emotional distress that can be objectively determined. The recognition that a person should be compensat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>ed for mental harm resulting from the negligent act of another is in accord with the ever increasing knowledge in the specialties which have evolved in the field of medicine and in the disciplines of psychiatry and psychology. Persons suffering from severe mental distress are no longer simply warehoused in Bedlam type institutions; they are treated by medical experts at no small cost. We are now aware that mental injuries can be as real as broken bones and may result in even greater disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">y</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The meaning of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in the contemplation of the Workers\u2019 Compensation act has not followed the path taken by the meaning of \u201cphysical injury\u201d in tort actions. It seems, as demonstrated by the disposition of Belcher\u2019s claim, that there has been a steadfast adherence in Workers\u2019 Compensation cases to a standard we have found to be outmoded in tort cases\u2014a standard which treats an injury only as \u201cphysical\u201d in the dictionary meaning of \u201cphysical,\u201d that is, in relation to the body, not the mind, corporeal as opposed to mental.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The right to benefits under Workers\u2019 Compensation laws is \u201cbased largely on a social theory of providing support and preventing destitution, rather than settling accounts between two individuals according to their personal deserts or blame.\u201d 1 Arthur Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 1.20 at 2 (1992) (hereinafter, Larson). In exchange for receiving compensation regardless of fault, an employee abandons the right to seek common law tort damages from the employer. Section 9-509 of the Act; <em>see also Cox v. Sandlers, Inc., </em>209 Md. 193, 198-199, 120 A.2d 674 (1956); some actions against third parties are still possible, though the proceeds of a successful lawsuit may at times be applied to reimburse the employer for the compensation payments. \u00a7 9-902(e)(2); <em>Railway Co. v. Assurance Corp., </em>163 Md. 97, 102-103, 161 A. 5 (1932); Larson, \u00a7 1.10 at 2; <em>cf. Anne Arundel County v. McCormick, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>323 Md. 688, 692-694, 594 A.2d 1138 (1991). The employer passed the expense of Workers\u2019 Compensation on to the consumer, \u201csince compensation premiums, as part of the cost of production, will be reflected in the price of the product.\u201d Larson, \u00a7 1.10 at 2.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-4\">The ultimate social philosophy behind compensation liability is belief in the wisdom of providing, in the most efficient, most dignified, and most certain form, financial and medical benefits for the victims of work-connected injuries which an enlightened community would feel obliged to provide in any case in some less satisfactory form, and of allocating the burden of these payments to the most appropriate source of payment, the consumer of the product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Larson, \u00a7 2.20 at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Thus, the Act has a purpose broader than serving the interests of employers and their employees. More than merely indemnifying workers for injuries sustained on the job, the system embodied in the Act provides compensation when earning power is lost as a result of work-related disabilities. The needs and expectations of society, in addition to those of the work force, come into play. In <em>Knoche v. Cox, </em>282 Md. 447, 449-450, 385 A.2d 1179 (1978), we found the rationale of the Act and its underlying philosophy clearly set out by the General Assembly in the Preamble to the original legislation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-7\">\u201cWHEREAS, The State of Maryland recognizes that the prosecution of various industrial enterprises which must be relied upon to create and preserve the wealth and prosperity of the State involves injury to large numbers of workmen, resulting in their partial or total incapacity or death, and that under the rules of the common law and the provisions of the statutes now in force an unequal burden is cast upon its citizens, and that in determining the responsibility of the employer on account of injuries sustained by his workmen, great and unnecessary cost is now incurred in litigation, which cost is borne by the workmen, the employers, and the taxpayers, in part, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>the maintenance of courts and juries to determine the question of responsibility under the law as it now exists; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-4\">WHEREAS, in addition thereto, the State and its taxpayers are subjected to a heavy burden in providing care and support for such injured workmen and their dependents, which burden should, insofar as may be consistent with the rights and obligations of the people of the State, be more fairly distributed as in this Act provided; and WHEREAS, the common law system governing the remedy of workmen against employers for injuries received in extra-hazardous work is inconsistent with modern industrial conditions; and injuries in such work, formerly occasional, have now become frequent and inevitable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">In the light of the language of the Act, the philosophy underlying it, and the purposes behind it, we believe that modern times call for the concept of \u201cphysical injury\u201d, which we have adopted with respect to emotional distress in tort actions to apply to \u201cpersonal injury\u201d under the Act. The provisions of the Act do not prohibit it; expediency has not proved to be a deterrent; the advances in medical science make it feasible; logic supports it; the needs of society require it. We have come to appreciate that a mind may be injured as well as a body maimed. A person\u2019s psychic trauma does not vary depending upon the type of legal action in which the harm is scrutinized. Disabilities are not lessened because compensation is pursued by way of the Act rather than by way of damages sought in a tort action. The inability to work and the loss of earning power are the same.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-6\">The human body consists of bones, flesh, ligaments, and nerves controlled by the brain. The law does not state which of these particular elements must produce the disability. If a disability exists, whether or not it is psychic or mental, if it is real and is brought on by the accident and injury, this being a humane law and liberally construed, it is nevertheless compensable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>This observation was made by a dissenting director when the case of <em>Indemnity Insurance Co. of North America v. Loftis, </em>reported in 103 Ga.App. 749, 120 S.E.2d 655, 656 (1961) was before the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board on review. It is quoted with approval by the court in its opinion at 656 and is often cited by the courts and scholars as a sound principle. <em>See </em>Larson, \u00a7 42.23(a) at 7-911 (1992). We see no sound reason or just cause why the concept of \u201cphysical injury\u201d which we have adopted in assessing damages in tort cases should not apply equally to the concept of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in awarding compensation in Workers\u2019 Compensation claims.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-4\">[T]here is no really valid distinction between physical and \u201cnervous\u201d injury. Certainly medical opinion would support this view, and insist that it is no longer realistic to draw a line between what is \u201cnervous\u201d and what is \u201cphysical.\u201d ... Perhaps, in earlier years, when much less was known about mental and nervous injuries and their relation to \u201cphysical\u201d symptoms and behavior, there was an excuse, on grounds of evidentiary difficulties, for ruling out recoveries based on such injuries, both in tort and in workmen\u2019s compensation. <em>But the excuse no longer exists. </em>And therefore a state which would withhold the benefits of workmen\u2019s compensation from a man who, before an obvious industrial mishap, was a competent, respected iron-worker, and after the mishap was totally incapacitated to do the only job he was trained for, would nowadays be doing unjustifiable violence to the intent of the workmen\u2019s compensation act, for reasons that are without support in either legal or medical theory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ2\">Larson, \u00a7 42.23 at 7-906 (emphasis added). <em>See Sparks v. Tulane Med. Ctr. Hosp. &amp; Clinic, </em>546 So.2d 138, 147 (La.1989). There is a caution, however. As <em>Sparks </em>puts it at 147:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\">We emphasize, however, that a mere showing that a mental injury was related to <em>general conditions </em>of employment, or to incidents occurring over an extended period of time, is not enough to entitle the claimant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>compensation. The mental injury must be precipitated by an accident, i.e., an unexpected and unforeseen event that occurs suddenly or violently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">(Emphasis in original; footnote omitted). The cases note that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-5\">by rejecting the \u201cnineteenth century approach\u201d of making the availability of benefits dependent upon a rigid and absolute distinction between physical and mental injuries, ... we reach a result that has been approved by a majority of the jurisdictions in this country.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Due to the interest and concern of others than the immediate parties in the question before us, we granted a request to file a brief by <em>amici curiae. </em>The <em>amici curiae </em>participating in the brief stated that they</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC9\">represent the entire spectrum of the workers\u2019 compensation payors in Maryland\u2014self-insured employers, the Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund, and trade organizations representing the overwhelming majority of workers\u2019 compensation insurers in the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">They speak, of course, in support of T.

They point out that \u201cother states with statutory language and prior case law similar to that of Maryland have rejected attempts to judicially expand workers\u2019 compensation coverage to include non-physical injuries.\u201d We believe that we have fully answered such lines of argument, and we are not persuaded otherwise by the <em>amici curiae. </em>They do not acknowledge, as we have found, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJR\">[generally, the trend in the law has been towards granting awards for mental injury resulting from mental stress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">Marc A. Antonetti, <em>Labor Law: Workers\u2019 Compensation Statutes and the Recovery of Emotional Distress Damages in the Absence of Physical Injury, </em>1990 Annual Survey of American Law 671 at 695. Antonetti, in his analysis of the trend, sees the same justification in allowing mental-mental claims as we found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-5\">This trend toward allowing the mental-mental claim is justified by both the goals of workers\u2019 compensation laws and evidence regarding the nature of mental injuries. The primary goal of workers\u2019 compensation is to compensate disabled employees. If an individual is unable to work because of a job related injury, he remains disabled whether he was injured from either mental or physical stress. Therefore, workers\u2019 compensation laws should make allowances for the mental-mental claimant. Additionally, modern medical and psychological theory supports the proposition that those who are unable to work for psychological reasons are as disabled to the same extent as those who are physically injured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 696 (footnote omitted). We are not at odds with Antonetti\u2019s comment that because \u201cworkers\u2019 compensation statues are drafted by the legislature, the judiciary should defer to legislative judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 698. \u201cNeverthe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>less,\u201d he avers, and we are in complete accord, \u201cthe judiciary has a role to play in determining the compensability of workers\u2019 compensation claims.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-4\">When the legislature has failed adequately to define statutory terms, the court is obliged to interpret the law and decide on the best social policy.

Included in the revision was a \u201cPlain English\u201d recodification of Article 101\u2014The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. We have exhausted the legislative file on the bills, maintained by the Department of Legislative Reference. The Department\u2019s \u201cOverview\u201d of HB 1 explained that \u201c[t]he goal in revising is to rewrite the law in a more clear and concise manner without making any substantive changes____ Thus, while the language of a revision differs from the derivative statute, the legislative intent does not change.\u201d In the case of workmen\u2019s compensation the understanding of the practical application of the Act was derived largely from case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>The Department\u2019s \u201cReport on House Bill 1\u201d proposed that the workers\u2019 compensation law be Title 9 in the new Labor and Employment article. Section 9-101(b) was to define \u201caccidental injury,\u201d as \u201c(1) an accidental injury that arises out of and in the course of employment; (2) an injury caused by a willful or negligent act of a third person ...,\u201d in accord with the former Art. 101, \u00a7 67(6). The Maryland Chamber of Commerce reacted to the proposed revision. The attorney who chaired the Workers\u2019 Compensation Committee of the Chamber of Commerce wrote the Chairman of the House Economic Matters Committee expressing \u201cconcern and opposition to the <em>new </em>definition of \u2018accidental injury\u2019 \u201d because it \u201cremoves the word \u2018personal\u2019 from the current substantive use of accidental <em>personal </em>injury.\u201d (Emphases in original). He claimed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-5\">This is a substantive change from the current law and it eliminates a very substantial and fundamental defense historically available since 1914 and applied uniformly by our courts over the past seventy-six years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">He observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-7\">A letter from the Legislative Analyst assigned to the Article Review Committee concedes that there is a potential problem with the proposed new definition of accidental injury if the Maryland Court of Appeals were to interpret the term \u201caccidental injury\u201d to include other than physical injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">He requested that the word \u201cpersonal\u201d be included in the definition of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">The Director of Industrial Relations of the Maryland Chamber of Commerce followed this with a letter to the Chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, in which, among a number of suggestions with respect to the revision of other laws, he said that the Chamber was \u201cconcerned about the deletion of the word \u2018personal\u2019 from the very basic defined term \u2018accidental personal injury\u2019 in the workers\u2019 compensation title____ We continue to believe,\u201d he asserted, \u201cthat the use of the term \u2018accidental injury\u2019 leaves open the possible interpretation that the law is intended to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>pensate for psychological damages as well as physical damages.\u201d He too urged \u201cthe use of the term \u2018accidental personal injury\u2019 in the workers\u2019 compensation definitions.\u201d We discovered in the legislative file a \u201cBill Analysis\u201d prepared by the House Economic Matters Committee concerning HB 692. The \u201cSummary\u201d of the Analysis was: \u201cThis bill makes the technical changes and changes to cross-references made necessary by House Bill 1 (Code Revision).\u201d It gave as the background of the bill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-4\">This bill is a companion bill to House Bill 1 (Labor and Employment Article) bill and makes all the <em>technical changes </em>necessary to other portions of the Code that are affected by the Revision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">(Emphasis added). The Analysis explained that the Economic Matters Committee had appointed a Subcommittee on Code Revision that examined the proposed changes suggested at the hearing on HB 1. Among the \u201ctechnical changes\u201d the Subcommittee had accepted was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag_\">Argument that \u201cAccidental injury\u201d should be changed to \u201caccidental personal injury\u201d (proposed by the Maryland Chamber of Commerce)____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The <em>amici curiae </em>take the insertion of the word \u201cpersonal\u201d back into the proposed statute as an indication of clear legislative intent not to permit compensation for mental trauma. We cannot perceive that the Legislature intend any such thing based on fears of what the Court of Appeals <em>might </em>do. As far as we are able to ascertain, the inclusion of the word \u201cpersonal\u201d was deemed by the Legislature as a mere \u201ctechnical\u201d change, not a substantive one. It cannot be taken as an expression of legislative intent to foreclose compensation for mental harm. Had the Legislature any doubt about the matter, it could very easily have declared that psychological harm is not compensable. The Overview to HB 1 noted that \u201c[a] by-product of the revision process is identification of substantive problems that exist in the law.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARb\">Although a code revision bill is not a vehicle for correcting substantive problems, they are discussed in notes following each section of the revision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>The Special Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 9-101(b) headed \u201cAccidental personal injury\u201d did not suggest that there was a substantive problem with respect to the word \u201cpersonal.\u201d The Note provides a plain explanation why the phrase \u201caccidental personal injury\u201d was used:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-4\">In the introductory language of [\u00a7 9-101(b)], Chs. 8 and 21, Acts of 1991, deleted the former terms \u201cinjury,\u201d \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d and \u201caccidental injury\u201d as unnecessary, since the term \u201caccidental personal injury\u201d is used consistently throughout this title to avoid confusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbU\"><em>See Office &amp; Prof. Employees Int\u2019l v.

Nevertheless, in the circumstances, we do not think that this action demonstrated a legislative intention to preclude compensation for emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Belcher presented two questions on her appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and we accepted them in our grant of certiorari. She asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-8\">(1) Is a mental condition compensable under the [Act] where there is no physical injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-9\">(2) Did Belcher suffer such psychological reaction from the accidental injury sufficient to qualify as a compensable accidental personal injury?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">The first question is a matter of law. The answer is \u201cyes\u201d in the context of the <em>Vance </em>definition of \u201cphysical injury,\u201d which we have now applied to a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in the contemplation of the Workers\u2019 Compensation act. That is, an injury under the Act may be psychological in nature if the mental state for which recovery is sought is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>capable of objective determination. Inasmuch as the circuit court decided that the answer was \u201cno\u201d, it erred in granting the motion for summary judgment made by the employer and in denying the summary judgment made by Belcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The second question concerns a matter of fact. In the appeal before us, as briefed and argued by the parties, it is not disputed that, in the contemplation of the Act, Belcher was a covered employee; T. Rowe Price was her insured employer; whatever injury she suffered was personal; that the injury arose out of and in the course of her employment and was either accidental or was caused by the negligent act of a third person. So the only question remaining is whether Belcher suffered sufficient psychological reaction from the alleged injury to qualify for compensation. The question must now be resolved by the application of the <em>Vance </em>standard to the evidence adduced on the issue. This is best accomplished on a rehearing before the Commission, which may review the evidence presented at the first hearing and such additional evidence as the Commission deems necessary or advisable. Of course, counsel shall be afforded the opportunity to be heard.

Gilbert, formerly Chief Judge of the Court of Special Appeals, and Robert L. Humphreys, Jr., in <em>Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook </em>(1988), have synthesized a rule from the Maryland cases that should be applied here. At \u00a7 5.2, \u201cPersonal Injury,\u201d those authors state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-4\">\u201cA review of case law shows that a compensable injury may be found whenever an accidental physiological change is found to have arisen out of and in the course of employment. There is no statutory nor decisional requirement that the injury arise concurrent to or immediately after the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-5\">\u201cThe absence of a physiological change or physical harm or damage should preclude a finding that an injury occurred. For this reason, emotional or mental disorders are not properly classified as accidental injuries unless they arise from an accidental event <em>and </em>include a physiological component.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 85-86 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">In the instant matter, the accidental event requirement of this rule is dramatically satisfied. The requirement for a physiological change is also satisfied, at least to the extent that it was satisfied in <em>Sargent v. Board of Educ. of Baltimore County, </em>49 Md.App. 577, 433 A.2d 1209 (1981). <em>Sargent </em>involved a building custodian who was required to enter a boiler to clean it. \u201cShe blacked out for several hours, which is clearly a physiological reaction, and after-wards, was temporarily unable to maintain the composure necessary to continue her work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584-85, 433 A.2d at 1213. The Commission awarded compensation, making \u201cimplicit in its decision that [the claimant] did suffer a physical change in response to her claustrophobic reaction to entering the boiler.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584, 433 A.2d at 1213. The Court of Special Appeals concluded \u201cthat there was sufficient evidence to support [the claimant\u2019s] contention that she suffered a physiological injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the <em>Sargent </em>court, after having found error in a circuit court\u2019s conclusion that there was no accident, also rejected an alternate ground for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>sustaining the circuit court\u2019s judgment by holding that the evidence of personal injury was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">In the instant matter the circuit court\u2019s ruling in favor of the employer is on summary judgment. The circuit court distinguished <em>Sargent </em>on the ground that the claimant here did not black out. There is, however, sufficient evidence to generate a factual issue that Belcher sustained physiological injury as the result of the accident. It could be found that, as a result of the accident, she suffered amnesia for several hours, was involuntarily shaking, became quite cold and was in shock, and that she suffers chest and shoulder pains, headaches, panic attacks, sleeplessness and nightmares. I would hold that this evidence generates a jury issue on physiological change. Certainly, Belcher\u2019s claim is more demonstrable than is a claim based on complaints of pain in the low back, allegedly resulting from an unusual, twisting motion at work, which can be compensable, if believed, even though the complaints cannot be objectively corroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">On the foregoing analysis, the instant matter is not a case in which there is \u201can injury solely to one\u2019s mind,\u201d unaccompanied by physical harm. 329 Md. 709, 721, 621 A.2d 872, 878 (1993). Consequently, there is no need to attempt to condense into a single phrase the body of Maryland tort law bearing on damages for emotional distress (said to be \u201ca standard permitting recovery for damages for trauma resulting from purely emotional distress that can be objectively determined\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 735, 621 A.2d at 885. Whether or not the foregoing statement accurately condenses Maryland tort law, it should not be imported into the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The expansive rationale of the majority opinion takes a state of facts which, under the <em>Sargent </em>analysis, presents a \u201cphysical-mental claim,\u201d and resolves it by recognizing a \u201cmental-mental claim\u201d as a compensable claim. \u201cPhysical-mental claims involve a physical injury which leads to a mental disability; for example, a conversion neurosis following a traumatic injury.\u201d D. DeCarlo, <em>Workplace Stress: </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number><em>Trends, Outlook and Perspectives 258 </em>(Am.Ins.Ass\u2019n.1987). \u201cMental-mental claims refer to mental stress which results in a mental disability; for example, a nervous breakdown brought on by job harassment or termination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">The majority erects a \u201ccaution\u201d\u2014the \u201c \u2018mental injury must be precipitated by an accident.\u2019 \u201d 329 Md. at 740, 621 A.2d at 887 (quoting <em>Sparks v. Tulane Medical Ctr. Hosp. &amp; Clinic, </em>546 So.2d 138, 147 (La.1989)). What the majority apparently considers to be an appropriately compensable mental-mental claim, and what the majority considers to be the appropriate scope of the accident requirement, are illustrated in the favorably cited <em>Sparks </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The claimant was hired by the employer hospital in 1980. She worked for four years in distribution of medical supplies, was promoted to regular work-week manager of the distribution center in 1984, and stopped work in April 1987. Relatively early in her employment, she had complained to her supervisor about co-workers smoking marijuana, and she had cautioned a co-worker about possible drug possession. From time to time property was stolen from the storeroom, including some belonging to the claimant, and there were acts of vandalism, some of which might have been directed at the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">In 1987, at a staff meeting, the claimant expressed her opinion that a weekend crew, in the charge of another supervisor and responsible for restocking supply shelves, had been performing poorly. In protest of the criticism, two of the weekend employees refused to restock at all on the following weekend. When a senior supervisor decided that the protestors should be suspended for five days, the weekend supervisor told the claimant that \u201c \u2018a lot of people around here want to kick your butt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">A majority of the Supreme Court of Louisiana held that, as a matter of law, the communication of threats to the claimant was an accident, and that her fright and upset over the threats, which resulted in an emotional disability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>was the injury. <em>Id. </em>at 148. \u201cThe Louisiana legislature reacted quickly to the <em>Sparks </em>decision, passing amendments to the statute in agreement with the dissent\u2019s reasoning.\u201d M. Antonetti, <em>Labor Law: Workers\u2019 Compensation Statutes and the Recovery of Emotional Distress Damages in the Absence of Physical Injury, </em>1990 Ann.Surv. of Am.Law 671, 680 (footnote omitted) (Antonetti).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s approval of \u201c \u2018allowing the mental-mental claim [as] justified by both the goals of workers\u2019 compensation laws and evidence regarding the nature of mental injuries.\u2019 \u201d 329 Md. at 741, 621 A.2d at 888 (quoting Antonetti at 696). The legislative history of the recodification of the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act makes plain to me the General Assembly\u2019s intent that mental-mental claims should not be compensable. Further, the General Assembly\u2019s ongoing interest in, and concern over, the costs of workers\u2019 compensation dictate judicial restraint rather than an expansion of benefits by judicial fiat, based on the majority\u2019s view of \u201c \u2018the best social policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 742, 621 A.2d at 888 (quoting Antonetti at 698).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The Act was recodified from former Art. 101 of the Md. Code to Title 9 of the Labor and Employment Article of the Code by Chapter 8 of the Acts of 1991. It was introduced as House Bill 1 on January 9, 1991, and referred to the Economic Matters Committee. As proposed by the staff of the Legislative Division of the Department of Legislative Reference (the Revisor), and as introduced, \u00a7 9-101(b) created a definitional term used throughout the Act\u2014\u201caccidental injury.\u201d By letter of January 16, 1991, the chairperson of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Committee of the Maryland Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Chairperson of the House Economic Matters Committee opposing this definition and urging that proposed Title 9 use the term, \u201caccidental personal injury,\u201d that had been used, albeit not uniformly, in. Art. 101. Although the Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 9-101, that was included in House Bill 1, indicated that no substantive change was intended, the position taken by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>Chamber of Commerce was not devoid of merit. We have recently pointed out, speaking through Judge Eldridge, that \u201cpersonal injury ... normally connotes a physical injury to a victim.\u201d <em>United States v. Streidel, </em>329 Md. 533, 539, 620 A.2d 905, 909 (1993). The Chamber of Commerce in part pointed out that \u201c[a] letter from the Legislative Analyst assigned to the Article Review Committee concedes that there is a potential problem with the proposed new definition of accidental injury if the Maryland Court of Appeals were to interpret the term \u2018accidental injury\u2019 to include other than physical injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">Companion legislation to the proposed new Labor and Employment Article was House Bill 692, prepared to correct throughout the Code cross-references that would be rendered obsolete by the new Labor and Employment Article. House Bill 692, introduced on February 1, 1991, also was referred to the House Economic Matters Committee. That committee amended House Bill 692 by inserting a new \u00a7 5 to the bill, consisting of eighteen printed pages. 1991 Md. Laws 1170-87. The amendments changed the Revisor\u2019s definitional term \u201caccidental injury\u201d to \u201caccidental personal injury\u201d and inserted that term throughout proposed Title 9. House Bills 1 and 692 were reported favorably by the House Committee on March 1, 1991; both were passed by the House on March 6, 1991; both were introduced into the Senate on March 7, 1991; and both were enacted. House Bill 1 was enacted on March 21 while House Bill 692 was enacted on March 22 as Chapter 21 of the Acts of 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">In the Maryland Code the combined effect of both bills appears under the Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 9-101 that has remained unchanged from its introductory form in House Bill 1. But the General Assembly did not agree with the Revisor that there was no difference between \u201caccidental injury\u201d and \u201caccidental personal injury.\u201d We should not consider that the General Assembly engaged in a useless act when it caused amendments to be made throughout the Act. Clearly the general purpose of the amendments was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>to prevent a judicial interpretation of \u201caccidental injury\u201d that included \u201cother than physical injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">At the time of the legislative amendments, however, the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Sargent </em>had already interpreted \u201caccidental personal injury\u201d to include physiological changes. Thus, while I agree that Belcher\u2019s claim is not barred, I also believe that this Court should respect the intent of the General Assembly and refrain from covering the purely mental-mental claim with the mantle of \u201caccidental personal injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Further, recent and ongoing executive and legislative economic studies that seek to balance benefit to workers against cost to employers should dictate against this Court\u2019s economically uninformed disruption of that balance by expanding the Act to include mental-mental claims. On December 31, 1985, the Maryland Department of Economic and Community Development (DECD) issued a report that compared Maryland\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation costs in fifty-one occupational classes with those of twenty-nine other states. DECD, <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation in Maryland </em>34 (1985) (the DECD Report). It found that Maryland \u201cranked in the high-cost third of the 30 states with respect to Standard Earned Premium (SEP), indemnity losses, and total losses.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 73. The Report also found that \u201cMaryland ... ranked in the high-cost third in all categories under permanent partial injuries, including indemnity losses, medical losses, total losses and claim count.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Identified as possible areas of reform were permanent partial awards, medical cost containment, use of standardized medical guides, competitive rating\u2014modified file-and-use, data collection and reporting, and safety in the workplace. <em>Id. </em>at 77-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>On December 31, 1985, another group, the Ad-Hoc Working Group on Workers\u2019 Compensation (the Working Group), issued a report, also entitled, \u201cWorkers\u2019 Compensation in Maryland.\u201d Working Group, <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation in Maryland </em>(1985). The Working Group was comprised of members from organized labor, the business community, and \u201cresearchers familiar with the availability and quality of data on Maryland\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. The Working Group\u2019s purpose was \u201cto propose cost effective initiatives for Maryland\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1. In its report, the Working Group made numerous recommendations, several of which were the same as those made in the DECD Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">By Executive Order 01.01.1986.11, on June 5, 1986, Governor Hughes established the Governor\u2019s Commission to Study the Worker\u2019s Compensation System (the Commission). 13 Md.Reg. 1575 (July 3, 1986). The impetus for the Governor\u2019s Executive Order came from the DECD Report and the Working Group\u2019s report. <em>See id. </em>The Executive Order charged the Commission with reviewing the laws, procedures and other matters relating to \u201cthe cost of workers\u2019 compensation and the efficient provision of adequate benefits to Maryland workers,\u201d and with recommending changes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The Commission replaced the Governor\u2019s Commission on Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws. That commission \u201cfocused more on the issues of efficiency and fairness in the implementation of the worker\u2019s compensation law, and did not have the specific cost reduction mandate of the new Commission.\u201d Department of Fiscal Services, <em>Staff Report on Worker\u2019s Compensation in Maryland: Briefing Paper for the 1987 General Assembly </em>10 (Jan. 19, 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The Commission reported in January 1987. Governor\u2019s Commission to Study the Workers\u2019 Compensation System, <em>Report of the Governor\u2019s Commission to Study the Workers\u2019 Compensation System </em>(1987) (the Commission Report). The Executive Summary to the Commission Report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>\u201cThe workers\u2019 compensation system is a major social program in Maryland, providing Maryland\u2019s two million workers with remedies for work-related injuries and illnesses. Previous research studies have clearly established that the costs of the present workers\u2019 compensation system to Maryland employers are significantly increasing, and that Maryland is an expensive workers\u2019 compensation state. Comprehensive reform of Maryland\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation program is critical to achieving a modern, effective system that is both equitable and cost effective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">During its 1987 session, the General Assembly made substantial revisions to the Act. <em>See </em>Acts of 1987, chs. 590, 591. Among other things, Chapter 590 established a Workers\u2019 Compensation Benefit and Insurance Oversight Committee (the Oversight Committee). Acts of 1987, ch. 590, \u00a7 3. The Oversight Committee was charged with examining and evaluating \u201cthe condition of the workers\u2019 compensation benefit and insurance structure in Maryland\u201d and the effects of the 1987 legislation. <em>Id. </em>The Oversight Committee must report by December 31 of each year to the Governor and the General Assembly. <em>Id. </em>It has done so. <em>See </em>Oversight Committee, <em>Reports of the 1889, 1990, 1991, and 1992 Interim to the Governor and the Maryland General Assembly.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">None of these studies expressly addresses the question of mental-mental claims, apparently because they have never been considered to be included in the Act and because there is no significant impetus to include them. Whether the Act should be expanded to include mental-mental claims requires an evaluation of costs and benefits to many interests that make up the economy of the entire State. It is, in my view, particularly inappropriate for this Court to decide that question in a case in which that issue need not be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">Judges McAULIFFE and CHASANOW have authorized me to state that they join in the views expressed in this concurring opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-6\">. \"Standard earned premium (SEP) is the total premium paid (or contracted to be paid) by employers in a given risk classification based on manual rates and experience rating <em>at the beginning </em>of the policy period.
