The facility is operated by the District of Columbia. During the time after his escape and before his recapture, Richardson killed Thomas T. Hansford, Jr., in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. Richardson was convicted in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, on August 3, 1988, of felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">On August 15, 1988, the decedent\u2019s parents, Thomas T. Hansford, Sr., individually and as personal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate, and Mary Dell Hansford, instituted the present suit in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against the District of Columbia, Mr. J.E. Neil Ollivierra, then Acting Superintendent of Oak Hill Youth Center, and Carl Sewanti Richardson. In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that the District of Columbia through its employees failed to \u201cproperly supervise and maintain custody and control\u201d over Richardson and thereby negligently allowed him to escape from the Oak Hill Youth Center. It was also alleged that the District, by its employees at Oak Hill, was negligent in failing to \u201crecapture [Richardson] in a timely manner.\u201d The District was alleged to be responsible, under the doctrine of respondeat superior, for the negligent acts of its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Furthermore, the plaintiffs alleged that, at the time of Richardson\u2019s escape, the District of Columbia had a policy or custom of permitting escapees from the Oak Hill Youth Center to remain at large. The complaint stated that one of every three detainees was permitted to be missing from the facility. The plaintiffs argued that the District\u2019s negligent policy or custom of allowing Richardson to remain at large violated the decedent\u2019s civil rights by depriving him of his life without due process of law. The plaintiffs, therefore, claimed damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Finally, the complaint included an \u201cassault and battery\u201d count which applied only to the action against Richardson.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The plaintiffs, in asserting that the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County could exercise jurisdiction in the case, relied on, <em>inter alia, </em>Maryland Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-902, 3-904, 6-101 and 6-103 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They also stated that they had complied with the provision of District of Columbia law which requires that notice of intent to sue the District be filed within six months of the incident alleged. D.C.Code \u00a7 12-309 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The District filed, on the same day, both a motion to dismiss and an answer to the complaint. The motion to dismiss asserted, with regard to the District, a lack of jurisdiction over the person. The motion also claimed that Mr. Ollivierra was immune from suit and that the complaint failed to state a cause of action against either the District or Mr. Ollivierra.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Although the plaintiffs in their opposition to the motion to dismiss did not raise the issue, the circuit court, at the hearing on the motion to dismiss, sua sponte raised a question about the timeliness of the motion. Maryland Rule 2-322 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">\u201cPRELIMINARY MOTIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2o\">\u201c(a) Mandatory.\u2014The following defenses shall be made by motion to dismiss filed before the answer, if an answer is required: (1) lack of jurisdiction over the person, (2) improper venue, (3) insufficiency of process, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>(4) insufficiency of service of process. If not so made and the answer is filed, these defenses are waived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\">\u201c(b) Permissive.\u2014The following defenses may be made by motion to dismiss filed before the answer, if an answer is required: (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, (2) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, (3) failure to join a party under Rule 2-211, and (4) governmental immunity. If not so made, these defenses and objections may be made in the answer, or in any other appropriate manner after answer is filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Counsel for the District of Columbia and for Mr. Ollivierra told the court that he had filed the motion to dismiss prior to filing the answer. The docket entries, however, read as if the answer were filed first. The circuit court found that counsel had in fact filed the motion to dismiss before filing the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The circuit court then heard arguments on the motion to dismiss. The attorney in the Office of the Corporation Counsel of the District of Columbia, who represented both the District and Mr. Ollivierra, contended that, under Maryland law, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over the District of Columbia, a foreign municipal corporation. Counsel, relying on <em>Phillips v. Baltimore, </em>110 Md. 431, 72 A. 902 (1909), argued that a municipal corporation can be sued only in the courts of the jurisdiction where it is situated. It was also claimed that Mr. Ollivierra was immune from suit because he was a public official engaged in discretionary duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The District and Mr. Ollivierra further argued that the complaint failed to state a cause of action because there was no special relationship between the plaintiffs and these two defendants giving rise to a special duty. They also maintained that there was no causal connection between the alleged negligence of these defendants and the death of Thomas T. Hansford, Jr., and that there was no basis in law for the \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>On September 8, 1989, the circuit court dismissed the action against the District of Columbia, holding that a municipal corporation could not be sued, in transitory actions, outside the jurisdiction in which it is located. The circuit court\u2019s holding was based entirely on <em>Phillips v. Baltimore City, supra, </em>110 Md. 431, 72 A. 902, which involved venue principles and the construction of a venue statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The circuit court refused to dismiss any part of the action against Mr. Ollivierra. The court stated that more factual development was required before it could render a decision on Mr. Ollivierra\u2019s defense of governmental immunity. The court also held that more factual development was needed before it could rule on the arguments that Mr. Ollivierra and the District owed no duty to the plaintiffs, that there was no causal connection between the death and alleged negligence of these defendants, and that there was no basis in law for the \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The plaintiffs noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals on October 6, 1989. On December 4, 1989 the circuit court certified as final the judgment in favor of the District of Columbia. Rule 2-602(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">In its brief in the Court of Special Appeals, the District argued' that it had complied with the filing requirements of Rule 2-322(a), and that the circuit court correctly held that, because the District was a municipal corporation, it could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>not be sued outside its boundaries. Although not raised in the circuit court, the District contended in the Court of Special Appeals that there was another rationale for affirming the dismissal of the complaint against the District. The District argued that Maryland\u2019s cession of exclusive jurisdiction over the land upon which Oak Hill Youth Center rests deprived the circuit court of its ability to exercise jurisdiction over acts and omissions occurring on that land. The District maintained that, although in 1943 Maryland expressly reserved jurisdiction over lands leased or ceded to the United States, this reservation expressly did not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxO\">\u201c \u2018affect the jurisdiction and authority of the State over land or persons, property, and transactions on land that the United States or its unit has acquired on or before May 31, 1943 to the extent that the State ceded jurisdiction under ... Chapter 743, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3, of the Acts of the General Assembly of 1906.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">(District\u2019s brief at 14, quoting, Code (1984, 1992 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 14-102(b) of the State Government Article.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment, although for a different reason than that relied upon by the circuit court. <em>Hansford v. District of Columbia, </em>84 Md. App. 301, 578 A.2d 844 (1990). The intermediate appellate court held that a Maryland court could not exercise jurisdiction over the District of Columbia in this case because the District\u2019s alleged negligence occurred on a federal enclave which was ceded prior to 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The plaintiffs filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari raising the following three issues (although in a somewhat different order): (1) whether the trial court erred in granting the District\u2019s \u201cmotion to dismiss due to lack of personal jurisdiction where\u201d the District had allegedly filed the motion after filing its answer; (2) whether the trial court erred in holding that the District, as a municipal corporation, could not be sued outside of the jurisdiction in which it is located; (3) whether the Court of Special Appeals erroneously affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint against the District on the ground that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>could not exercise jurisdiction where the District\u2019s alleged tortious conduct occurred on a federal enclave ceded prior to 1943. The District did not file a cross-petition or a conditional cross-petition for a writ of certiorari. Thereafter this Court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 petition, 321 Md. 709, 584 A.2d 708 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The plaintiffs continue to insist in this Court that, because the docket entries state that the District\u2019s answer was filed before its motion to dismiss was filed, the District has waived its right to argue issues which must be raised in a preliminary motion. As previously stated, Rule 2-322(a) requires that the defenses of lack of jurisdiction over the person, improper venue, insufficiency of process, and insufficiency of service of process, be made in a motion to dismiss before an answer is filed. If not so made, the right to assert these defenses is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The District\u2019s counsel represented to the trial judge that the motion to dismiss was filed prior to the answer. The trial judge indicated that the order of entries on the docket does not necessarily reflect the order in which the documents were filed. The trial judge stated: \u201cI\u2019m not going to conclude that you have waived the right to raise the matters contained in the motion raising preliminary objection merely because the clerk in shuffling papers put one ahead of the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Assuming arguendo that the contemporaneous filing of the motion and the answer would not satisfy the requirement of Rule 2-322(a), the trial court\u2019s finding that the motion was filed first is not clearly erroneous. Moreover, we note that the trial court\u2019s conclusion is supported by the date and time stamps on the pleadings. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the District waived its right to assert the defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">The District\u2019s sole \u201clack of jurisdiction\u201d argument in the circuit court was that, as a matter of Maryland law, the District of Columbia may not be sued in a Maryland court for transitory actions because the District is a municipal corporation which may not be sued outside of the District of Columbia. The District\u2019s argument is based upon one case, involving venue principles and the construction of a Maryland venue statute, which supports the proposition that a Maryland municipal corporation can be sued only in the county where it is situated. <em>Phillips v. Baltimore City, supra, </em>110 Md. 431, 72 A. 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Prior to <em>Phillips v. Baltimore City, </em>this Court in <em>Baltimore City v. Turnpike Co., </em>104 Md. 351, 65 A. 35 (1906), held that an action against Baltimore City, based on the City\u2019s alleged trespass upon the plaintiff\u2019s land located in Baltimore County, was properly brought in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Rejecting the City\u2019s assertion that the suit should have been brought in Baltimore City, the Court relied upon the principle that local actions should be brought in the jurisdiction where the land lies. <em>See Gunther v. Dranbauer, </em>86 Md. 1, 6, 38 A. 33 (1897). In the <em>Turnpike Co. </em>case, the City\u2019s entire reliance in this Court was upon the rule, set forth in several out-of-state cases, that \u201ca municipal corporation [can] be sued in its own Courts only, even in the case of a local action.\u201d 104 Md. at 351, 65 A. 35. This Court rejected the rule, stating (104 Md. at 357, 65 A. at 36):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">\u201cWe have been referred to no decision in this State, that holds that a municipal corporation should not be bound by the rules of law, which are applicable to other litigants and no sound reason can be given why they should be excepted. The contention of the appellant, if carried to its logical conclusion, would result in depriving municipalities in the State, which have no Courts, from suing or being sued____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Nevertheless, a few years later in <em>Phillips v. Baltimore City, </em>the Court did apply, in a transitory action against Baltimore City, the venue rule that a municipal corporation could be sued only in its own courts. 110 Md. at 436, 72 A. at 904. The Court held that this general rule was applicable to transitory actions in the absence of a statute modifying the rule. The <em>Phillips </em>Court limited the holding in <em>Baltimore City v. Turnpike Co. </em>to local actions only.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The <em>Phillips </em>Court then considered whether the venue statute relating to bringing suit against a corporation, which was then in effect, had changed this general rule. The Court held that the venue statute, which declared <em>inter alia </em>that a \u201ccorporation of this State\u201d could be sued in any county where it regularly transacted business,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not apply to a municipal corporation. 110 Md. at 437, 72 A. at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\"><em>Phillips </em>has no application to the present case. The rule that was applied in <em>Phillips </em>is that a Maryland municipality, sued in a Maryland court in a transitory action, should be sued where it is situated. The District of Columbia is not a Maryland municipal corporation and is not situated in a Maryland county. In the context of this case, it is a nonresident corporate defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Adoption of the District\u2019s argument would lead to the adoption of a venue rule which would grant foreign municipal corporations the unique privilege of being immunized from suit in the State of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The Supreme Court of Kansas addressed this issue in <em>Hillhouse v. City of Kansas City, </em>221 Kan. 369, 373, 559 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>P.2d 1148, 1151 (1977), stating: \u201cthere is no sound reason why a foreign municipal corporation should be treated any differently from foreign private corporations.\u201d We agree with the Supreme Court of Kansas and hold that a foreign municipal corporation is subject to the same venue rules as any private corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><em>Phillips </em>has no application to this case for another reason. In <em>Phillips, </em>this Court construed a venue statute which stated that a \u201ccorporation of this State may be sued in any county ... where it regularly transacts business.\u201d This venue statute no longer exists. The comparable general venue statute now reads in pertinent part as follows (Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 6-201 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\">\u201c[A] civil action shall be brought in a county where the defendant resides, carries on a regular business, is employed, or habitually engages in a vocation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Thus, with respect to suits where regular business is carried on, the broader term \u201cdefendant\u201d is used to encompass persons and corporations. The District of Columbia is certainly a \u201cdefendant.\u201d The <em>Phillips </em>Court\u2019s analysis of whether the former venue statute concerning \u201ccorporations\u201d included Maryland municipal corporations has little relevance to an action brought against the \u201cdefendants\u201d under the present venue statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Even if the venue statute had not been changed, this Court in <em>Eck v. State Tax Comm. of Md., </em>204 Md. 245, 252, 103 A.2d 850, 854 (1954), pointed out that \u201cthe [venue] rule applied in the <em>Phillips </em>case ... is not universal and has been subject to criticism____\u201d The court in <em>Eck </em>declined to apply the <em>Phillips </em>holding with respect to suits against public officials relating to the performance of their official duties. 204 Md. at 253-254, 103 A.2d at 854-855.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">The majority of jurisdictions which have reassessed the issue reject the notion that a municipal corporation is not subject to the same venue rules as other corporations. <em>See, e.g., Cacho v. Superior Court, </em>170 Ariz. 30, 32, 821 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>721, 723 (1991); <em>Lawless v. Village of Park Forest South, </em>108 Ill.App.3d 191, 195-196, 438 N.E.2d 1299, 1302 (1982); <em>Guy v. Pennsylvania R. Co., </em>87 N.E.2d 712, 714 (Ohio Ct. of App., Cuyahoga Cty., 1949); <em>City of Cushing v. Coryell, </em>400 P.2d 174, 175-176 (Okl.1965). <em>But see, Ex parte City of Birmingham, </em>507 So.2d 471, 473-474 (Ala.1987). Moreover, as previously discussed, this Court prior to <em>Phillips </em>had rejected the special venue rule for municipal corporations and had stated, in the context of venue principles, that a municipal corporation should be treated like any other litigant. <em>Baltimore City v. Turnpike Co., supra, </em>104 Md. at 357, 65 A. at 36. In addition, there have been Maryland cases since <em>Phillips </em>where, without discussion, a municipal corporation has been subjected to suit outside of its county\u2019s boundaries. <em>See, e.g., Alexander v. Montgomery County, </em>87 Md.App. 275, 589 A.2d 563 (1991) (Montgomery County sued in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">We agree with the majority of jurisdictions which today reject the notion that a municipal corporation is exempt from the venue principles governing other corporations. Consequently, for several reasons, the District\u2019s reliance upon <em>Phillips v. Baltimore </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The Court of Special Appeals held that the circuit court did not have jurisdiction over the District of Columbia because the allegedly tortious activities, giving rise to the suit against the District, occurred on a federal enclave which was acquired by the United States between the years 1906 and 1943. The land upon which Oak Hill Youth Center is situated was acquired in 1923 for governmental use by the District of Columbia. Act of February 29, 1923, ch. 148, 42 Stat. 1327, 1360.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>At the time of the acquisition of the land upon which Oak Hill Youth Center rests, Chapter 743, \u00a7 2, of the Acts of 1906, later codified as Maryland Code (1957), Art. 96, \u00a7 36, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-4\">\u201cExclusive jurisdiction in and over land so acquired by the United States shall be and the same hereby is ceded to the United States for all purposes except the service upon such sites of all civil and criminal process of the courts of this State, but the jurisdiction so ceded shall continue no longer than the said United States shall own such lands.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In 1943, the General Assembly limited any cession of jurisdiction over lands held by the United States to concurrent jurisdiction. Code (1984), \u00a7 14-102 of the State Government Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The Court of Special Appeals in its opinion stated that Maryland, between 1906 and 1943, \u201c \u2018ceded exclusive jurisdiction to the United States for all purposes except service of process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hansford v. District of Columbia, supra, </em>84 Md.App. at 306, 578 A.2d at 846, quoting 63 Att\u2019y Gen. Ops. 332, 333 (1978); 61 Att\u2019y Gen. Ops. 441, 446 (1976). The Court of Special Appeals appeared to view \u00a7 6-101 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article and \u00a7 14-102 of the State Government Article as somewhat in conflict, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>attempted to reconcile the two statutes. Section 6-101 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9\">\u201cDefinitions; jurisdiction as to federal land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\">\u201c(a) For the purposes of personal jurisdiction, venue, and service of process, the following terms have the meanings indicated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">\u201c(b) \u201cCounty\u201d includes any federal enclave, reservation, or land within the geographical limits of the county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">\u201c(c) \u201cResident\u201d includes a person residing on a federal enclave, reservation, or land in the State or a county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">\u201c(d) \u201cState\u201d includes any federal enclave, reservation, or land within the geographical limits of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">\u201c(e) <em>Legislative </em>intent.\u2014It is the intention of the General Assembly to extend the personal jurisdiction and venue of courts of the State and the. power to serve process of those courts to any person on federal enclaves, reservations, or lands within the State to the fullest extent permitted by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Section 14-102 of the State Government Article provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-S\">\u201c(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014With respect to land that the United States or any of its units leases or otherwise holds in the State, the State reserves jurisdiction and authority over the land and over persons, property, and transactions on the land to the fullest extent that is permitted by the United States Constitution and that is not inconsistent with the governmental purpose for which the land is held.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIcj\">\u201c(b) <em>Previous </em>grants.\u2014This section does not affect the jurisdiction and authority of the State over land or persons, property, and transactions on land that the United States or its unit has acquired on or before May 31, 1943 to the extent that the State ceded jurisdiction under:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-11\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-12\">\u201c(4) Chapter 743, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3, of the Acts of the General Assembly of 1906____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded that, while \u201cthe legislature intended to \u2018extend jurisdiction ... of courts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the state ... to any <em>person </em>on federal enclaves ... to the fullest extent permitted by the Constitution and laws of the United States ... it is apparent that it did not intend the extension to apply to <em>\u2018transactions </em>on land that the United States ... has acquired on or before May 31, 1943.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hansford v. District of Columbia, supra, </em>84 Md.App. at 308-309, 578 A.2d at 848 (emphasis added). Therefore, according to the intermediate appellate court, because Maryland had ceded exclusive jurisdiction to the United States, the District of Columbia could not be subject to suit in a Maryland court based upon its activities at Oak Hill Youth Center.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">In our view, there is no conflict between \u00a7 6-101 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article and \u00a7 14-102 of the State Government Article, and, therefore, there is no need to \u201creconcile\u201d the statutes or adopt a strained construction of either. Furthermore, in dealing with the two statutes and the issues in this case, it is important to differentiate among the separate concepts of (1) a court\u2019s jurisdiction over the person, (2) a court\u2019s authority in civil cases to resolve disputes growing out of transactions occurring outside of the territorial jurisdiction in which the court is located, and (3) a state government\u2019s legislative, executive and administrative authority within its territorial limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Section 6-101 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article deals entirely with personal jurisdiction, service of process, and venue. A Maryland court is clearly entitled to serve process on and exercise jurisdiction over the person of the District of Columbia under the circumstances of this case. Because a federal enclave is included in the definition of \u201cState,\u201d \u00a7 6-101(d), and because of the activities conduct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>ed by the District of Columbia at the Oak Hill Youth Center in this State, the circuit court had the power to exercise jurisdiction over the \u201cperson\u201d of the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">We now turn to the holding of the Court of Special Appeals, namely that the cession of \u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction by the State of Maryland limits the authority of the courts of this State so that a Maryland court cannot exercise jurisdiction over \u201c \u2018transactions on land that the United States ... has acquired on or before May 31, 1943 <em>..\u201d Hansford v. District of Columbia, supra, </em>84 Md.App. at 308-309, 578 A.2d at 848, quoting \u00a7 14-102(b) of the State Government Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Section 14-102(b) of the State Government Article deals entirely with the governing authority of the State of Maryland over enclaves ceded between 1906 and 1943. The section does not in any manner restrict the ability of courts to acquire in personam jurisdiction over persons and entities on federal enclaves. In fact, \u00a7 14-102(b) refers to Ch. 743 of the Acts of 1906 which excepted from the cession of jurisdiction \u201cthe service upon such sites of all civil and criminal process of the courts of this State.\u201d Consequently, there is no conflict between \u00a7 14-102(b) and \u00a7 6-101 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Section 14-102(b) also does not purport to restrict the traditional authority of Maryland courts to resolve disputes between plaintiffs and defendants over whom in personam jurisdiction has been acquired, regardless of where the transaction giving rise to such disputes occurred. Section 14-102(b) simply purports to restrict the applicability of Maryland law and Maryland executive and administrative governmental authority over federal enclaves ceded prior to 1943. The District\u2019s argument, and the position of the Court of Special Appeals, \u201cconfuses the political jurisdiction of a State with its judicial jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Gulf Offshore v.

The Supreme Court has stated that there is \u201c[n]othing inherent in exclusive federal sovereignty over a territo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>ry [that] precludes a state court from entertaining a personal injury suit concerning events occurring in the territory and governed by federal law.\u201d <em>Gulf Offshore v.

The Supreme Court in <em>Gulf Offshore </em>continued (453 U.S. at 481-482, 101 S.Ct. at 2877, 69 L.Ed.2d at 793-794):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\">\u201c \u2018The judiciary power of every government looks beyond its own local or municipal laws, and in civil cases lays hold of all subjects of litigation between parties within its jurisdiction, though the causes of dispute are relative to the laws of the most distant part of the globe.\u2019 The Federalist No. 82, p. 514 (H.

Lowe, </em>150 Md. 592, 133 A. 729 (1926), for the argument that the cession of exclusive jurisdiction over land transfers to the federal government exclusive authority and jurisdiction for all purposes, and deprives a state court of authority to entertain litigation growing out of a transaction on the federal enclave. <em>Lowe </em>involved an action for divorce filed by residents of a federal enclave in Cecil County, Maryland. This Court held that the Lowes, as residents of an \u201cexclusive\u201d federal enclave, were not residents of the State of Maryland and that, therefore, a Maryland state court had no authority to entertain their divorce action. <em>Lowe v. Lowe, supra, </em>150 Md. at 600-601, 133 A. at 733. In support of its holding, the Court pointed to some old cases purportedly standing for the principle that the \u201cinhabitants of [a federal enclave] cease to be inhabitants of the state and can no longer exercise any civil or political rights under the laws of the state.\u201d 150 Md. at 598, 133 A. at 732. The holdings in the cases cited in <em>Lowe </em>included the following: that residents on a federal enclave could not vote at state elections, that residents of a federal enclave could not send their children to the state public schools, and that residents of federal enclaves are exempt from all county and state taxes. The views expressed in <em>Lowe </em>were reiterated by this Court in <em>Royer v. Bd. of Elec. Sups., </em>231 Md. 561, 191 A.2d 446, <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 921, 84 S.Ct. 267, 11 L.Ed.2d 165 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Evans v. Cornman, supra, </em>398 U.S. at 421-426, 90 S.Ct. at 1754-1757, 26 L.Ed.2d at 373-377, expressly disapproved of the holding in <em>Royer v. Bd. of Elec. Sups., supra, </em>and disapproved of the principles set forth in both <em>Royer </em>and <em>Lowe. Evans v. Cornman, </em>also involving residents of an \u201cexclusive\u201d federal enclave in Maryland, held that such persons were residents of the State of Maryland, were entitled to vote in Maryland elections, were subject to Maryland taxes, and were subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>numerous other Maryland laws. The Supreme Court explicitly stated that residents of federal enclaves in Maryland \u201care subject to the process and jurisdiction of state courts; they themselves can resort to those courts in divorce ... proceedings; and they send their children to Maryland public schools.\u201d 398 U.S. at 424, 90 S.Ct. at 1756, 26 L.Ed.2d at 376. The Court also pointed out that the view taken by numerous older cases concerning \u201cthe relationship between federal enclaves and the States in which they are located\u201d is no longer accurate. 398 U.S. at 423, 90 S.Ct. at 1755, 26 L.Ed.2d at 375. <em>See also Howard v.

Bd. of Elec. Sups. </em>are not only inconsistent with controlling Supreme Court authority, but they are inconsistent with the policy of the Maryland General Assembly embodied in \u00a7 14-102 of the State Government Article and \u00a7\u00a7 2-101 <em>et seq. </em>and 6-101 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Consequently, the <em>Lowe </em>and <em>Royer </em>cases are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The District of Columbia argues that even if a Maryland court could exercise jurisdiction over a tort suit based on activities of an individual or of a private corporation occurring on a federal enclave, it cannot exercise jurisdiction over the District, a public corporation. The District claims that it is entitled to the same governmental immunity as the United States. The District asserts that requiring it to answer in a Maryland court would \u201cinterfere with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>District\u2019s governmental functions.\u201d (District of Columbia brief at 11).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">In support of its immunity argument, the District relies on several Supremacy Clause cases. <em>See, e.g., Pacific Coast Dairy v. Department of Agriculture, </em>318 U.S. 285, 295, 63 S.Ct. 628, 631, 87 L.Ed. 761, 767 (1943); <em>United States v. McGee, </em>714 F.2d 607, 612 (6th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Bellevue, </em>474 F.2d 473, 476 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 827, 94 S.Ct. 46, 38 L.Ed.2d 60 (1973); <em>United States v. Dreos, </em>156 F.Supp. 200, 206 (D.Md.1957). In these cases, the courts held that federal employees on federal enclaves could not be subjected to state legislation in the face of a conflicting federal law or federal function. Thus, the Supreme Court has stated <em>(James Stewart &amp; Co. v. Sadrakula, </em>309 U.S. 94, 103-104, 60 S.Ct. 431, 436, 84 L.Ed. 596, 603 (1940)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">\u201c[T]he authority of state laws or their administration may not interfere with the carrying out of a national purpose. Where enforcement of the state law would handicap efforts to carry out the plans of the United States, the state enactment must, of course, give way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In the context of this case, however, the District of Columbia is not the United States, is not carrying out a national purpose, and is not entitled to the governmental immunity or supremacy of the United States. The District is \u201ca body corporate for municipal purposes,\u201d D.C.Code Ann. (1981, 1992 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 l-102(a), and it has been treated as a municipality by the courts. <em>See, e.g., Haynesworth v. Miller, </em>820 F.2d 1245, 1271-1272 (D.C.Cir.1987). The District is not treated like the United States, but rather is treated like any other municipality for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See, Dorman v. District of Columbia, </em>888 F.2d 159, 162 (D.C.Cir.1989); <em>Best v. District of Columbia, </em>743 F.Supp. 44, 45-47 (D.D.C.1990); <em>O\u2019Callaghan v.

Moreover, a Maryland court need not recognize the governmental immunity of another state or of a municipal corporation or political subdivision outside of Maryland. <em>See Nevada v.

While \u00a7 14-102(b) and Ch. 743 of the Acts of 1906 may literally purport to relinquish all Maryland political jurisdiction over federal enclaves ceded between 1906 and 1943, the effect of the cessions during that period is not quite as far reaching as the statutory language would indicate. For example, numerous Maryland laws concerning voting, education, other individual rights, taxation, licensing, appropriations, employment, divorce, etc., are applicable to such \u201cexclusive\" federal enclaves. <em>See </em>the discussion in <em>Evans v. Cornman, </em>398 U.S. 419, 90 S.Ct. 1752, 26 L.Ed.2d 370 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b193-7\">. It is noteworthy that the specific holding in the <em>Lowe </em>case would leave the residents of a federal enclave without a remedy, as the federal courts have no jurisdiction over divorce actions. <em>Ankenbrandt v. Richards, </em>504 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 2206, 119 L.Ed.2d 468 (1992); <em>Barber v. Barber, </em>21 How. (62 U.S.) 582, 16 L.Ed. 226 (1859). The Supreme Court, however, has made it clear that \"no area however small will be left without a developed legal system for private rights,\u201d <em>James Stewart &amp; Co. v. Sadrakula, </em>309 U.S. 94, 100, 60 S.Ct. 431, 434, 84 L.Ed. 596, 600 (1940).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b195-6\">. As previously stated, the District alternatively argued in the trial court that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint failed to state a cause of action because there was no special relationship between the plaintiffs and the District giving rise to a duty, because there was no causal connection between the alleged negligence of these defendants and the death of Thomas T. Hansford, Jr., and because there was no basis in law for the \u00a7 1983 constitutional claims. The District did not file a cross-petition or a conditional cross-petition for a writ of certiorari raising these issues. Consequently, the District does not in its brief seek to sustain the trial court\u2019s judgment by pressing the duty, proximate cause, and \u00a7 1983 arguments. Therefore, we express no opinion on these issues; they are for the trial court on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
