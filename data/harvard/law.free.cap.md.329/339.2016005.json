Specifically, the issue is whether the trial court erred in allowing the guilty verdict to stand without probing into the meaning of one juror\u2019s response that her verdict was guilty, \u201cwith reluctance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Early in the morning of February <em>2, </em>1990, Calvert County Deputy Sheriff Thomas Kane noticed a car pass by with its tailpipe scraping the street. Kane made the vehicle stop. Petitioner Kevin Tyrone Lattisaw was driving; Sherman Gross was a passenger. Kane asked Lattisaw and Gross to step out of the vehicle when Lattisaw could not produce the car\u2019s registration and responded suspiciously to questions about its ownership. Kane called for backup assistance and, with Lattisaw\u2019s consent, began to search the car for weapons and drugs. Kane observed what appeared to be crack cocaine on the rear floorboard. A drug-sniffing dog, brought to the scene by the backup, indicated that the substance was indeed cocaine, and the dog revealed further caches of crack cocaine in the rear-seat area. Kane also found a large sum of money in the car, at which point he arrested Lattisaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Lattisaw was charged with simple possession of cocaine and with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. He was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Calvert County on August 15, 1990. Lattisaw testified in his defense that the contraband in the vehicle did not belong to him. He claimed that he did not know of the drugs or money in the car and that he had seen Gross \u201cfumbling\u201d to remove something from his pocket as Kane approached the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">After a verdict of guilty was returned as to both counts, Lattisaw requested that the jury be polled. The clerk of the court asked each juror whether his or her individual verdict was the same as the verdict of the jury as a whole. All responded, \u201cYes, it is,\u201d except for juror Patricia Kiefer, who replied, \u201cYes, with reluctance.\u201d At this juncture of the proceedings, the court granted defense counsel Kent\u2019s request for a bench conference, at which the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">\u201cMR. KENT: Frankly, I don\u2019t know what to do about this, but we have one lady back in the corner who said, yes, with reluctance, and she seems very upset.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>THE COURT: What does reluctance mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">MR. KENT: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">MR. RIDDLE (Assistant State\u2019s Attorney): Your Hon- or, any time somebody is responsible for somebody facing up to 20 years in jail, I can see them being a little upset and reluctant. I do a lot of things with reluctance, but I make decisions. She said yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">MR. KENT: I would like to know what reluctance means. Does that mean you are not going to get out of here unless you agree with us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">MR. RIDDLE: That\u2019s academic. We don\u2019t sit here and decide what goes on in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t think we do either. She said that her verdict is the verdict of the jury. She was reluctant to do it. Apparently it has something to do with some reluctance on her part, but I don\u2019t think that matters. I don\u2019t think it makes any difference whether you are reluctant or not, do you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Defense counsel began to respond to the court\u2019s inquiry as to whether it made any difference that the juror was reluctant. He said: \u201cWell, to me, I think,\u201d when the court interrupted him to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">\u201c[T]he verdict being that way, regardless of how it reached that particular verdict, she came out with a yes, it was her verdict. I don\u2019t see whether it would make any difference that she was reluctant to do it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">Defense counsel stated that he had \u201conly asked that the jury be polled because I noticed her [Juror Kiefer], and she kept shaking her head.\u201d The court then observed that defense counsel wanted the jury polled \u201cto make sure that\u2019s her verdict,\u201d noting at the same time that her verdict was \u201cYes,\u201d and he didn\u2019t know \u201cwhat else you can do.\u201d The prosecutor objected to the court\u2019s inquiring further as to the juror\u2019s verdict. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-13\">\u201cIf you ask her again, it is going to be like asking, well, do you want a second chance. They came to a verdict; she said yes. I would object strongly to any second asking.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>The court then asked defense counsel, \u201cWhat is your motion?\u201d in response to which defense counsel stated, \u201cI don\u2019t have any idea. It has never happened before.\u201d The court concluded the bench conference, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">\u201cI think I am going to have to rule that that is a yes. And I don\u2019t think there is any question about it being anything but a yes. I don\u2019t know anything else to ask her. I don\u2019t think it would be proper for me to ask her what reluctance means. If yes is yes, yes is yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Allowing the guilty verdicts to stand, the court sentenced Lattisaw to five years\u2019 imprisonment (with all but thirty months suspended) on the charge of possession with intent to distribute and to one-year imprisonment (to run concurrent to the five-year term) on the simple possession charge. Lattisaw appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals rejected Lattisaw\u2019s assertion that the reluctant juror\u2019s response undermined the unanimity of the guilty verdict and therefore required curative action by the trial court. First, the intermediate appellate court found that Lattisaw had not preserved the issue for review by failing to specify what course of action he wanted the trial court to pursue. Second, the court determined that, on the merits, Kiefer\u2019s verbal addendum \u201cwith reluctance\u201d did not repudiate her verdict of guilty, and that the jury\u2019s verdict was indeed unanimous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">We granted certiorari to consider the novel issue raised in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">As a threshold contention, the State again maintains that Lattisaw has not preserved the defective verdict issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>for appellate review. Maryland Rule 4-323(c) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\">\u201cFor purposes of review by the trial court or on appeal of any other ruling or order, it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order is made or sought, makes known to the court the action that the party desires the court to take or the objection to the action of the court. The grounds for the objection need not be stated unless these rules expressly provide otherwise or the court so directs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The State points out that when the court inquired \u201c[w]hat is your motion,\u201d Lattisaw\u2019s counsel responded \u201cI don\u2019t have any idea.\u201d On this premise, the State argues, and the Court of Special Appeals agreed, that Lattisaw failed to apprise the trial court of the action he wished it to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">We do not read Rule 4-323(c) so narrowly. Lattisaw\u2019s counsel stated to the trial court, \u201cI would like to know what reluctance means.\u201d When the court expressed its tentative position that a juror\u2019s reluctance does not matter, Lattisaw\u2019s counsel, although interrupted by the court, sufficiently indicated his disagreement with the court\u2019s view. In so doing, he made known his \u201cobjection to the action of the court,\u201d which is all that Rule 4-323(c) requires. We will therefore consider the question of whether Lattisaw\u2019s guilty verdict was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">By its Declaration of Rights, common law, and procedural rules, Maryland continues an English tradition dating from the Middle Ages in requiring that criminal jury verdicts be unanimous. <em>See Apodaca v. Oregon, </em>406 U.S. 404, 92 S.Ct. 1628, 32 L.Ed.2d 184 (1972). Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights specifies, \u201cThat in all criminal prosecutions, every man hath a right ... to a speedy trial by an impartial jury, without whose unanimous consent he ought not to be found guilty.\u201d In <em>Ford v. State, </em>12 Md. 514, 549 (1859), the Court said: <em>\u201cUnanimity </em>is indispensable to the sufficiency of the verdict....\u201d (Emphasis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>original.) And Maryland Rule 4-327(a) specifies that \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury shall be unanimous and shall be returned in open court.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Given the firmness of the unanimity requirement, Maryland also affords criminal defendants an absolute right to poll their juries. <em>Smith v. State, </em>299 Md. 158, 165, 472 A.2d 988 (1984). Polling, we said in <em>Smith, </em>\u201cprovides a means of establishing that the verdict was with the unanimous consent of the jurors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166, 472 A.2d 988.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the jurors are polled, we have specified that \u201c \u2018[t]he assent of each juror [polled] must be free and unqualified.' \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167, 472 A.2d 988, quoting L. Hochheimer, <em>The Law of Crimes and Criminal Procedure </em>(2d ed. 1904) \u00a7 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">No Maryland case has ever presented the situation in which a juror\u2019s equivocal response to a poll calls into question the unanimity of a verdict. However, we have stated that where a jury\u2019s verdict as a whole</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A80\">\u201cis ambiguous, inconsistent, unresponsive, or otherwise defective, it is the duty of the trial judge to call the jury\u2019s attention to the defect and to direct them to put the verdict in proper form either in the presence of the court or by returning to their consultation room for the purpose of further deliberation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-7\"><em>Heinze v. State, </em>184 Md. 613, 617, 42 A.2d 128 (1945); see <em>also Glickman v. State, </em>190 Md. 516, 525, 60 A.2d 216 (1948); <em>Smith, supra, </em>299 Md. at 170, 472 A.2d 988. As the State concedes, a trial judge\u2019s duty to take corrective action must also apply when the verdict of an individual juror is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>ambiguous or otherwise defective, for it takes but one juror to threaten the constitutional requirement of a unanimous verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The controversy in this case focuses upon whether Kiefer, in responding to the jury poll, was ambiguous in announcing her verdict. The State maintains that such a determination must remain within the trial court\u2019s discretion since it is in a unique position to observe the juror\u2019s demeanor and tone of voice in responding to the poll. We agree, as do the vast majority of other jurisdictions. <em>See </em>Annot., \u201cJuror\u2019s Reluctant, Equivocal, or Conditional Assent to Verdict, On Polling, as Ground for Mistrial or New Trial in Criminal Case,\u201d 25 A.L.R.3d 1149 (1969, Cum.Supp. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The State further contends, however, that in the instant case the trial court found there to be no ambiguity in Kiefer\u2019s response, \u201cYes, with reluctance,\u201d and that we should respect that finding as not clearly erroneous. In the circumstances of this case, we cannot agree. At the bench conference, the trial court\u2019s first reaction to Kiefer\u2019s statement was \u201cWhat does reluctance mean?\u201d By itself, the court\u2019s instinctive uncertainty strongly suggests that the juror\u2019s response was ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">More importantly, the response, \u201cYes, with reluctance,\u201d is demonstrably ambiguous in this case, where the record indicates that Kiefer was upset and shaking her head and that the trial court recognized that there was \u201csome reluctance on her part.\u201d While there is no telling exactly why Kiefer was reluctant, one distinct possibility, among many, is that she was genuinely uncertain as to the fact of Lattisaw\u2019s guilt and may have assented to the verdict despite serious misgivings as to its correctness. If Kiefer\u2019s reluctance went to the accuracy of the verdict itself, then her assent to the finding of guilt was not, in Hochheimer\u2019s words, \u201cfree and unqualified.\u201d Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in failing to take appropriate account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>of Kiefer\u2019s ambiguous response, which, left unexplored, cast doubt upon the unanimity of the verdict. <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>325 Md. 511, 520, 601 A.2d 1093 (1992) (\u201cThe failure to exercise discretion when its exercise is called for is an abuse of discretion.\u201d). Indeed, the trial court was clearly in error in believing that it had no discretion <em>at all </em>when it said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what else you can do.... I don\u2019t know anything else to ask her. I don\u2019t think it would be proper for me to ask her what reluctance means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">To cure the ambiguity in Kiefer\u2019s verdict, the trial court may have employed either of two options. The safest course would be for the court to send the jury out for further deliberations in accordance with Maryland Rule 4-327(e), <em>supra, </em>with the simple instruction that their verdict must be unanimous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Alternatively, the trial court may attempt to clarify the juror\u2019s ambiguous response by questioning the juror directly. In doing so, however, the court must be careful not to influence or coerce the juror\u2019s decision during the course of the questioning. As the Supreme Court has said, \u201c \u2018The influence of the trial judge on the jury is necessarily and properly of great weight,\u2019 and jurors are ever watchful of the words that fall from him.\u201d <em>Bollenbach v. United States, </em>326 U.S. 607, 612, 66 S.Ct. 402, 405, 90 L.Ed. 350 (1945), quoting <em>Starr v. United States, </em>153 U.S. 614, 626, 14 S.Ct. 919, 923, 38 L.Ed. 841 (1894). And we have warned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq3\">\u201c[t]he law does not permit the judge to suggest the alteration of a verdict in substance. He must not throw the weight of his influence into the deliberations of the jury as to matters exclusively within their province.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-8\"><em>Heinze, supra, </em>184 Md. at 618, 42 A.2d 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>We believe, however, that a limited exchange for the sole purpose of clarifying a juror\u2019s ambiguous response may be productive in averting unwarranted further deliberation and delay, where the juror in fact concurs with the verdict once the ambiguity is resolved. In <em>State v. Frederick, </em>783 S.W.2d 469 (Mo.App.1990), for example, the court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">\u201cQuestioning about a juror\u2019s verdict by a trial judge in open court \u2018need not be inherently coercive.\u2019 The reviewing court must distinguish between a court\u2019s effort to eliminate confusion and its attempt to compel an answer. The trial court errs if it continues to question a juror only after that juror\u2019s answers clearly evince disagreement with the verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 472, quoting <em>State v. Jackson, </em>522 S.W.2d 317, 322 (Mo.App.1975). <em>See also State v. Hatch, </em>724 S.W.2d 643, 645 (Mo.App.1986) (\u201cthe trial judge may make inquiry in a genteel, polite, non-leading and non-coercive manner that will clarify a juror\u2019s response\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">We emphasize, as the court in <em>Frederick </em>observed, that a court does not clarify an ambiguous response by compelling an end to the ambiguity. For a trial court to demand a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer ordinarily is improper compulsion. <em>See e.g. United States v. McCoy, </em>429 F.2d 739 (D.C.Cir.1970); <em>State v. Bell, </em>13 Conn.App. 420, 537 A.2d 496 (1988); <em>Rhodes v. State, </em>290 Ark. 60, 716 S.W.2d 758 (1986); <em>People v. Kellogg, </em>77 Ill.2d 524, 34 Ill.Dec. 163, 397 N.E.2d 835 (1979). A court may only attempt to root out the source of the juror\u2019s ambiguous response in order to determine whether it is material to the unanimity of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Our holding in this case necessitates a new trial. A limited remand under the provisions of Maryland Rule 8-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>604(d) would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CALVERT COUNTY FOR A NEW TRIAL; COSTS IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AND IN THIS COURT TO BE PAID BY THE COUNTY COMMISSIONER OF CALVERT COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-10\">.
