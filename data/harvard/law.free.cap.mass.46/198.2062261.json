Tamerlane Burt, (Seal).\u201d No seal was affixed to the instrument, but the word \u2018 seal \u2019 was added to the defendant\u2019s name, and was encircled with a line of the pen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-9\">At the trial in the court of common pleas, before <em>Strong, </em>J. the defendant contended that the instrument was under seal, and objected to its being admitted in evidence to support the action of assumpsit. This objection was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-10\">The defendant then offered evidence that said instrument was given in consequence of the recovery of a judgment against himself, Luther Babbitt, Gilbert W. Strange and Asa Paul, in an action of John Sikes, at the March term, 1840, of the superior court for Tyrrel county, North Carolina ; that in the trial of said action, the present plaintiff was a material witness foi said Sikes, both as to the maintenance of the action and the amount of damages, and yet that, at the time of said trial, he had purchased and was the owner of the subject matter of said action; and that the present defendant, at the time of his executing the instrument now in suit, did not know nor suspect that the interest in the said judgment, or that the interest, at the time of said trial, in the subject matter of said action, was in the present plaintiff. This evidence was not admitted. There was evidence that John Sikes of North Carolina, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>the term above mentioned of the superior court of that State, recovered judgment, in two actions of trespass for cutting his wood and timber, against the present defendant and the three other persons abovenamed ; that said Luther Babbitt, alone or in connexion with said Asa Paul, was charged with the defence of said actions \u2014 the present defendant being then in Massachusetts ; that the present defendant, soon after said judgment was recovered, went to North Carolina, and executed the instrument now in suit, which was for half the amount of said judgment\u2014being the portion of himself and said Gilbert W. Strange \u2014 which instrument was intended as satisfaction of said judgment, so far as said Strange and the present defendant were concerned ; and that the present plaintiff then and there acknowledged, in writing, that he had received of the present defendant <em>\u201c </em>$2712.50, the one half of a judgment recovered against Babbitt, Burt, Paul and Strange, in favor of John Sikes,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-5\">The defendant objected that this evidence did not show a sufficient consideration for the instrument declared on, and that the same was without consideration. The plaintiff then offered evidence to prove that said Sikes assigned said judgment to ln\u00a1\u00a1n before said instrument was executed ; and the judge stated, that if such assignment should be proved to have been so made,\\ there would be a sufficient consideration for the instrument de=\\ dared on. The evidence was received, and the counsel for the defendant <em>\u201c </em>declined going to the jury upon the question whether there was such an assignment before the instrument declared on was executed.\u201d Whereupon the jury, under the direction of the judge, found a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant alleged exceptions to said rulings and directions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b207-6\">Holmes, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ2\">1.

The first exception is, that the writing on which the action is founded appears to be a sealed instrument, and consequently that the action should have been an action of debt or covenant. But this does not appear by the writing produced in evidence. According to the common law, and the law of this Commonwealth, this is not a writing under seal, nor is it placed on the same footing with specialties or contracts under seal. If the law of North Carolina, where the contract was made, be otherwise, it should have been proved. Such proof, however, would not avail the defendant, it being a well settled rule of law, that in deciding a question as to the form of action for the breach of a contract made in a foreign state or nation, the <em>lex fori </em>and not the <em>lex loci contractus </em>must govern. <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>5 Johns. 239. <em>Pearsall </em>v. <em>Dwight, </em>2 Mass. 90. <em>Bank of United States </em>v. <em>Donnally, </em>8 Pet. 361. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Herriot, </em>4 Cow. 508. <em>Don </em>v. <em>Lippmann, </em>5 Clark <em>&amp; </em>Fin. 1. <em>Trasher </em>v. <em>Everhart, </em>3 Gill &amp; Johns. 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">/ Another exception is, that the evidence offered by the defendant to prove the invalidity of the judgment, for the discharge of which in part the contract in question was made, was illegally excluded. As the defendant was a party to that judgment, it is very clear, we think, that he cannot collaterally impeach it in this action. The case of <em>Homer </em>v. <em>Fish, </em>1 Pick. 435, and the cases there cited, are. decisive on this point. If that judgment was fraudulently obtained, the defendant\u2019s remedy is by application to the court, that rendered it, to vacate it. And if by the laws of North Carolina it may be vacated by a writ of review or otherwise, the defendant will not be deprived of his remedy, by the plaintiff\u2019s recovery against him in the present action. Considering that judgment as valid, it cannot be doubted that the discharge of it in part was a good consideration for the contract in suit. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
