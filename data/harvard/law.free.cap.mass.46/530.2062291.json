The defendant was convicted, in the court of common pleas, in the county of Bristol, March term, 1842, of stealing from a dwellinghouse property of less value than $ 100, and was sentenced to two days\u2019 solitary imprisonment, and confinement afterwards at hard labor, for the term of eighteen months, in the state prison, to commence from and after the expiration of a former sentence\u00b0of two days\u2019 solitary imprisonment, and two years\u2019 confinement at hard labor, awarded against him by the same court at the same term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-7\">The error assigned was, that the indictment, on which the judgment was founded, set out no offence above simple larceny, and that the judgment was therefore excessive and illegal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-8\"><em>G.

A judgment void in part must be wholly reversed. This court cannot award a new sentence, nor send the case back to the court of common pleas for correction there. <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Met. 419. <em>The Queen </em>v. <em>Hartnett, </em>Jebb\u2019s Cr.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEe\">It was urged by the Attorney General, that case is distinguishable from all former cases, in this particular , that in this case the convict has not yet suffered any thing from the erroneous judgment, as he has not yet completed his sentence under the first judgment. The term of imprisonment under the second sentence not having yet commenced, it is contended that the prisoner can now be sentenced, either in this court, or in the court of common pleas, and that on reversal of this judgment, such judgment may now be rendered as the court below should have rendered. But on the best consideration we can give it, we perceive no substantial ground to distinguish this from the former cases, where judgments have been reversed, in which it was held that no new judgment could be given by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In the first place, it is very clear, and indeed it is conceded, that the judgment is erroneous in imposing a longer sentence, in a case of simple larceny, than the law would warrant. <em>Hopkins </em>v. Commonwealth, 3 Met. 460. The judgment, therefore, must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">What further can this court do ? It has already been held, that it is not competent for the court to reverse in part where the judgment is entire, nor to enter up such judgment as the court below ought to have entered. The fact, that the convict has yet suffered no part of the, sentence on the erroneous judgment, does not vary the case in principle. If one has suffered a part of the sentence awarded by an erroneous judgment, it may add weight to the reasons why a new judgment should not be pronounced, if it were a new and original question; but it is not the legal reason on which the rule rests, and that rule is now established by precedent and practice. <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 2 </em>Met. 419. Whatever other remedy the Commonwealth may have, we think it is not competent for this court to call the party in and pronounce a new sentence, nor to remit the case to the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
