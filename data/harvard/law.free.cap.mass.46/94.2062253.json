The note bore date July 20th 1840, and was made payable to the plaintiff, or his order, in four months after date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-9\">It was agreed by the parties, that the writ was made on the 23d of November 1840, after sunset, and was put into an officer\u2019s hands the next day, when it was served.

The defendant could not have tendered payment after sunset of the last day of grace. Bac. Ab. Rent. I. Tender, D. <em>Savary </em>v. <em>Goe, </em>3 Wash. C. C. 140. The plaintiff might therefore well commence this action, as soon as the time, within which a tender could be made, had expired. A plea of tender on the last day would be bad; it should be alleged to have been made on the last convenient hour of the day. But in case of negotiable notes, the maker is not entitled to the whole of the last day to tender payment. <em>Shed </em>v. <em>Brett, </em>1 Pick. 401. <em>Church </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>21 Pick. 310. <em>City Bank </em>v. <em>Cutter, </em>3 Pick. 418.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-12\">The action may be regarded as <em>commenced </em>when the writ was given to the officer. <em>Seaver </em>v. <em>Lincoln, </em>21 Pick. 267.
