Cad-mus, in Bangor, where he left his family, while he went to New York, in May or June 1836 ; that, when he returned from New York, he took his family to Belfast, where he remained some weeks, and returned to Bangor, in August 1836, and \u201c stopped at Cadmus\u2019s \u201d ; that he afterwards took his family to Portsmouth in New Hampshire : That the defendant, in the spring of 1836, \u201c had a bond of the Bowdoin College townships, and was trying to effect a sale of them ; and was back and forth, part of the time here,\u201d [at Bangor,J \u201cand part of it in Boston, part of it in New York and other places, attempting to make sale ot said townships : \u201d That m 1836, the defendant\u2019s papers were left in the counting room of the deponent, and his brother Robert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>M. N. Smyth, in Bangor, where the defendant \u201cusually did his writing, when in Bangor ; \u201d and that the deponent knew \u201cof no other place of business, he had, except there, in Bangor, in 1836 : \u201d That all the defendant\u2019s papers were left in the deponent\u2019s care and kept in the deponent\u2019s desk, and were not removed until late in the autumn of 1836 : That when the defendant went to Belfast, as above mentioned, the deponent \u201cunderstood him that it was uncertain whether he should come back or not.

The case is <em>sui generis. </em>The defendant had no fixed residence, and nobody in Bangor could tell where he was, or where his domicil or place of business was, on the 26th of July 1836. The question of diligence is settled by the circumstances' of each particular case. <em>Williams v. Bank of U. States, </em>2 Pet. 102. Chit, on Bills, (Amer. ed. of 1809,) 201, 202. Bayley on Bills, (1st Amer. ed.) 180. <em>Sturges </em>v. <em>Derrick, </em>Wightw. 76. <em>Eagle Bank </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>3 Pick. 180 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>It should have been left to the jury to decide whether due dili gence had been used to find out the defendant\u2019s place of residence. <em>Bateman </em>v. <em>Joseph, </em>12 East, 433.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-5\">If the defendant had been a resident of Bangor, the notice, left in the post office there, might not have been sufficient to charge him. But if the plaintiffs were not bound to give any notice, that which they did give cannot harm them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-6\">JV. J. <em>Lord, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-E\">The evidence shows that the defendant\u2019s residence was in Bangor, when the note fell due. If so, then the notice, put into the post office, was insufficient. Bayley on Bills, (2d Amer. ed.) 277, and cases cited in <em>note </em>(q). <em>Stephenson </em>v. <em>Primrose, </em>8 Porter, 155. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>3 Alab. 34. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Gowen, </em>and <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Jackman, </em>1 Appleton, 447, 467.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-7\">The evidence would not have warranted a jury to find that due diligence was used to ascertain the defendant\u2019s residence. <em>Beveridge </em>v. <em>Burgis, </em>3 Campb. 262. By the law of Maine, where this note was made and was dishonored, the holders, if they did not know the defendant\u2019s place of residence, were bound to inquire of the other parties to the note. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Varrell, </em>3 Greenl. 233. And they cannot recover in this State, without doing all that was necessary to entitle them to recover in Maine. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>1 Met. 82.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b363-8\">Shaw, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARL\">This was assumpsit by the indorsees against the Indorser of a promissory note, payable in one year from date. The question is, whether the indorser had due notice of the dishonor of the note, by a notice in writing addressed to him at Bangor, by the notary public, and deposited in the post office at that place.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">We are satisfied by the evidence, which is submitted and made part of the case, that the defendant, at the time this note became due, had his domicil and also a place of business in Bangor, and that by the use of reasonable diligence, this might have been ascertained ; and that the notary made no inquiries of the other parties to the note, or otherwise used due diligence to ascertain the residence of the indorser.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">The only remaining question then is, whether notice by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>post office was sufficient. The <em>general rule </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> certainly is, that when the indorser resides in the same place, with the party who is to give the notice, the notice must be given to the party per sonally, or at his domicil, or place of business'. <em>Ireland </em>v. <em>Kip, </em>10 Johns. 490, and 11 Johns. 231. <em>Smedes </em>v. <em>Utica Bank, </em>20 Johns. 372. <em>Lindenberger </em>v. <em>Beall, </em>6 Wheat. 104. <em>Shedd </em>v. <em>Brett, </em>1 Pick. 401. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Gowen, </em>1 Appleton, 447. <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>1 Connect. 329. Perhaps a different rule may prevail in London, where a penny post is established and regulated by law, by whom letters are to be delivered to the party addressed, or at his place of domicil or business, on the same day they are deposited. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Lifford, </em>9 East, 347. And perhaps the same rule might not apply, where the party to whom notice is to be given lives in the same town, if it be at a distinct village or settlement, where a town is large, and there are several post offices in the different parts of it. But of this we give no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">In the present case, the defendant had his residence and place of business in the city of Bangor, and the only notice given him was by a letter, addressed to him at Bangor, and deposited in the post office at that place. And we are of opinion that this was insufficient to charge him as indorser</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\n<em>Nonsuit confirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"pA7q\"> See <em>Eagle Bank at Providence </em>v. <em>Hathaway, ante, </em>212.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
