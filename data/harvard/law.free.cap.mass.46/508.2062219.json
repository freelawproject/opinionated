The state constitution, Part II. c. 2, \u00a7 1, art. 9, requires that all judicial officers shall be nominated and appointed by the governor, by and with the advice and consent of the council. And the 8th article of amendment forbids the judges of the court of common pleas to hold any other state office, except that of justice of the peace and militia offices. But <em>St. </em>1843, c. 7, \u00a7 1, (under which jurisdiction was assumed in this case,) enacts that all the duties of the judge of the municipal court shall be performed by the justices of the common pleas, or some one of them. The municipal court, however, still exists, and, by \u00a7 3, its powers, duties and jurisdiction are continued. The office of judge of the municipal court still exists, and, if filled by a judge of the common pleas, is unconstitutionally filled. Or if that office is by implication abolished, yet the judge of the common pleas had no authority, <em>virtute officii, </em>to award the sentence in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-7\">What is the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d of the municipal court, which the statute declares shall \u201c continue the same as now prescribed by law\u201d?

Sts. c. 81, \u00a7 17 ; c. 82, \u00a7\u00a7 25, 34 ; and <em>c. </em>86, \u00a7 4 ; that court has jurisdiction, concurrently with the supreme judicial court, of all offences, not capital, committed in this county. This jurisdiction is exclusive of that of the com <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>mon pleas ; and as to the matter of jurisdiction, the legislature might have ordered any man in the Commonwealth to perform the duties of the judge of the municipal court, as rightfully as they have ordered the justices of the common pleas to perform them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-5\">The office of judge of the municipal court still exists, and the governor may appoint a successor to the late incumbent. The Rev. Sts. c. 86, \u00a7 1, direct, that when a vacancy occurs m that office, it shall be filled. This direction is not repealed by <em>St. </em>1843, c. 7, nor is the office thereby abolished. Its duties are required to be performed by others. But the functions of an office may be transferred, and yet the office remain. <em>Hoke </em>v.

And there are numerous statutes, transferring judicial power from one officer to another. By <em>St. </em>1821, c. 109, all the judicial authority of justices of the peace for the county of Suffolk was confer\u00ed eo on the justices\u2019 court for that county ; and this statute was adjudged to be constitutional. <em>Wales </em>v. <em>Belcher, </em>3 Pick. 508. By <em>St. </em>1799, c. 81, the criminal jurisdiction of the court of sessions in Suffolk was transferred to the municipal court; and by <em>St. </em>1812, c. 133, jurisdiction of all offences not capital was given to the latter court, concurrently with the supreme court. By <em>St. </em>1803, c. 154, and 1809, c. 18, the powers and duties of the courts of sessions were transferred to the court of common pleas. By <em>St. </em>1813, c. 173, the powers and duties of the circuit court of common pleas within this county were conferred upon the Boston court of common pleas. By <em>St. </em>1820, c. 79, the circuit and Boston courts of common pleas were abolished, and the present court substituted. The <em>St. </em>of 1827, <em>c. </em>118, a\u2014Jhorized the municipal court to award the additional punishments which, by <em>St. </em>1817, <em>c. 176, were to be </em>awarded by the supreme court. And numerous other statutes might be cited, to show the exercise, by the legislature, of their authority to modify the subordinate courts, and transfer their powers and duties, as the public good has seemed to require. And none of them have been held to be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b520-6\">The objection, that the legislature cannot appoint a judge, is no more applicable to the case at bar, than to the cases in which the judges of the common pleas were required by statute to perform the duties of the court of sessions. Yet it has been decided that those judges had jurisdiction of offences formerly cognizable by the court of sessions.

The case, it will be perceived, presents the very grave question, whether the justices of the court of common pleas can perform the duties and exercise the functions in criminal matters, in the county of Suffolk, that have heretofore been discharged by the judge of the municipal court of the city of Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The <em>St. </em>of 1843, <em>c. </em>7, \u00a7 1, provides, that \u201c all the duties, now required by law to be performed by the judge of the municipal court of the city of Boston, shall hereafter be performed, within and for the county of Suffolk, by the justices of the court of common pleas, or some one of them.\u201d Sect. 5 further provides, that \u201c all indictments, now pending or before said municipal court, shall be heard and acted upon by one of the justices of the court of common pleas sitting as aforesaid as judge of said municipal court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The legislature have by this statute, in terms, authorized the jurisdiction assumed in the present case ; and the only inquiry is, whether this enactment is in violation of any of the provisions of the constitution of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">That the legislature have full power to change the criminal jurisdiction, and transfer the same from one court to another, is not denied. Great and important changes in this respect have been made from time to time, and particularly by <em>St. </em>1812, c. 133, which gave enlarged jurisdiction to the municipal court, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>by <em>St. 1832, c. </em>130, which vested in the court of common pleas original jurisdiction of all offences of which the supreme judicial court previously had jurisdiction, except crimes punishable with death.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">But it is contended, that although it might be fully competent to the legislature to transfer to the justices of the court of common pleas the entire criminal jurisdiction throughout the Commonwealth, yet the duties must nevertheless be performed by such justices, under the name and style of justices of the court of common pleas. It is said that if jurisdiction is conferred upon them by force of <em>St. </em>1843, c. 7, it is by making them judges of the municipal court, and thus conferring upon them a new office, in violation of the provisions of the eighth article of amendment of the constitution of the Commonwealth, which is in these words : \u201c Judges of the court of common pleas shall hold no other office under the government of this Commonwealth, the office of justice of the peace and militia offices excepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">This leads to the inquiry, whether the justices of the c-ourt of common pleas do in fact, by force of the statute under consideration, hold an office additional to that of judges of the common pleas ? The office, if any such has been conferred upon them, is a judicial office ; but a new judicial office could only be conferred by a commission from the governor, upon a nomination made by him and approved by the council, in the manner prescribed by the constitution. The legislature, by an ordinary legislative act, cannot appoint judicial officers. They may create judicial offices, leaving them to be filled by appointments made pursuant to the constitution. In fact, therefore, the only judicial office held by the presiding judge at the time of the rendition of the judgment, and the awarding of the sentence now sought to be reversed by this writ of error, was that of chief justice of the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">From this view of the case, it clearly results, that the constitutional objection, supposed to arise from the provision that the judges of the court of common pleas shall hold no other office, does not in fact exist here.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">The ground of objection to the jurisdiction exercised bv the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>court of common pleas, which is more relied upon, is, that the municipal court of the city of Boston is still in existence, as a separate judicial tribunal, having criminal jurisdiction, and, as such, should have its presiding judge, regularly appointed and commissioned as municipal judge. If this position can be maintained, of course this judgment and award of sentence was without authority of law, and ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In looking at the various provisions of <em>St. </em>1843, c. 7, some of them will be found to be indicative of a purpose to continue, to some extent, a municipal court. By \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 7, the name, style and caption are retained, and all precepts are to be under the seal of the municipal court. These provisions present objections which, though not insuperable, yet are certainly entitled to some consideration. They do, to some extent, seem to indicate a separate court, distinct from and independent of the court of common pleas.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> But when we find that all the duties, required by law to be performed by the judge of the municipal court, are, by the very terms of the act, \u00a7 1, required hereafter to be performed by the justices of the court of common pleas, or by some one of them, we may properly consider whether these provisions a= to the name, style and seal of the court, may not be reconciled with the general object and purpose of the act, and thereby avoid a construction which would render the whole act nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The principle of exercising the criminal jurisdiction of the court of common pleas, distinct from its duties in civil suits, has been long known in practice. In some of the larger counties, distinct terms are by law established for the criminal business of that court; and at the terms established for either civil or criminal business, the court has no jurisdiction over cases of a different character. At the terms for criminal business, they are judges in criminal cases exclusively; as much so as when sitting to do the duties of judge in the municipal court in the city of Boston. See Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>82, \u00a7\u00a7 41-43. <em>St. </em>1839, c. 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Now it seems to us, that the provisions above alluded to, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>which are thought to present some objection to the crin inal jurisdiction in the county of Suffolk, exercised by the court of common pleas, may fairly and reasonably be treated as provisions designed only to make the criminal jurisdiction of that court in the county of Suffolk distinct in its terms and places of sitting, in its records and all its proceedings, carrying out, substantially, the same provisions as now exist by law and in practice in the counties of Worcester and Middlesex, but in a form certainly not so free from objections, as are the acts regulating criminal trials in those counties. We think the <em>St. </em>of 1843, c. 7, must be understood and construed as a general and entire transfer to the court of common pleas of all criminal matters which had heretofore been cognizable by the judge of the municipal court; and therefore, if an appointment could now be made of a municipal judge, for the reason that the office has not been specially abrogated, yet the individual holding such office would exist, as a judge, in name only, and without any authority or jurisdiction. It seems, however, to result from the considerations we have suggested, that the office of judge of the municipal court was virtually abrogated by the act transferring its duties to the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The result to which we have come is, therefore, that the act in question does not violate the constitutional provision contained in the amendments to the constitution, art. 8, and is not void for that cause : And as to the second point, that the act does abolish the office of judge of the municipal court, as a distinct and independent office, and transfers the jurisdiction of that court to the justices of the court of common pleas, separating all proceedings by the court of common pleas, in criminal matters, wholly from the civil jurisdiction exercised by that court in the county of Suffolk.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\"> By <em>St. </em>1844, c. 44, \u00a7 2, it is enacted, that \u201c the seal of the said municipal court shall in all cases be the same as that of the court of common pleas of said Com monwealth.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
