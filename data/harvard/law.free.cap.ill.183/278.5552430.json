He prayed said board to review his said assessment list of personal property, and that upon such review they might find said credits of $118,000 held by him in the State of Iowa were not taxable, under the laws of this State, in this State. On August 2, 1899, the board of review of that county, upon a hearing and consideration of said petition, overruled the same and determined to retain said $118,000 as a part of the assessment against appellant for the year 1899, and the question here presented for determination is whether or not those credits for $118,000, held and possessed by appellant in the State of Iowa, for moneys loaned and debts due him by citizens of that State, are taxable against appellant in this State.</p> <p id=\"b281-5\" pgmap=\"281\">By paragraph 4 of section 35 of an act entitled \u201cAn act for the assessment of property and providing the means therefor, and to repeal a certain act therein named,\u201d approved February 25,1898, provision is made for the clerk of the board of review to certify to the Auditor certain cases where the whole property is not liable to taxation, upon which, if the Auditor objects to the decision of the board of review of any particular county, .he may advise the board of his objection to its decision, and give notice thereto that he will apply to the Supreme Court, specifying to what term thereof, for an order to set aside and remove the decision of such board. It is therein further provided that if the board of review shall decide that property claimed to be exempt is liable to be taxed, and the party aggrieved at the time shall pray an appeal, a brief statement in the case shall be made by the' clerk, under the direction of the board, and transmitted to the Auditor, who shall present the case to the Supreme Court in like manner. Under this latter provision the case is presented to this court as to whether the $118,000 belonging to appellant, included in his assessment list of $144,000, is liable to taxation in the State of Illinois.</p> <p id=\"b281-6\" pgmap=\"281(130) 282(77)\">The actual situsrof personal property having an actual and tangible existence, under the legislation of this State, will determine the town or district in which it maybe taxed. (Rev. Stat. chap. 120, sec. 8.) The general rule is, that personal property of a tangible character is to be assessed where situated, without reference to the domicile of the owner. Debts and choses in action are a species of intangible property that, for purposes of taxation, are generally held to be situated at the domicile of the owner. A debt owing to a person is evidenced by an account, note, bond or other promise of the debtor, and is a mere chose in action, which goes with the person of the creditor, and can be properly assessed, under the great weight of authority, only in the county where the owner resides. A debt has no situs other than the domicile of the owner. It cannot be taxed to the debtor, for in such case it would not be a tax on property or wealth, but would be a tax on the converse and a tax on poverty. The debtor may be in one State and the creditor and security for the debt in another.</p> <p id=\"b282-3\" pgmap=\"282\">It was held in Railroad Co. v. Pennsylvania, 15 Wall. 300: \u201cDebts owing by corporations, like debts owing by individuals, are not property of the debtor, in any sense. They are the obligations of the debtors, and only possess value, in the hands of the creditors. With them they are property, and in their hands may be taxed. To call debts property of the debtors is a misuser of terms. All the property there can be, in the nature of things, in debts of corporations belongs to the creditors to whom they are payable, and follows their domicile, wherever that may be. Their debts can have no locality separate from the parties to whom they are due. This principle might be .stated in many different ways and supported by citations from numerous adjudications, but no number of authorities and no forms of expression could add anything to its obvious truth, which is recognized upon its simple statement. The bonds of the railroad company in this case are undoubtedly property, byt property in the hands of the holders and not property of the obligators. So far as they are held by non-residents of the State they are property beyond the jurisdiction of the State.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b282-4\" pgmap=\"282(86) 283(72)\">In Davenport v. Mississippi and Missouri Railroad Co. 12 Iowa, 539, the question arose before the Supreme Court of Iowa whether mortgages on property in that State held by non-residents could be taxed under a law which provided that all property, real and personal, within the State should be subject to taxation, and the court said: \u201cBoth in law and equity the mortgagee has only a chattel interest. It is true that the situs of the property mortgaged is within the.jurisdiction of the State; but, the mortgage itself being personal property,-a chose in action attaches to the person of the owner. It is agreed by the parties that the owners and holders of the mortgages are non-residents of the State. If so, and the property of the mortgage attaches to the person of the owner, it follows that these mortgages are not property within the State, and if not they are not subject of taxation.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b283-3\" pgmap=\"283\">In Johnson v. City Council of Oregon City, 3 Ore. 13, it was held that intangible property not growing out of real estate must be held to follow the person of the owner, and that notes and other choses in action belonging to citizens resident in Oregon City are liable to taxation under the charter of that city. The language-used was: \u201cIntangible property not growing out of real estate must be held to follow the person of the owner. Instead of depending on the whereabouts of the evidence of the ownership, the locality of this class of property must, in general, depend upon the locality of him whose personal property it is. \u201d</p> <p id=\"b283-4\" pgmap=\"283\">In Hunter v. Supervisors of Page County, 33 Iowa, 376, it appeared that a resident of Iowa deposited for safe keeping in Illinois promissory notes for \u00a77000 that were never brought into Iowa. They were held liable to be taxed in Iowa. It was held: \u201cIt is not the notes, as such, that are taxed, \u2014 it is the debt. Notes are mere evidences of the debt. The right to money due being in the resident of Iowa, the property must, of necessity, be at the place where he resides, irrespective of the situs of the evidence.\u201d To the same effect are McKeen v. Northampton County, 49 Pa. St. 519, and Worthington v. Sebastian, 25 Ohio, 1.</p> <p id=\"b283-5\" pgmap=\"283(62) 284(32)\">The weight of authority is that money loaned in another State or county, in the absence of a statute to the contrary, is taxable in the State or county where the owner or creditor resides, and not in that of the debtor, and that the debt follows the residence of the creditor and has its situs there. That principle, applicable generally to the taxation of this character of property, has in this case added strength when it appears that in the State of Iowa it is held that such is the rule.</p> <p id=\"b284-3\" pgmap=\"284\">The principle that where the owner of credits resides in this State there is jurisdiction over his person and over his credits, which, in law, accompany him and have a situs here for taxation, is sustained by Goldgart v. People ex rel. 106 Ill. 25, People v. Davis, 112 id. 272, and Cooper v. Beers, 143 id. 25.</p> <p id=\"b284-4\" pgmap=\"284\">It was clearly proper to list for taxation the credit for $118,000 included in the list of the appellant. The action of the board of review is approved and held valid.</p> <p id=\"b284-5\" pgmap=\"284\">Action approved.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
