It is further agreed that the said Charles R. Truitt shall use his personal influence and the influence of the Sentinel to secure the appointment of the said Homer J. Clark as postmaster at the city of Pontiac, Illinois, or any other appointive office under the present republican national administration, and to use his efforts to secure for the said Homer J. Clark railroad transportation on account of the Sentinel during one year from the date of this contract, said Clark being allowed to retain pass on Toledo, Peoria and Western Railroad Company, and also to have such mileage on the Wabash and Illinois Central railroads as said Truitt can spare.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-5\" pgmap=\"241\">\u201cIt is further agreed and understood by and between the parties to this contract, as a part of the consideration of the sale of the Pontiac Sentinel plant to the said Charles R.

The bill concludes with the prayer that appellee be decreed to accept the consideration tendered him, as provided by the terms of the contract, and transfer to appell ant said one-half interest in said Sentinel plant, or, failing to do so, he be decreed to transfer the whole of said Sentinel plant back to appellant upon the surrender of the consideration received by appellant therefor. An injunction was also asked for to restrain appellee from disposing of or encumbering the property described in the bill. An amendment to the bill was afterwards filed, setting up more fully the manner in which appellant had complied with the provisions of the contract.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\" pgmap=\"242\">The bill as amended was demurred to by appellee for want of equity, and the demurrer was overruled by the court. Appellee elected to stand by his demurrer, and thereupon the court entered a decree directing that appellee, within five days after the payment or tender to him by appellant of the consideration provided for by the contract, transfer to the latter one-half interest in the Pontiac Sentinel business plant, consisting of good will, subscription list, material and machinery; that appellee admit appellant to an equal partnership in the conduct of the business and profits of said Pontiac Sentinel newspaper and job printing plant, and that upon the failure of appellee to comply with the requirements of the decree, he be held in contempt of court. It was further decreed that the injunction which had been theretofore issued be continued pending the carrying into effect of the requirements of the decree. To reverse the decree appellee appealed to the Appellate Court, where the decree was reversed and the cause was remanded, with directions to sustain the demurrer, dissolve the injunction and dismiss the bill. To reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court the complainant in the bill appealed to this court.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-6\" pgmap=\"242\">A. C.

Where the contract requires a party to give his time, skill, attention or services of any kind, an enforcement of it upon an unwilling party would require the court to manage the partnership, which alone is reason for refusing to grant relief, beside being productive of no benefit to the other party.

Smith, 29 Mich. 166.</p> <opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b244-7\" pgmap=\"244\">Mr. Justice Craig</author> <p id=\"AyU\" pgmap=\"244\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p> <p id=\"b244-8\" pgmap=\"244(66) 245(208)\">The object of the bill in this case was to enforce the specific performance of that portion of the contract which provided that appellant might purchase one-half interest in the plant and business of the Pontiac Sentinel, and thus compel appellee to admit appellant as a partner in the management of the plant and in conducting its business, including the selection of articles and preparing editorials for the columns of the paper. If appellant were admitted to a partnership in the plant, as was decreed by the circuit court, in the management of the business and conducting of the newspaper appellant\u2019s judgment, ability and personal skill would be required. But, as we understand the authorities, the rule is well established that courts of equity will not, as a general rule, lend their aid to enforce the specific performance of contracts where personal skill and judgment in the control and management of the partnership business are required. Should a court of equity decree the specific performance of a contract providing for a partnership where personal skill, attention and services are required, as would be the case here, the enforcement of a decree in such a case upon an unwilling party would of necessity require the court to manage the partnership, which, of itself, is regarded a sufficient reason for a refusal to grant the relief. Moreover, where a partnership agreed upon is not for a definite time, but is merely at will, specific performance will be refused, for the reason that the partnership could be immediately dissolved, and a court is never required to do a void or useless thing.</p> <p id=\"b245-5\" pgmap=\"245\">We have been cited in the argument to a number of authorities bearing on the questions involved, but a reference to a few will be sufficient to sustain the view we are disposed to take in regard to those questions.</p> <p id=\"b245-6\" pgmap=\"245(108) 246(18)\">\u201cSpecific performance of a contract to form a partnership, as a general rule, will not be enforced. Where the contract requires a party to give his time, skill, attention or services of any kind, an enforcement of it upon an unwilling party would require the court to manage the partnership, which alone is reason for refusal to grant relief, besides being productive of no benefit to the other party. And this refusal of specific relief is in analogy to the policy of the .law to grant dissolution for hopeless and irreconcilable dissensions.\u201d (Bates on Partnership, sec. 1009.) \u201cIf a partnership agreed upon is at will, specific performance will be refused, for the reason that the partnership could be immediately dissolved.\u201d (Ibid, sec. 1011.)</p> <p id=\"b246-5\" pgmap=\"246\">\u201cA-n agreement to enter into a partnership, and, as a partner, to use and exercise personal skill and judgment in the control and management of the partnership business, is not enforceable specifically.\u201d Lindley on Partnership, (Rapalje,) p. 795, note 16, citing Buck v. Smith, 29 Mich. 166.</p> <p id=\"b246-6\" pgmap=\"246\">\u201cAs a general rule, the court will not enforce specific performance of a contract to form and carry on a partnership; and, notwithstanding some early authorities more or less to the contrary, it is clear that the court would- in no case compel performance of a contract to enter into a partnership not for a 'definite term, for it might be dissolved as soon as entered upon, and the interference of the court would thus become simply nugatory.\u201d (Fry on Specific Performance,- \u2014 3d Am. ed. 1884,\u2014 .sec. 1512.) In Wollensak v. Briggs, 20 Ill. App. 50, and Doyle v. Bailey, 75 Ill. 418, the same principle is announced.</p> <p id=\"b246-7\" pgmap=\"246\">It will be observed that the contract relied upon here contains no provision in regard to the manner in which the business- shall be conducted after the partnership shall be formed, nor is there any provision in regard to the time of its duration. If the contract were in other respects one of which a court of equity might decree specific performance, the fact that no time is provided for the duration of the partnership is fatal. The rule declared by Fry on Specific Performance on the question seems to be well sustained by the authorities.</p> <p id=\"b246-8\" pgmap=\"246\">While appellant cannot resort to a court of equity for a specific performance of the contract he is not without remedy. If he has fully complied with the terms of the contract he is entitled to bring an action at law for a breach of the same. On such action he may recover such damages as he has sustained on account of the failure of appellee to comply with the contract.</p> <p id=\"b247-3\" pgmap=\"247\">Wilson v. Campbell, 5 Gilm. 383, has been, cited as an authority sustaining the position of appellant. In the decision of that case the court said (p. 402): \u201cWhile the agreement (to form a partnership) remains executory, if one of them refuses to carry it into effect the only remedy of the other is by an action at law for the violation of the agreement, or by a bill in equity to enforce specifically its performance.\u201d Whether a court of equity would decree the specific performance of a contract to form a partnership was not involved in the case, and what the court may have said on that question cannot be regarded as authority controlling a case where the question was directly involved.</p> <p id=\"b247-4\" pgmap=\"247\">We think the judgment of the Appellate Court was correct, and it will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"AAk\" pgmap=\"247\">Judgment afflrmed_</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
