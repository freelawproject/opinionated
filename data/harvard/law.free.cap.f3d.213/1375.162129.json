United States, </em>44 Fed.Cl. 633 (1999), concluding that the Navy\u2019s solicita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>tion of Contract No. N00039-99-D-3201 was improperly conducted and ordering injunctive relief. By our order of December 30, 1999, we granted expedited review because of potential national security concerns. Because the Court of Federal Claims erred in finding a latent ambiguity in the contract, we reverse the judgment and vacate the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">On March 1, 1999, the Department of the Navy\u2019s Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (Navy) issued a request for proposals (RFP) for an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract to procure leased-channel-mode, high-speed, satellite-based communication services through the International Maritime Satellite (INMARSAT) B high-speed data service. Section V of the RFP, entitled \u201cEvaluation,\u201d informed bidders that \u201c[t]he Government will award a contract ... to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation ... will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered,\u201d and that the \u201c[ajward will be made to the offeror whose proposal meets the minimum technical requirements and offers the best value to the Government in terms of combination of past performance and price.\u201d The RFP states that \u201c[p]r/ce will be evaluated using the anticipated order amounts which follow.\u201d However, potential bidders were also informed that \u201c[o]fferors are cautioned that evaluation of the [anticipated] quantities does <em>NOT </em>obligate the Government to place orders in that manner. The Government is obligated to order only the minimum quantity....\u201d The RFP also instructs that \u201c[i]n the price evaluation, the Government will apply any discounts offered as applicable.\u201d Specific examples of discounts were provided, all of which were \u201cwithout regard to the number of channels ordered\u201d or \u201cwithout regard to the number of months funded by the Government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">In addition to the anticipated quantities, the RFP specified a not-to-exceed quantity and informed bidders that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-9\">[p]rices will also be evaluated for reasonableness using the items\u2019 not-to-exceed quantities.... In considering the reasonableness and realism of the price proposals, the Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items. An offer is materially unbalanced when: one, it is based on prices significantly less in cost for some work and prices that are significantly overstated in relation to the cost for other work; and two, if there is reasonable doubt that the offer will result in the low overall cost to the Government even though it may be the lowest evaluated offer, or it is so unbalanced as to be tantamount to allowing an advance payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">Stratos Mobile Networks USA, LLC (\u201cStratos\u201d) and COMSAT submitted proposals in accordance with the RFP. Both COMSAT and Stratos satisfied the RFP\u2019s technical requirements, and the past performance evaluation resulted in excellent weighted average past performance scores for both companies. Both companies offered discounts in their proposals, and, as the Court of Federal Claims observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-11\">These discounts, however, were structured differently. In general terms, Stratos\u2019 per-unit price discounts would become available only after the Navy had built up a specified channel-month ordering total, found by multiplying the number of channels ordered by the months in service. In order to receive credit toward these cumulative totals, the Navy was required to place orders each month for a number of channels that matched or exceeded the number of channels specified for that month in the solicitation\u2019s anticipated order quantities. A failure to order the prescribed minimum quantity in the specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>month resulted in the resetting of the cumulative channel months to zero and thus caused a delay in reaching the channel-month level necessary for discount. Stratos\u2019 discount, in other words, was tied to an exact replay of the solicitation\u2019s anticipated order amounts. In contrast, COMSAT, following an example set forth in the solicitation, offered a discount for any channel quantity when ordered for a 12-month period. COM-SAT\u2019s discount thus depended only on the duration of an order, and operated without regard to the number of channels ordered, or to the month of an order\u2019s placement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-4\"><em>Stratos Mobile Networks, </em>44 Fed.Cl. at 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">After receiving the initial proposals, the Navy sought clarification of outstanding questions, including some directly related to the Stratos pricing proposal. Stratos was informed that its \u201cproposal\u2019s potential for award could be enhanced if it were more price competitive,\u201d and was later asked to clarify whether discounts would be available if service started in a month with thirty active channels but ended in a month with less than thirty active channels, whether discounts \u201ckick in\u201d after lease months are completed versus ordered, and was informed that the Navy would not prepay for services as initially required by Stratos to earn discounts. After Stratos submitted a revised proposal, the Navy responded with a letter stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-6\">... it appears that the discounts you are offering ... apply to the exact anticipated quantities included in the RFP for price evaluation. Although the price evaluation quantities constitute a reasonable estimate of future order quantities, it is impossible to predict exact order quantities over the five-year ordering period. Accordingly, the RFP advised that evaluation of the anticipated order amounts would not obligate the Government to place orders in that manner. Consequently, we are seeking confirmation/clarification with regard to the discounts you have offered in your 21 April 1999 proposal revision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">The Navy then asked a series of questions to determine whether discounts would be available for additional service requested in a month beyond the number of channels specified in the price evaluation quantities, for orders placed in a different month than specified in the price evaluation quantities, and for channels ordered for less than a twelve month period. The Navy also questioned when the volume discounts based on the number of channel months would become effective and whether discounts were dependent on the order being placed in the month specified in the price evaluation quantities. Stratos submitted a final proposal which responded that (1) discounts are not available for quantities above the anticipated amount, (2) ordering service one month later than the anticipated evaluation schedule would reset the discount level to zero channel months, (3) the discount schedule is tied to both the month of order and the aggregate number of channel months ordered and cannot be accelerated by ordering additional services before they are scheduled in the anticipated evaluation schedule, (4) obligating for six month periods versus one year periods does not affect the discount schedule so long as the number of leases planned to be procured in any month under the anticipated evaluation schedule is met, and (5) the discount plan is based on completed months of service and not the month of order.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Based on the final proposals submitted by each company, the prices for the evaluated quantity were $65,254,030 for COM-SAT and $64,221,920 for Stratos, while COMSAT bid $111,951,000 compared to $126,100,800 for Stratos for the not-to-exceed value. The Navy awarded the contract to COMSAT based on the its percep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>tion that COMSAT\u2019s pricing was more flexible and thus more accommodating of the uncertainties of demand associated with an IDIQ contract. Specifically, the Navy justified the award to COMSAT because (1) COMSAT\u2019s monthly undiscounted per channel price was $3350 lower than Stratos\u2019, (2) Stratos\u2019 lower overall evaluated quantity price was entirely dependent upon the government ordering channels in the same months and in the same quantities as called for in the anticipated evaluation schedule while COMSAT\u2019s discounts were not directly tied to placing orders in the anticipated manner, (3) arduous restrictions applied to Stratos\u2019 pricing which was only lower under very limited conditions unlikely ever to materialize, (4) COMSAT\u2019s discount terms were more advantageous to the government because they were not tied to a requirement to have a specific number of leases in place in a specific month, and (5) considering each offer as a whole, it was more advantageous to award the contract to COMSAT at a not-to-exceed value that is $14,149,800 less than Stratos rather than to award the contract to Stratos whose offer was only $1,032,110 less than COMSAT\u2019s offer for the anticipated evaluation quantities.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Stratos challenged both aspects of the Navy\u2019s evaluation process in the United States Court of Federal Claims, arguing that COMSAT\u2019s past performance did not warrant an excellent rating and, further, that the Navy did not follow the RFP\u2019s direction to evaluate prices strictly based on the anticipated order amounts set out in the RFP for price evaluation purposes. COMSAT intervened. The Navy and COMSAT argued that the award of the contract to COMSAT was appropriate because the RFP provided that the Navy would also evaluate price reasonableness and realism and the likelihood that the evaluated price would be the most advantageous to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">Based on these conflicting interpretations of the price evaluation criteria, the Court of Federal Claims granted summary judgment for Stratos, holding that the procurement was illegal because the RFP contained a latent ambiguity as to the method of evaluating bids. The Navy emphasized the potential risks to national security that would be posed if it were forced to rebid the contract and if it had to transition service from COMSAT to Stratos in the middle of the five-year contract period. The trial court concluded that it was in the interest of national security that the Navy have both continuous, uninterrupted access to the INMARSAT-B high speed data communications and guaranteed access to the requisite number of communications channels. Nevertheless, it issued an injunction requiring the Navy to rewrite the RFP, rebid the contract, and transition the contract to Stratos by January 1, 2001 if Stratos won the rebid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In formulating the injunction, the court discounted the national security threat posed by a forced service transition, but sought to mitigate any such harm by delaying any transition to permit an expedited appeal, which is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Prineville Sawmill Co., Inc. v. United States, </em>859 F.2d 905, 911 (Fed.Cir.1988) (\u201c[Tjhis court determines for itself whether the standards for summary judgment have been met.\u201d). We review the grant of a permanent injunction for an abuse of discretion which \u201crequires plenary review of the correctness of ... rulings on matters of law.\u201d <em>Intergraph Corp. v. Intel Corp., </em>195 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed.Cir.1999). Within that context, the decision of an agency to award a contract must be upheld unless it is found to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>tion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1994). \u201cTo prevail in a bid protest, a protester must show a significant, prejudicial error in the procurement process.\u201d <em>Alfa Laval Separation, Inc. v. United States, </em>175 F.3d 1365, 1367 (Fed.Cir.1999) (citations omitted). \u201c[T]he protester must show \u2018that there was a substantial chance it would have received the contract award but for that error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Statistica, Inc. v. Christopher, </em>102 F.3d 1577, 1582 (Fed. Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">The RFP, like any contract, must be read in light of its purpose and consistently with common sense. <em>See Dalton v. Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>98 F.3d 1298, 1305 (Fed.Cir.1996). Both the existence of an ambiguity and whether any ambiguity is patent or latent are issues of law that we review <em>de novo. Grumman Data Sys. Corp. v. Dalton, 88 F.3d </em>990, 997 (Fed.Cir. 1996). The RFP states that <em>\u201c[pjrices </em>will be evaluated using the anticipated order amounts which follow....\u201d Stratos argues this can only reasonably be interpreted to mean that the anticipated order amounts constitute the sole basis for comparing the prices of various bids. COM-SAT and the Navy point to language in the same section of the RFP stating that prices will also be evaluated for reasonableness using the not-to-exceed quantities and authorizing the Navy to consider an offer unacceptable because it is materially unbalanced \u201cif there is reasonable doubt that the offer will result in the lowest overall cost to the Government even though it may be the low evaluated offer....\u201d The RFP also makes clear that \u201c[t]he Government will award a contract. .. to the responsible offeror whose offer ... will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. ... Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal ... offers the best value to the Government in terms of combination of past performance and price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">The RFP warned that the anticipated order amounts were for evaluation purposes only and did not bind the Navy to order more than the minimum requirements. These terms of the RFP provided substantial guidance that would put the reasonable contractor on notice that the evaluation would include more than a simple comparison of price calculations at a single data point, would \u201capply any discounts offered as applicable,\u201d and would consider whether the offer would be most advantageous to the government. Stratos\u2019 interpretation unreasonably expects the Navy to look no further than the single data entry for evaluated price and to ignore the fact that its discount scheme, in the Navy\u2019s words, provides lower prices <em>\u201cunder very limited conditions which place restrictions that are so arduous that the </em>pricing offered by Stratos for the evaluation quantity is likely to never materialize due to the discount terms.\u201d The Navy\u2019s evaluation of the competing bids shows that \u201cthere is reasonable doubt that [Stratos\u2019] offer will result in the lowest overall cost to the Government even though it may be the low evaluated offer____\u201d The very purpose of an IDIQ contract is to provide flexibility for requirements that cannot be accurately anticipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">The government did not intend that the evaluated pricing schedule be the exclusive means of evaluation. Stratos points to no provision in the RFP that expressly mandates the use of the anticipated evaluation schedule to the exclusion of other factors. Even assuming the reasonableness of Stratos\u2019 interpretation that it is an exclusive provision, COMSAT\u2019s contrary interpretation is at least equally reasonable. The solicitation would then at most be ambiguous. <em>Grumman Data, 88 </em>F.3d at 997 (\u201cIf more than one meaning is reasonably consistent with the contract language, then the contract term is ambiguous.\u201d). If Stratos\u2019 claims of ambiguity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>among the evaluation terms are correct, the ambiguity would be patent and not latent. A patent ambiguity is present when the contract contains facially inconsistent provisions that would place a reasonable contractor on notice and prompt the contractor to rectify the inconsistency by inquiring of the appropriate parties. Thus, Stratos \u201chad a duty to seek clarification from the government, and its failure to do so precludes acceptance of its interpretation.\u201d <em>Statistics </em>102 F.3d at 1582.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The Court of Federal Claims said that \u201c[insistence upon a literal application of the price evaluation clause, ... is complicated by other seemingly contradictory aspects of the solicitation.\u201d <em>Stratos Mobile Networks, </em>44 Fed.Cl. at 638. \u201cWe read the language of a particular contractual provision in the context of the entire agreement ... and construe the contract so as not to render portions of it meaningless.\u201d <em>Dalton, </em>98 F.3d at 1305. The RFP terms thought by the Court of Federal Claims to support a conclusion of latent ambiguity are not mutually exclusive, are included within the same \u201cEvaluation\u201d section of the RFP, and clearly delineate the factors that will be considered in determining which is the most advantageous offer to the Navy. While the anticipated quantities are to be used to determine an evaluated price for comparing the bids, nothing in the RFP makes that consideration exclusive, and the RFP makes clear that the lowest evaluated offer need not be accepted \u201cif there is reasonable doubt that the offer will result in the lowest overall cost to the Government even though it may be the low evaluated offer____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">The Navy\u2019s award of the contract to COMSAT was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, considering its $14,-189,800 lower not-to-exceed quantity price point and greater flexibility in offering discounts not tied to a specific number of leases in place in a specific month which was more advantageous to the government than Stratos\u2019 restrictive discounts and $1,032,110 lower evaluated price. Based on the nature of the IDIQ contract and the specific terms of the RFP, there was no ambiguity in the RFP, latent or otherwise, and therefore no error sufficient to justify judgment for Stratos. In light of this disposition, we do not address the not insubstantial national security concerns raised by the Navy in the remedy phase of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the United States Court of Federal Claims is reversed, and the injunction is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">\n<em>REVERSED AND VACATED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-6\">.
