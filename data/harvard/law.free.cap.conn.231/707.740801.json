We conclude that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>because the remedies are not explicitly exclusive, there is no conflict between the two provisions. Accordingly, both must be given concurrent effect and cumulative remedies must be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>The plaintiff, Dawn Jacobs, instituted this action against the defendant, Healey Ford-Subaru, Inc., for alleged multiple violations of RISFA and the UCC. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>sought minimum statutory damages of $6500, costs and attorney\u2019s fees, pursuant to the UCC and RISFA, as well as actual and punitive damages pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), and General Statutes \u00a7 36-243b<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Creditors\u2019 Collection Practices Act (CCPA). The defendant denied the allegations and counterclaimed for a deficiency of $1608.07.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 430,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the case was referred to an attorney trial referee (referee), who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>found the following facts. In October, 1988, the defendant sold a used 1987 Ford Tempo to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The cash price of the vehicle was $10,647.03; the amount financed was $10,898.90; and the finance charge was $4196.14. There was a down payment of $2600, and the plaintiff made three payments of $314.48 each. In May, 1989, the plaintiff voluntarily returned the vehicle to the defendant. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association formula, at the time the vehicle was returned its value was $6500.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The referee further found that the defendant never gave the plaintiff advance notice of its intent to repossess the vehicle before the plaintiff returned it. See General Statutes \u00a7 42-98 (b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s only correspondence with the plaintiff consisted of two demands for a deficiency of $5285.07 that were mailed in August and November, 1989. Only the letter of November 10, 1989, however, arrived at the correct location and was received by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On November 9, 1989, the vehicle was sold for $8427. The defendant was unaware that the vehicle had been sold the day before it sent the second letter because, while moving its dealership, it had misplaced the pertinent file. On or before Febru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>ary 18,1991, the defendant located its file and directed its attorney to notify the plaintiff of the sale and of the corrected deficiency balance due of $1608.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The referee first concluded that the plaintiff was a \u201cretail buyer\u201d as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 42-83 (3) (h),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that, despite its voluntary return, the vehicle had been \u201crepossessed\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 42-98 (b). Neither of these conclusions has been challenged. Because the vehicle had been sold under a retail instalment contract, the referee concluded that the defendant was obligated under the notice and resale provisions of RISFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The referee also concluded that the defendant had violated \u00a7 42-98 (c), (d) and (e) based upon his findings that the defendant had failed to provide the plaintiff with any notice of: (1) the right to redeem; (2) the proposed sale; (3) the actual sale; or (4) the disposition of the proceeds. Furthermore, the defendant did not credit the plaintiff with the statutory fair market value of the vehicle, either before or after its resale, as required by \u00a7 42-98 (e) and (g). In light of the defendant\u2019s admitted violations of these provisions, the referee precluded it from recovering any claimed deficiency under its counterclaim. The referee then concluded that neither CUTPA nor CCPA had been violated and thereafter applied the statutory formula under RISFA to award the plaintiff $885.86 in damages. See General Statutes \u00a7 42-98 (i).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>The plaintiff objected to the report, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 440,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and claimed that: she was entitled to the minimum consumer damages provided by the UCC; she should have received attorney\u2019s fees under General Statutes \u00a7 42-150bb;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the referee should have concluded that both CUTPA and CCPA had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The trial court accurately recited all the pertinent facts found by the referee and his conclusion of law that the notice provisions of RISFA had been violated. The trial court then concluded that because the referee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>report contained insufficient factual findings to support the plaintiffs claim that the defendant had failed to resell the vehicle in a commercially reasonable manner, as required by \u00a7 42a-9-504, the damages sought under the UCC could be predicated only on the plaintiffs claim that the notice provisions of the UCC had been violated. The trial court rejected the plaintiffs objection to the referee\u2019s denial of damages under the UCC concluding that the provisions of RISFA took precedence and thereby limited the amount of damages to which the plaintiff was entitled. In reaching its decision, the trial court relied on two statutes that assign priority to the provisions of RISFA when there is a conflict between RISFA and the UCC. Section 42-83 (1) provides that \u201c[a] transaction subject to this chapter is also subject to the Uniform Commercial Code, title 42a, but in case of any conflict the provisions of this chapter shall control.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-9-203 (4) provides that \u201c[a] transaction, although subject to this article, is also subject to sections . . . 42-83 to 42-99, inclusive . . . and in the case of conflict between the provisions of this article and any such statute, the provisions of such statute control. Failure to comply with any applicable statute has only the effect which is specified therein.\u201d The trial court also affirmed the referee\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s conduct did not amount to an unfair trade or collection practice. Finally, the trial court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb because the plaintiff had failed to assert this specific statutory claim to the referee and had, therefore, failed properly to place it before the referee for consideration. Accordingly, the trial court overruled the plaintiff\u2019s objection to the report and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $885.86.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). The plaintiff raises three issues: (1) whether the trial court properly refused to award damages under both RISFA and the UCC when both statutes had been violated; (2) whether the trial court properly concluded that the defendant had not violated CUTPA; and (3) whether the trial court properly denied the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 42-150bb.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">We first consider the question of cumulative remedies. The referee explicitly found that the defendant had violated RISFA.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In light of that finding, we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>resolve: (1) whether a conflict exists between the provisions of RISFA and the UCC; and (2) whether, in the absence of a conflict, the provisions can be given concurrent effect. We conclude that there is no conflict and that the plaintiff was entitled to damages under both statutory schemes.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">We begin our analysis with a review of the statutes themselves. Section 42-83 (1) provides that a transaction subject to RISFA is also subject to the UCC, but adds that RISFA controls in case of any conflict. Similarly, \u00a7 42a-9-203 (4) provides that a transaction subject to the UCC is also subject to RISFA. A creditor must therefore comply with both RISFA and the UCC unless a conflict exists. See <em>Gaynor </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., </em>216 Conn. 458, 582 A.2d 190 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The defendant argues that a conflict exists solely because the provisions of RISFA and the UCC include different and distinct remedies. RISFA provides a statutory formula that allows the retail buyer to recover \u201chis actual damages, if any, and in no event less than one-fourth of the sum of all payments which have been made under the contract.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-98 (i). The UCC allows the debtor to recover \u201can amount not less than the credit service charge plus ten per cent of the principal amount of the debt or the time price differential plus ten percent of the cash price.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-9-507 (1). Because the remedies are different, the defendant contends that only one can apply. On the basis of that supposition, the defendant further maintains that a conflict exists and therefore only the remedy provided by RISFA applies. Because we disagree with the defendant\u2019s underlying premise that each of the remedy provisions is exclusive, we find no conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument has been considered and rejected in other jurisdictions. In <em>Wilmington Trust Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>v. <em>Conner, </em>415 A.2d 773, 779 (Del. 1980), the court confirmed its adherence to the \u201cabsolute bar\u201d rule that failure to comply strictly with the notice provisions of the Delaware UCC<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> acts as an absolute bar to recovery of a deficiency judgment by the creditor. The court found that both the \u201cabsolute bar\u201d rule and the statutory remedy under the Delaware UCC \u00a7 9-507 (l),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> are available as debtor's remedies. The creditor had argued that the remedy in \u00a7 9-507 (1) was intended to be exclusive and that the debtor was therefore not entitled to avail himself of the absolute bar rule. In rejecting this claim, the court referred to \u00a7 1-106 (1) of the Delaware UCC, which specifically recognizes the applicability of other remedies, providing that the remedies afforded by the UCC \u201cshall be liberally administered . . . but neither consequential nor special nor penal damages may be had except as specifically provided in this subtitle <em>or by other rule of law. </em>(Emphasis added.)\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wilmington Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>supra, 779. The court concluded that \u201cbecause of their learning, skill and experience, the drafters of the Uniform Commercial Code, had they truly intended the remedy to be exclusive, would have been scrupulously careful to state it. Their omission of language in \u00a7 9-507 (1) expressly indicating exclusivity of the remedy thus speaks volumes against the correctness of [the] plaintiffs position.\u201d (Internal quotation marks of the Delaware UCC omitted.) Id., 780. Additionally, the court relied on \u00a7 1-103 of the Delaware UCC, which provides that other rules of law may supplement the UCC unless they are displaced by particular UCC provisions. The Delaware court interpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>that section to mean that only if other provisions \u201cexplicitly\u201d displace any other rule of law, will such provision be exclusive. Id., 779. The court concluded that the drafters\u2019 failure explicitly to limit a debtor to \u00a7 9-507 (1) reflects an intent that the remedy contained therein not be the debtor\u2019s sole recourse. Therefore, the debtor was entitled to avail himself of the remedy provision of the absolute bar rule.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Id., 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Other courts have come to the same conclusion. In <em>Camden National Bank </em>v. <em>St. Clair, </em>309 A.2d 329, 332 (Me. 1973), the court remarked that \u201cin view of the omission of \u00a7 9-507 (1) expressly to state that it provides an exclusive remedy for notification deficiencies, U.C.C. \u00a7 1-103 becomes most significant. Its import is that the right of action established by \u00a7 9-507 (1), absent clear expression to the contrary, must be held cumulative in the context of remedies previously, or otherwise, afforded.\u201d See also <em>Industrial Valley Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>349 Pa. Super. 27, 44, 502 A.2d 1254 (1985) (Motor Vehicle Sales Financing Act [MVSFA] provisions not intended to be exclusive; UCC and MVSFA are \u201cin pari materia\u201d and should be construed together to enhance the purposes of both statutes); <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Chrysler Credit Corp., </em>818 S.W.2d 23, 31 (Tenn. App. 1991) (\u00a7 9-507 [1] \u201cremedies are not intended to be exclusive and, in fact, are cumulative to other remedies available to debtors under state law\u201d); see generally Atlas <em>Thrift Co. </em>v. <em>Horan, </em>27 Cal. App. 3d 999, 1008, 104 Cal. Rptr. 315 (1972) (remedies available before adoption of UCC are not eliminated unless UCC specifically deletes them); <em>Christian </em>v. <em>First National Bank, </em>531 S.W.2d 832, 843 (Tex. App. 1975) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Although the remedy provisions of RISFA and the UCC provide different relief, we are persuaded that both can apply simultaneously. Mindful that consumer legislation must be interpreted so as to implement its remedial purpose of protecting consumer buyers; <em>Mack Financial Corp. </em>v. <em>Crossley, </em>209 Conn. 163, 166, 550 A.2d 303 (1988); <em>Barco Auto Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>House, </em>202 Conn. 106, 116, 520 A.2d 162 (1987); and in accord with the reasoning other jurisdictions have applied to resolve this issue, we conclude that there is no conflict between the remedy provisions of RISFA and the UCC, in the absence of a clear mandate that the remedies are exclusive. Accordingly, under \u00a7 42-83 (1), the remedies are cumulative and the plaintiff is entitled to collect damages under both statutory formulas as set forth in \u00a7 42-98 (i) and \u00a7 42a-9-507 (l).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Our decision that the remedies of RISFA and the UCC are cumulative is further supported by public policy considerations. Repossession statutes are enacted to protect the consumer from well documented repossession abuses and to encourage and promote compliance with the laws that govern such actions. <em>Barco Auto Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>House, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 116 (\u201cbuyer\u2019s remedy must therefore be implemented in a fashion that will take full account of a governing statute that was purposefully designed to correct the often gross imbalance in bargaining power between a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>retail seller and a retail buyer\u201d); P. Shuchman, \u201cProfit on Default: An Archival Study of Automobile Repossession and Resale,\u201d 22 Stan. L. Rev. 20 (1969); Symposium, \u201cDefaulting Debtors and the Judicial Process\u2014The FTC\u2019s Proposed Restriction on Deficiency Judgments: \u00a7 444.2 (a) (7) of the Rule on Credit Practices,\u201d 8 Conn. L. Rev. 457 (1976); note, \u201cI Can Get It For You Wholesale: The Lingering Problem of Automobile Deficiency Judgments,\u201d 27 Stan. L. Rev. 1081 (1975); comment, \u201cBusiness as Usual: An Empirical Study of Automobile Deficiency Judgment Suits in the District of Columbia,\u201d 3 Conn. L. Rev. 511 (1971). The problem with statutes like RISFA, however, is that the award of damages is too minimal to provide a \u201cstimulus to make it advantageous for the seller to follow [RISFA].\u201d 2A Uniform Laws Annotated (1924) \u00a7 129, p. 181. The penalty clause is thus \u201cof little value. . . . [I]n the case of the ordinary conditional sale a threat of absolute liability for one-quarter of the payments will not be very persuasive. If the part payments have been trifling in amount, an absolute liability for 25 percent of the payments will be of little importance.\u201d Id., pp. 181-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">\u201cThe Uniform Commercial Code\u2019s drafters included the statutory penalty for consumer goods in Section 9-507 (1) because they believed that compensatory damages would not be a sufficient deterrent in the average consumer case. See [2 J. White &amp; R. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code (3d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 27-18, p. 623]. They intended that the statute would provide the minimum recovery for consumers who prove that a secured party did not proceed in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code. See 9 R. Anderson, Anderson on the Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 9-507:21 (1985).\u201d <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Chrysler Credit Corp., </em>supra, 818 S.W.2d 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>\u201cThe purpose of . . . [UCC \u00a7 9-507] is to encourage creditors to comply with all provisions of part 5 or face the consequences of noncompliance. We agree with the view that the drafters created a statutory penalty in UCC [\u00a7] 9-507 to \u2018up the ante for those who would abuse the consumer\u2019 because in most cases, compensatory damages are \u2018an insufficient deterrent to creditor misbehavior in nickel and dime consumer transactions where such damage will amount to very little . . . .\u2019 [2 J. White &amp; R.. Summers, supra, \u00a7 27-18, p. 623].\u201d <em>Erdmann </em>v. <em>Rants, </em>442 N.W.2d 441, 443 (N.D. 1989). \u201cThe penalty evinces a strong policy by the UCC drafters and our Legislature that the best protection for consumers is creditor compliance with all of the default provisions of part 5. A flat penalty for noncompliance is the means chosen by the framers of the UCC and our Legislature to ensure that creditors take careful steps to comply with those default provisions.\u201d Id., 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Under the facts of this case, the remedy afforded by the UCC is the only real deterrent. It is irrelevant that the penalty bears little or no relation to the actual loss. <em>First City Bank\u2014Farmers Branch </em>v. <em>Guex, </em>677 S.W.2d 25, 29 (Tex. 1984) (\u201c[o]bviously the drafters of the Uniform Commercial Code intended . . . to penalize the secured party if the debtor suffered no losses or his losses were less that the statutory penalty\u201d). The plaintiff\u2019s actual damages under RISFA were based on the down payment and the three monthly payments that were made. According to the statutory formula, the referee awarded the plaintiff only $885.86. Imposing cumulative remedies for a violation of RISFA and the UCC obviously creates a greater incentive to comply with repossession laws. We therefore conclude that the plaintiff is entitled to damages under both statutory schemes and we remand the case for application of the proper statutory formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The plaintiff also asserts that the trial court should have concluded that the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted a violation of CUTPA. In essence, she maintains that the defendant\u2019s violation of the repossession statutes was an unfair trade practice that offended public policy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">We recently had occasion to discuss the well established test for determining whether a particular act or practice violates CUTPA. \u201cIt is well settled that in determining whether [an act or] practice violates CUTPA we have adopted the criteria set out in the cigarette rule by the federal trade commission for determining when [an act or] practice is unfair: (1) [W]hether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise\u2014whether, in other words, it is within at least the penumbra of some common law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers [competitors or other businessmen]. <em>Conaway </em>v. <em>Prestia, </em>[191 Conn. 484, 492-93, 464 A.2d 847 (1983)], quoting <em>FTC </em>v. <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., </em>405 U.S. 233, 244-45 n.5, 92 S. Ct. 898, 31 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1972) .... <em>McLaughlin Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>192 Conn. 558, 567-68, 473 A.2d 1185 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">\u201cAll three criteria do not need to be satisfied to support a finding of unfairness. A practice may be unfair because of the degree to which it meets one of the criteria or because to a lesser extent it meets all three. Statement of Basis and Purpose, Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchising and Business Opportunity Ventures, 43 Fed. Reg. 59, 614, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>[and] 59,635 (1978). . . . Id., 569 n.15. Thus a violation of CUTPA may be established by showing either an actual deceptive practice; see, e.g., <em>Sprayfoam, Inc. </em>v. <em>Durant\u2019s Rental Centers, Inc., </em>39 Conn. Sup. 78, 468 A.2d 951 (1983); or a practice amounting to a violation of public policy. See, e.g., <em>Sportmen\u2019s Boating Corporation </em>v. <em>Hensley, </em>[192 Conn. 747, 474 A.2d 780 (1984)]. <em>Web Press Services Corporation </em>v. <em>New London Motors, Inc., </em>[203 Conn. 342, 355, 525 A.2d 57 (1987)]. Furthermore, a party need not prove an intent to deceive to prevail under CUTPA. See id., 363 (knowledge of falsity, either constructive or actual, need not be proven to establish CUTPA violation). <em>Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>[223 Conn. 80, 105-106, 612 A.2d 1130 (1992)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>230 Conn. 486, 522-23, 646 A.2d 1289 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The referee found that the defendant had failed to comply with the notice provisions of RISFA. In our resolution of the first issue on appeal, we concluded that these same omissions amounted to a violation of the UCC. In resolving the CUTPA claim, the referee reviewed the statute and the \u201ccigarette rule\u201d to determine whether this lack of compliance constituted a CUTPA violation. The referee also examined the question of whether the defendant\u2019s attempts to seek a deficiency judgment from the plaintiff, despite its lack of compliance with the repossession laws, amounted to an unfair trade practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The question of whether an action or practice can be the basis of a CUTPA action depends upon all the circumstances of the particular case. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>v. <em>Canaan Oil Co., </em>202 Conn. 234, 242, 520 A.2d 1008 (1987). In her complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had violated various notice provisions of RISFA and the UCC and that, as a result, she was entitled to damages and counsel fees under CUTPA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>The referee implicitly rejected this per se argument, and independently examined the testimony to decide whether the defendant\u2019s conduct violated the established concept of fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">To the extent that the referee correctly interpreted the plaintiff\u2019s bare allegations of a CUTPA violation<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> as a per se claim, we agree with his rejection of it. When the legislature has intended to make the violation of a consumer statute an automatic violation of CUTPA, it has done so expressly. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 20-427 (b) of the Home Improvement Act; General Statutes \u00a7 42-141 of the Home Solicitation Sales Act; see also General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-16c, 16a-22k, 16a-23a, 20-341y, 20-427, 20-457, 21-35h, 21a-222, 21a-404, 35-1, 36-435Z, 36-573, 38a-355, 42-103k, 42-103aa, 42-115r, 42-115t, 42-115u, 42-126C, 42-141, 42-232, 42-251. There is no such provision in RISFA or in the UCC. It is necessary, therefore, that we examine all the facts surrounding the defendant\u2019s noncompliance, as found by the referee, in evaluating the threshold test for CUTPA recovery. In the absence of a motion to correct the report or an objection to its acceptance because the facts had been improperly found,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> we examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>these facts solely to determine whether the referee\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>186 Conn. 387, 391, 441 A.2d 629 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The referee concluded that the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the pertinent notice provisions did not constitute an unfair collection practice. As predicate findings, the referee remarked upon the defendant\u2019s lost records and files and sloppy accounting methods that led to its misrepresentation of the amount of the deficiency. The report filed by the referee contained a discussion of arguments by the defendant that \u201cthere was no fraud, deliberate deception or willful misconduct on its part.\u201d Although the referee did not incorporate these exact conclusions in his report, he did find that the defendant had sent a demand letter to an outdated address and that because it had temporarily lost its file when it moved its dealership, it was unaware that the vehicle had been sold. The referee further found that upon locating its missing file, the defendant directed its attorney to notify the plaintiff that the vehicle had been sold, to credit the plaintiff with the fair market value of the vehicle and to correct the amount of the deficiency balance. Additionally, the referee entertained the defendant\u2019s explanation for its failure to comply with RISFA and the UCC. The defendant argued that the repossession statutes were inapplicable because the plaintiff had not been a retail buyer and the vehicle had not been repossessed. Although he disagreed as a matter of law with the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the pertinent terms, the referee did not find that the defendant had been acting in bad faith or that it had been disingenuous in making these arguments. On the basis of these factual underpinnings, the referee concluded that CUTPA had not been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>The plaintiff urges us nonetheless to hold that the defendant\u2019s violation of RISFA and the UCC <em>necessarily </em>constituted a violation of CUTPA. The referee implicitly concluded, on the basis of his unchallenged factual findings, that the defendant\u2019s statutory noncompliance was not, in fact, unfair, deceptive or oppressive.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 524; <em>Gaynor </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., </em>supra, 216 Conn. 483. The repossession in issue appears to have been an isolated instance of misinterpretation by the defendant of its obligations due to the unique circumstances of this particular case as distinguished from unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the defendant\u2019s trade or business. In light of the referee\u2019s implicit finding that the defendant\u2019s conduct was not in fact unfair, deceptive, or oppressive, we conclude that the plaintiff has not established her CUTPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Finally, the plaintiff claims that she is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 42-150bb. Because this issue was first raised in her objection to the referee\u2019s report, the trial court properly denied the claim. Absent con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>tractual or statutory authority, each party must pay its own attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Maiocco, </em>209 Conn. 579, 590, 552 A.2d 1207 (1989). By its own terms, \u00a7 42-150bb applies only to contracts that contain a provision for reciprocal attorney\u2019s fees. Neither the referee nor the trial court found that the contract in issue contained such a provision. The plaintiff concedes that the contract was not admitted into evidence, but argues, nevertheless, that the referee took judicial notice of its existence.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Even if the referee could take judicial notice of the contract, a matter that we do not decide in this case, the mere <em>existence </em>of a contract, however, does not prove that the contract included a <em>provision </em>for receiving attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The trial court may not find facts when those facts had not been placed before the referee. <em>Wixner </em>v. <em>Wixner, </em>154 Conn. 703, 704, 223 A.2d 807 (1966); see <em>Stamford </em>v. <em>Kovac, </em>229 Conn. 627, 633, 642 A.2d 1190 (1994). Although the plaintiff filed an objection to the referee\u2019s report, the proper pleading by which to have asserted the claim that the contract in issue contained a reciprocal attorney\u2019s fees clause was a motion to correct pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 438.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Under those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>circumstances, the plaintiff could have asked the referee to find the existence of a reciprocal attorney\u2019s fees clause. Because she did not bring this matter to the attention of the referee at any time, there was no fact finding in connection with this issue upon which the trial court could have acted. The trial court could render judgment only upon the facts contained within the referee\u2019s report. Practice Book \u00a7 443.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed in part and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b730-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-98 provides: \u201cforeclosure, (a) repossession.

Unless the goods can be retaken without breach of the peace, it shall be retaken by legal process, but nothing herein contained shall be construed to authorize a violation of the criminal law. In the case of repossession of any motor vehicle without the knowledge of the retail buyer, the local police department shall be notified of such repossession immediately thereafter.

If the holder of such contract does not give the notice of intention to retake, described in subsection (b), he shall retain such goods for fifteen days after the retaking within the state in which they were located when retaken. During such period the retail buyer, upon payment or tender of the unaccelerated amount due under such contract at the time of retaking and interest, or upon performance or tender of performance of such other condition as may be named in such contract as precedent to the retail buyer\u2019s continued possession of such goods, or upon performance or tender of performance of any other promise for the breach of which such goods were retaken, and upon payment of the actual and reasonable expenses of any retaking and storing, may redeem such goods and become entitled to take possession of the same and to continue in the performance of such contract as if no default had occurred. The holder of such contract shall within three days of the retaking furnish or mail, by registered or certified mail, to the last known address of the buyer a written statement of the unaccelerated sum due under such contract and the actual and reasonable expense of any retaking and storing. For failure to furnish or mail such statement as required by this section, the holder of the contract shall forfeit the right to claim payment for the actual and reasonable expenses of retaking and storage, and also shall be liable for the actual damages suffered because of such failure. If such goods are perishable so that retention for fifteen days as herein prescribed would result in their destruction or substantial injury, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply and the holder of the contract may resell the goods immediately upon such retaking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">\u201c(d) compulsory resale. If the retail buyer does not redeem such goods within fifteen days after the holder of the contract has retaken possession, the holder of the contract shall sell such goods at public or private sale which sale may be held not less than fifteen days and shall be held not more than one hundred eighty days after the retaking. When the holder of the contract retakes possession by legal process, and an answer is interposed, the holder of the contract may, at his election, hold such retaken goods for a period not to exceed thirty days after the entry of final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction entitling the holder of the contract to possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>of such goods before holding such resale. The holder of the contract shall give the retail buyer not less than ten days\u2019 written notice of the time and place of any public sale, or the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition is to be made, either personally or by registered mail or by certified mail receipted for on mailing directed to the retail buyer at his last-known place of business or residence.

In the event that the value of such motor vehicle is not stated in such publication, then the fair market value at retail minus the reasonable costs of resale shall be determined by the court. The prima facie evidence of fair market value of such motor vehicle so determined may be rebutted only by direct in-court testimony. If such value of the motor vehicle is less than the balance due under the contract, plus the actual and reasonable expenses of the retaking of possession, the holder of the contract may recover from the retail buyer, or from anyone who has succeeded to his obligations, as a deficiency, the amount by which such liability exceeds such fair market value, as defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>in this subsection.

After the holder retakes possession as provided in subsection (a), or if the holder obtains a prejudgment remedy against the goods under chapter 903a, the retail buyer or anyone who has succeeded to his obligations shall not be liable for any balance due, except to the extent permitted by subsection (g) of this section. The holder may seek a monetary judgment on the contract against the buyer unless the goods have been repossessed, with or without judicial process. Goods purchased under the contract shall not be executed upon to satisfy such judgment. When such judgment becomes final, the holder\u2019s security interest in the goods shall be extinguished. If the contract covers a retail sale of a motor vehicle required to be registered, the holder shall comply with section 14-188.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">\u201c(i) RECOVERY OF part payments. If the holder of the contract fails to comply with the provisions of subsections (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h), after retaking the goods, the retail buyer may recover from the holder of the contract his actual damages, if any, and in no event less than one-fourth of the sum of all payments which have been made under the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">\u201c(j) WAIVER of STATUTORY protection.

We disagree. Although the requirements of \u00a7 42a-9-504 are more general than those set forth in \u00a7 42-98, the record shows a total absence of any notification as to the time and place of sale or other disposition of the vehicle. This case does not present an issue as to whether the notice complied with the specific requirements of RISFA or whether it violated the relevant portions of the UCC. See <em>Gaynor </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., </em>216 Conn. 458, 582 A.2d 190 (1990). Any issue of accuracy of the notice regarding the plaintiff\u2019s right to redeem, etc. is not before us because the defendant failed to provide the plaintiff any notice at all. In light of this undisputed fact, implicit in the referee\u2019s specific findings of fact outlining all the various ways in which the more detailed notice provisions of RISFA had been violated is the referee\u2019s conclusion that the general provisions of the UCC equally had been ignored by the defendant. This finding, supported by the uncontested evidence that no notification of sale or other disposition had been provided, was a proper exercise of the referee\u2019s discretion.

This distinction played no role in the Delaware court\u2019s treatment of the issue of whether the remedy provision of \u00a7 9-507 was exclusive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b744-6\"> The trial court relied on the phrase in \u00a7 42a-9-203 (4), that \u201c[fjailure to comply with any applicable statute has only the effect which is specified therein,\u201d to limit the plaintiffs remedy to \u00a7 42-98 (i). Provisions of regulatory statutes covering the field of consumer finance, such as RISFA, prevail over article 9 of the UCC in case of conflict. The last sentence of \u00a7 42a-9-203 (4) was added \u201cto make clear that no doctrine of total voidness for illegality is intended: failure to comply with the applicable regulatory statute has whatever effect may be specified in that statute, but no more.\u201d General Statutes Ann. \u00a7 42a-9-203, comment 6 (1990). Therefore, when a conflict exists, the applicable regulatory statute, such as RISFA, will dictate the consequences that may flow from its violation. Because we have decided that no conflict exists, the limiting provision is inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b749-6\"> Following the allegations of the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the various notice provisions of RISFA and the UCC, the complaint set forth the following CUTPA claim: \u201cPlaintiff seeks . . . nominal actual and substantial punitive damages and attorneys fees under the Unfair Trade Practices Act, C.G.S. \u00a7 42-110a, the Creditors\u2019 Collection Practices Act, C.G.S. \u00a7 36-243a</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b749-7\"> See footnote 25 for Practice Book \u00a7 438 and footnote 13 for Practice Book \u00a7 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Although the plaintiff filed an objection to the referee\u2019s report, she did not challenge his factual findings. The pertinent claim contained in the objection is that the referee \u201c[ejrred in concluding that the complete failure to comply with repossession laws, or violations of the Creditor\u2019s Collection Practices Act, are not unfair or deceptive practices within the Unfair Trade Practices Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 42-110a, since defendant\u2019s intent vel non is not an element of a CUTPA violation.\u201d In her brief to this court, the plaintiff claims that the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the pertinent notice provisions \u201ccould not have been made in good faith.\u201d In order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>be reviewed, that argument first should have been made in her objection or in a motion to correct. <em>Garofalo </em>v. <em>Argraves, </em>147 Conn. 685, 687, 166 A.2d 158 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b751-7\"> The trial court accepted the referee\u2019s implicit factual finding that the defendant\u2019s noncompliance with the notice requirements of RISFA and the UCC was the result of a good faith mistake and therefore did not constitute fraud, deliberate deception or wilful misconduct. We recognize, however, that CUTPA prohibits unfair or deceptive trade practices without requiring proof of intent to deceive, to defraud or to mislead. See <em>Associated Investment Co. Ltd. Partnership v. Williams Associates IV, </em>230 Conn. 148, 158, 645 A.2d 505 (1994), and cases cited therein. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s lack of such scienter, alone, does not rescue it from CUTPA\u2019s clutches. Nevertheless, that the defendant acted in good faith does not necessarily mean that its conduct was merely a technical or inadvertent violation of RISFA or the UCC. There may indeed be circumstances when good faith statutory noncompliance sufficiently offends public policy as to constitute a CUTPA violation. Because the parties in this case have not asked specifically for this court to decide the role of good faith and bad faith in a CUTPA case, we leave that discussion for another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b752-6\"> \u201cThe doctrine of judicial notice excuses the party having the burden of establishing a fact from introducing formal proof of the fact. Judicial notice takes the place of proof. <em>Beardsley </em>v. <em>Irving, </em>81 Conn. 489, 491, 71 A. 580 (1909). A matter that may be the subject of judicial notice is one that is not subject to argument because it is already known to the court or its knowledge is easily accessible to the court, and consequently it is unnecessary and wasteful of time to require evidence of it. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomanelli, </em>153 Conn. 365, 368, 216 A.2d 625 (1966).\u201d C.
