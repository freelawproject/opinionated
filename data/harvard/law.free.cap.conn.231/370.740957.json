The defendant, the city of Stamford, moved for summary judgment on the complaint of the intervening plaintiff, United Parcel Service (UPS), and the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion. UPS thereafter appealed the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The relevant undisputed facts and procedural history are as follows. On May 18, 1987, while acting in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>course of his employment with UPS, the named plaintiff, Derrick C. Quire (plaintiff), came to stand on the curb portion of a catch basin located on the westerly side of Greenwich Avenue in Stamford. The catch basin collapsed, causing the plaintiff to fall and suffer injuries to his neck, back and knee. The plaintiff timely served on the defendant a written statement describing the accident and his injuries as required by \u00a7 13a-149. The plaintiff thereafter brought an action against the defendant under \u00a7 13a-149, alleging that his injuries were the result of the defendant\u2019s failure to maintain the curb and catch basin in a safe condition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> UPS filed a motion to intervene pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a), seeking reimbursement for benefits it had paid or had become obligated to pay to the plaintiff under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the trial court, <em>Hickey, J., </em>granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The defendant moved for summary judgment against UPS, alleging that only a \u201ctraveler\u201d may maintain an action under \u00a7 13a-149 and, in the alternative, that UPS had failed to file with the defendant the notice required by \u00a7 13a-149. The trial court, <em>Dean, J., </em>granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that UPS itself could not maintain its action against the defendant in view of the fact that UPS was not a \u201ctraveler\u201d on the allegedly defective road.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>UPS claims that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment because \u00a7 31-293 (a), not \u00a7 13a-149, defines an employer\u2019s right to join in its employee\u2019s action against a third party tortfeasor to obtain reimbursement for workers\u2019 compensation payments made to its employee. UPS concedes that only a \u201ctraveler\u201d may recover damages against a municipality under \u00a7 13a-149. See, e.g., <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 199, 592 A.2d 912 (1991); <em>Aerotec Corp. </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>138 Conn. 116, 119, 82 A.2d 356 (1951). UPS contends, however, that having properly joined in the plaintiff\u2019s action, it may maintain a derivative claim against the defendant under \u00a7 13a-149, solely to obtain reimbursement for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, because it has complied with the requirements of \u00a7 31-293 (a) and the injured employee has complied with the requirements of \u00a7 13a-149. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Section 31-293 (a) authorizes an employer to obtain reimbursement for workers\u2019 compensation benefits from a third party tortfeasor and, in so doing, implements the public policies of preventing double recovery by an injured employee; <em>Durniak </em>v. <em>August Winter &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>222 Conn. 775, 779-80, 610 A.2d 1277 (1992); and thereby containing the cost of workers\u2019 compensation insurance. In accomplishing these objectives, the statute unconditionally and unambiguously authorizes reimbursement to the employer when the employer properly intervenes in the employee\u2019s action against the third party tortfeasor and damages are recovered. Id., 780. There is no suggestion either in the plain language of \u00a7 31-293 (a) or in its legislative history that the legislature sought to limit the subrogation rights of an employer who otherwise complies with the requirements of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Moreover, \u201c[w]e have repeatedly observed that our [Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] represents a complex and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>comprehensive statutory scheme balancing the rights and claims of the employer and the employee arising out of work-related personal injuries. Because of the comprehensive nature of the act, the responsibility for carving out exceptions from any one of its provisions belongs to the legislature and not to the courts.\u201d <em>Dur-niak </em>v. <em>August Winter &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>supra, 222 Conn. 781. In the absence of such express legislative intervention, we will not assume that the legislature intended to create an exception for actions brought under the \u201chighway defect\u201d statute. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Similarly, there is no support for the defendant\u2019s claim that the legislature intended \u00a7 13a-149 to serve as a bar to an employer\u2019s right to reimbursement pursuant to \u00a7 31-293 (a) in connection with a claim by an injured employee against a municipality under the \u201chighway defect\u201d statute. In no respect is the right of UPS under \u00a7 31-293 (a) to obtain reimbursement from the defendant inconsistent with the requirement that only the plaintiff, as the injured \u201ctraveler,\u201d may recover damages under \u00a7 13a-149. The employer\u2019s claim against a municipality under \u00a7 13a-149, brought solely for the purpose of obtaining reimbursement for the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits under \u00a7 31-293 (a), is derived entirely from the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover damages against the municipality under \u00a7 13a-149. The injured \u201ctraveler,\u201d therefore, retains the exclusive right to recover damages against a municipality for injuries sustained by virtue of a defective highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s arguments, moreover, our decision in <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 179, does not suggest a different result. We concluded in <em>Sanzone </em>that the spouse of an injured \u201ctraveler\u201d may not maintain a loss of consortium claim against a municipality under \u00a7 13a-149, noting that such a claim under the \u201chighway defect\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>statute is implicitly barred by General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id., 200. There is, however, no comparable statutory prohibition against an employer\u2019s seeking reimbursement for workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to an employee who has initiated an action against a third party tortfeasor under \u00a7 13a-149. Indeed, \u00a7 31-293 (a) expressly affords an employer the right to do so. Moreover, unlike the spouse who seeks damages for loss of consortium, the employer who intervenes in its employee\u2019s action as authorized by \u00a7 31-293 (a) does not enlarge the amount of the recovery against the municipality. Rather, the employer may only obtain reimbursement for workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to its employee from any damages recovered by the employee. We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 13a-149 does not bar UPS from seeking reimbursement from the defendant under \u00a7 31-293 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">The defendant maintains, as an alternative basis upon which to affirm the judgment; see Practice Book \u00a7 4013 (a);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the trial court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment because UPS failed to provide notice of its claim against the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 13a-149. Although the defendant does not dispute that the plaintiff properly filed the notice mandated by \u00a7 13a-149, it argues that UPS was required to file a notice of its own. This claim also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>The plaintiff, as the injured \u201ctraveler\u201d alleging a violation of \u00a7 13a-149, had an obligation under that statute to file with the defendant a proper description of the accident and his injuries within ninety days from the date of the accident.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiff having done so, the defendant received in a timely manner the information to which it was entitled under \u00a7 13a-149.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because the statute requires nothing more, UPS was under no obligation to provide any additional notice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a) provides: \u201cWhen any injury for which compensation is payable under the provisions of [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] has been sustained under circumstances creating in a third person other than the employer a legal liability to pay damages for the injury, the injured employee may claim compensation under the provisions of this chapter, but the payment or award of compensation shall not affect the claim or right of action of the injured employee against the third person, but the injured employee may proceed at law against the third person to recover damages for the injury; and any employer having paid, or having become obligated to pay, compensation under the provisions of this chapter may bring an action against the third person to recover any amount that he has paid or has become obligated to pay as compensation to the injured employee. If either the employee or the employer brings an action against the third person, he shall immediately notify the other, in writing, by personal presentation or by registered or certified mail, of the action and of the name of the court to which the writ is returnable, and the other may join as a party plaintiff in the action within thirty days after such notification, and, if the other fails to join as a party plaintiff, his right of action against the third person shall abate. In any case in which an employee brings an action against a third party in accordance with the provisions of this section, and the employer is a party defendant in the action, the employer may join as a party plaintiff in the action. The bringing of any action against an employer shall not constitute notice to the employer within the meaning of this section. If the employer and the employee join as parties plaintiff in the action and any damages are recovered, the damages shall be so apportioned that the claim of the employer, as defined in this section, shall take precedence over that of the injured employee in the proceeds of the recovery, after the deduction of reasonable and necessary expenditures, including attorneys\u2019 fees, incurred by the employee in effecting the recovery. The rendition of a judgment in favor of the employee or the employer against the third party shall not terminate the employer\u2019s obligation to make further compensation which the commissioner thereafter deems payable to the injured employee. If the damages, after deducting the employee\u2019s expenses as provided in this subsection, are more than sufficient to reimburse the employer, damages shall be assessed in his favor in a sum sufficient to reimburse him for his claim, and the excess shall be assessed in favor of the injured employee. No compromise with the third person by either the employer or the employee shall be binding upon or affect the rights of the other, unless assented to by him. For the purposes of this section, the claim of the employer shall consist of (1) the amount of any compensation which he has paid on account of the injury which is the subject of the suit and (2) an amount equal to the present worth of any probable future payments which he has by award become obligated to pay on account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>of the injury. The word \u2018compensation,\u2019 as used in this section, shall be construed to include incapacity payments to an injured employee, payments to the dependents of a deceased employee, sums paid out for surgical, medical and hospital services to an injured employee, the burial fee provided by subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 31-306, payments made under the provisions of sections 31-312 and 31-313, and payments made under the provisions of section 31-284b in the case of an action brought under this section by the employer or an action brought under this section by the employee in which the employee has alleged and been awarded such payments as damages.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b395-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149 provides: \u201cAny person injured in person or property by means of a defective road or bridge may recover damages from the party bound to keep it in repair. No action for any such injury sustained on or after October 1,1982, shall be brought except within two years from the date of such injury. No action for any such injury shall be maintained against any town, city, corporation or borough, unless written notice of such injury and a general description of the same, and of the cause thereof and of the time and place of its occurrence, shall, within ninety days thereafter be given to a selectman or the clerk of such town, or to the clerk of such city or borough, or to the secretary or treasurer of such corporation. If the injury has been caused by a structure legally placed on such road by a railroad company, it, and not the party bound to keep the road in repair, shall be liable therefor. No notice given under the provisions of this section shall be held invalid or insufficient by reason of an inaccuracy in describing the injury or in stating the time, place or cause of its occurrence, if it appears that there was no intention to mislead or that such town, city, corporation or borough was not in fact misled thereby.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b396-6\"> The complaint also contained counts alleging loss of consortium and nuisance. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the nuisance count, as well as its motion for summary judgment on the loss of consortium count. The plaintiff has not appealed with respect to those counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b396-8\"> At the conclusion of the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court granted the motion without explanation, and UPS thereafter filed a motion for articulation. At a hearing on the motion for articulation, the trial court stated that the defendant was entitled to summary judgment against UPS because UPS was not a \u201ctraveler\u201d as required by \u00a7 13a-149.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b399-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) (1) Except as otherwise provided by law, a political subdivision of the state shall be liable for damages to person or property caused by . . . (C) acts of the political subdivision which constitute the creation or participation in the creation of a nuisance; provided, no cause of action shall be maintained for damages resulting from injury to any person or property by means of a defective road or bridge except pursuant to section 13a-149.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b399-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 4013 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAt the time the appellant sends a copy of the endorsed appeal form and the docket sheet to the appellate clerk, the appellant shall also send the appellate clerk an original and one copy of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">\u201c(1) A preliminary statement of the issues intended for presentation on appeal. If any appellee wishes to (A) present for review alternate grounds upon which the judgment may be affirmed . . . that appellee shall file a preliminary statement of issues within fourteen days from the filing of the appellant\u2019s preliminary statement of the issues.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b400-9\"> As we have noted, \u201c[t]he statutory notice assists a town in settling claims promptly in order to avoid the expenses of litigation and encourages prompt investigation of conditions that may endanger public safety, as well as giving the town an early start in assembling evidence for its defense against meritless claims.\u201d <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 198; see also <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Old Saybrook, </em>225 Conn. 177, 182, 621 A.2d 1322 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b400-10\"> Indeed, to require the intervening employer to file its own notice of claim pursuant to \u00a7 13a-149 would, in some instances at least, give the employee the power to preclude the employer\u2019s right to recover under the statute, by allowing the injured employee to delay notifying his employer of the injury until the ninety day period for notice under \u00a7 13a-149 had passed. This would arguably allow the employee to gain the double recovery that \u00a7 31-293 (a) aims to prevent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
