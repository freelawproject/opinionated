The plaintiff, Heyman Associates No. 1, brought suit against the defendants, the Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania (ISOP) and National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (National Union), after the defendants denied coverage based on the exclusions. Both the plaintiff and the defendants moved for summary judgment on select counts of the plaintiffs six count complaint. The trial court ruled in favor of the defendants on both motions and rendered judgment nunc pro tunc on the remaining counts. The plaintiff appealed and raises three primary issues for consideration. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The following facts are not disputed. The plaintiff is a general partnership in the business of owning and operating commercial real estate. Late in January, 1991, the United States Coast Guard discovered that a large quantity of fuel oil had leaked from the plaintiff\u2019s property into Stamford Harbor. By letter dated February 1,1991, the Coast Guard informed the plaintiff that as the party responsible for the spill, it was \u201cliable for, among other things, removal costs and damages resulting from th[e] incident.\u201d In its letter, the Coast Guard required that, inter alia, the plaintiff \u201c[ijdentify and remediate\u201d the oil\u2019s impact on the water, shoreline and affected wildlife.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, the Coast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Guard explained that under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the plaintiff\u2019s failure to remediate the incident or to comply with necessary administrative orders would subject it to substantial civil penalties. In response to the Coast Guard\u2019s letter, the plaintiff undertook the required remediation of the affected harbor area.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">On February 14, 1991, the plaintiff sent to ISOP notice of a claim on its primary comprehensive general liability insurance policy in effect with ISOP. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 19,1991, the plaintiff notified National Union of a claim on its excess liability policy in effect with National Union.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After numerous communications between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>parties concerning the fuel oil spill and purported insurance coverage, ISOP denied coverage on March 13, 1991, and National Union denied coverage on June 10, 1991. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each defendant denied coverage relying on an exclusion contained in its insurance policy with the plaintiff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>In response to the denials of coverage, the plaintiff filed in the Superior Court a six count complaint against the defendants alleging that: (1) the policies issued by the defendants provide coverage for property damage claims, and that the defendants have failed to assume their obligation under the policies to defend and indemnify the plaintiff; (2) the defendants waived any defenses to coverage that they may have had because they failed to provide the plaintiff with timely notice of their denials of coverage; (3) National Union acted in violation of the common law and General Statutes \u00a7 38a-321<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>in \u201cwrongfully] attempting] to alter and cancel the plaintiffs insurance policy after the plaintiff notified [National Union] of its claim\u201d; (4) the defendants\u2019 conduct violated General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38a-815 and 38a-816 (6) of the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act (CUIPA) <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (5) the defendants\u2019 conduct violated CUIPA under Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38a-815 and 38a-816 (1) and (2);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (6) the defendants breached their duty of good faith and fair dealing. The defendants filed an answer to the complaint, along with thirty-five \u201caffirmative defenses,\u201d on September 3, 1991. The plaintiff filed its reply to the defendants\u2019 affirmative defenses on November 13, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">On September 30,1991, the plaintiff moved the trial court to grant partial summary judgment and to declare that: (1) the defendants \u201care obligated under either or both of their insurance policies to pay on behalf of [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>plaintiff] any expenses, by way of defense and/or liability, incurred by [the plaintiff] in connection with the fuel oil product spill from [its] property into Stamford Harbor; (2) . . . [the defendants] have waived any purported defenses to coverage as a result of their untimely denials of coverage; and (3) . . . National Union violated [CUIPA] and [CUTPA].\u201d In response, on October 28,1991, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment requesting that the trial court declare that, in light of the policy exclusions, they had no duty to defend or to indemnify the plaintiff for costs arising from the fuel oil spill.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">On January 7, 1992, the plaintiff served on the defendants a set of requests for the production of documents, seeking, inter alia, broad disclosure of all writings pertaining to the existence and extent of its own insurance coverage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On February 6,1992, the defendants countered the plaintiffs motion, moving that the trial court grant a protective order authorizing them to withhold disclosure of their responses to the plaintiffs requests for production of documents. In its memorandum of decision of February 25, 1993, the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the first,* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> second,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>and fifth<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> counts of the complaint.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Further, the trial court denied the plaintiffs request to compel discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">On March 12, 1993, the plaintiff filed a motion to open the judgment and/or to reargue the trial court\u2019s decision of February 25,1993, claiming that: (1) newly received information from the commissioner of insurance revealed that the defendants had failed to file the exclusions properly, thereby invalidating the exclusions and requiring summary judgment in its favor as a matter of law; and (2) it had moved for summary judgment only on the first, second and third counts and that the trial court therefore acted improperly in rendering judgment on the first, second, fourth and fifth counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>On May 17,1993, the trial court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion, concluding that: (1) the plaintiff had waived consideration of the filing issues by failing to raise them in its memoranda in support of its motion for partial summary judgment and in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment; and (2) it properly had rendered summary judgment on those counts of the complaint that contained CUIPA and CUTPA causes of action. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and we thereafter transferred the case to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the first and second counts of the complaint, the counts related to the defendants\u2019 duty to defend and to indemnify it for claims arising from the fuel oil spill. More specifically, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erroneously granted the motion for summary judgment on the basis of its incorrect conclusion that the policy provisions excluded all coverage for its fuel oil spill into Stamford Harbor. In support of this claim, the plaintiff asserts two primary arguments: (1) that the trial court improperly interpreted the meaning of the insurance contracts and the exclusions; and (2) that the trial court wrongly found that the defendants did not waive their right to rely on the policy exclusions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">On the issue of the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the insurance contracts and the pollution exclusions, the plaintiff principally argues that the pollution exclusions do not exclude a fuel oil spill of any type. In the alternative, the plaintiff avers that even if the clauses may exclude fuel oil spills under certain circumstances, they do not exclude coverage for a spill of the particular nature involved in this case. Moreover, the plaintiff contends that, at a minimum, the exclusions are ambiguous and therefore should be interpreted against the defendants, requiring summary judgment in its favor. In opposition, the defendants argue that the pollution exclusions unambiguously exclude coverage for damages caused by the release of fuel oil into a waterway such as Stamford Harbor.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We agree with the defendants\u2019 interpretation of the exclusions and hold that coverage for the plaintiff\u2019s fuel oil spill into Stamford Harbor was excluded by the applicable exclusions. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court properly granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the first and second counts of the complaint.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">\u201cUnder our law, the terms of an insurance policy are to be construed according to the general rules of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>tract construction. See, e.g., <em>Weingarten v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>169 Conn. 502, 509-10, 363 A.2d 1055 [(1975), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Streitweiser v. Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>219 Conn. 371, 593 A.2d 498 (1991)]; <em>A. M. Larson Co. v. Lawlor Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>153 Conn. 618, 622, 220 A.2d 32 [1966]. The determinative question is the intent of the parties, that is, what coverage the . . . [plaintiff] expected to receive and what the defendant was to provide, as disclosed by the provisions of the policy. <em>Marcolini v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>160 Conn. 280, 283, 278 A.2d 796 [1971]. If the terms of the policy are clear and unambiguous, then the language, from which the intention of the parties is to be deduced, must be accorded its natural and ordinary meaning. <em>Weingarten v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 509. However, [w]hen the words of an insurance contract are, without violence, susceptible of two [equally responsible] interpretations, that which will sustain the claim and cover the loss must, in preference, be adopted. <em>Raffel v. Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>141 Conn. 389, 392, 106 A.2d 716 [1954]; see also 4 [S.] Williston, Contracts (3d Ed. [1961]) \u00a7 621.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Griswold v. Union Labor Life Ins. Co., </em>186 Conn. 507, 512-13, 442 A.2d 920 (1982); <em>see Hammer v. Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., </em>214 Conn. 573, 583-84, 573 A.2d 699 (1990). \u201c[T]his rule of construction favorable to the insured extends to exclusion clauses.\u201d <em>Griswold v. Union Labor Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 514; <em>Smedley Co. v. Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co., </em>143 Conn. 510, 513, 123 A.2d 755 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Our jurisprudence makes clear, however, that \u201c[although ambiguities are to be construed against the insurer, when the language is plain, no such construction is to be applied.\u201d <em>Izzo v. Colonial Penn Ins. Co., </em>203 Conn. 305, 309-10, 524 A.2d 641 (1987); <em>Gottes-man v. Aetna Ins. Co., </em>177 Conn. 631, 634, 418 A.2d 944 (1979); <em>Smedley Co. v. Employers Mutual Liabil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number><em>ity Ins. Co., </em>supra, 143 Conn. 513. Indeed, \u201ccourts cannot indulge in a forced construction ignoring provisions or so distorting them as to accord a meaning other than that evidently intended by the parties.\u201d <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>178 Conn. 664, 675, 425 A.2d 131 (1979); <em>Porto </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>120 Conn. 196, 200, 180 A. 289 (1935); <em>Komroff v. Maryland Casualty Co., </em>105 Conn. 402, 405, 135 A. 388 (1926); see <em>Hammer </em>v. <em>Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., </em>supra, 214 Conn. 584; <em>Horak </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>181 Conn. 614, 617, 436 A.2d 783 (1980); see also <em>Aschenbrenner </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>292 U.S. 80, 84, 54 S. Ct. 590, 78 L. Ed. 1137 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">Accordingly, in order to determine whether the exclusions within the plaintiff\u2019s policies exclude the fuel oil spill into Stamford Harbor, we must determine whether the policies are clear and unambiguous on this point. More precisely, we must examine whether the language of each policy clause clearly and unambiguously defines \u201cpollutant\u201d to include fuel oil released into a waterway such as the Stamford Harbor. If we so determine, we must then accord that language its natural and ordinary meaning. In other words, if the clauses unambiguously define \u201cpollutant\u201d to include fuel oil spilled into a waterway such as Stamford Harbor, we may not \u201cindulge in a forced construction\u201d; <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 178 Conn. 675; distorting that plain meaning. This case presents a question of first impression regarding the meaning of \u201cpollutant\u201d as expressed within the context of this exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The trial court found that the exclusion in ISOP\u2019s policy, also known as an \u201cabsolute pollution\u201d exclusion due to the breadth and depth of its exclusionary language, excludes coverage for, inter alia, \u201c \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 arising out of the alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, release or escape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>of pollutants . . . .\u201d Further, it found that the clause excludes coverage for \u201cany loss, cost or expense arising out of any governmental direction or request that you test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize pollutants.\u201d The exclusion clause also specifies that \u201c[p]ollutants means any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste material. Waste material includes materials which are intended to be or have been recycled, reconditioned or reclaimed.\u201d The trial court found that the exclusion contained in National Union\u2019s policy embodies similar exclusionary language.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">The plain language of the absolute pollution exclusion clause therefore makes clear that a liquid is an excluded \u201cpollutant\u201d if it may be characterized as an \u201cirritant\u201d or \u201ccontaminant.\u201d The dictionary defines \u201ccontaminant\u201d as \u201csomething that contaminates,\u201d and it defines \u201ccontaminate\u201d as \u201cto soil, stain, corrupt, or infect by contact or association\u201d or \u201cto render unfit for use by the introduction of unwholesome or undesirable elements.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986). Similarly, the dictionary defines \u201cpollutant\u201d as \u201csomething that pollutes ... a polluting substance, medium, or agent,\u201d and it defines \u201cpollute\u201d as \u201cto . . . impair the purity of . . . to make physically impure or unclean.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">There is no question that the introduction of fuel oil into a waterway such as Stamford Harbor \u201csoils,\u201d \u201ccorrupts,\u201d \u201cinfects,\u201d and/or \u201crenders unfit for use\u201d the affected water. Fuel oil does not naturally occur in the waters of Stamford Harbor. Moreover, it cannot seriously be disputed that the introduction of fuel oil served to \u201cimpair the purity of\u201d the water in the harbor. Indeed, the Coast Guard\u2019s swift and intensive investigation of the spill, followed by the plaintiff\u2019s substantial remediation efforts, illustrates that the presence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>of fuel oil in the harbor represents a substantial hazard to the quality of the water and to the wildlife in the area. Thus, an ordinary, lay definition of \u201cpollutant\u201d includes fuel oil spilled into a waterway such as Stamford Harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">Additionally, statutory definitions of \u201cpollutant\u201d or \u201cpollution\u201d indicate that \u201cpollutant\u201d within an absolute pollution exclusion includes fuel oil spilled into a waterway. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-451 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person, firm or corporation which directly or indirectly causes <em>pollution </em>and contamination of any land or waters of the state or causes an emergency through the discharge, spillage, uncontrolled loss, seepage or filtration of <em>oil or petroleum, . . . </em>deemed by the commissioner to be a potential threat to human health or the environment and removed by the commissioner shall be liable for all costs and expenses . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 22a-448 (4) defines \u201coil or petroleum\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 22a-451 (a) as \u201coil or petroleum of any kind or in any form including but not limited to . . . fueloil . . . .\u201d Thus, we find that the plain meaning of the exclusions demonstrates the intention of the parties to exclude from coverage as a \u201cpollutant\u201d oil spilled into Stamford Harbor.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Moreover, we find persuasive those authorities recognizing that a petroleum product, when released into a waterway, clearly constitutes a \u201cpollutant\u201d within the meaning of the absolute pollution exclusion. <em>Union Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>835 F. Sup. 59, 64-66 (D.N.H. 1993) (under New Hampshire law, gasoline that leaked into soil and ground water is \u201cpollutant\u201d within meaning of absolute pollution exclusion); <em>Guilford Industries Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>688 F. Sup. 792, 793 (D. Me. 1988) (under Maine law, fuel oil that spilled into river is \u201cpollutant\u201d within meaning of absolute pollution exclusion), aff d, 879 F.2d 853 (1st Cir. 1989); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co., </em>384 U.S. 224, 226, 86 S. Ct. 1427, 16 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1966) (\u201c[the] presence [of gasoline] in our rivers and harbors is both a menace to navigation and a pollutant\u201d); see also <em>American States Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>F.H.S., Inc., </em>843 F. Sup. 187, 189-90 (S.D. Miss. 1994) (absolute pollution exclusion unambiguously excludes coverage for harm caused by accidental release of ammonia into atmosphere).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Despite this clear and unambiguous meaning of \u201cpollutant,\u201d the plaintiff argues that we must look beyond the plain language to uncover an intended, yet unexpressed, limitation on the scope of the definition of \u201cpollutant.\u201d The plaintiff contends that because some courts have interpreted the absolute pollution exclusion as not excluding coverage in certain instances, we should not rely on the exclusions here without a clear expression of the parties\u2019 intent to include a fuel oil spill within the meaning of \u201cpollutant.\u201d Each of these cases is distinguishable and none answers whether oil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>in a waterway is a pollutant.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Further, the plaintiffs citation of cases finding an \u201cambiguity\u201d in the absolute pollution exclusion, either on its face or as applied, fails to convince us that the clause is ambiguous as applied to the particular facts of this case.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that the clear and unambiguous language of the absolute pollution exclusions excludes coverage for the plaintiffs spill of fuel oil into Stamford Harbor. Accordingly, we may not look to evidence outside the insurance contracts to vary or distort that plain meaning. See <em>Leathermode Sportswear, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>150 Conn. 63, 66, 186 A.2d 79 (1962) (\u201c[t]he effect of the [insurance] contract must be determined by the intent expressed in it and not by an extraneous intent which may be claimed or believed to have been in the minds of the parties\u201d); see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>also <em>Hammer </em>v. <em>Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., </em>supra, 214 Conn. 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The plaintiff also argues that the trial court incorrectly determined that the defendants did not waive their right to rely on the policy exclusions. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the lapse in time between the filing of its claims with the defendants and the subsequent denials of coverage amounted, as a matter of law, to a waiver of their policy defenses. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right. <em>Wadia Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hirschfeld, </em>224 Conn. 240, 251, 618 A.2d 506 (1992); <em>Olean </em>v. <em>Treglia, </em>190 Conn. 756, 772, 463 A.2d 242 (1983); <em>Multiplastics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arch Industries, Inc., </em>166 Conn. 280, 286, 348 A.2d 618 (1974); <em>Brauer </em>v. <em>Freccia, </em>159 Conn. 289, 295, 268 A.2d 645 (1970). A waiver occurs, therefore, only if there is both knowledge of the existence of the right and intent to relinquish it. <em>Novella </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>163 Conn. 552, 562, 316 A.2d 394 (1972); see 16B J. &amp; J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice (1981) \u00a7 9081, p. 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">In the insurance context, moreover, it has been recognized that \u201ca contract, under the guise of waiver, [may not] be reformed to create a liability for a condition specifically excluded by the specific terms of the policy.\u201d 16B J. &amp; J. Appleman, supra, \u00a7 9090, pp. 584-85. This limitation on the applicability of waiver to an insurance contract recognizes that because waiver requires the relinquishment of a known, and therefore existing, right within the insurance contract, a party cannot create through waiver coverage for a claim that the parties expressly had excluded from that contract. See id., p. 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Nonetheless, the plaintiff argues that we should follow the precedent of those courts recognizing, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>plaintiffs view, that an insurer may waive its right to assert an exclusion under certain circumstances. See, e.g., <em>Val Drugs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>402 F. Sup. 174 (W.D.N.Y. 1975); <em>Hartford Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Nassau, </em>46 N.Y.2d 1028, 389 N.E.2d 1061, 416 N.Y.S.2d 539 (1979). These cases are distinguishable from the present case, however, because they are based not on the requirements of waiver, but on either equitable principles of estoppel;<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> see, e.g., <em>Val Drugs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>supra, 177; or a court\u2019s interpretation of a specific statute regulating disclaimers of coverage. <em>Hartford Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Nassau, </em>supra, 1029 (citing New York insurance statute governing timeliness of disclaimers). Because the plaintiff failed to establish the elements of estop-pel at trial, it has no basis to argue estoppel on appeal and these cases are inapposite. Consequently, we find that the trial court properly rejected the plaintiff\u2019s waiver claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly denied it the opportunity to conduct discovery to oppose the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. In support of its claim, it argues that its motion for partial summary judgment \u201cis based on the premise that the exclusions at issue are limited and do not apply to fuel oil, <em>or </em>that the exclusions are ambiguous and are inapplicable as a matter of law. If this Court is not persuaded by these arguments, however, [the plaintiff] is entitled to conduct discovery to prove that the exclusions are limited and do not apply to the facts of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>case.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Further, the plaintiff contends that it may move for summary judgment on its interpretation of the policies, yet seek discovery to defend against the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the very same issue. The plaintiff specifies that it is entitled to discovery for the following reasons: (1) to prove a latent ambiguity in the absolute pollution exclusion; (2) to show the intent of the drafters of the absolute pollution exclusion; (3) to ascertain the existence of the defendants\u2019 filings with state insurance regulators or any representations made by the defendants in marketing the policies; and (4) to determine the actual terms of its policy with National Union. Although we agree in principle that a plaintiff can move for summary judgment on some claims and still receive discovery as to the remaining ones; see, e.g., <em>American Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>London &amp; Edinburgh Ins. Co., </em>354 F.2d 214, 216 (4th Cir. 1965); we find that the trial court properly denied the plaintiff further discovery in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Our analysis and holding in part I of this opinion necessarily dictates our rejection of the plaintiff's first and second discovery arguments. As we discussed therein, there is no ambiguity in the absolute pollution exclusions as applied to the facts of this case. Instead, we find that the clear and unambiguous language of the absolute pollution exclusions in the plaintiff\u2019s policies with the defendants excludes coverage for the fuel oil spill into Stamford Harbor. Discovery as to these materials is therefore inappropriate here because any evidence possibly derived from them would be inadmissible under the parol evidence rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">\u201cAs we have so often noted, the parol evidence rule is not a rule of evidence, but a substantive rule of contract law. <em>Security Equities </em>v. <em>Giamba, </em>210 Conn. 71, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>77-78, 553 A.2d 1135 (1989); <em>Damora </em>v. <em>Christ-Janer, </em>184 Conn. 109, 113, 441 A.2d 61 (1981); <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>111 Conn. 342, 346, 149 A. 851 (1930); see also 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 213, comment (a) [1981]; 3 A. Corbin, [Contracts (1960)] \u00a7 573; 4 S. Williston, [Contracts (3d Ed. 1961)] \u00a7 631. The rule is premised upon the idea that \u2018when the parties have deliberately put their engagements into writing, in such terms as import a legal obligation, without any uncertainty as to the object or extent of such engagement, it is conclusively presumed, that the whole engagement of the parties, and the extent and manner of their understanding, was reduced to writing. After this, to permit oral testimony, or prior or contemporaneous conversations, or circumstances, or usages [etc.], in order to learn what was intended, or to contradict what is written, would be dangerous and unjust in the extreme.\u2019 <em>Glendale Woolen Co. </em>v. <em>The Protection Ins. Co., </em>21 Conn. 19, 37 (1851).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">\u201cThe parol evidence rule does not of itself, therefore, forbid the presentation of \u2018parol evidence,\u2019 that is, evidence outside the four corners of the contract concerning matters governed by an integrated contract, but forbids only the use of such evidence to vary or contradict the terms of such a contract. Parol evidence offered solely to vary or contradict the written terms of an integrated contract is, therefore, legally irrelevant. When offered for that purpose, it is inadmissible not because it is parol evidence, but because it is irrelevant. By implication, such evidence may still be admissible if relevant \u2018(1) to explain an ambiguity appearing in the instrument; (2) to prove a collateral oral agreement which does not vary the terms of the writing; (3) to add a missing term in a writing which indicates on its face that it does not set forth the complete agreement; or (4) to show mistake or fraud.\u2019 <em>Jay Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ahearn Development Corporation, </em>189 Conn. 52, 56, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>453 A.2d 771 (1983). These recognized \u2018exceptions\u2019 are, of course, only examples of situations where the evidence (1) does not vary or contradict the contract\u2019s terms, or (2) may be considered because the contract has been shown not to be integrated; or (3) tends to show that the contract should be defeated or altered on the equitable ground that \u2018relief can be had against any deed or contract in writing founded in mistake or fraud.\u2019 <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Comstock, </em>3 Conn. 295, 299 (1820); see also <em>Dale </em>v. <em>Gear, </em>38 Conn. 15, 18-19 (1871) (agency, trust, equitable relation or equity may be shown by parol evidence).\u201d <em>TIE Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kopp, </em>218 Conn. 281, 288-89, 589 A.2d 329 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">Because we hold that the absolute pollution exclusions are unambiguous as applied to the facts of this case, the parol evidence rule bars the introduction of any extrinsic evidence to vary or contradict the plain meaning of the term \u201cpollutant\u201d as it is used in those exclusions. Because we determine that the plain meaning of \u201cpollutant\u201d includes fuel oil that has been spilled into a waterway such as Stamford Harbor, we may not look to extrinsic evidence of the exclusion\u2019s drafting history to find a contrary meaning.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Such evidence is \u201cirrelevant\u201d to the case. Thus, because a party is entitled to discovery only as to information material to the case or likely to lead to admissible evidence; Prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>tice Book \u00a7 218; the trial court properly denied the plaintiffs discovery request as to these materials.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">The plaintiff also argues that the trial court wrongly denied its request for discovery to prove a \u201clatent ambiguity\u201d in the absolute pollution exclusions. The plaintiff suggests that it is entitled \u201cto make a reasonable attempt to discover evidence on the issue of applying the contract to the subject matter with which it deals, and thereby raise a fact issue on latent ambiguity.\u201d See <em>CBI Industries </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>860 S.W.2d 662, 665-66 (Tex. App. 1993), writ granted, 37 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 670 (1994). Because we find that the plaintiff has failed to proffer any evidence suggesting the existence of a latent ambiguity, we conclude that the trial court correctly denied the plaintiffs request for discovery on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The concept of \u201clatent ambiguity\u201d has been described as follows: \u201cA latent ambiguity arises from extraneous or collateral facts which make the meaning of a written instrument uncertain although the language thereof be clear and unambiguous. The usual instance of a latent ambiguity is one in which a writing refers to a particular person or thing and is thus apparently clear on its face, but upon application to external objects is found to fit two or more of them equally.\u201d 4 S. Williston, supra, \u00a7 627, p. 898. In Connecticut, the vast majority of cases considering a claim of latent ambiguity have arisen in three limited contexts: (1) interpretation of statutes; see, e.g., <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 226-27, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992); <em>Elections Review Committee of the Eighth Utilities District </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>219 Conn. 685, 693-94, 595 A.2d 313 (1991); (2) interpretation of wills or trusts; see, e.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number><em>Connecticut National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>217 Conn. 260, 269-73, 585 A.2d 1189 (1991); <em>Beardsley </em>v. <em>Merry, </em>136 Conn. 573, 576-77, 72 A.2d 829 (1950); and (3) interpretation of deeds to real property. See, <em>e.g., Apostles of the Sacred Heart </em>v. <em>Curott, </em>187 Conn. 591, 598, 448 A.2d 157 (1982); <em>Young Men\u2019s Christian Assn. </em>v. <em>Zemel Bros., Inc., </em>171 Conn. 310, 311-12, 370 A.2d 937 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">In fact, the plaintiff can offer no Connecticut precedent to support its reliance on latent ambiguity. Instead, it contends that this court should follow the approach adopted by an intermediate appellate court in Texas. See <em>CBI Industries </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>supra, 860 S.W.2d 665-66. In <em>CBI Industries, </em>the plaintiff, a contractor at an oil refinery, brought suit against its various insurers seeking a declaration of coverage for claims arising from its accidental release of hydrofluoric acid into the atmosphere. Id., 664. The insurers subsequently brought a motion for summary judgment based on the absolute pollution exclusions in their insurance policies with the plaintiff. In response, the plaintiff claimed that the terms \u201cpollution,\u201d \u201cpollutants,\u201d and \u201cto pollute,\u201d were ambiguous, and that discovery was required in order to show the ambiguities and permit an accurate construction of the exclusions. Id. Thereafter, the trial court granted the motion in favor of the insurers after the plaintiff had time only to procure affidavits from its own personnel and some unauthenticated documents of testimony presented to the state insurance agency. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals of Texas reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of the motion for summary judgment. Id., 665-67. In doing so, the court held that the plaintiff was entitled to a reasonable period of time to attempt to locate evidence of a \u201clatent ambiguity.\u201d Id., 665. Further, the court listed four pieces of summary judgment evidence, including testimony before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>state insurance agency, filings made to the state and communications between third parties, to support its conclusion that the plaintiff had raised an issue of \u201clatent ambiguity.\u201d Id., 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">We decline to follow the rationale of the <em>CBI Industries </em>decision. Although the opinion couches its result in terms of \u201clatent ambiguity,\u201d its reference to extrinsic pieces of evidence such as drafting history and third party communications suggests that the court uses the phrase \u201clatent ambiguity\u201d actually to mean nothing more than \u201cvarying the plain and unambiguous language of the exclusion with extrinsic evidence of intent.\u201d In essence, this decision has little to do with external facts creating an ambiguity in otherwise clear and unambiguous language, the traditional view of latent ambiguity, but seems to require a court, regardless of the clarity of the language utilized and the absence of irreconcilable external facts, always to consider extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent. Taken to its logical conclusion, this rule likely would prohibit a motion for summary judgment on any contract claim as long as a litigant proffers some extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 unexpressed intent. Consequently, we find that the trial court properly denied the plaintiff discovery on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The plaintiff also argues that the trial court improperly denied it the opportunity to obtain discovery regarding whether the defendants had filed the exclusions with state insurance regulators and received approval for the use of those exclusions. The plaintiff contends that such discovery would show that the defendants failed to file the exclusions or to obtain approval before using them in their policies. It asserts that if the defendants had failed to file the exclusions and to receive prior approval, the exclusions are invalid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>and it would be entitled to summary judgment in its favor on the issues of the defendants\u2019 duties to defend and to indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">In its memorandum of decision on the plaintiff\u2019s motion to open the judgment and/or to reargue, the trial court found, however, that the plaintiff had waived its right to assert the defendants\u2019 alleged failure to file and receive approval for the exclusions. The trial court noted that the plaintiff, by moving for summary judgment on its claims based on the insurance contracts, necessarily represented that there existed no genuine issue of material fact on the issue of contractual interpretation and that the trial court could therefore rule on those claims as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Refusing to permit discovery on this filing issue, the trial court recognized that the plaintiff had failed to raise that particular legal argument in any of its mem-oranda in support of its motion for partial summary judgment or in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Further, the trial court determined that the plaintiff had discussed the filing and approval requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 38a-676<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> for the first time in its motion to reargue, dated March 12,1993. The trial court also emphasized that the plaintiff, before moving for partial summary judgment, should have sought and could have received full discov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>ery as to whether the defendants had filed the exclusions properly. We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the plaintiffs motion to open the judgment and/or to reargue and therefore conclude that it properly denied the plaintiff the opportunity to seek discovery on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">\u201cThe principles that govern motions to open or set aside a civil judgment are well established. Within four months of the date of the original judgment, Practice Book \u00a7 326 vests discretion in the trial court to determine whether there is a good and compelling reason for its modification or vacation. . . . <em>Gillis </em>v. <em>Gillis, </em>214 Conn. 336, 340-41, 572 A.2d 323 (1990); <em>Sanchez </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>214 Conn. 23, 35, 570 A.2d 673 (1990); <em>Acheson </em>v. <em>White, </em>195 Conn. 211, 214-15, 487 A.2d 197 (1985); <em>Steve Viglione Sheet Metal Co. </em>v. <em>Sakonchick, </em>190 Conn. 707, 713, 462 A.2d 1037 (1983). <em>Hirtle </em>v. <em>Hirtle, </em>217 Conn. 394, 398, 586 A.2d 578 (1991). In determining whether the trial court abused its discretion, this court must make every reasonable presumption in favor of its action. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bitting, </em>162 Conn. 1, 11, 291 A.2d 240 (1971); <em>E.M. Loew\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Surabian, </em>146 Conn. 608, 612, 153 A.2d 463 (1959). . . . <em>Walton </em>v. <em>New Hartford, </em>223 Conn. 155, 169, 612 A.2d 1153 (1992).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Somers </em>v. <em>Le Vasseur, </em>230 Conn. 560, 570-71, 645 A.2d 993 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Similarly, the trial court may, in its discretion, permit reargument on the judgment, and we may disturb its decision only if it is an abuse of that discretion. See <em>Ideal Financing Assn. </em>v. <em>LaBonte, </em>120 Conn. 190, 195-96, 180 A. 300 (1935). We must find such abuse of discretion if the trial court\u2019s decision results in \u201ca miscarriage of justice.\u201d Id., 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">We cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion to open the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>ment and/or to reargue. Although the plaintiff now argues that it had no meaningful opportunity to seek discovery from the commissioner of insurance and that the trial court\u2019s protective order precluded it from obtaining any information related to the filings from the defendants, it is noteworthy that the plaintiff, not the defendants, moved for summary judgment on the contract claims. Indeed, the defendants moved for and received a protective order permitting them to withhold discovery related to the insurance contracts only after the plaintiff filed its motion for partial summary judgment. We cannot find fault in the trial court\u2019s rejection of the plaintiff\u2019s pleas of insufficient time when the plaintiffs own actions had accelerated the very process of which it complained.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">Further, although the plaintiff claims that it clearly had raised this precise filing issue in its motion for partial summary judgment and supporting memoranda, our reading of the record shows that the plaintiff had sought discovery on the defendants\u2019 filings with the commissioner of insurance only to show the defendants\u2019 intent regarding the exclusionary language and to raise an issue of material fact about the actual contents of the exclusions. For example, the plaintiff cited in its memorandum in support of its motion for partial summary judgment <em>Gerrish Corp. </em>v. <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>947 F.2d 1023 (2d Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 973, 112 S. Ct. 2939, 119 L. Ed. 2d 564 (1992), which concluded that a filing with the state by an insurance rating organization bound that organization\u2019s member-insurer to the terms of its policy as amended by the filing. Because this case and the plaintiff\u2019s other references do not discuss the consequences of an insurer\u2019s failure to file an exclusion and therefore certainly did not go so far as to raise a claim that such a failure to file renders an exclusion void, we cannot hold that the trial court abused its discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>in not granting the motion to open the judgment and/or to reargue based on the force of these vague references. Our conclusion on this point is further buttressed by our determination that the exclusions are clear and unambiguous as applied to the facts of this case.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The plaintiff also claims that the trial court improperly denied it access to discovery on the issue of what pollutants exclusion, if any, can be considered part of its National Union policy. In support of this claim, the plaintiff argues that because one binder issued by National Union refers to \u201cPollution\u201d and another binder refers to \u201cAbsolute Pollution,\u201d there remains an issue of fact as to which version of the pollution exclusion was supposed to be in its policy. The plaintiff emphasizes that its inability to obtain a copy of the policy or policies reflected in the binders heightens its need for discovery to ascertain the exact policy language. We reject this argument as directly contrary to the plaintiffs own admissions and the findings of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In moving for partial summary judgment, the plaintiff expressly stated to the court that \u201cthere are no facts in dispute which would prevent this Court from ruling on either [the plaintiffs] insurance coverage or CUTPA and CUIPA claims. Therefore, summary judgment is appropriate under Connecticut law.\u201d In doing so, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>plaintiff acknowledged, in effect, that the trial court could treat its insurance coverage claim as a matter of law. See Practice Book \u00a7 384. Indeed, the plaintiff stated in its memorandum accompanying the motion that \u201c[a]s explained below, this policy [the original ten million dollar policy with National Union containing the exclusion in question] was extended to cover the period at issue in this case.\u201d Despite these clear statements to the trial court, the plaintiff later responded to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment by claiming that the actual language of its policy with National Union remained an issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">On the basis of the prior admissions of the plaintiff, the trial court permissibly disregarded the plaintiff\u2019s subsequent protest that there existed an issue of fact relating to its National Union policy. See C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 6.7.1 (discussing conclusive effect of judicial admissions). The trial court appropriately considered the affidavits and other proof in making its factual determination concerning the contents of the relevant insurance policies. As to the plaintiff\u2019s policy with National Union, the trial court found that it contained an exclusion equivalent to that in the ISOP policy. Because the plaintiff submitted ample evidence with its motion for partial summary judgment to support this determination, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous. See Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Kulesza, </em>197 Conn. 101, 105, 495 A.2d 1074 (1985). Consequently, the trial court properly denied the plaintiff\u2019s request for further discovery on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Finally, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the third, fourth and fifth counts of the complaint. The plaintiff contends that the third count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>of the complaint alleged a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 38a-816, specifically \u00a7 38a-816 (1) (f), and that the trial court mistakenly granted the motion for summary judgment against it on that count applying an analysis inappropriate to a claim under that statutory subsection. Further, the plaintiff asserts that the trial court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment on the fourth and fifth counts of the complaint because neither the defendants nor the plaintiff had moved for summary judgment on those counts. We reject these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">We have previously recognized that CUTPA and CUIPA claims both \u201cordinarily involve different factual inquiries\u201d and that \u201cthe duties ordinarily associated with them derive from different sources\u201d than claims that rely instead on an underlying insurance contract. <em>Lees </em>v. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co., </em>219 Conn. 644, 653, 594 A.2d 952 (1991). In a CUTPA or CUIPA claim, \u201cthe insurer\u2019s liability is ordinarily based on its conduct in settling or failing to settle the insured\u2019s claim and on its claims settlement policies in general. The factual inquiry focuses, not on the nature of the loss and the terms of the insurance contract, but on the conduct of the insurer. ... In a CUIPA and CUTPA claim, the insurer\u2019s duty stems not from the private insurance agreement but from a duty imposed by statute.\u201d Id. Thus, when the plaintiff moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether \u201cNational Union violated the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act\u201d and expressly stated that \u201cthere are no facts in dispute which would prevent this Court from ruling on . . . [its] CUTPA and CUIPA claims,\u201d it acknowledged that the court could treat the issue as a question of law. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 380, 384. Further, the defendants filed no affidavits in connection with this claim and thereby raised no genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>We have scrutinized the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment, the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and all the supporting memoranda, and conclude that the trial court properly rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Although the plaintiff contends that the trial court \u201cconfused\u201d the various counts in the complaint and granted summary judgment on the wrong counts, we are persuaded that the trial court carefully reviewed the plaintiff\u2019s factual allegations in light of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Moreover, it is clear that the trial court reasonably construed the plaintiff\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, and correctly ruled on the merits of those arguments presented to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">In its motion for partial summary judgment, the plaintiff moved the trial court to find that: (1) the defendants \u201care obligated under either or both of their insurance policies to pay on behalf of [the plaintiff] any expenses, by way of defense and/or liability, incurred by [the plaintiff] in connection with the fuel oil product spill from [its] property into Stamford Harbor; (2) . . . [the defendants] have waived any purported defenses to coverage as a result of their untimely denials of coverage; and (3) National Union violated the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act.\u201d The plaintiff supported this motion with a memorandum referring generally to \u201cthe Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act\u201d and \u201cthe Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act,\u201d while also referring more specifically to \u00a7\u00a7 \u201c38a-815 et seq.,\u201d \u201c38a-816\u201d and \u201c38a-816 (1) (f)\u201d of CUIPA and \u201c\u00a7 42-110 (b)\u201d of CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Although the plaintiff now claims that the third count of the complaint alleged a violation of General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>\u00a7 38a-816, that count made no mention whatsoever of that statute. The third count alleged in relevant part: \u201cNational Union\u2019s wrongful attempts to alter and to cancel insurance policies subsequent to notification of a claim from their policyholder constitute breach of contract, misrepresentation, and violations of common law as well as <em>C.G.S. Sections 88a-821, </em>all to the harm and detriment of the Plaintiff.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 38a-321 is entitled \u201cLiability of insurer under liability policy,\u201d and it is not within either CUTPA or CUIPA. It is evident that the trial court applied its CUTPA and CUIPA analysis only to the fourth and fifth counts, the two counts stating causes of action under CUTPA and CUIPA. Indeed, it became clear that the trial court had not expressly analyzed the third count in its memorandum of decision on the motion for summary judgment when it subsequently, and <em>without opposition, </em>granted judgment nunc pro tunc on the third and sixth counts. See footnote 15. Thus, this claim relating to the third count is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The plaintiff also claims that the trial court improperly granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the fourth and fifth counts of the complaint. The plaintiff contends that because it had moved for partial summary judgment only on the third count and not on the fourth and fifth counts, the trial court improperly granted the motion for summary judgment sua sponte on the fourth and fifth counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">As discussed previously, the plaintiff broadly moved in its motion for partial summary judgment that the court declare \u201cthat National Union violated the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act.\u201d By doing so, it represented to the court, in effect, that there existed no genuine issue of material fact relative to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>claims. The wording of this portion of the motion, however, implicitly created two problems for the trial court. First, the language failed to specify the particular count or counts in the complaint upon which the plaintiff was moving. Second, this language failed to articulate the specific section or sections of CUTPA or CUIPA upon which the plaintiff was relying.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">As to the first problem, it is clear from the memorandum of decision that the trial court, despite the plaintiffs numbering of this part of its motion as \u201c(3),\u201d recognized that the plaintiff was not moving for summary judgment on the third count of its complaint. As stated previously, the third count of the complaint specifically referenced only \u00a7 38a-321. Instead, the trial court correctly discerned that the substance of the plaintiffs argument related only to the fourth and fifth counts, the counts expressly referencing sections of CUTPA and CUIPA, and that the designation \u201c(3)\u201d referred only to that claim\u2019s relative position within the motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">As to the second problem, the trial court obviously treated the plaintiff\u2019s motion as one for summary judgment on the fourth and fifth counts of the complaint. In doing so, the trial court necessarily ruled on the plaintiff\u2019s claims under \u00a7 38a-816 (1), (2) and (6) of CUIPA, as well as General Statutes \u00a7 42-110 et seq. of CUTPA. The plaintiff now argues that it had moved for summary judgment only on its count grounded in \u00a7 38a-816 (1) and (2), which the plaintiff now argues is the third count but, in fact, is the fifth count of the complaint. More precisely, the plaintiff contends that the trial court: (1) improperly granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of the defendants on its claim under \u00a7 38a-816 (1) and (2); and (2) improperly had considered on the motion its claim pursuant to \u00a7 38a-816 (6) because it had not moved for summary judgment on that claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Section 38a-816 (1) prohibits misrepresentations and false advertising of insurance policies. Section 38a-816 (2) prohibits false information and advertising generally. The plaintiff alleges in its complaint that the defendants have violated, inter alia, these sections by the following conduct: their \u201cwrongful attempts to alter and to cancel the Plaintiffs insurance policies\u201d; the response to the plaintiffs notice and claims for coverage; misrepresentations as to the terms, facts, conditions, and provisions of insurance policies; false advertising; and/or false information and/or advertising generally. The factual basis for this motion was substantiated through affidavits; the defendants filed no affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues, as it did to the trial court on its motion for partial summary judgment, that National Union made two misrepresentations that \u201cinduced\u201d or \u201ctended to induce\u201d a lapse of insurance coverage in violation of \u00a7 38a-816 (1) (f).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> First, it contends that National Union\u2019s failure to issue a policy, while charging a premium, \u201ctended to induce\u201d it into letting its coverage lapse. Second, it claims that National Union misrepresented that it had failed to pay its premiums and \u201cinduced lapse\u201d by sending the cancellation notice following the claim for the fuel oh spill.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court correctly granted the motion for summary judgment on this issue because these facts, even though uncontroverted, fail to support a CUIPA claim under \u00a7 38a-816 (1) (f) and therefore fail to support a CUTPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>Although the plaintiff emphasizes that \u00a7 38a-816 (1) (f) prohibits misrepresentations inducing or tending to induce a lapse in insurance coverage, it ignores the fact that the subsection actually prohibits misrepresentations <em>\u201cfor the purpose </em>0/inducing or tending to induce . . . [a lapse in coverage.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) As a result, regardless of whether there is a misrepresentation that induces or tends to induce a lapse in coverage, the plain language of the statute permits recovery only if an insured establishes that its insurer made a purposeful misrepresentation. To show such a purposeful misrepresentation, an insured must necessarily produce evidence that the insurer acted intentionally. See <em>Wadia Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hirschfeld, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 248-49 (plaintiff must show intentional conduct to establish \u201cdishonest purpose\u201d). Because the plaintiff moved for summary judgment on this count and there were no contradictory affidavits, the court properly decided the motion by looking only to the sufficiency of the plaintiffs affidavits and other proof. See Practice Book \u00a7 384. Thus, this claim must fail because although the plaintiff places great emphasis on its uncontradicted affidavits from one of its corporate officers, the affidavits show, at most, that National Union used somewhat lax clerical or administrative procedures, and not that National Union intended to induce or to tend to induce a lapse in coverage.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> See <em>Wadia Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hirschfeld, </em>supra, 248-49 (proof of mere negligence fails to support showing of dishonest purpose); see also <em>Haesche </em>v. <em>Kissner, </em>229 Conn. 213, 216, 640 A.2d 89 (1994) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>(summary judgment appropriate if \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d person could conclude only one way).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Section 38a-816 (6) prohibits unfair claim settlement practices. Under this section of CUIPA, the claimant must allege and prove facts sufficient to show that the insurer was \u201c[cjommitting or performing [certain specified acts] with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 38a-816 (6). The plaintiff admits that it failed to show the requisite \u201cgeneral business practice\u201d under this section, but contends that it never moved for summary judgment on this issue. Moreover, it contends that it should be entitled to obtain discovery on this issue to prove a sufficient \u201cgeneral business practice.\u201d We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">As the party moving for summary judgment, the plaintiff is required to support its motion with supporting documentation, including affidavits. Practice Book \u00a7 380. Further, because the plaintiff moved on its statutory claims under CUTPA and CUIPA, it was required to identify the specific numbers of those statutes. Practice Book \u00a7 109A. Although we have held that Practice Book \u00a7 109A is directory rather than mandatory; <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Godou, </em>209 Conn. 273, 550 A.2d 1073 (1988); the purpose underlying the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 109A is instructive. \u201cThe purpose of this rule, adopted in 1979, is self-evident. No such procedural rule existed prior to that time. It was clearly designed to make future pleadings more specific, detailed and particularly informative by pinpointing statutory authority. Such a rule promotes the often expressed judicial policy of full, informative, comprehensive and open disclosure of legal claims, which promotes the <em>identification, </em>narrowing and resolution of issues before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>court.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Rowe v. <em>Godou, </em>12 Conn. App. 538, 543-44, 532 A.2d 978 (1987), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 209 Conn. 273, 550 A.2d 1073 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">In light of this policy and the plaintiffs failure to articulate its motion clearly, we cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that the trial court improperly construed the scope of the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment. Faced with a broadly worded motion and supporting memoranda containing general references to CUIPA and CUTPA, the trial court reasonably interpreted the pleadings to mean that the plaintiff sought summary judgment on all of its CUIPA and CUTPA claims. Although we acknowledge that the plaintiff made a few isolated references in its memoranda and at oral argument on the motion which might have indicated that it did not seek summary judgment on its claim under \u00a7 38a-816 (6),<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> these references must be considered in the light of the expansive language and general citations to \u201cCUTPA\u201d and \u201cCUIPA\u201d also presented to the trial court. Thus, we cannot find that the trial court\u2019s failure to interpret these references as limiting the motion constituted an abuse of discretion. Consequently, the trial court properly granted the motion for summary judgment on this claim in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>of the defendants and correctly denied the plaintiff\u2019s request for discovery.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">In this opinion Peters, C.

This policy imposed on ISOP a general duty to defend and to indemnify the plaintiff up to the policy limits on claims arising from covered \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b782-11\"> An excess liability policy, also known as an \u201cumbrella\u201d policy, provides coverage that is secondary to an insured\u2019s primary policy. Thus, coverage under an excess liability policy generally pays benefits only if the insured first exceeds the coverage limits on its primary policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">The parties agree that National Union originally sold the plaintiff an excess liability policy with an effective period of coverage from April 15, 1989, to April 15, 1990. This policy provided for coverage limits of ten million dollars. The record, however, is unclear as to whether a version of that policy, or another policy, was in effect on the dates relevant to this case. It appears from the evidence that the original policy apparently was rewrit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>ten, effective August 1, 1989, as two policies each providing for coverage limits of five million dollars through August 1, 1990. These rewritten policies were then extended to cover the period of time through August 1,1991. National Union issued binders to confirm these new policies, but the plaintiff claims that it never received the policies themselves. Nonetheless, due to confusion following the oil spill over whether National Union actually had issued the two policies providing coverage limits of five million dollars, the original policy providing for coverage limits of ten million dollars was extended by endorsement to cover the period of time in question here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b783-7\"> The parties disagree as to the nature, extent and implications of the communications between the plaintiff and ISOP during the period of time from the fuel oil spill to ISOP\u2019s eventual denial of coverage. The plaintiff contends that ISOP originally responded to its claim on the policy by sending \u201cseveral dilatory letters requesting irrelevant information\u201d and by ignoring its \u201crepeated requests\u201d for an \u201cimmediate response.\u201d ISOP retorts, however, that many of the plaintiffs purported communications actually were directed to the plaintiff\u2019s insurance brokers rather than to it. Further, ISOP suggests that it required the time and information only to determine under which policies the plaintiff was seeking coverage and to obtain those policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">The plaintiff further contends that National Union first responded to its claim by sending a notice of cancellation due to nonpayment of premium. National Union apparently had canceled the policy on the basis of an erroneous belief that the plaintiff had not paid all of the premiums. When the plaintiff protested this cancellation, however, National Union extended by endorsement the original ten million dollar policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b783-9\"> The trial court found that the exclusion in effect in the ISOP policy provided in relevant part that the policy did not apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-10\">\u201c(1) to \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 arising out of the alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, release or escape of pollutants;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-11\">\u201c(a) at or from premises you own, rent or occupy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-12\">\u201c(b) at or from any site or location used by or for you or others for the handling, storage, disposal, processing or treatment of waste material;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-13\">\u201c(c) which are at any time transported, handled, stored, treated, disposed of, or processed as waste by or for you or any person or organization for whom you may be legally responsible; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWS\">\u201c(i) to test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify, or neutralize the pollutants, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>\u201c(ii) if the pollutants are brought on or to the site or location by or for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-5\">\u201c(2) [to] any loss, cost or expense arising out of any governmental direction or request that you test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize pollutants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-6\">\u201cPollutants means any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste material.

Contamination or pollution is defined as, loss, damages, or expense caused by gas(es), liquid(s), solid(s), or radioactive material which may be harmful to human health or the environment.\u201d Because we find that the plaintiffs claim is excluded by the absolute pollution exclusion in effect in its policies with the defendants, we need not discuss whether this amendment would also exclude coverage independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">Although the plaintiff argues that the binders it received from National Union between 1989 and 1991, which refer to both a \u201cpollution\u201d clause and an \u201cabsolute pollution\u201d clause, create an issue of fact as to what \u201cversion\u201d of the exclusion actually controls this case, it is clear from the memorandum of decision that the trial courtfound to be controlling the language within the original ten million dollar policy. This is the position advanced by the plaintiff in the memorandum filed in support of its original motion for summary judgment.

We acknowledge the plaintiffs citation to cases holding that an insurer\u2019s duty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify, but we are unpersuaded that such authority is relevant when, as in this case, the exclusion clearly and unambiguously excludes coverage for fuel oil spilled into Stamford Harbor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b795-5\"> We reject the plaintiffs argument that we should look to the existence in the insurance industry of oil-specific exclusions as evidence that the absolute pollution exclusion does not include oil as a \u201cpollutant.\u201d This argument incorrectly assumes that because an insurer may offer to sell to a customer a policy with a narrowly tailored exclusion pertaining only to specific causes of damage such as oil, that same insurer cannot also offer to that customer, for a lower premium, a policy with a more broad exclusion that excludes coverage for damage caused by all types of pollution, including oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">We similarly reject the plaintiff\u2019s argument that because some environmental statutes expressly exclude oil products from their definitions of \u201cpollutant\u201d; see, e.g., Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 (14) (1986) (excluding oil from definition of \u201chazardous substances\u201d); fuel oil spilled into Stamford Harbor is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>not a pollutant within the meaning of the absolute pollution exclusion. If an environmental statute\u2019s express limitation of \u201cpollutant\u201d not to include oil bears any relevance to our inquiry, it seems to undermine rather than bolster the plaintiff\u2019s position because a legislature likely would have no need to exclude oil from the definition of \u201cpollutant\u201d unless it believed that oil was within the ordinary meaning of that term originally.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b797-4\"> The plaintiff cites <em>W.H.

Breshears, Inc. </em>v. <em>Federated Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 17, although the court refused to hold, as a matter of law, that unleaded gasoline was a \u201cpollutant\u201d within the meaning of a pollution exclusion, the court concluded that the gasoline had affected soil, not water. The court specified that \u201cthe provided authority does not support a finding that, as a matter of law, unleaded gasoline is a pollutant within the meaning of the policies at issue. The federal environmental law, both statutory and decisional, address Congress\u2019 and the California legislature\u2019s specific concerns regarding emission of oil into navigable and non-navigable waterways. The cases cited by Federated [the insurer] specifically rely on the compelling grounds for protecting the quality of the nation\u2019s waterways, including commercial trade, public health, and other environmental and even aesthetic reasons. In addition, both the federal and state statutory law address concerns of damage to waterways. In the instant case, there has been no damage to any waterway.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Similarly, in <em>McFadden, </em>the court upheld the trial court\u2019s rendering of summary judgment against the insurer on the issue of the applicability of the absolute pollution exclusion to a claim arising from the lead poisoning of children, concluding that \u201can insured could reasonably have understood the provision at issue [an absolute pollution exclusion] to exclude coverage for injury caused by certain forms of industrial pollution, but not coverage for injury allegedly caused by the presence of leaded materials in a private residence.\u201d <em>Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McFadden, </em>supra, 413 Mass. 92. Thus, <em>McFadden, </em>like <em>W.H. Breshears, Inc., </em>provides no contrary authority to the proposition that oil spilled in a waterway is a pollutant.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Finally, in <em>West, </em>the court reversed the decision of the trial court rendering summary judgment in favor of the insurer on the issue of the application of a pollution exclusion to a claim arising from a worker\u2019s inhalation of Azinphosmenthyl fumes. <em>West </em>v. <em>Board of Commissioners, </em>supra, 591 So. 2d 1361. Although that court determined that \u201cthe exclusion is applicable to \u2018polluters\u2019\u2014those who indifferently pollute our environment\u2014and not to those who only incidentally possess the pollutant in the course of their other business,\u201d it construed an exclusion with language different than that at issue in this case.

Co. </em>v. <em>Pittsburg, </em>supra, 354, the court denied the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment on the issue of whether the absolute pollution exclusions in two of the city\u2019s insurance policies excluded coverage for \u201cinjuries allegedly sustained when the City sprayed [the plaintiffs in an underlying state action against the city] with an insecticide called malathion.\u201d Criticizing that under the clauses\u2019 broad definition of \u201cpollutants\u201d \u201c[a]ny substance could conceivably be an \u2018irritant or contaminant\u2019 under the right circumstances,\u201d the court stated that \u201c[l]ack of precision in the definition of \u2018pollutants\u2019 renders the entire exclusion ambiguous.\u201d Id., 355. The plaintiff claims that this rationale applies equally to this case and that we therefore must construe that ambiguity against the defendants in favor of coverage. We reject that overbroad conclusion because it fails to recognize that many substances, including fuel oil, otherwise considered to be useful or beneficial, necessarily become \u201ccontaminants\u201d when released into the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The <em>West American Ins. Co. </em>decision does not support the plaintiff\u2019s claim of ambiguity. In that case, the court interpreted an absolute pollution exclusion identical to that in this case and found that the policy was ambiguous as applied to claims arising from property damage caused by styrene vapors. <em>West American Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tufco Flooring, </em>supra, 104 N.C. App. 320-21. In holding only that the policy was ambiguous as applied to the facts, the <em>West American Ins. Co. </em>court found that the styrene vapor damage occurred in the course of the insured\u2019s \u201cregular business activities\u201d and reasoned that \u201c[t]o allow [the insurer] to deny coverage for claims arising out of [the insured\u2019s] central business activity would render the policy virtually useless to [the insured].\u201d Id., 321. That rationale does not apply here because it is clear that fuel oil storage was not the plaintiff\u2019s central business activity and that protection from a fuel oil spill was therefore not the primary purpose of the plaintiff\u2019s policies with the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b800-6\"> \u201cThe essential elements of estoppel are that the party against whom estoppel is claimed must do or say something calculated or intended to induce another party to believe that certain facts exist and to act on that belief; and the other party must change its position in reliance on those facts, thereby incurring some injury. . . .

I disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis and conclusions on both the procedural aspects of summary judgment and the substantive issue in this case. First, I am troubled by the majority\u2019s approval of the trial court\u2019s decision to render judgment against the plaintiff when the plaintiff had moved only for a partial summary judgment and when it never had an opportunity to contest issues of fact and law on the remaining legal issues. Second, I believe the majority, like the trial court, incorrectly characterizes the word \u201cpollutants\u201d as clear and unambiguous. Finally, I believe the trial court was incorrect in refusing to allow the plaintiff to engage in discovery on certain legal issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">The availability of summary judgment as an expeditious means to resolve cases in which there is no genuine dispute between the parties about material facts is, of course, essential to the administration of civil justice. I believe the majority\u2019s holding in this case will significantly impede the effectiveness of this remedy. Indeed, as a result of this holding, parties who rely on multiple theories of liability will be reluctant to move for summary judgment on just one theory. They will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>fear\u2014quite understandably, in my view\u2014that the mere act of moving for summary judgment on certain theories of liability will make them vulnerable to summary judgment in favor of their opponents on all theories, even if those other theories require discovery or involve significant factual disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">The plaintiff, Heyman Associates No. 1, brought this action against the defendants, the Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania (ISOP) and the National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (National Union), in six counts. In order, the counts alleged that, first, the insurance contracts required coverage of the plaintiffs claim; second, the defendants had waived the right to contest coverage; third, the defendants had violated General Statutes \u00a7 38a-321; fourth, the defendants had violated the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act (CUIPA)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in particular General Statutes \u00a7 38a-816 (6), which prohibits unfair claim settlement practices; fifth, the defendants had violated CUIPA and CUTPA, in particular General Statutes \u00a7 38a-816 (1), which prohibits misrepresentations and false advertising of insurance policies, and \u00a7 38a-816 (2), which prohibits false information and advertising generally; and sixth, the defendants had breached a covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The plaintiff thereafter moved for partial summary judgment. In its memorandum of law in support of its motion, the plaintiff made clear that it was seeking summary judgment only on the issues of whether the insurance contract provided coverage and whether the defendant had waived the right to contest coverage. The plaintiff also indicated that it was moving for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>summary judgment on the issue of whether only one of the defendants, National Union, had \u201cviolated [CUIPA and CUTPA] by wrongfully withholding a copy of the insurance policy sold to [the plaintiff] and by attempting to cancel [the plaintiff\u2019s] insurance coverage after [the plaintiff] gave notice of the claim . . . .\u201d More specifically, the plaintiff argued that National Union had violated \u00a7 38a-816 (1) (f).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The defendants responded by filing a cross motion for summary judgment. The language of the cross motion itself pertained only to the contract\u2019s coverage<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the accompanying affidavit and exhibits pertained only to that issue. In their memorandum of law in support of their motion and in opposition to the plaintiff\u2019s motion, however, the defendants also discussed whether they had waived their right to exclude coverage and whether National Union had violated \u00a7 38a-816 (1) (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Considering these motions in light of the allegations set forth in the complaint, the parties moved for summary judgment <em>at most </em>on (i) one legal theory pertaining to the first count, (ii) the second count, and (iii) that very limited portion of the fifth count that had alleged a violation by one of the two defendants, National Union, of \u00a7 38a-816 (1) (f). In other words, several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>counts remained on which neither the plaintiff nor the defendants had moved for summary judgment. These included other theories of liability under the first count; the third,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> fourth and sixth counts; and that portion of the fifth count that had alleged violations by National Union of \u00a7 38a-816 (2) and \u00a7 38a-816 (1) (a) and (e), and all of the fifth count with respect to the other defendant, ISOP.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">Nevertheless, after oral argument on the motions, the trial court rendered summary judgment against the plaintiff and in favor of the defendants on all counts of the complaint.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In other words, the trial court rendered summary judgment for the defendants on theories of liability and counts on which neither party had sought summary judgment and on which neither party had the opportunity to present affidavits of fact or to argue the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">I have been unable to find any authority in this state, in either appellate or trial court decisions, for the proposition that a court may render summary judgment on issues in favor of a party who did not move on those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>issues. Nevertheless, I do not disagree with the theoretical application of such a rule. If both sides agree that there are no genuine issues of fact in dispute and that the court may render judgment as a matter of law, the mere fact that a party has neglected to file a cross motion on all the counts or on all theories of liability within a count should not prevent the court from rendering judgment. After all, \u201cthe form of the pleadings should not place a limitation upon the power of the court to do justice.\u201d 6 J. Moore, Federal Practice (2d Ed. 1994) \u00a7 56.12, p. 56-161. Moreover, federal courts have long followed such a rule; see, e.g., <em>Coach Leatherware Co. </em>v. <em>Anntaylor, Inc., </em>933 F.2d 162 (2d Cir. 1991); <em>Lowenschuss </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>520 F.2d 255 (2d Cir. 1975); and our state summary judgment rule is closely patterned after the federal rule. <em>Plouffe </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>160 Conn. 482, 280 A.2d 359 (1971); <em>New Haven Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Research Associates, Inc., </em>153 Conn. 118, 214 A.2d 375 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The mere theoretical existence of such a rule, however, does not mean that a court may apply it haphazardly in any situation in which a party has moved for partial summary judgment. Indeed, \u201cwhenever the court believes that the nonmoving party is entitled to judgment, great care must be exercised to assure that the original movant has had an adequate opportunity to show that there is a genuine issue and that his opponent is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d 10A C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure (2d Ed. 1983) \u00a7 2720, p. 34; see J. Moore, supra, \u00a7 56.12, p. 56-165 (\u201c[c]are should, of course, be taken by the . . . court to determine that the party against whom summary judgment is rendered has had a full and fair opportunity to meet the proposition that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be tried, and that the party for whom summary judgment is rendered is entitled thereto as a matter of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>In this case, it is absolutely clear that the plaintiff neither conceded that there were no material facts in dispute nor had an opportunity to rebut the court\u2019s consideration of judgment for the nonmoving party. On the contrary, several facts evident in the record indicate that the plaintiff was taking all necessary steps to go forward with the prosecution of the balance of its case when the trial court abruptly rendered summary judgment against it on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">First, as indicated above, the plaintiff\u2019s motion sought summary judgment on only a limited number of the allegations in its complaint. The plaintiff obviously believed that only these counts or legal theories were appropriate for summary judgment, and that it would have to go to greater lengths\u2014such as engaging in extended discovery or conducting a trial on the merits\u2014in order to pursue the remaining counts. Indeed, the plaintiff\u2019s memorandum of law in support of its motion for partial summary judgment clearly limited the subject matter of the motion to the issues I have identified above.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Second, the plaintiff emphasized to the trial court at the hearing on its motion for partial summary judgment that only a portion of the complaint was before the court. As the plaintiff explained to the court: \u201cIn summary, Your Honor, [the plaintiff] seeks summary judgment on three of the six counts and no matter how the court rules on those three counts there are three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>remaining counts, that according to the Connecticut Supreme Court . . . since those counts involve proving a general business practice under the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, the lead court said that those acts are separate from the policy and, therefore, [the plaintiff] is entitled to recovery on these other counts . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Third, the plaintiff had requested discovery on several of the remaining issues in the complaint, including the general business practices of the defendants in settling claims. This issue, of course, was enumerated in count four of the complaint, a count not advanced by either the plaintiff or the defendants in their motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Fourth, even as to the first count, the plaintiff had sought discovery on alternate theories of liability, including whether the defendants had complied with state insurance laws.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Despite the plaintiffs entreaties, the trial court nevertheless rendered summary judgment against the plaintiff on all counts, effectively putting the plaintiff out of court. Making the trial court\u2019s action particularly egregious was the fact that the sole affidavit submitted by the defendants pertained only to the first count of the complaint. The trial court later justified its action, however, by suggesting that simply by moving for partial summary judgment, the plaintiff had \u201crepresented to the court that no genuine issues of material fact existed,\u201d and that the court therefore was entitled to render judgment on every count in the complaint.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>There is nothing in our Practice Book to suggest that a party, merely by moving for partial summary judgment, thereby admits that there are no genuine issues of material fact remaining on all other allegations of its complaint. See Practice Book \u00a7 378 et seq. Although the Practice Book does provide that a court may render judgment only \u201cif the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\u201d; Practice Book \u00a7 384; this provision cannot be twisted to mean that a motion for partial summary judgment is equivalent to an implicit representation by the moving party that there is no question of fact on different theories of liability or defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">This simply is not a proper statement of the law. If it were, summary judgment would become merely a dangerous trap for the unwary litigant. Indeed, if this were the law, a litigant who might have several legal theories to support his position would be reluctant to move for summary judgment on any single theory because, merely by doing so, he would be exposing himself to an adverse summary judgment on all other theories for which discovery was necessary or in which there was a factual dispute. Motions for summary judgment, therefore, would lose much of their effectiveness for limiting issues or disposing of litigation on a theory for which there is no factual dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The majority claims that it is justified in upholding the trial court because the plaintiff stated in its brief that \u201cthere are no facts in dispute which would prevent this Court from ruling on either [the plaintiffs] insurance coverage or CUTPA and CUIPA claims.\u201d The majority equates this to a judicial admission. That statement, however, when read in the context of the plaintiffs brief, does not support the majority\u2019s position. The plaintiff made this statement on the last page <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>of its memorandum of law in support of its summary judgment motion. The opening statement of the plaintiffs memorandum of law in support of its motion, as I previously pointed out,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> had focused only on counts one, two and that portion of count four in which the plaintiff moved for summary judgment against National Union under \u00a7 38a-816 (1) (f) of CUIPA and, correspondingly, CUTPA. The plaintiffs concluding statement, that \u201cthere are no facts in dispute which would prevent this Court from ruling on either [the plaintiff\u2019s] insurance coverage or CUTPA and CUIPA claims,\u201d obviously referred only to the claims it had advanced in support of its motion and not to all of the other counts or theories of liability it had alleged in its complaint. Furthermore, even if the plaintiff had conceded the facts on all counts of its complaint, it still had a right to be heard by the trial court on the issues of law. The plaintiff was never afforded this opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The majority\u2019s rush to judgment in this case is troubling. The trial court\u2019s rendering of summary judgment for the defendants on all counts of the complaint has deprived the plaintiff of fundamental justice and the right to be heard in a meaningful manner. But the majority\u2019s decision to uphold the trial court\u2019s decision will not be limited to this plaintiff or to this case. The effects of the court\u2019s decision today will reverberate through Connecticut practice and, inevitably, will dissuade future litigants from moving for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Aside from my concern with the summary judgment aspects of this case, I believe that the word \u201cpollutants\u201d in the exclusion clauses of the insurance policies at issue is far from being clear and unambiguous. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>court, therefore, should not have rendered summary judgment for either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">Several courts have arrived at quite different meanings when interpreting clauses with identical or very similar language to the exclusion in issue here. In <em>West-chester Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pittsburg, </em>794 F. Sup. 353 (D. Kan. 1992), aff d sub nom. <em>Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pittsburg, </em>987 F.2d 1516 (10th Cir. 1993), the court ruled that an exclusion identical to the one involved in this case was ambiguous. Noting that the term \u201cpollutants\u201d was broadly defined as \u201c \u2018any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste,\u2019 \u201d the court held that the \u201c[l]ack of precision in the definition of \u2018pollutants\u2019 renders the entire exclusion ambiguous.\u201d Id., 354, 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">In <em>West </em>v. <em>Board of Commissioners, </em>591 So.2d 1358, 1360 (La. App. 1991), the court held that an exclusion with nearly identical language to the clause in this case<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> applied only to \u201cthose who indifferently pollute our environment\u2014and not to those who only incidentally possess the pollutant in the course of their other business . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Finally, <em>in Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McFadden, </em>413 Mass. 90, 595 N.E.2d 762 (1992), the court explained that an identical exclusion, when read in its entirety, was limited in its effect. \u201c[T]he terms used in the pollution exclusion, such as \u2018discharge,\u2019 \u2018dispersal,\u2019 \u2018release,\u2019 and \u2018escape,\u2019 are terms of art in environmental law which generally are used with reference to damage or injury caused by improper disposal or containment of hazardous waste.\u201d Id., 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">These cases make clear that it is impossible for a court to say that the term \u201cpollutants\u201d in an exclusion such as is involved here is perfectly clear and unambiguous. Indeed, the well reasoned opinions of these courts reveal that such clauses are susceptible to multiple interpretations.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Furthermore, the majority cannot bolster its already strained analysis of the pollution exclusion by relying on General Statutes \u00a7 22a-451 (a). That provision imposes liability on a party who \u201ccauses <em>pollution . . . </em>through the discharge, spillage, uncontrolled loss, seepage or filtration of <em>oil or petroleum . . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The majority relies on this provision to suggest that pollution therefore includes oil and petroleum in all equivalent situations. As the court correctly recognizes elsewhere in its opinion, however, such an argument \u201cseems to undermine rather than bolster\u201d its argument, because \u201ca legislature likely would have no need\u201d to enumerate oil or petroleum as a form of pollution unless it believed that oil or petroleum was originally outside the ordinary meaning of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">It is clear, therefore, that the trial court should have allowed the parties to introduce extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of the clause that the parties actually intended; see <em>Bead Chain Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Saxton Products, Inc., </em>183 Conn. 266, 272-73, 439 A.2d 314 (1981); and summary judgment should not have been rendered for either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">In addition to arguing that the exclusion is ambiguous, the plaintiff raised two other theories of liability on the insurance contract which would have required discovery. First, the plaintiff argued that it required discovery to prove a latent ambiguity in the language of the exclusion. Second, the plaintiff argued that the clause was ineffective because the defendants had failed to comply with state insurance laws. I believe the trial court should have allowed the plaintiff an opportunity to conduct discovery on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The majority dismisses in summary fashion the plaintiffs argument that the exclusion is latently ambiguous and, therefore, that the trial court should have allowed the plaintiff discovery to gather evidence of the parties\u2019 intent. According to the rather tortured analysis supplied by the majority, the trial court was justified in its decision because (1) traditionally, latent ambiguity exists where a writing is apparently clear on its face, but upon application to external objects is found to fit two or more equally; (2) the plaintiff \u201ccan offer no Connecticut precedent to support its reliance on latent ambiguity\u201d; and (3) out-of-state precedents cited by the plaintiff fail to comport with the traditional view of latent ambiguity. None of these premises, however, is completely accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">First, although the majority has properly quoted a \u201ctraditional\u201d definition of latent ambiguity, it fails to recognize that other scholars and courts, including this court, have either defined or applied the concept differently. Professor Hunter, for example, has noted that \u201clatent ambiguity arises when the language of the contract can be construed in two or more ways, both or all of which are compatible with the language used.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>H. Hunter, Modern Law of Contracts (1993) \u00a7 7.03 [2] [a], pp. 7-12-7-13. The Texas Supreme Court explained that under the latent ambiguity rule, \u201ceven though a written contract be unambiguous on its face, parol evidence is admissible for the purpose of applying the contract to the subject with which it deals; and if by reason of some collateral matter an ambiguity then appears, proof of the facts and circumstances under which the agreement was made is admissible, in order that the language used in the contract may be read in the light thereof for the purpose of ascertaining the true intention of the parties as expressed in the agreement.\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Dilworth, </em>137 Tex. 32, 36, 151 S.W.2d 1004 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">This court, moreover, has used the term \u201clatent ambiguity\u201d to encompass ambiguity in the plain language of an insurance policy, regardless of how that language applies to external facts. In <em>Beach </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>205 Conn. 246, 247, 532 A.2d 1297 (1987), this court held that \u201cthere is latent ambiguity in the term \u2018collapse\u2019 in a homeowner insurance policy.\u201d Chief Justice Peters, writing for the majority, acknowledged that the defendant insurance company had offered a plausible interpretation of that term as meaning \u201ccasualty of a sudden and cataclysmic nature.\u201d Id., 251. The court concluded, however, that \u201can alternate reading is equally reasonable, and that is sufficient to defeat the defendant\u2019s claim of error.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Second, contrary to the assertion of the majority, this court has expressly recognized the validity of the doctrine of latent ambiguity to allow a court to use extrinsic evidence to interpret the provisions of a contract. In <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Remington Electric Shavers, </em>179 Conn. 494, 500, 427 A.2d 810 (1980), this court acknowledged that \u201cit is true that extrinsic evidence is admissible to assist the court in resolving the question of intent where the terms of a written contract are either latently or patently ambiguous . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>Finally, while it is arguable that the out-of-state decisions cited by the plaintiff do not comport with the \u201ctraditional\u201d view of latent ambiguity, they certainly do comport with the other definitions proffered by scholars and courts. In fact, the decision by the Texas Court of Appeals in <em>CBI Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>860 S.W.2d 662 (Tex. App. 1993), writ granted, 37 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 670 (1994), comports with such a view and is directly on point with this case. In <em>CBI Industries, Inc., </em>the plaintiff argued that the words \u201cpollution,\u201d \u201cpollutants\u201d and \u201cto pollute\u201d in an insurance exclusion were ambiguous and, as a consequence, that summary judgment for the defendants was inappropriate. Id., 664. The Texas court, reciting the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s definition of latent ambiguity <em>in Murphy </em>v. <em>Dilworth, </em>supra, 137 Tex. 36, held that the plaintiff \u201cwas entitled to attempt to show a latent ambiguity in the exclusions\u201d and that summary judgment was therefore inappropriate. <em>CBI Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>supra, 665-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">Accordingly, I would hold that the trial court should have allowed the plaintiff an opportunity to discover evidence of the parties\u2019 intent before rendering summary judgment for either party.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Finally, the trial court should have allowed the plaintiff to conduct discovery on the issue of whether the defendants had complied with state insurance law by filing the exclusionary clauses with the state insurance commission. Our rules of practice make clear that \u201c[sjhould it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that he cannot, for reasons stated, present facts essential to justify his opposition, the court may deny the motion for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 382. Discovery was essential in order for the plaintiff both to prosecute and to counter the defendants\u2019 arguments on the legal theories that the plaintiff did not advance under its motion for partial summary judgment. <em>See American Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>London &amp; Edinburgh Ins. Co., </em>354 F.2d 214, 216 (4th Cir. 1965). Indeed, the plaintiff had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>repeatedly requested discovery, but the court granted a protective order that shielded the defendants from these requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">After the trial court rendered summary judgment against the plaintiff on all counts, the plaintiff asked the court to open the judgment. The plaintiff argued, inter alia, that it never had an opportunity to conduct discovery on the issue of whether the defendants had complied with state insurance law by filing the exclusionary clauses with the state insurance commission. The trial court, however, denied the plaintiffs motion, concluding that the plaintiff had never raised this issue prior to the court\u2019s rendering of summary judgment and therefore had waived it.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The record, however, clearly shows that the plaintiff did indeed raise this issue early in the proceedings. First, the plaintiff had demonstrated, in its memorandum in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for a protective order to prohibit discovery, that it had attempted to obtain this information from the insurance commissioner and had even attempted to invoke the aid of the freedom of information commission months before the trial court\u2019s decision on the motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Second, in its reply memorandum of law in sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>port of its motion for partial summary judgment, the plaintiff had argued that it \u201cshould be afforded an opportunity to conduct discovery of the statutory filings affecting [the] defendants\u2019 policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The majority, perhaps recognizing that the trial court was incorrect on this point, nevertheless holds that the court properly rejected the plaintiff\u2019s discovery request because the plaintiff, by moving for partial summary judgment, \u201caccelerated the very process of which it complained,\u201d because the record demonstrated \u201cthat the plaintiff had sought discovery on the defendants\u2019 filings with the commissioner of insurance only to show the defendants\u2019 intent regarding the exclusionary language,\u201d and because the plaintiff did not \u201cdiscuss the consequences of an insurer\u2019s failure to file an exclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">There are several problems with the majority\u2019s cursory analysis of this claim of error. First, the plaintiff made clear to the trial court that, while it was moving for summary judgment on certain counts and certain theories of liability, it nevertheless was seeking discovery on other counts and other theories of liability.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>mere fact that the plaintiff moved for summary judgment on certain theories of liability, therefore, should not have barred it from discovery on all theories of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">Second, the majority makes no reference to the record for its bold assertion that the plaintiff sought discovery on the insurance commission filings only to demonstrate the intent of the drafters of the provision. Instead, the majority merely notes that the plaintiff, in its memorandum of law in support of its motion for partial summary judgment, had cited <em>Gerrish Corp. </em>v. <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>947 F.2d 1023 (2d Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 973, 112 S. Ct. 2939, 119 L. Ed. 2d 564 (1992). <em>Gerrish Corp., </em>however, does not support the majority\u2019s conclusion for two reasons. First, <em>Gerrish Corp. </em>did not even address the evidentiary value of an insurance filing as a measure of the intent of the exclusion\u2019s drafters. Rather, <em>Gerrish Corp. </em>held that the terms of an insurance policy had been amended by a filing made with the state insurance commission by an agent of the insurer. Second, the plaintiff obviously cited <em>Gerrish Corp. </em>merely to demonstrate the importance of allowing discovery on these filings. Indeed, the plaintiff introduced its discussion of that case by noting: \u201cPerhaps the most recent example of the value of discovery in these cases is <em>Gerrish [Corp.] . . . </em>.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Finally, it is settled law that discovery is to be liberally allowed, and that a party may seek discovery on any issue that is \u201cmaterial to the subject matter involved in the pending action\u201d and \u201cif the disclosure sought would be of assistance in the prosecution or defense of the action.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 218. Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>\u201c[i]t shall not be ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 218. Under this standard, the trial court should have allowed the plaintiff to conduct discovery on the issue of the defendants\u2019 filings with the state insurance commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-815 et seq.; see footnote 7 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b822-6\"> Contrary to the majority\u2019s sweeping statement that the plaintiff had filed only \u201ca broadly worded motion and supporting memoranda containing general references to CUIPA and CUTPA,\u201d \u00a7 88a-816 (1) (f) was the only specific provision that the plaintiff contended National Union had violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\"> The defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was worded as follows: \u201cPursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 378 et seq., the defendants, Insurance Company of the State of Pennsylvania (ISOP) and National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. (National Union), hereby move that the Court grant their Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and declare that [the] Defendants have no obligation to provide coverage for defense and/or indemnity costs that Heyman Associates has or will incur in connection with the fuel oil spill from Heyman Associates\u2019 property in the Stamford Harbor, Stamford, Connecticut.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b823-6\"> I agree with the majority that the plaintiff\u2019s argument that it moved for summary judgment on, inter alia, count <em>three </em>of the complaint is wholly without merit.

This statute does not lie within either CUIPA or CUTPA and, in fact, has nothing to do with either act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\"> In count five of its complaint, the plaintiff enumerated those acts and practices of National Union which it believed violated \u00a7 38a-816 (1) and (2). \u201cThese acts and practices include but are not limited to: any of the conduct alleged in this complaint, including but not limited to wrongful attempts to alter and to cancel [the] Plaintiff\u2019s insurance policies; the response to [the] Plaintiffs notice and claims for coverage; misrepresentations as to the terms, facts, conditions, and provisions of insurance policies; false advertising; and/or false information and/or advertising generally.\u201d Within \u00a7 38a-816, subsections (a) and, possibly, (e) are the only subsections other than subsection (f) to which this description might apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b823-8\"> For reasons I will explain in part II of this dissent, I agree that the trial court would have been correct in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the three counts on which it had moved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b825-6\"> The opening paragraph of the plaintiffs memorandum of law in support of its motion provided in part: \u201cBy this motion, [the plaintiff] seeks the following declarations: (1) that [the] defendants . . . are obligated under either or both of their insurance policies to pay for any expenses incurred by [the plaintiff], by way of defense and/or liability, in connection with the fuel oil product spill; (2) that [the defendants] have waived any purported defenses to coverage as a result of their untimely denials of coverage; and (3) that National Union violated [CUIPA and CUTPA] by wrongfully withholding a copy of the insurance policy sold to [the plaintiff] and by attempting to cancel [the plaintiffs] insurance coverage after [the plaintiff] gave notice of the claim that is the subject matter of this action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b826-7\"> See part III B of this dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b826-8\"> The court made this statement in its memorandum of decision refusing to open the judgment or to hear reargument on the motions for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b828-7\"> See footnote 8 of this dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b829-6\"> The majority attempts to distinguish this holding by suggesting that the court in <em>West </em>\u201cconstrued an exclusion with language different than that at issue in this case.\u201d Any differences, however, are strictly cosmetic and of no legal significance. In <em>West, </em>the clause excluded coverage for injury \u201carising out of the discharge, dispersal, release or escape of smoke, vapors, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, toxic chemicals, liquids or gases, waste materials or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants . . . .\u201d <em>West </em>v. <em>Board of Commissioners, </em>supra, 591 So.2d 1360. The exclusion in this case merely breaks down that clause into two smaller and more readable parts. The clause first excludes coverage for injury \u201carising out of the alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, release or escape of pollutants.\u201d The clause then defines \u201cpollutants\u201d as \u201cany solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste material.\u201d The exclusions in the two cases, therefore, perform the same function in virtually identical ways.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b833-5\"> While it is true that under the \u201cFour Corners\u201d doctrine a court may not consider any extrinsic evidence unless a contract is ambiguous, the more modem view, propounded by Professor Corbin, recognizes that \u201cthe meaning of language may vary greatly according to the circumstances\u201d and that \u201call language is infected with ambiguity and vagueness and that even language that seems on its face to have only one possible meaning may take on a different meaning when all the circumstances are disclosed . . . .\u201d E. Farnsworth, Contracts (1990) \u00a7 7.12, pp. 277-78. Under this theory, extrinsic evidence is always available to be used for interpreting the intent of the parties. Id., p. 272. After all, as Professor Corbin observed, \u201c[n]o contract should ever be interpreted and enforced with a meaning that neither party gave it.\u201d 3 A. Corbin, Contracts (Sup. 1993) \u00a7 572B, p. 427; see 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 212, comment (b), and \u00a7 209, com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>ment(a) (1981); see also Uniform Commercial Code, General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">In <em>Sims </em>v. <em>Honda Motor Co., </em>225 Conn. 401, 623 A.2d 995 (1993), this court embraced Corbin\u2019s modern approach. In <em>Sims, </em>we interpreted the meaning of a general release agreement signed by the injured plaintiff. The plaintiff had signed the contract with the intent of releasing only one defendant from liability, but the contract expressly discharged from liability \u201cany and all\u201d other parties from \u201cany and all\u201d claims arising from the incident. Id., 404. Chief Justice Peters, writing for the majority, declined to enforce the plain meaning of the all encompassing release, and instead adopted a Corbin-like approach which \u201cprovides for consideration of extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 actual intent and does not confine interpretation of the release to its four corners.\u201d Id., 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Under this view, of course, the trial court in this case should not have rendered summary judgment for either party without first considering extrinsic evidence which may have shed light on the meaning they attached to the word \u201cpollutants\u201d at the time they formed their contract. Such extrinsic evidence may properly have included evidence of usage of the trade, including any pollution exclusions that the defendants and other insurance companies had utilized, as well as communications between the parties prior to the signing of the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b835-6\"> In its opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for a protective order dated April 13, 1992, the plaintiff attached to its objection the following affidavit of its attorney: \u201c3.
