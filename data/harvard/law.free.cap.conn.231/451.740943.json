The defendant Westwood Park, Inc. (Westwood), applied to the commission for a wetlands permit in connection with its proposed development of certain property in Tolland. The commission granted Westwood\u2019s application for a permit without conducting a public hearing. The plaintiff, which owns land adjacent to the subject property, appealed from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>commission\u2019s decision to the trial court, which dismissed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the plaintiffs appeal. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">The relevant facts are as follows. In September, 1991, Westwood applied to the Tolland planning and zoning commission for a permit to develop a twenty-eight acre parcel of property located on Dockerel Road. Westwood proposed to develop the property, comprised primarily of woodlands, into a fifteen lot residential subdivision. In conjunction with that application, Westwood also sought a permit from the inland wetlands commission to build a road across certain wetlands located on the property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Westwood\u2019s application for a wetlands permit indicated that the construction and maintenance of the road as proposed would result in the disturbance of less than one acre<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of those wetlands.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Westwood\u2019s application for a wetlands permit was considered by the commission at its meeting on October 3,1991. The commission took no action on the application at that time, however, deciding instead to obtain and review additional information concerning the impact of the proposed road construction on the wetlands. Following discussion of the application at its October 17,1991 meeting, the commission invited the plaintiff to participate in future meetings and to comment upon Westwood\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The plaintiff is a club whose members use its property primarily for hunting and fishing. The property contains two ponds stocked with trout and several streams that cross the boundary onto Westwood\u2019s property at several points. The plaintiff, concerned that Westwood\u2019s proposed development would harm the water quality of those streams and ponds, opposed Westwood\u2019s application for a wetlands permit at the commission\u2019s meetings on October 17, November 7, November 21 and December 5,1991.* <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Members of the plaintiff club attended each of those meetings, and its president submitted two letters to the commission, including an analysis of the water quality of the wetlands that the plaintiff claimed would be adversely affected by Westwood\u2019s proposed development. In addition, JoAnn Paul, an attorney for the plaintiff, and Barbara Obeda, an environmental systems analyst retained by the plaintiff, testified at the commission meeting on December 5, 1991, concerning the potential adverse impact of the proposed development on the surrounding wetlands.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The commission approved Westwood\u2019s application for a wetlands permit on December 5,1991. The commission concluded that Westwood\u2019s proposal did not constitute a \"significant activity\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2.1aa of the Tolland inland wetlands and watercourses regulations (wetlands regulations)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, therefore, that no public hearing was necessary under \u00a7 9.1<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of those regulations. The plaintiff appealed from the commission\u2019s decision to the Superior Court, claiming that the commission was required to conduct a public hearing on Westwood\u2019s application for a wetlands permit pursuant to Tolland\u2019s wetlands regulations and, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>the alternative, that the commission was required to give notice of its intent to waive a public hearing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-39 (k).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiffs appeal. On appeal to this court, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the commission had not been required: (1) to conduct a public hearing on Westwood\u2019s application for a wetlands permit under the Tolland wetlands regulations; and (2) to publish notice of its intent to waive a public hearing on West-wood\u2019s application pursuant to \u00a7 22a-39 (k). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly determined that the record of the proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>before the commission supports the commission\u2019s decision to grant Westwood\u2019s application for a wetlands permit without conducting a public hearing. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Section 9.1 of the Tolland wetlands regulations requires the commission to hold a public hearing on any application for a wetlands permit that involves a \u201csignificant activity.\u201d Section 2.1aa of those regulations defines \u201csignificant activity\u201d as any activity \u201cwhich may have a substantial effect on the area for which an application has been filed or on another part of the inland wetland or watercourse system. . . .\u201d See footnote 7. Section 2.1aa also lists seven activities as examples<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> of the type of activities that may have a \u201csubstantial effect\u201d on wetlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The plaintiff claims that because the development proposed by Westwood involves several of the regulated activities enumerated in \u00a7 2.1aa,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the commission could not properly have concluded that Westwood\u2019s application for a wetlands permit did not involve a \u201csignificant activity.\u201d This argument, however, ignores the definition of \u201csignificant activity\u201d in \u00a7 2.1aa as an activity that \u201cmay have a substantial effect\u201d on wetlands. An activity that may affect wetlands, therefore, is not a \u201csignificant activity\u201d within the meaning of the Tolland wetlands regulations unless its potential effect on the wetlands is a substantial one. Because \u00a7 9.1 of the Tolland wetlands regulations mandates a public hearing only when the wetlands application involves a \u201csignificant activity,\u201d a public hearing is not required if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>activity, including any one or more of the activities enumerated in \u00a7 2.1aa, will not have a \u201csubstantial effect\u201d on wetlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">We conclude that the record of the meetings of the commission on Westwood\u2019s application for a wetlands permit supports the commission\u2019s determination that the proposed activity would have no \u201csubstantial effect\u201d on the wetlands and, consequently, that the application did not involve a \u201csignificant activity\u201d for which a public hearing was required. The environmental concerns raised by the plaintiff were addressed specifically in the detailed reports and testimony of Christie Barton, the town wetlands agent, David Smith, the town director of development, and Henry Torcellini, a consulting engineer. Relying on the reports and testimony of those witnesses,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the commission reasonably could have concluded that the proposed development would have little or no adverse impact on the surrounding wetlands. Indeed, Torcellini testified that the proposed road construction site had been chosen because the portion of the wetlands to be affected by the construction was already disturbed,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and Barton stated that the project would actually improve the condition of the affected wetlands area. Moreover, on the recommendation of commission staff, approval of West-wood\u2019s application was conditioned on certain improvements to be made by Westwood to the subject property, including the creation of a conservation easement and a water retention basin, designed to eliminate any possible adverse effect of the development on the wetlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The commission\u2019s determination that Westwood\u2019s application for a wetlands permit did not involve a \u201csignificant activity\u201d may not be disturbed by a reviewing court if the record of the proceedings before the commission reveals that there was substantial evidence to support its conclusion. See, e.g., <em>Samperi </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Agency, </em>226 Conn. 579, 588, 628 A.2d 1286 (1993); <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>203 Conn. 525, 540-41, 525 A.2d 940 (1987). Moreover, it was the responsibility of the commission to evaluate the credibility of witnesses and to resolve disputed factual issues. <em>Samperi </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Agency, </em>supra, 588; <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>supra, 540-41. The record indicates that the commission carefully considered the conflicting expert testimony and documentary evidence concerning the possible impact of the proposed development on the wetlands. Although the contradictory evidence presented to the commission on the issue of that impact might have supported a contrary conclusion, the commission\u2019s determination that West-wood\u2019s application for a wetlands permit did not involve a \u201csignificant activity\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2.1aa of the Tolland wetlands regulations was amply supported by the evidence. See <em>Samperi </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Agency, </em>supra, 588; <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>supra, 541-42. Therefore, the trial court properly rejected the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the commission\u2019s failure to conduct a hearing on West-wood\u2019s application for a permit violated the town\u2019s wetlands regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The plaintiff also claims that the commission improperly failed to give notice of its intent to waive a public hearing on Westwood\u2019s application for a wetlands permit as required by General Statutes \u00a7 22a-39 (k). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Section 22a-39 (k) provides that the commissioner of environmental protection may waive the requirement of a public hearing on an application for an inland wetlands permit when the regulated activity for which the permit is sought is not likely to have a significant impact on the wetland or watercourse. See footnote 9. The plaintiff argues that the commission was required to comply with this provision before approving West-wood\u2019s application for a wetlands permit.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This claim lacks merit, however, because \u00a7 22a-39 (k) requires only the <em>commissioner of environmental protection </em>to give notice of his or her intent to issue a wetlands permit without conducting a public hearing. No such notice requirement is imposed on local wetlands agencies.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Moreover, in contrast to the notice requirement imposed on the commissioner under \u00a7 22a-39 (k), General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (a)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> provides that local wetlands agencies themselves shall promulgate regulations concerning notice and publication requirements. This grant of authority is consistent both with the public policy to require municipal regulation of activities affecting .wetlands and watercourses within the vari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>ous cities and towns; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42 (a);<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and with the statutory scheme designed to give local agencies broad discretion to oversee wetland activities. <em>Samperi </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Agency, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 592. When the legislature has chosen to impose specific notice requirements on inland wetlands agencies, it has done so in terms that are clear and unambiguous. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (c) and (d). Moreover, even in these statutes, the legislature has not required a local agency to give notice of its intent to issue a wetlands permit without a public hearing. The legislature, if it intended to mandate such notice, could easily have expressed this intent. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 410, 645 A.2d 965 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>217 Conn. 648, 654, 588 A.2d 127 (1991). Because the plaintiff has identified nothing in either the language or legislative history of \u00a7 22a-39 (k) to suggest that the legislature intended to require a local wetlands agency to give notice of its intent to waive a public hearing, the commission\u2019s approval of Westwood\u2019s application without such notice did not violate the requirements of \u00a7 22a-39 (k).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-5\"> Although the trial court \u201cdenied\u201d the plaintiffs appeal, the preferable usage is to \u201cdismiss\u201d such an appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-6\"> A total of 2.7 acres of the twenty-eight acre parcel sought to be developed by Westwood is designated as wetlands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b475-7\"> Westwood\u2019s application stated that construction of the proposed road would result in the disturbance of 0.08 acres of wetlands. Although the commission made no express finding as to the wetlands acreage to be disturbed by the proposed development, the commission\u2019s report to the department of environmental protection on its approval of Westwood\u2019s application; see Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-39-14; also stated that 0.08 acres of wetlands were to be disturbed by the project. The trial court, however, apparently in reliance on certain statements contained in Westwood\u2019s trial brief, concluded that the commission reasonably could have determined \u201cthat the area of the wetlands to be disturbed is .8 acres . . . .\u201d The parties have not raised this issue on appeal, and we therefore do not address it. Moreover, our resolution of the issue is unnecessary because, as we discuss more fully in part I of this opinion, we agree with the trial court that the commission\u2019s decision to grant Westwood\u2019s application without a public hearing is fully supported by the record of the proceedings before the commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\"> In addition to the disturbance of the wetlands that would be caused by the construction and maintenance of the road, Westwood acknowledged that drainage from the road would have an indirect effect on the wetlands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b476-5\"> The plaintiff raised concerns not only about the impact of the proposed road on the wetlands, but also about the indirect effect that the development of a residential subdivision would have on the wetlands. The record of the meetings of the commission indicates that the commission considered all the issues raised by the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b476-10\"> Obeda also submitted a written report of her findings and conclusions to the commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b477-4\"> Section 2.1aa of the Tolland inland wetlands and watercourses regulations provides: \u201c \u2018Significant activity\u2019 means any activity, including, but not limited to, the following activities which may have a substantial effect on the area for which an application has been filed or on another part of the inland wetland or watercourse system:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">\u201c1.
