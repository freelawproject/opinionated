J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFX\">The dispositive issue in this case is whether a trial court has discretion to deny a petition for a utility rent receivership with respect to multifamily residential property once the utility company has established that the owner or lessor of the property is currently in default in the payment of utility charges. The plaintiffs, Connecticut Light and Power Company and Yankee Gas Services Company, filed a petition for an order to show cause for the appointment of a receiver of rents pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 16-262\u00cd<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for designated properties owned by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>defendants Maria DaSilva, both individually and as executrix of the estate of Joseph DaSilva, and JAG, Ltd.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a hearing, the trial court denied the petition. The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. The plaintiffs petitioned for the appointment of a rent receiver on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>August 18, 1993. The defendants had made no payments on the applicable utility accounts for their residential property since February 1, 1993. Because of prior arrearages for utility services, DaSilva, as executrix and individually, had previously executed, on February 14,1992, a promissory note and a guaranty secured by two mortgage deeds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On January 31,1993, when these instruments were in default, the defendants owed the plaintiffs $594,405.01. Further utility charges have continued to accrue since February 1, 1993. At the time of the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for the appointment of a receiver of rents, they had also initiated proceedings for the foreclosure of the mortgages. Subsequent to the hearing on the petition for the utility rent receivership, the trial court determined, in a separate hearing, that there was reason to believe that the indebtedness secured by the mortgages was undersecured in the amount of $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for the appointment of a rent receiver for three reasons. It concluded that the plaintiffs: (1) had failed to establish a threat of waste or loss; (2) had taken the mortgage note and guaranty in substitution for the preexisting indebtedness; and (3) were adequately secured by the secured note and guaranty. We agree with the plaintiffs that the court misconstrued the applicable statutes and documents and therefore improperly denied the plaintiffs\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Our point of departure is the text of \u00a7 16-262f (a). That statute entitles a utility company to apply for a receivership \u201c[u]pon default of the owner ... of a residential dwelling who is billed directly . . . forutility service furnished to such building . . . .\u2019\u2019Thestat-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>ute requires an immediate judicial order \u201cto show cause why a receiver should not be appointed,\u201d and a hearing, within seventy-two hours, whose \u201csole purpose . . . shall be to determine whether there is an amount due and owing between the owner and the . . . utility.\u201d That statute further directs the court to \u201cmake a determination of any amount due and owing and any amount so determined shall constitute a lien upon the real property of such owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u201cSection 16-262\u00cd permits public service companies to petition for a statutory rent receivership under limited circumstances that are statutorily linked to the [General Statutes] \u00a7 16-262e (a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> prohibition on the termination of utility services. Under \u00a7 16-262e (a), service may not be terminated: (1) to a residential dwelling; (2) despite nonpayment of a delinquent account; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>(3) for service billed directly to the residential building\u2019s lessor, owner, agent or manager; and (4) when it is impracticable for occupants of the building to receive service in their own name. Unable to terminate service to such a residential dwelling, public service companies are expressly instructed, by \u00a7 16-262e (a), to \u2018pursue the remedy provided in section 16-262\u00cd.\u2019 . . . The summary rent receivership proceedings authorized by \u00a7 16-262\u00cd constitute, as we have previously recognized, a statutory trade-off for the requirement of continued service imposed by \u00a7 16-262e (a). <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>183 Conn. 85, 94, 438 A.2d 828, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 837, 102 S. Ct. 143, 70 L. Ed. 2d 118 (1981).\u201d <em>Southern Connecticut Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>191 Conn. 514, 518-20, 468 A.2d 574 (1983). The statutory proceedings authorized by \u00a7 16-262\u00cd are sui generis. Id., 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In light of the language, the acknowledged purpose and the sui generis nature of \u00a7 16-262f, the trial court was mistaken in its assumption that the appointment of a rent receiver for the protection of a utility is governed by the same wide-ranging equitable and discretionary principles that govern rent receiverships in ordinary mortgage foreclosure proceedings. See, e.g., <em>Hartford Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>196 Conn. 172, 175, 491 A.2d 1084, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 920, 106 S. Ct. 250, 88 L. Ed. 2d 258 (1985). Once the plaintiffs presented factual evidence to establish a default in utility payments with respect to residential property, they were entitled to the appointment of a rent receiver without having to demonstrate any further equitable right such as a threat of waste or loss. The trial court, in light of its own findings in the companion foreclosure proceedings, was also mistaken in its conclusion that the plaintiffs had adequate security to collect the amounts that were in default because of their ability to avail themselves of the defendants\u2019 note, guaranty and mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>We recognize that, even when a default has been incontrovertibly established, extraordinary circumstances may warrant a withholding of judicial relief. The defendants in this case have failed, however, to satisfy their burden of demonstrating the existence of any such extraordinary circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The defendants contend, as the trial court concluded, that the plaintiffs irrevocably elected not to pursue the remedy otherwise afforded them by \u00a7 16-262f. The trial court decided that an election of remedies flowed from the plaintiffs agreement to accept the secured promissory note and guaranty from the defendants in the first place. On appeal, without pursuing that claim, the defendants argue that an election of remedies flowed from the plaintiffs\u2019 institution of proceedings to obtain a judgment of default on the note and the guaranty and to foreclose on the correlative mortgages executed as security for the note and the guaranty. We disagree that the plaintiffs are barred from pursuing a utility rent receivership under \u00a7 16-262\u00cd in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">When the plaintiffs initially agreed to accept a note and a guaranty, and two mortgages as security for these monetary obligations, which were intended to enable the defendants to work out their preexisting arrearages for utility bills, the plaintiffs arguably bound themselves not to pursue these arrearages so long as the instruments were not in default. Unless otherwise agreed, if a promissory note is taken for a preexisting obligation, the obligation is ordinarily suspended \u201cuntil dishonor of the note or until it is paid.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-310 (b) (2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We need not determine, however, whether the parties in this case had \u201cotherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>agreed,\u201d because, as the trial court found, the defendants had defaulted on the note and the guaranty at the time when the plaintiffs initiated their \u00a7 16-262\u00cd application.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">After the defendants\u2019 default, the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to pursue their statutory entitlement to a rent receivership were fully protected both by the terms of the agreement between the parties and by \u00a7 16-262\u00cd. The parties expressly agreed that the plaintiffs\u2019 remedies, in the event of default, were \u201ccumulative\u201d and that the plaintiffs had retained their rights \u201cto resort to every other right or remedy available at law or in equity.\u201d* <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>terms of their agreement are entirely consistent with \u00a7 16-262f (c),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which counsels against any election of remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 initiation of default and foreclosure proceedings on the note and guaranty and the mortgages securing these instruments did not abrogate their contractual and statutory rights. Under the law of negotiable instruments, a dishonored instrument is not \u201cpaid\u201d in the absence of an act or agreement that \u201cwould discharge an obligation to pay money under a simple contract.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-601.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under governing principles of contract law, a party who manifests the choice of one available remedy among others \u201cby bringing suit or otherwise\u201d has not barred his right to pursue any other remedy \u201cunless the remedies are inconsistent and the other party materially changes his position in reliance on the manifestation.\u201d 3 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 378 (1981).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As these authorities recognize, the essence of \u201cpayment\u201d is the actual collection of moneys owed, not the pursuit of remedies to accomplish their collection. In the absence of a discharge on grounds such as bankruptcy, an unpaid default judgment does not automatically discharge an indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The defendants argue, however, that they have been materially disadvantaged by the plaintiffs\u2019 pursuit of default and foreclosure proceedings because of the defendants\u2019 continued liability as parties to a negotiable instrument. They suggest that the plaintiffs \u201ccould obtain a default in the foreclosure, and then assign the note to a third party, who could collect on it, while the plaintiffs collected on their receivership under ... \u00a7 16-2621\u201d The defendants\u2019 argument assumes that a person who takes a negotiable instrument after its maturity and default could collect on the instrument, as a holder in due course thereof, without regard to any defenses of whole or partial payment. The defendants are mistaken. Under General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-302 (a) (2) (iii),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a holder cannot be \u201cin due course\u201d unless the holder takes the instrument \u201cwithout notice that the instrument is overdue or has been dishonored . . . .\u201d Under General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-304 (b) (2), <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> an instrument \u201cpayable at a definite time\u201d becomes \u201coverdue on the day after the due date.\u201d Because the promissory note in this case bore a due date of January 31,1993, it gave notice on its face that it had become \u201coverdue\u201d on February 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>1993. By the time of these proceedings, therefore, the note could no longer be negotiated to a holder in due course. Under General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-305 (a) (2),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> enforcement of the instrument by any taker other than a holder in due course would preserve for the obligor on the instrument any \u201cdefense . . . that would be available if the person entitled to enforce the instrument were enforcing a right to payment under a simple contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The protracted proceedings in this case failed to accord with the letter or the spirit of \u00a7 16-262\u00cd. The plaintiffs clearly established their right to a rent receivership. On remand, the trial court should promptly designate a rent receiver and determine the amount of the utility charges due and owing from the defendants to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The judgment is reversed and the trial court is directed to conduct a prompt hearing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 16-262f provides in relevant part: \u201cpetition for RECEIVER OF RENTS; HEARING; APPOINTMENT; DUTIES. TERMINATION OF RECEIVERSHIP. LIENS. NONEXCLUSIVITY OF REMEDY. CONTEMPT, (a) Upon default of the owner, agent, lessor or manager of a residential dwelling who is billed directly by an electric, gas, telephone or water company or by a municipal utility for utility service furnished to such building, such company or municipal utility may petition the superior court or a judge thereof, for appointment of a receiver of the rents or payments for use and occupancy for any dwelling for which the owner, agent, lessor or manager is in default. The court or judge shall forthwith issue an order to show cause why a receiver should not be appointed, which shall be served upon the owner, agent, lessor or manager or his agent in a manner most reasonably calculated to give notice to such owner, agent, lessor or manager as determined by such court or judge, including, but not limited to, a posting of such order on the premises in question. A hearing shall be had on such order no later than seventy-two hours after its issuance or the first court day thereafter. The sole purpose of such a hearing shall be to determine whether there is an amount due and owing between the owner, agent, lessor or manager and the company or municipal utility. The court shall make a determination of any amount due and owing and any amount so determined shall constitute a lien upon the real property of such owner. A certificate of such amount may be recorded in the land records of the town in which such prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>erty is located describing the amount of the lien and the name of the party in default. When the amount due and owing has been paid the company or municipality shall issue a certificate discharging the lien and shall file the certificate in the land records of the town in which such lien was recorded. The receiver appointed by the court shall collect all rents or payments for use and occupancy forthcoming from the occupants of the building in question in place of the owner, agent, lessor or manager. The receiver shall pay the petitioner or other supplier, from such rents or payments for use and occupancy, for electric, gas, telephone, water or heating oil supplied on and after the date of his appointment. The owner, agent, lessor or manager shall be liable for such reasonable fees and costs determined by the court to be due the receiver, which fees and costs may be recovered from the rents or payments for use and occupancy under the control of the receiver, provided no such fees or costs shall be recovered until after payment for current electric, gas, telephone and water service and heating oil deliveries has been made. The owner, agent, lessor or manager shall be liable to the petitioner for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred by the petitioner, provided no such fees or costs shall be recovered until after payment for current electric, gas, telephone and water service and heating oil deliveries has been made and after payments of reasonable fees and costs to the receiver. Any moneys from rental payments or payments for use and occupancy remaining after payment for current electric, gas, telephone and water service or heating oil deliveries, and after payment for reasonable costs and fees to the receiver, and after payment to the petitioner for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, shall be applied to any arrear-age found by the court to be due and owing the company or municipal utility from the owner, agent, lessor or manager for service provided such building. Any moneys remaining thereafter shall be turned over to the owner, agent, lessor or manager.
