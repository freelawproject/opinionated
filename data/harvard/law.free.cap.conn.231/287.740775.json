In its appeal from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board denying its request to transfer to the fund its obligations under \u00a7 31-284b, Norwich maintains that the transfer of a case to the fund pursuant to \u00a7 31-349 simultaneously creates an obligation on the part of the fund to continue \u00a7 31-284b benefits as \u201ccompensation.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>The following facts are undisputed. On August 12, 1983, Civardi sustained an injury to his back while in the course of his employment with Norwich. Because this 1983 injury aggravated preexisting injuries to his back, Norwich paid Civardi workers\u2019 compensation disability benefits through July 23, 1986, pursuant to a voluntary agreement, as provided for by General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 31-296.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As of July 24,1986, pursuant to \u00a7 31-349, Norwich transferred to the fund its responsibility to pay to Civardi any remaining liability for weekly indemnity payments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Norwich has, however, continued to date to pay Civardi\u2019s health insurance benefits as required by \u00a7 31-284b.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>At a hearing before a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner on December 3,1991, Norwich disputed its obligation to pay Civardi\u2019s \u00a7 31-284b insurance benefits for the period of time following July 24,1986, arguing that it had transferred to the fund, pursuant to \u00a7 31-349, not only its liability for indemnity payments, but also its responsibility to pay for Civardi\u2019s \u00a7 31-284b insurance benefits. Rejecting Norwich\u2019s argument, the commissioner concluded that \u00a7 31-349 did not transfer to the fund Norwich\u2019s obligation to pay Civardi\u2019s \u00a7 31-284b benefits. Following an appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-280b (b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 31-301 (b),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the compensation review board concluded that the transfer of \u00a7 31-284b benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-349 may occur only after 104 weeks of total disability, and that Civardi was not totally disabled. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301b,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Norwich appealed that decision to the Appellate Court, and we thereafter transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We hold that \u00a7 31-284b benefits are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>\u201ccompensation\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 31-349 and therefore affirm.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We begin our analysis with a discussion of the fund\u2019s history and the purpose underlying its enactment. Connecticut, like most states, established the fund primarily to foster employment of individuals with an existing disability. See <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Gerber Group, </em>222 Conn. 78, 82, 608 A.2d 87 (1992). \u201cTo prevent discrimination against handicapped workers, while providing the benefits of [workers\u2019] compensation to such workers, virtually every state has enacted some form of second injury fund legislation. . . . Such legislation is also designed to relieve employers from the hardship of liability for those consequences of compensable injury not attributable to their employment.\u201d (Internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>marks omitted.) Id. Furthermore, the combined effect of a successive injury to someone with a preexisting disability can far exceed the combined allowances for each injury existing separately.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, under \u00a7 31-349, the employer by whom the employee is employed at the time of the second injury must pay all wages, benefits and covered medical costs only for the first 104 weeks of disability. Thereafter, pursuant to \u00a7 31-349, liability is transferred and all responsibility for \u201ccompensation and medical treatment\u201d rests with the custodian of the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Mindful of this history, we have cautioned that \u201c[p]ayment of an award from a special fund such as the second injury and compensation assurance fund, which was established, inter alia, to assist in the payment of compensation awarded to handicapped and disadvantaged workers; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-349\u201431-355; see <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Ingraham, </em>150 Conn. 153, 158, 186 A.2d 798 [1962]; should be made only in accordance with express statutory authority; 101 C.J.S., Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 837 [1958]; in order to protect that special fund and prevent unwarranted diversions of it from the specific purpose for which it was created.\u201d <em>Going </em>v. <em>Cromwell Fire District, </em>159 Conn. 53, 61, 267 A.2d 428 (1970). The absence of any such express statutory authority therefore undermines the claim that the fund must assume liability for Civardi\u2019s \u00a7 31-284b insurance benefits as a part of the \u00a7 31-349 transfer of liability for \u201ccompensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Our resolution of this issue is further supported by the legislative history of \u00a7 31-284b. It is well established that in discerning legislative intent, we consider the statute\u2019s specific language, the legislative policy that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>the statute was designed to implement, the history surrounding the statute\u2019s enactment and the statute\u2019s relationship to existing legislation. See <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 455, 459-60, 600 A.2d 310 (1991). This exercise leads us to conclude that the expanded definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d proffered by Norwich would exceed the legislative intent and place an undesired and unanticipated burden on the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The legislature enacted \u00a7 31-284b following the decision in <em>Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corp. </em>v. <em>Ilsley, </em>518 F. Sup. 1297 (D. Conn. 1981), that General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 31-51h<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was unconstitutional.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Ilsley, </em>the United Stated District Court ruled that by impermissibly regulating the duration of payments made by an employer to a jointly administered employee union welfare fund and altering an employer\u2019s obligations pursuant to negotiated benefit plans, \u00a7 31-51h interferred with federal regulation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Id., 1300. Because federal lawmakers had clearly expressed in ERISA that federal law preempted the application of state laws in these areas, the court concluded that \u00a7 31-51h unconstitutionally intruded into the field.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>1302. The District Court noted, however, that the state law might have avoided ERISA preemption if the law had imposed obligations on employers only as part of the workers\u2019 compensation regime. Id., 1301, citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003 (b) (3). In 1982, pending the appeal in <em>Ils-ley, </em>Connecticut lawmakers, aware that the District Court opinion might be affirmed, and in an effort to fall within the exception, attempted to insulate the obligations flowing from \u00a7 31-51h against constitutional challenge by placing them within the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The legislative history makes clear that \u00a7 31-284b was drafted to express the obligations then currently stated in \u00a7 31-51h. As stated in the Senate debate: \u201cWhat we are doing here is taking the exact same language and moving it into workers\u2019 compensation statutes. There is no change in benefits. As I said before, there is no change in the way in which we are dealing with it. We feel that if we move it into the workers\u2019 [compensation] statutes that we would meet some of the problems that the court has already pointed out.\u201d 25 S. Proc., Pt. 4, 1982 Sess., p. 1171, remarks of Senator Michael J. Skelley. Even those who opposed the passage of the new act pending a definitive ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit shared the view that the act did not change any statutory obligations. They argued that: \u201c[b]ecause the obligations which Bill 345 proposed are identical to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>those currently mandated by section 31-51h the bill presents the same questions as are being litigated in <em>[Ilsley], </em>If the Court of Appeals reverses the lower court ruling, section 31-51h will continue to be applicable, making Bill 345 totally unnecessary. If the Court of Appeals affirms the lower court ruling rendering section 31-51h void, the legislation before you continues rather than resolves the legal defects upon which such a decision would be based.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor and Public Employees, Pt. 1, 1982 Sess., p. 118. The pertinent part of \u00a7 31-284b provides, as did \u00a7 31-51h, that an employer, when it has provided fringe benefits for its working employees, must create a plan for the injured employee who is receiving or is entitled to receive workers\u2019 compensation. We therefore conclude that there is nothing surrounding the enactment of \u00a7 31-284b to indicate that the 1982 legislature intended to change the benefits transferrable to the fund under \u00a7 31-349.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The legislature also provided in \u00a7 31-284b that in any case where workers\u2019 compensation payments to an individual for total incapacity under the provisions of \u00a7 31-307 continue for more than 104 weeks, health and life insurance benefits are transferrable to the fund in accordance with \u00a7 31-349. General Statutes \u00a7 31-284b (d). This section was drafted to incorporate that portion of \u00a7 31-51h, enacted as No. 81-464 of the 1981 Public Acts, intended to deal with \u201can employee that is totally incapacitated and if that\u2019s the case [then] that particular liability or burden that the employer would bear in carrying out his health benefits would be picked up by the second injury fund under Workers\u2019 Compensation.\u201d 24 S. Proc., Pt. 9, 1981 Sess., p. 2828, remarks of Senator Michael J. Skelley. Only in that instance has the legislature expressly transferred liability for \u00a7 31-284b benefits to the fund. Again, this reflects no substantive change from the previously enacted \u00a7 31-51h.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>We also note that the legislative history of \u00a7 31-349 contains no reference to the transferability of \u00a7 31-284b benefits pursuant to a \u00a7 31-349 transfer based on a preexisting impairment. Despite the flurry of activity in this area in 1981 and 1982, the legislature made no substantive changes to \u00a7 31-349.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018The [legislature] is always presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or non-action will have upon any one of them. And it is always presumed to have intended that effect which its action or non-action produces.\u2019 \u201d <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>144 Conn. 516, 523, 134 A.2d 351 (1957). We therefore find that the lack of any substantive changes to \u00a7 31-349 during and following the passage of \u00a7 31-284b reflects the legislature\u2019s decision not to transfer the employer\u2019s liability for \u00a7 31-284b benefits to the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Additionally, although \u00a7 31-349 has existed in some form since 1949, Norwich has failed to cite any recorded instance of the fund\u2019s willingness to accept responsibility for paying health insurance benefits as \u201ccompensation.\u201d It appears that in the history of \u00a7 31-349 transfers, the fund has never assumed liability for an employer\u2019s obligations for \u00a7 31-284b benefits pursuant to a \u00a7 31-349 transfer based on a preexisting impairment. See <em>Luis </em>v. <em>Frito-Lay, Inc., </em>10 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 50 (1992) (obligation to pay \u00a7 31-284b benefits did not transfer to the fund when the obligation to pay indemnity and medical benefits transferred under \u00a7 31-349), rev\u2019d on other grounds, <em>Luis </em>v. <em>Frito-Lay, Inc., </em>Supreme Court, Docket No. SC 14536 (order, April 27, 1993).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although not dispositive, we accord <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and review board. See <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>227 Conn. 333, 354, 630 A.2d 1027 (1993). We therefore find, in the case of an employee with a preexisting impairment, no legislative intent to mandate the transfer of liability for \u00a7 31-284b benefits to the fund as \u201ccompensation\u201d under \u00a7 31-349.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Furthermore, we disagree with Norwich\u2019s contention that our ruling <em>in Deschnow </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>214 Conn. 394, 572 A.2d 345 (1990), compels a contrary conclusion. In <em>Deschnow, </em>we considered \u201cthe eligibility of disabled members of municipal police and fire departments, who are entitled to compensation under General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c, the Heart and Hypertension Act, to receive insurance coverage from their municipal employers in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 31-284b (a).\u201d Id., 394-95. After first noting that \u00a7 7-433c entitled qualifying injured municipal officers and firefighters to receive from their employers \u201ccompensation and medical care in the same amount and the same manner\u201d as provided to a disabled employee under the workers\u2019 compensation statute, we looked to the broad definition of \u201cincome\u201d in the workers\u2019 compensation statute for guidance in construing the scope of \u201ccompensation\u201d under \u00a7 7-433c. Id., 397-98; see also <em>Felia </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>214 Conn. 181, 185, 571 A.2d 89 (1990). As a result, we concluded that \u201cthe economic benefits that qualify as \u2018compensation\u2019 under \u00a7 7-433c <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>may include [\u00a7 31-284b type] fringe benefits, in appropriate circumstances.\u201d <em>Deschnow </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Citing <em>Deschnow, </em>Norwich contends that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has thus definitively ruled that the term \u2018compensation\u2019 as utilized in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act includes group benefits provided pursuant to \u00a7 31-284b.\u201d Norwich\u2019s position, however, misstates the import of <em>Deschnow </em>and ignores the specific legal issue before us in that case. \u201cIt is a general rule that a case resolves only the issues explicitly decided in the case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>190 Conn. 84, 91, 459 A.2d 1005 (1983). Unlike <em>Deschnow, </em>the issue here is not whether Civardi is entitled to \u00a7 31-284b benefits, but rather, whether the fund, and not Norwich, must pay for those benefits subsequent to the \u00a7 31-349 transfer. Thus, instead of interpreting \u201ccompensation\u201d broadly to comport with the remedial purpose of a statute such as \u00a7 7-433c, we must construe it narrowly to implement the limited purposes for which the legislature created the fund when it enacted \u00a7 31-349. See <em>Going </em>v. <em>Cromwell Fire District, </em>supra, 159 Conn. 61. Consequently, our categorization of \u00a7 31-284b benefits as \u201ccompensation\u201d in the specific context of \u00a7 7-433c benefit entitlement does not govern our interpretation of the meaning of \u201ccompensation\u201d within \u00a7 31-349.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The judgment of the compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) 31-349 provides: \u201ccompensation foe SECOND DISABILITY. PAYMENT OF INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR TOTALLY incapacitated persons. The fact that an employee has suffered a previous disability, or received compensation therefor, shall not preclude him from compensation for a later injury, nor preclude compensation for death resulting therefrom. If an employee who has previously incurred, by accidental injury, disease or congenital causes, total or partial loss of, or loss of use of, one hand, one arm, one foot or one eye, or who has other permanent physical impairment, incurs a second disability by accident or disease arising out of and in the course of his employment, resulting in a permanent disability caused by both conditions which is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the second injury alone, he shall receive compensation for the entire amount of disability, including total disability, less any compensation benefits payable or paid with respect to the previous disability, and necessary medical care, as elsewhere provided in this chapter, notwithstanding the fact that part of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>disability was due to a prior accidental injury, disease or congenital causes. The employer by whom the employee is employed at the time of the injury, or his insurance carrier, shall in the first instance pay all awards of compensation and all medical expenses provided by this chapter for the first one hundred four weeks of disability. As a condition precedent to the liability of the second injury fund, the employer or his insurance carrier must, ninety days prior to the expiration of the one-hundred-four-week period, notify the custodian of the second injury fund of the pending case and shall furnish to said custodian a copy of the agreement or award together with all information purporting to support his claim as to the liability of the second injuiy fund, and shall make available to the custodian all medical reports as the custodian shall desire. Failure on the part of the employer or the carrier to comply does not relieve the employer or carrier of its obligation to continue furnishing benefits under the provisions of this chapter. In the event the custodian shall reject the claim of the employer and its insurer, the question shall be submitted to the commissioner having jurisdiction, as promptly as possible, and the employer or carrier shall continue furnishing benefits until the outcome is finally decided, and if the employer or carrier prevails all payments made beyond the one-hundred-four-week period shall be reimbursed to the employer or carrier by the second injury fund. After the employer or its insurer has completed the payment for the one-hundred-four-week period, he shall file with the commissioner having jurisdiction, and with the custodian of the second injury fund, a form indicating that all compensation and medical bills have been paid for the one-hundred-four-week period, and indicating thereon the date the custodian was notified of the pending case. Thereafter all responsibility for compensation and medical treatment shall be with the custodian of the second injury fund. . . . In any case where workers\u2019 compensation payments to an individual for total incapacity under the provisions of section 31-307 continue for more than one hundred four weeks, the costs of accident and health insurance or life insurance coverage required under section 31-284b, shall be paid out of the second injury fund after the one hundred fourth week. Employers shall notify the custodian of the second injury fund within sixty days of the expiration of the one-hundred-four-week period that such coverage is required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Prior to a technical amendment to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in 1991, the second injury fund was officially titled the \u201csecond injury and compensation assurance fund.\u201d See Public Acts 1991, No. 91-207. Thus, although this opinion refers only to the \u201csecond injury fund,\u201d any reference to the second injury fund prior to the 1991 amendment impliedly refers to what was then officially known as the \u201csecond injury and compensation assurance fund.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 31-284b provides: \u201cemployee to continue INSURANCE COVERAGE OR WELFARE PLAN PAYMENTS FOR EMPLOY<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>EES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION.

As one legislator remarked: \u201cThe bill before us is the product of two years of hard work by the Law Revision Committee, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, members of this Chamber and others to do a complete and total . . . rewrite ... of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Statutes as we know them today.\u201d 34 H.R. Proc., Pt. 5,1991 Sess., p. 1959, remarks of Representative Joseph A. Adamo. As part of this revision, the definitions contained within General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act were greatly expanded. Section 31-275 (4) now provides that \u201c[cjompensation\u201d means \u201cbenefits or payments mandated by the provisions of this chapter, including, but not limited to . . . payments made under the provisions of section 31-284b . . . ,\u201d There is nothing in the legislative history, however, to indicate even remotely that this provision was intended to apply to employees previously injured, and thereby to depart from the date of the injury rule. See <em>Iacomacci </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 224. We therefore need not decide, in the absence of any such claim before us, whether \u00a7 31-275 (4) constitutes an express statement by the legislature of its intent that \u00a7 31-284b benefits transfer to the fund upon a \u00a7 31-349 transfer of compensation for those employees injured after the date of its passage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\"> An obvious example is the worker who is blind in one eye.
