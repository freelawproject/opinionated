The plaintiff, First Bethel Associates (Associates), brought an action against, inter alios, the defendant town of Bethel and its board of tax review (collectively, the town),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 12-118,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requesting a reduction of the assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>ment on its real property for the tax years 1988 through 1991. The trial court found that the assessment of Associates\u2019 property was excessive and reduced the assessed value to an amount reflective of both actual rental income and market rent. The town appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The following facts are undisputed. Associates is the owner of a strip shopping center located in a general commercial zone in the town of Bethel. The property, totaling 3.75 acres, has frontage and access on three different streets and is improved by buildings containing approximately 28,000 square feet of rentable floor space. The anchor store of this complex, constructed in 1957, occupies approximately 14,000 square feet, and includes a full basement. Six general retail stores occupying approximately 11,500 square feet were built approximately ten years later. A bank, built in 1978, occupies the remaining 2500 square feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Acting pursuant to the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 12-63,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the town\u2019s assessor determined that the fair market value of Associates\u2019 property was $2,892,970, which corresponded to an assessment of $2,025,080 as of October 1,1988.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Associates appealed to the Bethel board of tax review requesting a reduction of the assessment, and to the trial court after the board affirmed the assessment on the ground that the true fair market value of the subject property was only $1,122,242.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In order to arrive at the town\u2019s valuation of the property, the assessor for the town of Bethel used three methods: a comparable sales method, a cost method and an income capitalization method. Associates\u2019 expert witness, Morris Lefsetz, a licensed real estate appraiser, used only the income capitalization method. The trial court rejected the town\u2019s comparable sales method because it found that the town\u2019s assessor had used properties that \u201cwere not actually comparable to the applicant\u2019s property.\u201d The trial court also rejected the town\u2019s cost method because \u201cthe [town\u2019s] expert attributed an actual age to the premises of twenty-one years, when more than one-half of the square footage of the center was constructed more than thirty years ago. . . . [T]he expert assumed an \u2018effective age\u2019 of ten years. Had the actual age of the premises been used, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>the cost analysis would have yielded a considerably different result than the one adopted by the assessor . . . The trial court then focused on the income capitalization method for determining the property\u2019s fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Associates\u2019 expert arrived at a fair market value of $1,122,242, relying only on actual income derived from the property, using the income capitalization method. In contrast, the town\u2019s expert testified that he had considered and rejected the actual income method because \u201cit wasn\u2019t indicative of the market and the law says fair market value.\u201d Rather, the town\u2019s expert utilized the income capitalization method, relying on fair market rents derived from rental information that had been supplied by other property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The trial court rejected the income capitalization ana-lyses of both parties, concluding instead that the revaluation properly should have taken into account <em>both </em>actual rental income <em>and </em>the property\u2019s market rental value. Accordingly, the court determined that although \u201cthe [town\u2019s assessor] claims to have considered the actual rental income, it does not appear to have been factored into [his] analysis. Consequently, the assessor\u2019s valuation is excessive while [Associates\u2019] valuation . . . based solely on actual rental income, is unreasonably low.\u201d The trial court therefore recalculated the fair market value of Associates\u2019 property at $1,789,980, which corresponds to an assessment of $1,252,986. This valuation, in the trial court\u2019s view, was \u201ca more reasonable and realistic figure, reflective of both actual and market rent.\u201d The court rendered judgment in favor of Associates accordingly, and ordered a refund of $31,153.99, which represented Associates\u2019 overpayment of taxes to the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The town claims on appeal that (1) the trial court improperly reduced the assessment on Associates\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>property by including in its income capitalization calculation both market rent and actual rent, and (2) the trial court\u2019s reduction of the assessment was not supported by the evidence. Associates cross appeals, claiming that because the anchor store\u2019s current lease will extend beyond the next townwide revaluation, the trial court was bound by General Statutes \u00a7 12-63b (b) to accept, and to base its judgment on, the actual rental income flowing from that lease. We disagree with all of these claims and accordingly affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">We first address the issue of whether \u00a7 12-63b <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requires the exclusive use of either market rent or actual rent in determining fair market value. The town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>claims that the trial court impermissibly included actual rental income, or \u201ccontract rent\u201d in its calculation of market value. According to the town, the assessor must consider contract rent, but if that rent is not in accord with market rent, it must be disregarded. In direct contrast, Associates claims that the trial court impermissibly included market rent in its calculation and argues that, under the facts of this case, \u00a7 12-63b (b) mandates the exclusive use of contract rent to determine market value in the income capitalization calculation. We disagree with both of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The goal of property valuation is to determine the \u201cpresent true and actual value\u201d of the subject property. General Statutes \u00a7 12-63; see footnote 3. \u201cThe process of valuation at best is a matter of approximation. <em>National Folding Box Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>146 Conn. 578, 586, 153 A.2d 420 (1959).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Frilando, </em>182 Conn. 397, 399, 438 A.2d 413 (1980). On appeal, the scope of our review is limited because it is a question of fact for the trier as to whether the method used for valuation appears in reason and logic to accomplish a just result. <em>National Folding Box Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 586; see also <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>212 Conn. 639, 647, 563 A.2d 688 (1989); <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>23 Conn. App. 460, 465, 581 A.2d 1061 (1990), cert. denied, 217 Conn. 805, 584 A.2d 1190 (1991); <em>Midway Green Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>8 Conn. App. 440, 443, 512 A.2d 984 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Section 12-63b provides an assessor with guidance in producing a valuation that best approximates the actual value of the property by specifying the methods for calculation. The trial court determined, and the parties do not dispute, that the proper method for assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>ing the true value of Associates\u2019 property is the capitalization of net income method as outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 12-63b (a) (3) and 12-63b (b). \u201cThe income capitalization approach to value consists of methods, techniques, and mathematical procedures that an appraiser uses to analyze a property\u2019s capacity to generate benefits (i.e., usually the monetary benefits of income and reversion) and convert these benefits into an indication of present value.\u201d Appraisal Institute, The Appraisal of Real Estate (10th Ed. 1992) p. 409. It follows that the higher the contract rent, the higher the income expectancy and the higher the property valuation. When, as in this case, the contract rent differs significantly from the estimated rent that the property would command on the open market,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the relative weight given to either has a potentially significant impact on the calculation of the true and actual value.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Our disposition of the town\u2019s first claim and Associates\u2019 cross claim must start with the plain language of \u00a7 12-63b (b). \u201cThe objective of statutory construction is to give effect to the intended purpose of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>185 Conn. 517, 521, 441 A.2d 158 (1981). . . . <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>226 Conn. 818, 828, 629 A.2d 379 (1993). Where the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, it is assumed that the words themselves express the intent of the legislature and there is no need for statutory construction .... <em>All Brand Importers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>213 Conn. 184, 195, 567 A.2d 1156 (1989).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Haesche </em>v. <em>Kissner, </em>229 Conn. 213, 223, 640 A.2d 89 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Section 12-63b (a) (3) requires the use of \u201cmarket rent\u201d as the indicator of income. See footnote 5. \u201c[T]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>term \u2018market rent\u2019 means the rental income that such property would most probably command on the open market as indicated by <em>present rentals being paid for comparable space. </em>In determining market rent the assessor shall consider the <em>actual rental income </em>applicable with respect to such real property under the terms of an existing contract of lease at the time of such determination.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 12-63b (b). Thus, the statute requires that, in determining a property\u2019s \u201cmarket rent,\u201d the assessor and, therefore, the court, in determining the fair market value of the property, must consider <em>both </em>(1) net rent for comparable properties, and (2) the net rent derived from any existing leases on the property. This legislative approach makes sense because it reflects the reality that a willing seller and a willing buyer\u2014whose ultimate judgments are what we mean by \u201cfair market value\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\u2014would themselves consider in arriving at a price for the property that is subject to leases that do not closely approximate current rentals for similar properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The town argues that contract rent should not factor into the valuation process unless it is equivalent to the rent that the property would command on the open market. Such a construction, however, would mean that contract rent would factor into the analysis only if it had no effect on the overall valuation, rendering meaningless the direction of \u00a7 12-63b (b) to \u201cconsider\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>actual rental income. Similarly, Associates\u2019 argument that only contract rent should be considered ignores the statute\u2019s direction to take into account what the \u201cproperty would most probably command on the open market . . . .\u201d It is a \u201cwell established rule of statutory construction that \u2018we will not read a statute in such a way as to render a portion of it superfluous.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Christiano, </em>228 Conn. 456, 472, 637 A.2d 382 (1994); <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 307, 320, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990); 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. Singer 1992 Rev.) \u00a7 46.06.\u201d <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 Conn. 77, 90-91, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994). Therefore, we reject the parties\u2019 proposed constructions because they each would render a portion of the statute mere surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The trial court\u2019s thoughtful analysis, on the other hand, properly considered both contract and market rent. The trial court increased \u201cthe anchor store\u2019s rent from $3.46 to $6.00 per square foot, a more reasonable and realistic figure, reflective of both actual and market rent.\u201d A trial court is vested with broad discretion in municipal tax appeals to determine true and actual value, and \u201chas the right to accept so much of the expert testimony and the recognized appraisal methods which are employed as it finds applicable.\u201d <em>John F. Epina Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Space Realty, Inc., </em>194 Conn. 71, 84, 480 A.2d 499 (1984). \u201cThe exercise of this right would be reviewable only if it were apparent that the [trial court] misapplied or overlooked, or gave a wrong or improper effect to, any testimony or consideration which it [has a] duty to regard.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., quo tin <em>g Federated Dept. Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>162 Conn. 77, 86, 291 A.2d 715 (1971). The function of the court below was to determine the \u201ctrue and actual value of the plaintiff\u2019s property. <em>Dickau </em>v. <em>Glastonbury, </em>156 Conn. 437, 441, 444, 242 A.2d 777 [1968]; <em>Burritt </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number><em>Mutual Savings Bank </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>146 Conn. 669, 673, 154 A.2d 608 [1959].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Executive Square Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>11 Conn. App. 566, 570, 528 A.2d 409 (1987). We are persuaded, on this record, that the trial court properly applied the law in correcting the town\u2019s valuation of Associates\u2019 property.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plain language of \u00a7 12-63b (b) demonstrates that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in considering both market rent and contract rent in making a valuation based on the income capitalization method.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The town also claims-that the trial court\u2019s valuation was not supported by the evidence. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">The trial court heard testimony of two expert appraisers, each of whom testified to a different assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>ment value and appraisal method for the property. Associates\u2019 expert offered an assessed value that was substantially less than that of the town\u2019s expert. \u201cThe trier of fact arrives at his own conclusions as to the value of land by weighing the opinion of the appraisers, the claims of the parties in light of all the circumstances in evidence bearing on value, and his own general knowledge of the elements going to establish value . . . . <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>[169 Conn. 129, 136, 362 A.2d 914 (1975)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Newbury Commons Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>226 Conn. 92, 105, 626 A.2d 1292 (1993). The town\u2019s argument, however, that the trial court should have ignored Associates\u2019 appraisal because it used only one of three statutory appraisal methods ignores the fact that Associates\u2019 appraiser was not obligated to use any one method of appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>The directive of \u00a7 12-63b applies to \u201c[t]he assessors ... in any town, when determining the present true and actual value of real property as provided in section 12-63 . . . .\u201d A party challenging the validity of such an appraisal is not required to follow the structure outlined in \u00a7 12-63b, but is only required to provide evidence proving that his property has been overas-sessed. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-63 (b). Although a trial court certainly could consider the methodology used by an appraiser in determining what weight to give the appraisal, the trial court is not required to ignore an appraisal from a party challenging the assessment simply because it did not conform to the standards set for the town\u2019s assessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">In essence, the town asks this court to retry the facts on appeal. \u201cOn appeal, this court may reverse or modify the decision of the trial court only if it determines that the factual findings are clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record. Practice Book \u00a7 4061. We do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. Rather, we focus on the conclusion of the trial court, as well as the method by which it arrived at that conclusion, to determine whether it is legally correct and factually supported. <em>Lukas </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>184 Conn. 205, 208, 439 A.2d 949 (1981); <em>Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>223 Conn. 80, 88, 612 A.2d 1130 (1992); <em>Nor\u2019easter Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Colossale Concrete, Inc., </em>207 Conn. 468, 473, 542 A.2d 692 (1988). A finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Kulesza, </em>197 Conn. 101, 105, 495 A.2d 1074 (1985), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S. Ct. 525, 92 L. Ed. 746 (1948); see also <em>Web Press Services Corp. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number><em>New London Motors, Inc., </em>205 Conn. 479, 483, 533 A.2d 1211 (1987).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Normand Josef Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>230 Conn. 486, 503-504, 646 A.2d 1289 (1994). The town has offered no basis for a conclusion that the court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. The town\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-6\"> Also named as defendants were Thomas Reynolds, chairman of the board of tax review, and John J.

The legislative history cited by the town, however, involves Raised Committee Bill No. 635, entitled \u201cAn Act Providing That The Term Market Rent As Used In Appraisal Of Income Producing Real Property Refers To Current Rental Value <em>Irrespective </em>Of Existing Contract Rent.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although this committee bill did call for income capitalization appraisal to exclude contract rent, this bill was not passed by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">In fact, the Senate passed Substitute Senate Bill No. 635, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Determination Of Market Rent As The Term Is Used In Relation To Appraisal Of Rental Income Real Property.\u201d This bill, No. 84-417 of the 1984 Public Acts, was passed by the General Assembly and codified as General Statutes \u00a7 12-63b. The distinction between the successful and unsuccessful bills is critical. Senate Bill No. 635 provided that market rent means \u201cthe current rental income that would most probably be applicable to a particular parcel . . . notwithstanding the actual rental income.\u201d The substitute bill, however, provided the exact opposite: that the assessor <em>\u201cshall consider </em>the actual rental income applicable ... at the time of such determination.\u201d Thus, to the extent that the legislative history of the original Senate bill supports the town\u2019s argument regarding the exclusion of actual rent, it is irrelevant to our interpretation of \u00a7 12-63b (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">Furthermore, a review of the legislative history of the substitute bill reveals that the trial court\u2019s analysis of \u00a7 12-63b (b) corresponds with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>legislative intent. The issue of whether to include contract rent was hotly-debated: the original bill called for income capitalization \u201cirrespective\u201d of contract rent; the final bill called for consideration of contract rent as well as market rent. In describing the bill, Senator Michael J. Skelley remarked that \u201cthis Bill has been worked over by quite a few people and there has been a substantial agreement that was made on this Bill. . . . The term market rent is defined in the Bill which means rental income of that property\u2014of such property would most properly command on the open market. As indicated, the present rental is being paid for comparable space. It\u2019s also mentioned that in determining the market rent, the assessor shall consider the actual rental income under the terms of the existing contract lease. This cuts both ways but it brings into light a much more equitable situation of how to determine the worth of commercial property . . . .\u201d 27 S. Proc., Pt. 7,1984 Sess., p. 2474, remarks of Senator Michael J. Skelley.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Representative Ronald L. Smoko\u2019s comments are also telling. \u201cThis bill amends section 12-63b, which is the assessment statute on income-producing property to clarify what is meant in that statute by market value. . . . Mr. Speaker, this bill lends some clarity to the statute in the continuing saga of the battle between contract rent versus market rent. Mr. Speaker, it is a bill that has been worked on by a number of individuals and has been worked on to the point where virtually all of those parties with a position have come to the conclusion that this is a fair and rational restructuring of [\u00a7] 12-63b, and I would urge passage of this bill.\u201d 27 H.R.
