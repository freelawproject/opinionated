The plaintiffs, the state of Connecticut, the state department of public safety (public safety) and the state department of administrative services (administrative services), appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court, rendered after a hearing and submission of posthear-ing memoranda, sustaining the decision in part and modifying the review board order. Specifically, the trial court: (1) determined that the decision of the review board was not final; and (2) nonetheless, sustained the decision in part, and modified it by adding to it a provision for the review board to retain jurisdiction over the matter. The plaintiffs claim that the trial court: (1) improperly determined that the review board\u2019s decision was not final for the purposes of the UAPA; and (2) improperly modified the review board\u2019s decision to cause the review board to retain jurisdiction over the matter. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>The factual findings of the review board as set forth in its decision and order, and the procedural history of this case, are not disputed for purposes of this appeal. The defendant Daniel Cawley<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was hired by public safety in May, 1986, as a data processing manager 3 (DPM 3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that time, he supervised approximately thirty employees as well as the activities of the data processing unit. Over the next several years, Cawley\u2019s supervisory responsibilities diminished until November 30, 1990,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> when those responsibilities were completely terminated. Instead, public safety assigned him to special projects that he conducted independently. Public safety gave Cawley\u2019s supervisory responsibilities to a DPM 1, a position of lower rank and salary than a DPM 3. This shift in duties was intended to be, and was, permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Early in 1990, a classification specialist from administrative services advised public safety to make changes in the data processing unit. Specifically, administrative services advised public safety to \u201cred-circle\u201d the DPM 3 position,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>and to abolish or reclassify it to a non-managerial level once it had been vacated. Despite the administrative services directive, when Cawley was permanently reassigned to a nonsupervisory position in November, 1990, public safety did not review the classification of his position. Rather, Cawley remained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>a DPM 3.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Cawley continued to draw pay as a DPM 3 after his reassignment until public safety laid him off on May 31, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Cawley appealed to the review board pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 5-202,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> seeking a determination as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>to whether his layoff was in accordance with General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 5-241,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which requires layoffs by seniority within a position classification selected for layoff. The review board determined that because Cawley\u2019s position had not been reviewed pursuant to the administrative services recommendation, neither his proper position classification nor his relative seniority within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>that classification could be determined. Therefore, the review board concluded, the layoff was improper as \u201carbitrary or taken without reasonable cause.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 5-202 (b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thereafter, the review board ordered public safety, with the assistance of administrative services, to \u201creview the position classification of Daniel Cawley\u2019s [DPM 3] position, as of the time when he was assigned to new duties, November 30,1990, and, based on such duties, determine the appropriate classification of his position.\u201d The review board\u2019s order also directed public safety, upon completion of the classification review, to follow its normal procedures in determining which positions should have been abolished and which employees occupying those positions should have been laid off. The review board ordered that if the result of the analysis indicated that Cawley was wrongfully laid off, he was to be reinstated and awarded appropriate back pay, seniority and other benefits. The review board made clear that it was not ordering the state to review the classification of all red-circled positions, but rather that its decision required review as follows: \u201cif a position has been red-circled and if a permanent vacancy has occurred therein, and such position [has been] considered for layoff, the classification of such position must be reviewed and decided before a layoff decision affecting such position can be made.\u201d The review board did not retain jurisdiction over the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The plaintiffs appealed to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-202 (Z)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 4-183 <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> claiming that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>they were aggrieved by the review board\u2019s decision and that the decision exceeded the review board\u2019s statutory authority. The trial court first determined that the review board decision was not a final decision within the meaning of \u00a7 4-183, and therefore was not appeal-able to the trial court because Cawley\u2019s right to reinstatement had not been finally determined by the review board. Having reached that conclusion, however, the trial court recognized that it was faced with a conundrum, namely, that: (1) lack of a final decision would \u201cordinarily\u201d require dismissal of the appeal; but (2) if the appeal were dismissed, it was possible, depending upon the outcome of the future proceedings ordered by the review board, that public safety would be deprived of an opportunity to challenge the validity of the administrative regime mandated by the review board decision, which public safety claimed to be beyond the authority of the review board.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>In order to resolve this conundrum, the trial court determined that the review board should have retained jurisdiction over Cawley\u2019s appeal \u201cfor the purpose of ultimately rendering a final decision after [public safety] had resolved the contingencies as directed by the order.\u201d How to implement that determination produced a second conundrum, however, because a determination that there had been no final decision necessarily would have required the trial court to dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the trial court rendered judgment sustaining the appeal in part, and ordering a modification of the review board decision, requiring the review board to retain jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>tion over Cawley\u2019s appeal and to permit further appeal by any party. In the trial court\u2019s view, this order solved the conundrum because it gave public safety an avenue of further access to the review board and, thereby, to the trial court, for the purpose of later challenging the authority of the review board to order the position classification review process at issue in this case. The trial court also noted that its decision would enable the review board to monitor the compliance with its order by public safety and administrative services.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The trial court identified two sources of authority to support its ordering the review board to retain jurisdiction, despite the court\u2019s determination that there had been no final decision for purposes of appeal pursuant to \u00a7 4-183. The first source was \u00a7 4-183 (k).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s reliance on this provision is misplaced, however, because the trial court\u2019s power to modify an agency\u2019s decision follows the court\u2019s decision to sustain the appeal, which can only be done if the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The second source was by analogy to the federal administrative law doctrine of primary jurisdiction. The trial court relied on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Michigan National Corp., </em>419 U.S. 1, 6, 95 S. Ct. 10, 42 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1974), for the proposition that \u201c[wjhere suit is brought after the first administrative decision and stayed until remaining administrative proceedings have concluded, judicial resources are conserved and both parties fully protected.\u201d The difficulty with this source of authority, however, is that the federal doctrine of primary jurisdiction presupposes that both the federal court and the administrative agency have concurrent subject mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>ter jurisdiction. See, e.g., <em>Pan American World Airways </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 296, 83 S. Ct. 476, 9 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1963). Thus, its use in this context would be inconsistent with our jurisprudence that a trial court has subject matter jurisdiction over an administrative appeal only if the administrative agency has rendered a final decision. Indeed, there are instances under federal administrative law, analogous to our law, in which the federal court must dismiss an action because an administrative agency has exclusive jurisdiction to consider the complaint. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Michigan National Corp., </em>supra, 5 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Thus, the trial court\u2019s analysis, although a creative attempt to surmount the jurisdictional hurdles that it accurately perceived, itself engendered other insurmountable jurisdictional hurdles. Having determined, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s analysis cannot stand, we turn to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial court\u2019s initial conclusion, namely, that the review board decision was not final, was flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The plaintiffs claim that the review board\u2019s decision is final because, under the UAPA, it is an agency determination in a contested case. They argue that the test for finality of an agency decision under the UAPA is whether: (1) judicial review would effect the orderly process of adjudication of the case; (2) obligations or legal consequences would flow from the agency decision; and (3) the agency intended to render a final decision. The plaintiffs contend that under this test, the review board\u2019s decision is final.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The plaintiffs also claim that the review board has no statutory authority to maintain jurisdiction over an appeal once it has rendered a decision. We agree with both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>In determining whether an administrative decision is \u201cfinal\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 4-183 (a), we look first to our statutes governing such determinations. General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (3) states that a final decision is an \u201cagency determination in a contested case,\u201d but the term \u201cdoes not include a preliminary or intermediate ruling or order of an agency, or a ruling of an agency granting or denying a petition for reconsideration.\u201d A contested case is further defined as \u201ca proceeding . . . in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are required by statute to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (2); see footnote 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u201cThe considerations underlying the requirement of finality of an agency decision as a prerequisite to judicial review are akin to those involved in the ripeness doctrine as applied to administrative rulings. [I]ts basic rationale is to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties. <em>Abbott Laboratories </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 148-49, 87 S. Ct. 1507, 18 L. Ed. 2d 681 (1967). The cases dealing with judicial review of administrative actions have interpreted the finality element in a pragmatic way. Id., 149. [T]he relevant considerations in determining finality are whether the process of administrative decisionmaking has reached a stage where judicial review will not disrupt the orderly process of adjudication and whether rights or obligations have been determined or legal consequences will flow from the agency action. <em>Port of Boston Marine Terminal Assn. </em>v. <em>Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, </em>400 U.S. 62, 71, 91 S. Ct. 203, 27 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1970).\u201d (Inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>nal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>New Haven Police Union Local 530, </em>210 Conn. 597, 604, 557 A.2d 506 (1989). Another significant consideration is whether the agency intended its decision to be final. We have stated that \u201c[s]o long as the agency intends to render a final decision and the person taking the appeal is aggrieved by the decision rendered, the fact that other related issues are reserved for later adjudication does not necessarily detract from its finality.\u201d Id., 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">We conclude that the review board decision in this case satisfies the criteria for a final decision of an agency as set forth in New Haven. First, because no further administrative proceedings before the review board were contemplated, an appeal to the trial court would not \u201c \u2018disrupt the orderly process of adjudication.\u2019 \u201d Id., 604. It is true, as the trial court noted, that considering this review board decision to be nonfinal would avoid \u201cpiecemeal\u201d appeals in that Cawley\u2019s ultimate right to future employment would thereby be fully determined prior to judicial review of the review board decision. Under the UAPA, however, that does not necessarily detract from the finality of the review board decision. See id., 606. In this case, despite the possibility of a subsequent appeal, specific legal duties have been imposed on public safety and administrative services and, therefore, this appeal is not an \u201cabstract [disagreement] over administrative policies.\u201d Id., 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Second, the review board order directing public safety and administrative services to review the classification of Cawley\u2019s DPM 3 position immediately affected the administration of both agencies. As a direct result of the review board decision, both public safety and administrative services are required to undergo an administrative process of reviewing classifications in a certain class of cases. Thus, the \u201clegal rights, duties or privileges of a party\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (2); namely, public safety and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>administrative services, have been determined, and \u201c \u2018legal consequences will flow from the agency action.\u2019 \u201d <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>New Haven Police Union Local 530, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">It is not dispositive that, as the review board characterized it, its \u201cdecision is a very narrow one, and should not seriously impact the State.\u201d The review board has directed public safety, with the assistance of administrative services, to review the classification of Cawley\u2019s DPM 3 position and to apply the results of that review to Cawley\u2019s layoff. Under \u00a7 5-202 (d), public safety must within ten days \u201ctake such measures as are necessary to comply with the remedial action directed by the hearing panel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">If public safety were required to adhere to the review board order, its effects would be \u201c \u2018felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>New Haven Police Union Local 530, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 604.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The fact that in the present case such an order might not be difficult to carry out does not change the analysis. The ease with which public safety could comply with the order does not make it less concrete. Two state agencies have been ordered to undertake specific administrative actions. These actions, although purportedly unobtrusive, are, according to the plaintiffs, illegally ordered. Although the review board decision may leave open final resolution of Cawley\u2019s rights with respect to his employment, certain obligations of public safety and administrative services have been finally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>resolved and concrete legal responsibilities have been placed upon these agencies. This takes the review board decision out of the realm of the abstract and creates a finality for which the UAPA provides an appellate process.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Moreover, as the plaintiffs argue, the statutes governing the review board contain no provision for the review board to retain jurisdiction and monitor compliance with its orders.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cAn administrative agency, as a tribunal of limited jurisdiction, must act strictly within its statutory authority. <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 428, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988); <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>160 Conn. 226, 230, 278 A.2d 771 (1971). [An administrative agency] possesses no inherent power. Its authority is found in a legislative grant, beyond the terms and necessary implications of which it cannot lawfully function. <em>Adam </em>v. <em>Connecticut Medical Examining Board, </em>137 Conn. 535, 537-38, 79 A.2d 350 (1951); General Statutes \u00a7 19a-10. Absent a grant of authority, any sanction meted out by the board is necessarily void. <em>Newington </em>v. <em>Mazzoccoli, </em>133 Conn. 146, 156, 48 A.2d 729 (1946).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Stern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>v. <em>Medical Examining Board, </em>208 Conn. 492, 498, 545 A.2d 1080 (1988). Thus, the trial court\u2019s attempt to cure the problem that it perceived as a result of a lack of finality by ordering the review board to retain jurisdiction over Cawley\u2019s appeal imposed an authority on the review board that its governing statutes do not contemplate. This highlights another reason, rooted in the language of \u00a7 4-183, why the review board decision was a \u201cfinal decision of the agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The review board, as the sole agency from which any party to this litigation could appeal, cannot retain jurisdiction over an appeal after it has decided that appeal. Thus, any further proceedings at the public safety or administrative services level will not result in a final decision of an \u201cagency.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As the trial court noted, if public safety and administrative services comply with the review board order and, as a result, Cawley is satisfied, Cawley will have no reason to appeal. In that case, administrative services and public safety could not appeal to the review board because appeals to that agency are limited to \u201cemployees.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Any attempted appeal from such reinstatement by either public safety or administrative services directly to the trial court under \u00a7 4-183 would necessarily fail because that reinstatement action would not be a final decision of an agency. The review board\u2019s decision in this case is the only decision of an agency in a contested case from which these plaintiffs could appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Finally, it is apparent from the text and the surrounding circumstances of the review board decision that the review board intended it to be a final decision. The trial court noted that \u201c[i]t is not clear whether the review board intended to render a final decision, because its decision is not so labeled. Whether or not it intended to do so, however, the finality of a decision must be determined on the basis of its terms.\u201d Although we agree that the label of an administrative decision is not dispositive of the agency\u2019s intent, we do not agree that finality may be determined irrespective of the intent of the agency issuing the order. In <em>New Haven, </em>we stated that \u201cour statutes . . . giv[e] an agency discretion to limit in a practical way the scope of an administrative proceeding . ... <em>So long as the agency intends to render a final decision </em>and the person taking the appeal is aggrieved by the decision rendered, the fact that other related issues are reserved for later adjudication does not necessarily detract from its finality.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>New Haven Police Union Local 530, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Even in the absence of a label by the review board, a review of its decision indicates that it intended to render a final decision. First, the review board was fully cognizant of \u00a7 5-202 (b), which requires \u201ca decision within sixty calendar days from the date of the conclusion of the hearing.\u201d The review board rendered its decision without reserving any issue or ordering further evidence. Without some indication to the contrary, we presume that the review board intended to comply with the statute. Second, the review board determined that it no longer had any responsibility for the case, stating: \u201cHowever, our responsibility is not to see that [Cawley] is either reinstated or laid off, but only to insure that the classification and layoff process is legally sufficient. In making our decision, we have considered and rejected [Cawley\u2019s] theory that, because [admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>istrative services] pays no attention to position classifications when it assigns data processing managerial duties, we should do the same, and compare employees for layoff purely on seniority.\u201d Having rendered its decision, the review board had completed its duty as it saw fit and terminated the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Cawley argues, however, that this case is not governed by the criteria set forth in <em>New Haven. </em>He asserts that the trial court properly distinguished New <em>Haven </em>when it stated that \u201c[i]n that case the state board of labor relations had rendered a final decision determining the unfair labor practice claims against the city by issuing a cease and desist order and granting other relief, but had reserved jurisdiction with respect to the amount of compensation due to the many police officers. The court found that \u2018[s]uch a reservation was appropriate in this instance because the time required of adjudication of the numerous claims of the individual officers might well have delayed enforcement of the cease and desist order .\u2019. . .No such exceptional circumstances, however, are presented in this case.\u201d (Citation omitted.) We are not persuaded by this distinction. In <em>New Haven, </em>we did not determine that the labor board\u2019s decision was final because of the jurisdictional reservation, but rather in spite of it. The labor board\u2019s cease and desist provision was final because it \u201cwould have become effective immediately in the absence of an appeal.\u201d <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>New Haven Police Union Local 530, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 605. As with the case now before us, the agency\u2019s decision finalized rights and obligations of two of the parties, and would have become effective immediately in the absence of an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Cawley also argues that because \u201c[t]he remand by [the review board] clearly calls for the State to exercise judgment,\u201d the review board\u2019s decision was not final. In this respect, Cawley relies on our decisions in <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>214 Conn. 552, 573 A.2d 1 (1990), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>and <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>U.S. Printing Ink, Inc., </em>218 Conn. 181, 588 A.2d 194 (1991). These cases are distinguishable.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Both <em>Szudora </em>and <em>Cleveland </em>involved decisions by the workers\u2019 compensation review division, which is not governed by the UAPA. In those cases, we held that decisions of the review division are not appealable to the Appellate Court unless they meet the criteria for finality of court judgments for purposes of appeal. <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>U.S. Printing Ink, Inc., </em>supra, 185; <em>Szudora </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 556. Although there are certainly similarities between the criteria for finality of court judgments for purposes of appeal to our appellate courts and the criteria for determining whether an agency decision is final for purposes of appeal to the trial court under the UAPA, those respective criteria are not necessarily the same. That is reflected by the fact that the formulations of the respective criteria differ. Compare, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 463 A.2d 566 (1983), with <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>New Haven Police Union Local 530, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-10\"> The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-5\"> The named defendant, the review board, is the only other defendant.

Under that scenario, the trial court reasoned, if public safety were dissatisfied with the result of Cawley\u2019s second appeal to the review board, public safety could then appeal further to the trial court pursuant to \u00a7 4-183.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Absent a second appeal to the review board by Cawley, however, either because, for example, he was satisfied by the result of the process mandated by the review board or because he felt that a further appeal would be fruitless, there would be no opportunity for public safety to challenge the authority of the review board to have ordered public safety and administrative services to undergo that administrative process. This would have been so because only an employee may appeal to the review board pursuant to \u00a7 5-202 (a). Thus, as the trial court perceived, without the right of further access to the review board by public safety, the review board would have no occasion to render a \u201cfinal decision\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4-183 and, therefore, there would be no opportunity for an appeal by public safety to the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\"> Our well established case law interpreting the UAPA requires, with certain exceptions not applicable here; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b); a \u201cfinal decision\u201d in a contested case as a prerequisite to subject matter jurisdiction over an appeal. See, e.g., <em>Summit Hydropower Partnership </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>226 Conn. 792, 811-12, 629 A.2d 367 (1993).

There is no provision in that statute explicitly giving the review board the authority to retain jurisdiction over an appeal to it after it has rendered a decision therein, and we cannot conclude that such authority is necessary for the review board to function lawfully. Indeed, two subsections of \u00a7 5-202 strongly suggest the absence of such authority. Subsection (b) requires the review board hearing panel to render a decision within sixty days of the conclusion of the hearing, and subdivision (d) requires that the employee\u2019s appointing authority comply with any remedy ordered within ten days of the issuance of the review board hearing panel\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b429-6\"> Aggrievement by a final decision of an agency is an essential predicate to review by the Superior Court.

Although public safety and administrative services are both state agencies in a general sense, for the purpose of the UAPA they are not the \u201cagency\u201d rendering a final decision in a contested case. The review board is that agency, and public safety and administrative services are contestants before that agency. Hence, despite the trial court\u2019s creative attempt to avoid the conundrum it perceived, if Cawley were reinstated or otherwise satisfied as a result of the ordered position classification review process, there would never be a final decision of an agency that would trigger the plaintiffs\u2019 right to appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b429-7\"> See footnote 7 for the text of \u00a7 5-202.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\"> Cawley\u2019s reliance on <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>216 Conn. 253, 579 A.2d 505 (1990), is similarly misplaced.
