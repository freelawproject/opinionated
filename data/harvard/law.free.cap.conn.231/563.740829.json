J.</author>\n<p id=\"aeu-dedup-0\">The dispositive issue in this consolidated appeal is the extent of the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to inquire into a plaintiffs authority to bring a lawsuit in the name of an Indian tribe. The plaintiff, representing itself to be the Golden Hill Pau-gussett Tribe of Indians (plaintiff), brought an action to quiet title to land located in the town of Southbury (town). In its complaint, the plaintiff requested that the town be designated representative of a proposed defendant class of current owners of that land. The state of Connecticut (state) and a party representing itself as the General Tribal Council of the Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation (council) moved separately to intervene as defendants, and the trial court granted both motions. Thereafter, the defendants separately moved to dismiss the action on the grounds that, inter alia, the plaintiff had no authority to bring this lawsuit in the name of the tribe. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court found that the tribe had not authorized the suit and rendered judgment dismissing the action. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">This action arises out of events that are alleged to have occurred more than 300 years ago. In its complaint, the plaintiff claimed that its tribe, from time immemorial until the arrival of English colonists, had possessed, occupied and controlled much of present-day southwestern Connecticut. The plaintiff further claimed that, in a deed of 1706, the tribe had transferred to a group of colonists the tribe\u2019s Indian title to certain lands, but had \u201creserved\u201d to the tribe the land now in dispute. The plaintiff admitted that, in the years 1733 to 1759, a series of additional deeds had purported to transfer to the colonists the reserved land as well. The plaintiff contended, however, that those later deeds had been void ab initio, because the transfers had occurred without the Colonial General Court\u2019s express consent in violation of General Court enactments of 1663, 1680 and 1717. In light of the alleged invalidity of the later deeds, the plaintiff contended that its \u201cIndian title\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the reserved land never had been properly extinguished, and, therefore, that it has a present right to occupy the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">After filing its complaint, the plaintiff filed a notice of lis pendens in the Southbury town clerk\u2019s office and began to serve copies of the notice on all 1200 recorded current owners of the land. Alleging that the lis pen-dens was causing irreparable harm to the current land<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>owners by making their titles uninsurable, the town filed motions for a temporary injunction against continued service of the notice of lis pendens and for discharge of the lis pendens itself. After a hearing, the trial court granted both motions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Thereafter, all three defendants moved to dismiss the action on the grounds that the lawsuit, although brought in the name of the tribe, actually had not been authorized by the tribe. The trial court held an eviden-tiary hearing on the motions to dismiss, at which the plaintiff refused, on grounds of tribal sovereignty, to offer any evidence of its authority to sue on behalf of the tribe, other than copies of documents filed with the governor pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47-66\u00cd.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Those documents did not directly authorize any individual to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>sue on behalf of the tribe, but they did indicate that the tribe\u2019s \u201cleader\u201d was its \u201cTraditional Chief,\u201d Chief Big Eagle. The documents also indicated that Chief Big Eagle had appointed his son, Chief Quiet Hawk, to be the tribe\u2019s \u201cCouncil Chief.\u201d Although neither Chief Big Eagle nor Chief Quiet Hawk testified at the hearing, the parties stipulated that someone identifying himself as Chief Quiet Hawk had authorized the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to file the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In support of their motions to dismiss, the defendants offered testimony, which the trial court found credible, that Chief Quiet Hawk lacked authority to sue on behalf of the tribe. R. Michael Smith, a member of the tribe, testified that (1) notwithstanding the documents filed with the governor, the tribe was governed by an elected tribal council, (2) only the council could authorize a lawsuit in the name of the tribe and (3) in this case, the council specifically had decided not to authorize the action. Michael S. Haney, executive director of the American Indian Arbitration Institute, confirmed that pursuant to the customs and practices of the Golden Hill Paugussetts, only the tribal council could authorize a lawsuit in the name of the tribe. Haney testified, further, that a survey of the tribe\u2019s members disclosed no one who supported Chief Quiet Hawk in the bringing of the lawsuit. After finding that \u201cthe Council, and not Quiet Hawk, has control of the group calling themselves members of the tribe\u201d and that the council \u201cwishes the case withdrawn,\u201d the trial court granted the motions to dismiss.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>On appeal, the plaintiff argues, for two reasons, that the trial court improperly dismissed the case. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> First, the plaintiff maintains that the trial court had no jurisdiction to determine whether the plaintiff actually had power to act in the name of the tribe, as that question was a matter of tribal sovereignty not cognizable in civil court. Second, the plaintiff contends that, even if the trial court had jurisdiction to determine whether the plaintiff had authority to sue, the court was bound to make that determination solely on the basis of the documents filed with the governor pursuant to \u00a7 47-66\u00cd and was required to allow this suit to proceed because the individual who had authorized the suit was listed in those documents as a \u201cleader\u201d of the tribe. We disagree with both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s initial claim is that the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction when it decided that the plaintiff lacked authority to sue in the name of the tribe.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The plaintiffs claim requires us to examine the interrelationship of three propositions: (1) courts always have jurisdiction to determine whether they have jurisdiction; (2) courts lack jurisdiction over suits brought in the names of parties by persons unauthorized to sue on behalf of those parties; and (3) instrumentalities of the state have no jurisdiction over the internal affairs of bona fide Indian tribes. In essence, the plaintiff asks us to hold that the third proposition superseded the first two\u2014that is, that because of tribal sovereignty, the trial court had no power to decide the jurisdictional question of whether the plaintiff had authority to sue on the tribe\u2019s behalf. In the circumstances of this case, however, we need not decide whether a tribe\u2019s inherent sovereignty outweighs a court\u2019s inherent power to decide its jurisdiction. Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s implicit assertion, we are persuaded that all three propositions not only are compatible in this case, but are complementary, and that the trial court respected all of them by dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">We first address the trial court\u2019s power to determine its jurisdiction. As we have held repeatedly, the power to determine its jurisdiction is one of the core inherent powers of a court. \u201c[0]nce the question of lack of jurisdiction of a court is raised, [it] must be disposed of no matter in what form it is presented . . . and the court must fully resolve it before proceeding further with the case. ... [A] court must have jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>to determine its own jurisdiction once that has been put in issue.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 429-30, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988); accord <em>Chrysler Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>Fairfield Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>180 Conn. 223, 227, 429 A.2d 478 (1980); <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>178 Conn. 173, 178, 422 A.2d 290 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">As we also have held, \u201c[i]t is a basic principle of law that a plaintiff must have standing for the court to have jurisdiction. Standing is the legal right to set judicial machinery in motion. One cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless he has . . . some real interest in the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title or interest in the subject matter of the controversy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Unisys Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Labor, </em>220 Conn. 689, 693, 600 A.2d 1019 (1991); <em>Ardmare Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Freedman, </em>191 Conn. 497, 501, 467 A.2d 674 (1983). The standing requirement is \u201cdesigned to ensure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and that judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 223, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992); <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>210 Conn. 646, 649, 556 A.2d 1020 (1989); <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>183 Conn. 313, 320, 439 A.2d 349 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">To fulfill these goals, the standing doctrine requires a plaintiff to demonstrate two facts. First, the complaining party must be a \u201cproper party to request adjudication of the issues.\u201d <em>Nye </em>v. <em>Marcus, </em>198 Conn. 138, 141, 502 A.2d 869 (1985). Second, the person or persons who prosecute the claim on behalf of the complaining party must have authority to represent the party. See, e.g., <em>Orsi </em>v. <em>Senatore, </em>230 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>459, 470, 645 A.2d 986 (1994) (standing of foster parent to sue child\u2019s guardian on behalf of child); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 109, 112-16, 445 A.2d 304 (1982) (standing of state\u2019s attorney to challenge recommendation of sentence review division on behalf of state); <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Southern Connecticut Gas Co., </em>172 Conn. 362, 370, 374 A.2d 1051 (1977) (standing of shareholder to file derivative action on behalf of corporation); <em>Vaitekunene </em>v. <em>Budrys, </em>156 Conn. 547, 554, 244 A.2d 408 (1968) (standing of legatee\u2019s purported attorney to appeal order of Probate Court on behalf of legatee).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">A complaining party ordinarily can show that it is \u201ca proper party\u201d when it \u201cmakes a colorable claim of [a] direct injury [it] has suffered or is likely to suffer, in an individual or representative capacity. Such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy . . . provides the requisite assurance of concrete adverseness and diligent advocacy.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 223-24; <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 649; <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">To demonstrate authority to sue, however, it is not enough for a party merely to show a \u201ccolorable claim\u201d to such authority. Rather, the party whose authority is challenged has the burden of convincing the court that the authority exists. See <em>Orsi </em>v. <em>Senatore, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 470; <em>Vaitekunene </em>v. <em>Budrys, </em>supra, 156 Conn. 554; see also <em>Meredith </em>v. <em>Ionian Trader, </em>279 F.2d 471, 474 (2d Cir. 1960) (\u201cA party to ... a suit may by motion or pleading dispute the authority of the opposing party \u2018to act for the party in whose name he is proceeding, and, if the authority is not shown, the court will dismiss the action for want of parties before it.\u2019 \u201d). The burden of proof for questions of authority is higher than that for questions of propriety because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>the former questions are more important. Lawsuits must be authorized not only to ensure that the litigants \u201c \u2018fairly and vigorously\u2019 \u201d represent the party\u2019s views; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information </em>Commission, supra, 221 Conn. 223; but also because, if unauthorized lawsuits were allowed to proceed, future rights of the named parties might be severely impaired. Because of the doctrines of collateral estoppel (issue preclusion) and res judicata (claim preclusion), parties named in an unauthorized suit might later be unable to relitigate issues decided in that suit or to bring new claims. <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Southern Connecticut Gas </em>Co., supra, 172 Conn. 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">In this case, as it was not disputed that the tribe itself had at least \u201ca colorable claim of [a] direct injury [it] ha[d] suffered . . . in an individual or representative capacity\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 223; the motions to dismiss did not allege that the <em>tribe </em>was not a \u201cproper party\u201d to bring an action to quiet title to the disputed lands. The motions to dismiss argued only that the <em>person </em>who had brought suit on behalf of the tribe lacked authority to do so. In light of the precedents cited above, those motions properly called into question the jurisdiction of the trial court and required the court to determine its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The plaintiff alleges, however, that even if a court normally is empowered to investigate a litigant\u2019s authority to represent a party, the court does not have such power here, because any exercise of that power would violate the inherent sovereignty of the tribe. To avoid interfering with tribal sovereignty, according to the plaintiff, the trial court was required to accept the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that it had authority to sue and therefore was required to adjudicate the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Interestingly, the state joins the first part of the plaintiffs argument, agreeing that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to resolve who had authority to sue, because doing so interfered with the sovereignty of the tribe. From this agreement with the plaintiff, however, the state draws the opposite conclusion. The state reasons that, because the trial court had no power to decide who had authority to sue, the court was unable to make an affirmative finding that the plaintiff had standing, and thus it could not exercise jurisdiction over the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">We agree with both the plaintiff and the state that our courts may not interfere with tribal sovereignty. We disagree with both parties, however, that the trial court\u2019s decision as to whether the plaintiff had authority to sue on behalf of the tribe amounted to such an interference. On the contrary, greater threats to tribal sovereignty are posed by the positions taken by the plaintiff and the state than by the actions of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Like all instrumentalities of the state of Connecticut, our courts are powerless to intervene in the exercise of tribal self-government. Federal statute, federal common law and state statute all require us to treat bona fide Indian tribes as sovereign nations and to protect tribal rights to self-determination. <em>Schaghticoke Indians of Kent, Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>217 Conn. 612, 626-29, 587 A.2d 139 (1991).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because of the continuing inherent sovereignty of Indian tribes, for example, federal common law forbids states from \u201cunlawfully infring[ing] on the right of reservation Indians to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>their own laws and be ruled by them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe </em>v. <em>Bracker, </em>448 U.S. 136, 142, 100 S. Ct. 2578, 65 L. Ed. 2d 665 (1980); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>358 U.S. 217, 220, 79 S. Ct. 269, 3 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1959). Similarly, state statutes explicitly provide that \u201cthe indigenous tribes, [including] . . . the Golden Hill Paugussett are self-governing entities possessing powers and duties over tribal members and reservations. Such powers and duties include the power to . . . (2) determine the tribal form of government . . . and (5) determine tribal leadership in accordance with tribal practice and usage.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-59a (b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Any action by a state court that infringed on tribal sovereignty or interfered in tribal self-government would therefore be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Our recognition of tribal sovereignty does not, however, render all matters touching upon tribal decisions nonjusticiable. As the United States Supreme Court has made clear, tribal sovereignty does not impede state court jurisdiction unless \u201cthe exercise of state-court jurisdiction in [the] case would interfere with the right of tribal Indians to govern themselves under their own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>laws.\u201d <em>Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C., </em>467 U.S. 138, 148, 104 S. Ct. 2267, 81 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1984). If the exercise of state court jurisdiction is \u201ccompatible with tribal autonomy\u201d; id., 149; judicial action not only is permitted, but may be required. See id., 151-52 (suggesting that failure to exercise jurisdiction could violate Indians\u2019 rights under due process clause, equal protection clause and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The question before us, therefore, is whether, in deciding if the plaintiff had authority to sue on behalf of the tribe, the trial court actually interfered with the exercise of tribal sovereignty. Notwithstanding the plaintiff\u2019s and the state\u2019s arguments, we are persuaded that the trial court\u2019s actions were consistent with such sovereignty. By determining whether the suit had been brought by the tribe, the trial court preserved the autonomy of the tribe to choose its own form of government (i.e., government by tribal council) and enforced the tribe\u2019s sovereign decision not to sue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The propriety of the trial court\u2019s actions is further established by a decision of the United States Supreme Court, in a case strikingly similar to the case at bar, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>more than sixty years ago. In <em>Pueblo of Santa Rosa </em>v. <em>Fall, </em>273 U.S. 315, 317, 47 S. Ct. 361, 71 L. Ed. 658 (1927), as in this case, a suit had been filed in the name of an Indian tribe pursuant to a power of attorney executed by a man who purported to be the \u201cCaptain\u201d or chief of the tribe. The defendant, by way of a motion to dismiss, alleged that counsel had no authority to sue in the name of the tribe. Id., 319. At an evidentiary hearing, the defendant offered evidence of \u201cinquiries, conducted among the Indians . . . [that] failed to disclose anyone who knew of any authority from the Indians to bring or maintain the suit. . . . The evidence further show[ed] that no suit properly could have been brought without the prior consent of the Indians in council and that no council for that purpose was ever assembled. . . . Indeed, there [was] no evidence to the contrary worthy of serious consideration.\u201d Id., 318-20. The proper result, the court declared, was that the trial court should \u201cdismiss the bill, on the ground that the suit was brought by counsel without authority . . . .\u201d Id., 321.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Had the trial court followed the plaintiffs or the state\u2019s suggested courses of action, on the other hand, it would have risked a substantial infringement of tribal sovereignty. If, as the plaintiff desired, the suit had gone forward, the tribe might later have been precluded from relitigating issues decided against the plaintiff, or barred from bringing new claims not raised by the plaintiff. Likewise, if, as the state desired, the suit had been dismissed because there was a \u201cdispute\u201d about who was authorized to sue on behalf of an Indian tribe, the tribe might be forever foreclosed from bringing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>even an authorized lawsuit in its own name.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Cf. id., 321 (cautioning that trial court should dismiss unauthorized suit only without prejudice to \u201cthe bringing of any other suit hereafter by and with the authority of the alleged Pueblo of Santa Rosa\u201d). Both parties\u2019 suggestions, therefore, lead to results far more detrimental to tribal sovereignty than the path followed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In conclusion, we reiterate that the inherent sovereignty of Indian tribes bars courts from intervening in many matters of tribal self-government. The principle of tribal sovereignty, however, does not bar courts from acting to protect tribal sovereignty and thus did not bar the actions of the trial court in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s second claim is that, even if the trial court was empowered to decide whether the plaintiff was authorized to sue on behalf of the tribe, the court was required to decide the issue of standing solely on the basis of documents filed with the governor pursuant to \u00a7 47-66\u00cd. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">We note, first, that the statute itself does not require a trial court to look only to \u00a7 47-66\u00cd documents when deciding a litigant\u2019s authority to sue. The statute\u2019s only stated purpose in requiring the documents to be filed is to limit a court\u2019s role in reviewing an optional dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>pute resolution mechanism also established by the statute. The statute provides that <em>\u201c[u]pon request </em>of a party to a dispute, the dispute <em>may\u201d </em>be submitted to a panel of three arbitrators. (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 47-66\u00cd (b). On appeal from the arbitral procedure, the statute then directs the Superior Court to determine \u201cif provisions of the written description filed . . . pursuant to this section have been followed\u201d and to vacate the decision and remand the case to the arbitrators if \u201cthe dispute was not resolved in accordance with the provisions of the written description.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-66\u00cd (b). Section 47-66\u00cd, therefore, is consistent with other legislation limiting the scope of judicial review of consensual arbitration awards.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because nothing in the legislative history otherwise suggests, we are persuaded that the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 47-66\u00cd, did not intend to limit the Superior Court\u2019s role in deciding whether an individual had authority to represent a tribe in an action brought to the Superior Court in the first instance.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Our conclusion is buttressed by the limited reliability of the documents contemplated by \u00a7 47-66\u00cd with respect to a leader\u2019s actual authority to act on behalf of a tribe. On its face, the statute empowers any individual purporting to be the \u201cleader\u201d of a tribe to file documents confirming his leadership and power. The statute provides no procedure to guarantee that the tribe consents to the contents of the documents before they are filed by its purported leader.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Cf. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 476.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The statute also establishes no procedure by which the executive officials who receive the documents can inquire into the documents\u2019 provenance.

In this case, the trial court found, as a matter of fact, that the documents were unreliable, and that the lawsuit had not been authorized by the tribe.

First, the trial court noted that if \u201ca tribe is a group or band of Indians following a leader,\u201d the court was required to dismiss for lack of standing because \u201c[t]he designated plaintiff in this lawsuit is . . . not a tribe or representing a tribe . . . .\u201d The trial court explained that, because \u201c[n]o other members of the group calling themselves members of the Golden Hill Tribe of Indians support the bringing of this lawsuit on Quiet Hawk\u2019s authority ... no tribe exists which followed Quiet Hawk at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>time suit was filed [that] may be designated as the plaintiff Golden Hill Pau-gussett Tribe of Indians.\u201d Second, the trial court held that if its determination of the plaintiff\u2019s standing implicated an \u201cissue of disputed tribal leadership,\u201d it was required to dismiss because such issues were \u201cunsuited to judicial inquiry\u2019 \u2019 and \u2018 \u2018reserved by the Legislative Branch for resolution by a tie breaker appointed by the Executive Branch.\u201d Third, the trial court held that if it did have \u201cinherent jurisdiction to determine the identity and capacity of a party filing a lawsuit,\u201d it would be required to dismiss because, as a matter of fact, Quiet Hawk had no authority to sue on the tribe\u2019s behalf. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment only on the last of these three grounds. Like the trial court, we offer no opinion as to who <em>did </em>have authority to sue on the tribe\u2019s behalf, and affirm only the finding that Quiet Hawk did not have such authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b591-11\"> The plaintiff also argues on appeal that the trial court should not have imposed the temporary injunction against service of the notice of lis pen-dens or discharged the lis pendens. Because we affirm the trial court\u2019s determination that the plaintiff lacked authority to sue, however, these other issues on appeal are moot, and we need not reach them.

Cohen\u2019s monumental treatise, Handbook of Federal Indian Law (reprint 1986) (1942) p. 126, to support its proposition that courts are powerless to examine whether an individual represents an Indian tribe, Cohen actually supports the opposite principle. Cohen wrote: \u201cThe question of whether action taken in the name of an Indian tribe is in truth tribal action, has been before state and federal courts on many occasions, and in every case the courts have held that the definition of the form of tribal government is a matter for the decision of the Indians themselves.\u201d Id. To ensure that \u201cthe decision of the Indians themselves\u201d are upheld, Cohen continued, courts are obligated to decide, based on tribal law, whether an individual had authority to represent a tribe: \u201cNot only must officers presuming to act in the name of an Indian tribe show that their acts fall within their allotted function and authority, but likewise the procedural formalities which tradition or ordinance require must be followed in executing an act within the acknowledged jurisdiction of the officer or set of officers.\u201d Id., p. 127; see also id., pp. 126-28 and nn.34 and 46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b599-6\"> See also <em>Meredith </em>v. <em>Ionian Trader, </em>supra, 279 F.2d 473-74 (following <em>Pueblo of Santa Rosa </em>v. <em>Fall, </em>supra, 273 U.S. 315, dismissing suit by insurer of damaged cargo because statements of cargo\u2019s owner, the sovereign government of Pakistan, showed that insurer had no authority to sue on owner\u2019s behalf).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b600-9\"> The state suggests that the trial court would only need to wait until the dispute had been resolved pursuant to the arbitration procedures outlined in \u00a7 47-66\u00cd. Because those statutory procedures are discretionary, however, a court has no guaranty that the dispute ever would be submitted for resolution. In addition, the state does not explain how a court could prevent opposing parties from making false allegations that there were \u201cdisputes\u201d as a means to deprive the court of jurisdiction. If, as the state contends, a court has no power to hear evidence on the internal decision-making processes of the tribe, the court apparently would have to find that there was a bona fide \u201cdispute,\u201d and then dismiss the case, whenever anyone challenged a litigant\u2019s standing to sue on behalf of a tribe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b601-5\"> The statutory language, its legislative history, and policy considerations all support our conclusion that \u00a7 47-66\u00cd does not require disputing parties to submit to arbitration before a court can determine an individual\u2019s authority to sue. In the same statute providing that disputes \u201cmay\u201d be submitted to arbitration, the legislature also provided that disputes \u201cshall\u201d be resolved in accordance with tribal usage and practice, that parties submitting to arbitration \u201cshall\u201d each appoint one arbitrator, that the governor \u201cshall\u201d appoint a tie-breaking arbitrator if the parties cannot agree on a joint appointment, that the arbitrators\u2019 decision \u201cshall\u201d be final on substantive issues, that an appeal from the arbitration award \u201cmay\u201d be taken to the Superior Court, and that the court on appeal \u201cshall\u201d remand the case to the arbitrators if the dispute was not resolved in accordance with the written documents. \u201cThis use of shall and may in the same statute, which is commonly mandatory and directory in connotation is a factor that evidences affirmative selectivity of terms with specific intent to be distinctive in meaning. The words shall and may must then be assumed to have been used with discrimination and a full awareness of the difference in their ordinary meanings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Builders Service Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>208 Conn. 267, 304-305, 545 A.2d 530 (1988); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>175 Conn. 504, 509, 400 A.2d 721 (1978); <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>169 Conn. 344, 365 n.19, 363 A.2d 170 (1975); <em>Shulman v.

This argument, however, is supported neither by legal precedent nor by the factual record in this case, the latter of which indicates that the plaintiff persisted in its refusal to offer evidence at the hearing even after the defendants had stipulated, on the record, that they would not argue that the plaintiff had waived its jurisdictional challenge.

Indeed, the state of Connecticut has specifically recognized the Golden Hill Paugus-sett Tribe as a self-governing entity \u201cpossessing powers and duties over tribal members and reservations. Such powers and duties include the power to: (1) Determine tribal membership and residency on reservation land; (2) determine the tribal form of government; (3) regulate trade and commerce on the reservation; (4) make contracts; and (5) determine tribal leadership in accordance with tribal practice and usage.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-59a (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Allowing a tribe of Indians to choose its leader in the way it sees fit necessarily means allowing it to decide what powers and duties that leader is to possess. The Indians, for example, must be allowed to determine for themselves whether their leader possesses plenary powers to represent their interests in any manner he deems necessary or whether he must answer to a governing body of some sort. Similarly, the Indians must be allowed to decide for themselves whether their leader represents their interests on all concerns, or only on a limited range of narrowly framed issues. The majority, however, usurps the rights of the Indians to make these fundamental choices by holding that the trial court had a duty to receive evidence on this intratribal dispute and to determine whether the Indians had authorized their acknowledged chief to bring this action. The majority defends its action by paternalistically suggesting that it actually is protecting the rights of the Indians to self-determination, and that refusing to so hold would \u201clead to results far more detrimental to tribal sovereignty.\u201d Such a decision is, in my view, an unnecessary infringement on the rights of a sovereign people.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>The state legislature, not only recognizing the state\u2019s interest in knowing what form of governance a tribe has adopted and who represents the tribe but also concerned with the sovereignty of the Indian tribes, has established a procedure providing for out-of-court resolution of intratribal disputes. In 1987, the state legislature, by special act, established the Legislative Task Force on Indian Affairs (task force) to research all aspects of Indian life. Special Acts 1987, No. 87-103. The act specifically authorized the task force to study and make recommendations for legislation involving the process for determining tribal membership; Special Acts 1987, No. 87-103, \u00a7 (a) (4); and the rights of tribal government. Special Acts 1987, No. 87-103, \u00a7 (a) (5). The task force consisted of Indians from each of the five tribes recognized by the state of Connecticut including the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe, legislators and members of the state executive branch. Special Acts 1987, No. 87-103, \u00a7 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">After more than one year of research, the task force proposed to the legislature a carefully crafted mechanism that provided for the resolution of intratribal governance and leadership disputes in a manner that is deferential to the sovereignty of the Indian tribes. The legislature adopted the recommended procedure in essentially unchanged form when it adopted No. 89-368, \u00a7 18, of the 1989 Public Acts, which has been codified as General Statutes \u00a7 47-66\u00cd.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Section 47-66\u00cd, entitled \u201cMethod of selecting tribal leaders. Disputes,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> establishes a two-pronged mech<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>anism for state recognition of Indian leadership and the out-of-court resolution of intratribal disputes. First, the statute requires documentary filings with the state describing each tribe\u2019s method of governance and identifying the tribe\u2019s leader. Second, the statute creates a detailed dispute resolution procedure through which intratribal leadership disputes can be resolved without resort to a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Under the documentary prong of this scheme, each tribal leader is required to file with the governor his name, a written description of the method the tribe uses to select tribal leaders and the process by which tribal leaders exercise their authority. General Statutes \u00a7 47-66\u00cd (a). That statute requires that the governor, in turn, file this document with the secretary of the state and the Indian Affairs Council.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 47-66\u00cd (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The dispute resolution prong provides that any intratribal leadership dispute shall be resolved in accordance with tribal usage and practices. General Statutes \u00a7 47-66\u00cd (b). In the case of such a controversy, \u00a7 47-66\u00cd (b) provides a minimally intrusive, out-of-court procedure to resolve it in accordance with tribal law by appointing a dispute resolution council to be the final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>arbiter: \u201cUpon request of a party to a dispute, the dispute may be settled by a council. Each party to the dispute shall appoint a member to the council and the parties shall jointly appoint one or two additional members provided the number of members of the council shall be an odd number. If the parties cannot agree on any joint agreement, the governor shall appoint any such member who shall be a person knowledgeable in Indian affairs. The decision of the council shall be final on substantive issues.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-66\u00cd (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Although \u00a7 47-66\u00cd (b) provides for judicial oversight of the dispute resolution procedure, the statute strictly limits the role of the court. Section 47-66\u00cd (b) allows either party to appeal the decision of the council to the Superior Court, but makes clear that the court may only review the actions of the council to determine whether it followed the tribe\u2019s practices as those practices are described in the documents filed with the governor and the secretary of the state pursuant to the documentary prong of \u00a7 47-66\u00cd. If the court finds error in the council\u2019s decision, the court\u2019s sole available remedy is to remand the dispute to the council so that the council may reconsider its decision. General Statutes \u00a7 47-66\u00cd (b). In other words, under the statute, a state court has no authority whatsoever to substitute its findings, beliefs or conclusions about the tribe\u2019s leadership or governance for that of the council.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">This dispute resolution procedure, particularly under the circumstances of this case, must be interpreted as providing the exclusive means for resolving the leadership and governance questions here in issue. I reach this conclusion for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">First, this procedure was painstakingly crafted by the task force and the legislature as a means of ensuring the sovereignty of the Indian nations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>members of the task force intended that the procedure \u201cwill become the format for settling any dispute over leadership\u201d; 32 H.R. Proc., Pt. 31,1989 Sess., p. 10897, remarks of Representative Andrew Norton; and that state courts would have only a limited role in the process. For example, Representative Norton, a member of the task force, explained during the debate on the floor of the House of Representatives that in case of an appeal to the Superior Court, the court\u2019s only role is \u201cto determine if the procedures have been followed faithfully.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The legislature, of course, has authority to define the subject matter jurisdiction of Connecticut state courts.

As Chief Justice Peters wrote for the majority in <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 757, 764-65, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993), in determining whether the legislature has erected a barrier to our subject matter jurisdiction, \u201c \u2018we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . .\u2019\u2019\u2019All of these factors compel the conclusion that the legislature, in approving \u00a7 47-66\u00cd, intended to make the dispute resolution council the exclusive means for resolving intratribal conflicts and thereby clearly circumscribed the jurisdiction of state courts to make such determinations. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Piper, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New London, Docket Nos. CR21-57349, CR21-57446 (August 12,1994,12 Conn. L. Rptr. 137,138-39) (holding that similar procedural provisions in General Statutes \u00a7 47-66j for determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>ing tribal membership strip state courts of subject matter jurisdiction).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Second, the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe endorsed the procedures established by \u00a7 47-66\u00cd. Aurelius H. Piper, Sr., whose Indian name is Chief Big Eagle, was, at all times material to this dispute, and remains the traditional chief of the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Chief Big Eagle, representing the Golden Hill Paugus-sett Tribe, was a member of the task force which specifically recommended to the legislature the dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>resolution procedure now embodied in \u00a7 47-66L Chief Big Eagle\u2019s son, Kenneth L. Piper, whose Indian name is Moonface Bear and who maintains in this action that the intervening General Tribal Council of the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe has sole authority to institute legal action on behalf of the tribe,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was the alternate representative for the tribe on the task force. It is fundamental that statutes which affect the leadership of Indian tribes, \u201cwhen adopted with the advice and consent of the Indians themselves, have been accorded special weight.\u201d F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law (reprint 1986) (1942) p. 127. The involvement of Chief Big Eagle, the undisputed traditional chief of the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe, and Moonface Bear in the drafting and enactment of \u00a7 47-66\u00cd strongly indicates that the tribe approves of these provisions and expects to be governed by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Third, the individual parties involved in this lawsuit have indicated that they are not only aware of the statute\u2019s provisions, but have taken steps to comply with them. The record reveals that Moonface Bear was the first member of the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>file any documents with the governor and the secretary of the state pursuant to \u00a7 47-66\u00cd (a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In these documents, filed in 1990, Moonface Bear identified himself merely as \u201cwarchief and Reservation Chief of Col-chester\u201d and he acknowledged the continuing authority of Chief Big Eagle. Aurelius H. Piper, Jr., whose Indian name is Chief Quiet Hawk, filed his own documents with the state in February, 1993, and again in August, 1993. These documents, which were signed by both Chief Big Eagle and Chief Quiet Hawk, indicate that Chief Big Eagle had named Chief Quiet Hawk as the \u201ccouncil chief,\u201d a sub-chief of the Golden Hill Pau-gussett Tribe, and that Chief Big Eagle had delegated all of his powers to Chief Quiet Hawk at that time. Also, these documents include a signed statement from Moonface Bear acknowledging that Chief Quiet Hawk is the council chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Accordingly, in order to give effect to the intent of the legislature in adopting \u00a7 47-66\u00cd, the clear endorsement of those provisions by the Golden Hill Paugus-sett Tribe, and the actions of individual Indians of that tribe in attempting to comply with these provisions, I would hold that an individual who is currently identified as the leader of the tribe in the documents on file in the secretary of the state\u2019s office is presumptively the leader of the tribe. Any other member of the tribe who wishes to contest either the filing party\u2019s position as tribal leader or the filing party\u2019s authority to engage in particular acts must follow the procedure outlined in \u00a7 47-66\u00cd.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>It is undisputed that Chief Quiet Hawk, who authorized this action to be brought in the name of the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe, is designated as the council chief in the documents on file with the secretary of the state. It is also undisputed that Moonface Bear and the other individuals who purport to represent the intervening General Tribal Council of the tribe have failed to file superseding documentation and have failed to initiate the dispute resolution procedures established by \u00a7 47-66\u00cd (b). Instead, they have attempted to circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>vent these procedures by intervening in this action in order to challenge the authority of Chief Quiet Hawk. The courts of this state simply may not interfere in such a dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Even if I were to assume that state courts have jurisdiction to determine the governance and leadership of the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe, I would hold that the court must first defer to the jurisdiction and fact-finding capacity of the dispute resolution council established by \u00a7 47-66L</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, a court must yield jurisdiction over an issue to an administrative panel created by the legislature to deal with such issues. \u201cPrimary jurisdiction applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts, but enforcement of the claim requires, or <em>is materially aided by, </em>the resolution of threshold issues, usually of a factual nature, which are placed within <em>the special competence </em>of the administrative body.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe of Indians </em>v. <em>Weicker, </em>39 F.3d 51, 58-59 (2d Cir. 1994). Indeed, the doctrine applies \u201cwhere the subject of court litigation is \u2018at least arguably protected ... by another regulatory statute.\u2019 . . .\u201d Id., 59, quoting <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Chicago Mercantile Exchange, </em>409 U.S. 289, 300, 93 S. Ct. 573, 34 L. Ed. 2d 525 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">This court has held that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction \u201ccomes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body; in such a case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mazzola </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>169 Conn. 344, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>349, 363 A.2d 170 (1975). \u201cOrdinarily, a court should not act upon subject matter that is peculiarly within the agency\u2019s specialized field without giving the agency an opportunity to apply its expertise . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Sharkey </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>196 Conn. 253, 256, 492 A.2d 171 (1985). Indeed, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction dictates that a court must direct a dispute filed in court to the proper administrative body \u201cso as to take advantage of [that body\u2019s] specialized skills and procedures. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Cianci </em>v. <em>Connecticut Council, AFSCME, </em>8 Conn. App. 197, 201, 512 A.2d 232 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\"><em>At the very least, </em>the legislature intended to vest primary jurisdiction over intratribal leadership disputes with the council established by \u00a7 47-66\u00cd. First, the council is designed to be composed of individuals who have some special interest or knowledge in Indian affairs. Indeed, the statute provides that the Indians themselves should choose at least some of the council members. In the event the parties to the dispute are unable to agree on joint appointments to the council, the governor \u201cshall appoint any such member who shall be a person knowledgeable in Indian affairs.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-66\u00cd (b). Second, in providing for judicial oversight of the process, the legislature limited the role of the courts to verifying purely technical questions of procedure.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In accordance with the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, therefore, this court must yield jurisdiction over the dispute between the intervening Indians and Chief Quiet Hawk to the council established by \u00a7 47-66\u00cd.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Indeed, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals took exactly this position in the recent case of <em>Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe of Indians </em>v. <em>Weicker, </em>supra, 39 F.3d 51. In <em>Weicker, </em>which involved the same group at issue in this case, the defendants challenged whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the plaintiff was a \u201ctribe\u201d within the meaning of the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act of July 22, 1790, c. 33, 1 Stat. 137, codified as reenacted and amended at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 177 (1988). The Second Circuit Court'of Appeals, acknowledging that the District Court had jurisdiction to make this determination, nevertheless ordered that court to stay judicial proceedings until the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) could assume primary jurisdiction and thereby determine whether the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe satisfied the BIA\u2019s criteria for tribal status. <em>Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe of Indians </em>v. <em>Weicker, </em>supra, 60.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">In so holding, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals noted that a court and an agency which specializes in a particular subject matter \u201care not like two trains, wholly unrelated to one another, racing down parallel tracks towards the same end. Where a statute confers [subject matter] jurisdiction over a general subject matter to an agency and that matter is a significant component of a dispute properly before the court, it is desirable that the agency and the court go down the same track\u2014 although at different times\u2014to attain the statute\u2019s ends by their coordinated action. . . . The BIA\u2019s resolution of these factual issues regarding tribal status will be of considerable assistance to the district court in ultimately deciding Golden Hill\u2019s . . . claims.\u201d Id., 59-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The same reasoning which compelled the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to defer to the expertise of the BIA should compel this court likewise to defer to a nonjudicial decision maker\u2014the council established by \u00a7 47-66\u00cd\u2014for resolution of the specialized leadership issues here in dispute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Under these circumstances, I would reverse the trial court\u2019s dismissal of this action. I also would order on remand that if Moonface Bear or another member of the tribe renews a challenge to the authority of Chief Quiet Hawk to prosecute this action, the trial court should stay proceedings in order to allow the challenging party to proceed pursuant to \u00a7 47-66\u00cd (a), thus resolving the dispute over the leadership and the governance of the tribe. See <em>Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe of Indians </em>v. <em>Weicker, </em>supra, 39 F.3d 60 (staying judicial proceedings while the agency with primary jurisdiction, the BIA, determined whether the plaintiff satisfied its criteria for tribal status).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Furthermore, if this litigation proceeds on the merits, the trial court should consider, subject to any constitutional or other challenges, the impact on this litigation of two recent acts of the legislature: Special Acts, Spec. Sess., Oct., 1993, No. 93-1, and Public Acts, Spec. Sess., Oct., 1993, No. 93-4, \u00a7 1, amending General Statutes \u00a7 52-325. The former act validates any land transfers that occurred more than sixty years prior to the effective date of the act and that were otherwise valid \u201cexcept for the possible fact that the general assembly or its predecessor legislative bodies or other governmental authorities did not confirm, validate, ratify or approve such transfers . . . .\u201d Special Acts, Spec. Sess., Oct., 1993, No. 93-1. The latter act prohibits a party from recording a notice of lis pendens based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>litigation alleging \u201can illegal, invalid or defective transfer\u201d unless (a) the complaint contains the date of the alleged ineffective transfer, and (b) that transfer occurred less than sixty years prior to the commencement of the action. Public Acts, Spec. Sess., Oct., 1993, No. 93-4, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The decision of the majority does not do justice for any party. The claim of the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe has been dismissed from court not on its merits but on the issue of representation. There is no question that the tribe\u2019s claim, properly presented, is justiciable and one for the courts ultimately to determine. <em>Oneida Indian Nation of New York </em>v. <em>New York, </em>691 F.2d 1070, 1081 (2d Cir. 1982) (\u201cIndian land claims have traditionally been asserted in the courts of this country for resolution\u201d). Indeed, the tribe may choose to reinstitute this action at any time in the future, whether it be next week or 100 years from now. See <em>Mohegan Tribe </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>638 F.2d 612, 614-15 (2d Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 452 U.S. 968, 101 S. Ct. 3124, 69 L. Ed. 2d 981 (1981) (\u201c[djefenses based upon state adverse possession laws and state statutes of limitation have been consistently rejected\u201d); see also General Statutes \u00a7 47-61.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In the meantime, however, these vexing issues continue to cast a cloud on the title to the property that now stands in the name of innocent landowners and that the plaintiff Indians contend is rightfully theirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Unless the tribe reaches a binding settlement agreement, there are only two possible events that may serve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>to remove the uncertainty of the title to the real estate which is subject to the claims of the Indians. Either the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe of Indians will cease to exist as a sovereign nation, or a court with proper jurisdiction will intercede to determine the rights of the parties. The former seems unlikely,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the latter seems inevitable.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-7\"> At the outset, I must point out that I agree with the majority that litigation must only be instituted by persons or entities that have standing. See <em>Unysis Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Labor, </em>220 Conn. 689, 693, 600 A.2d 1019 (1991). A plaintiff has standing if \u201che has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest in the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title or interest in the subject matter of the controversy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Indeed, a plaintiff must have standing in order for a court to assert subject matter jurisdiction over the litigation. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Nevertheless, the question here is not so much one of <em>standing </em>but one of <em>authorization </em>to bring suit. The named plaintiff, the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe, clearly has standing to assert a right to its aboriginal lands. See <em>Oneida Indian Nation of New York </em>v. <em>New York, </em>691 F.2d 1070, 1081 (2d Cir. 1982). The only question is whether the person who has instituted the litigation on behalf of the tribe, Aurelius H. Piper, Jr., whose Indian name is Chief Quiet Hawk, has been authorized by the tribe to do so. Challenges to one\u2019s authority to bring suit have been made in innumerable ways, including an affirmative defense in the pleadings; <em>Vishipco Line </em>v. <em>Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., </em>660 F.2d 854 (2d Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 976, 103 S. Ct. 313, 74 L. Ed. 2d 291 (1982); or a motion to vacate service and summons of complaint; <em>Sterling Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ball Bearing Pen Corp., </em>298 N.Y. 483, 84 N.E.2d 790 (1949); or a motion to dismiss; <em>Meredith </em>v. <em>Ionian Trader, </em>279 F.2d 471 (2d Cir. 1960). I agree that a defendant should be able to raise such an issue early in the proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47-66\u00cd provides: \u201cmethod of selecting tribal leaders, disputes, (a) Each tribal leader shall file with the governor his name and a written description of the method of selecting tribal leaders and the process by which tribal leaders exercise their authority.

The majority argues that the statute indicates only that a party to the dispute \u201cmay\u201d submit the dispute to a panel of three arbitrators, and that the procedure, therefore, is discretionary. It is well established, however, that the \u201cword \u2018may\u2019 when used in a statute is to be interpreted as mandatory rather than directory if the context of the statute permits it and it is necessary to do so in order to make the statute effective to carry out the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Harp </em>v. <em>Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>162 Conn. 525, 530, 294 A.2d 633 (1972); see <em>State ex rel. Markley </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>130 Conn. 88, 93, 32 A.2d 58 (1943); <em>Lake Garda Co. </em>v. <em>LeWitt, </em>126 Conn. 588, 590-91, 13 A.2d 510 (1940); <em>Capobinco </em>v. <em>Samorak, </em>102 Conn. 310, 313, 128 A. 648 (1925). Clearly, the intent of the legislature in this case was to establish an effective means for the resolution of intratribal disputes that allowed for only limited review by state courts. Moreover, a statute should be considered as a whole, with a view toward reconciling its separate parts in order to render a reasonable overall interpretation. <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>192 Conn. 207, 214, 471 A.2d 1368 (1984); <em>LaProvidenza v. State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>178 Conn. 23, 29, 420 A.2d 905 (1979). Under these circumstances, the dispute resolution procedure set out in \u00a7 47-66\u00cd must be deemed mandatory and, therefore, a limitation on the authority of the court to consider these intratribal disputes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b611-11\"> No party to this action disputes Chief Big Eagle\u2019s continuing authority as traditional tribal chief. \u201cThe Golden Hill Paugussetts are the state\u2019s only traditionally governed Tribe: whereas the other four tribes now have elected tribal chairmen and tribal councils, the Paugussett Chief is appointed by the clan mother.\u201d Legislative Task Force on Indian Affairs, Report to General Assembly, Feb., 1989, p. 1, reprinted in Conn.

The tribal documents on file with the secretary of the state indicate that both Chief Big Eagle and Chief Quiet Hawk banished Moonface Bear from the tribe in April, 1993\u2014several months prior to the filing of this lawsuit\u2014and revoked any powers he held with respect to the tribe.

According to the majority, an Indian who disputed his tribe\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>leadership might therefore \u201cbecome bound by documents [he] alleged to be inaccurate or fraudulent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">This is a narrow and incorrect reading of the statute. Indeed, such a reading presumes that tribal documents, once filed pursuant to \u00a7 47-66\u00cd, can never be updated to reflect changes in tribal leadership and that the dispute resolution council is unable to determine the authenticity of documents filed. Each of these presumptions is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">First, there is nothing in the statute to prevent a member of the tribe who claims to be the rightful leader from filing another explanation of the practices the tribe follows in choosing its leader and its form of governance. Indeed, the majority recognized this fact elsewhere in its opinion, when it stated that \u201cthe statute empowers any individual purporting to be the \u2018leader\u2019 of a tribe to file documents confirming his leadership and power.\u201d In the case of the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe, for example, several individuals have filed documents describing the scope of their leadership and the tribe\u2019s process of governance. Moonface Bear filed documents in 1990 under his authority as \u201cwarchief and Reservation Chief of Colchester.\u201d Chief Quiet Hawk filed documents in February, 1993, and in August, 1993, under his authority as \u201ccouncil chief.\u201d Chief Big Eagle filed documents in July, 1993, under his authority as \u201ctraditional chief.\u201d Clearly, the majority\u2019s presumption that no superseding documents can ever be filed is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Second, because the statute allows the filing of superseding documents, the dispute resolution council is necessarily authorized to determine which filing is authentic in order to resolve the leadership dispute. Indeed, this is the very purpose of requiring the members of the council to be either appointed by the parties or \u201cknowledgeable in Indian affairs.\u201d In a case of contradictory filings, the council would simply determine which set of filed documents accurately represents the tribe\u2019s leadership structure, and then would determine which of the contending parties was properly chosen the leader. In the case of an appeal to Superior Court, the court would determine whether the council properly determined, based upon the documents it found to be authentic, who was the proper leader and the powers he possesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\"> See footnote 4 and accompanying text of dissenting opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b617-6\"> The Second Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe to reapply to the trial court for a ruling on the merits if the BIA had not ruled on its tribal status within eighteen months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b617-7\"> The majority ingenuously suggests that it will not defer to the dispute resolution council because no party has \u201cexplained how an arbitration deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>sion identifying an individual as a tribe\u2019s \u2018leader\u2019 pursuant to \u00a7 47-66\u00cd would \u2018materially ai[d]\u2019 the court in determining whether that leader had authority to sue on the tribe\u2019s behalf.\u201d The statute, however, empowers the council to resolve not only who is a tribe\u2019s leader, but also a tribal \u201cleadership dispute.\u201d The council, therefore, is capable of determining not only who represents the tribe but also what type of authority he has traditionally possessed.
