The court concluded that the petitioner\u2019s claim of a due process violation based on an allegation of actual innocence could not be sustained because of a lack of credible evidence. The court further concluded that his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel could not be sustained because of a lack of a showing of prejudice. The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the habeas court in every respect. <em>Talton </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>33 Conn. App. 171, 634 A.2d 912 (1993). We granted the petitioner\u2019s request for certification to appeal the same issues that he had presented to the habeas court and the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">After examining the record on appeal, and after considering the briefs and arguments of the parties, we conclude that the judgment of the Appellate Court must be affirmed. The issues on which we granted certification were properly resolved in the thoughtful and comprehensive opinion of the Appellate Court. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>therein contained. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>228 Conn. 756, 758, 638 A.2d 34 (1994); <em>State v.
