The defendant, Allan A. Crystal, the commissioner of revenue services, after auditing the plaintiffs tax returns for the years 1988, 1989 and 1990, found the plaintiff liable for an additional sales and use tax assessment, as well as a penalty and interest. The plaintiff filed an appeal to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-422. In light of the stipulated facts and the governing law, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>rendered a judgment dismissing the plaintiffs appeal. The plaintiff thereafter filed a further appeal in the Appellate Court, which we transferred to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The facts are not disputed. The plaintiff retained exclusive control of, as well as responsibility for, the operation of its photocopying machines. It received and retained all the revenues generated by the machines with the exception of a commission paid to the public libraries in which the machines were installed. Although the public libraries concededly qualify as tax exempt organizations pursuant to \u00a7 12-412, the plaintiff has not claimed that it has a tax exempt status except insofar as its transactions with the public libraries qualify for an exemption pursuant to subsections (8) or (24) of \u00a7 12-412.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">A taxpayer bears the burden of proving the impropriety of an adverse assessment concerning a tax exemption. <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 752-53, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992); <em>Plastic Tooling Aids Laboratory, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>213 Conn. 365, 369, 567 A.2d 1218 (1990). The trial court carefully examined the record before it and concluded that the plaintiff had failed to establish that its sales of photocopies to the general public qualified for an exemption either as sales \u201cto charitable and religious organizations,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 12-412 (8), or as sales \u201cby public libraries,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 12-412 (24). The thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision filed by the trial court thoroughly canvassed the applicable statutory language, its legislative history and relevant case holdings. See <em>Advanced Business Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>43 Conn. Sup. 253, 650 A.2d 641 (1994). Because that memorandum of decision fully states and meets the arguments raised in the present appeal, we adopt the trial court\u2019s well reasoned deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>sion as a statement of the facts and the applicable law on these issues. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. See <em>Van Dyck Printing Co. </em>v. <em>DiNicola, </em>231 Conn. 272, 273-74, 648 A.2d 877 (1994); <em>Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority </em>v. <em>Refuse Gardens, </em>229 Conn. 455, 458-59, 642 A.2d 697 (1994); <em>Daw\u2019s Critical Care Registry, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Labor, </em>225 Conn. 99, 101-102, 622 A.2d 518 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-412 provides in relevant part: \u201cexemptions.
