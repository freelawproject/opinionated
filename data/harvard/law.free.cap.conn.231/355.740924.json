The plaintiff owned a bar and restaurant named the Graffiti Lounge that served alcoholic beverages and provided dancing privileges. The establishment employed a performer and discjockey, Edwin Brown, known as the \u201cDuke of Doo-Wop\u201d (Duke), who gave dancing lessons to the patrons and danced with them on the dance floor to the prerecorded music. Using prerecorded music and various props and costumes, he also mimicked musical performances and entertained the audience by lipsynching. When he was not engaged in these various forms of entertainment, the Duke played the prerecorded music while the patrons danced.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The defendant, the commissioner of revenue services, conducted a sales and use tax audit of the Graffiti Lounge for the period from January 1,1984, through August 31,1989, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-548.* <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>As a result of the audit, the defendant imposed a deficiency assessment on the plaintiff for unpaid cabaret taxes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following the defendant\u2019s denial of reassess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>ment and the imposition of liability, the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-554, <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> claiming that the restaurant was not a \u201ccabaret\u201d under \u00a7 12-540 (4) and, therefore, was not subject to the cabaret tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">At trial, the plaintiff characterized the Duke\u2019s performance as \u201cthe music of a single performer alone.\u201d Consequently, the plaintiff argued, the Graffiti Lounge fell within the statutory exclusion to the definition of a \u201ccabaret or other similar place\u201d under \u00a7 12-540 (4), and was, therefore, not subject to the cabaret tax under \u00a7 12-542. The trial court concluded, however, that the statute provided an exemption, not an exclusion, and that the plaintiff had not sustained its burden of proving that it was entitled to the exemption.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the court upheld the defendant\u2019s deficiency assessment. The plaintiff appealed from that decision to the Appellate Court, and this court transferred the appeal to itself pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">In this case, we must examine two statutes: \u00a7\u00a7 12-540 (4) and 12-542. Section 12-542 imposes a tax on amounts charged for admissions, refreshment, service or merchandise at any cabaret or similar place that furnishes music, dancing privileges or any entertainment for profit during the time that such music, dancing privileges or any other entertainment is provided. It is undisputed that the plaintiff received money while the Duke performed, and that the Graffiti Lounge was in business for profit. Consequently, the plaintiff\u2019s operation was taxable under \u00a7 12-542 if it was <em>\u201ca </em>cabaret or similar place\u201d as defined by \u00a7 12-540 (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The parties agree that the establishment afforded its patrons \u201cmusic, dancing privileges or other entertainment.\u201d They disagree, however, about how to interpret the phrase \u201cexcept mechanical music alone or the music of a single performer alone\u201d within the context of \u00a7 12-540 (4). The plaintiff argues that the exceptions modify the entire preceding phrase. Therefore, the plaintiff contends, if patrons dance to mechanical music or to a single performer, the establishment is not subject to the tax. Because these are exceptions to the tax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>able class, the plaintiff maintains the establishment is removed from the class before tax liability is ever imposed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">We begin our analysis by noting that it is fundamental that statutory construction requires us to ascertain the intent of the legislature and to construe the statute in a manner that effectuates that intent. <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 455, 459-60, 600 A.2d 310 (1991). In seeking to ascertain the legislature\u2019s intent when it crafted chapter 225 of the General Statutes, the admissions, cabaret and dues tax statutes, we follow well established principles of statutory construction and \u201clook to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d Id., 460. No one invariable rule of statutory construction is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Section 12-542 provides authority to tax all establishments where music, dancing privileges or any other entertainment is furnished for profit, and \u00a7 12-540 (4) limits the application of the tax by providing an exclusion for \u201cmechanical music alone or the music of a single performer alone.\u201d \u201cA court should accord a statutory enactment its plain meaning.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>228 Conn. 335, 341, 636 A.2d 782 (1994); <em>Kil-patrick </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>206 Conn. 25, 28, 535 A.2d 1311 (1988). Therefore, to accord \u00a7 12-540 (4) its plain meaning, we first focus on the word \u201calone.\u201d Webster\u2019s defines alone as \u201cexclusive of anyone or anything else: only.\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary. We see no reason to torture the meaning of \u201calone.\u201d The exclusion at issue pertains to situations where <em>only </em>mechanical music or <em>only </em>the music of a single performer is provided, without anything else. Therefore, if the music is mechanical or that of a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>performer, the tax may still be imposed if the establishment in question affords dancing privileges or other entertainment. Moreover, had the legislature intended to exclude establishments that afford their patrons the opportunity to dance to mechanical music or the music of a single performer, it could easily have done so. The provision of dancing privileges remains an indisputable fact of taxable significance that cannot be ignored.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">The history of \u00a7 12-540 (4) confirms that the legislature sought to exclude only those establishments where background music is incidental to dining. Following the 1969 enactment of the admission, cabaret and dues tax, the legislature created an exception to \u00a7 12-540 (4) that applied only to \u201cmechanical music alone.\u201d Public Acts 1971, No. 837, \u00a7 1. Even as amended, \u00a7 12-542 provoked a public protest, and associations representing restaurants and musicians petitioned the legislature to change the law because the tax created a significant rise in unemployment among entertainers who performed alone. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Finance, 1971-1972 Sess., pp. 16-18, 43-44, 50-52. In response, the legislature added another exception to \u00a7 12-540 (4) in 1972: \u201cthe music of a single instrumental performer alone.\u201d Public Acts 1972, No. 88, \u00a7 1. This was proposed specifically to address the problem that \u201cover 140 or [1]50 musicians . . . had lost their jobs as a result of a Cabaret Tax being applied to places where they were furnishing background music.\u201d 15 H.R. Proc., Pt. 4, 1972 Sess., p. 1448, remarks of Representative Darius J. Spain. The exception was intended to encourage restaurants to hire musicians who provide background music and was narrowly defined so that the state would suffer a minimal loss of revenue. Id. Following the 1972 amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>ment, however, the department of revenue services ruled that the performance of a vocalist created a cabaret status. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Finance, Pt. 3,1977 Sess., p. 875. Thereafter, the statute was again amended to exclude \u201cmusic of a single performer alone\u201d in order to permit an establishment employing a musician who sings to his or her own musical accompaniment to avoid the tax. Public Acts 1977, No. 77-434, \u00a7 1; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Finance, Pt. 3, 1977 Sess., pp. 855-56, 874. This statutory history reflects the legislature\u2019s intent to provide a limited exception to establishments that hire single musicians to entertain their diners. Nowhere is there any indication, however, that the legislature intended to exclude from the definition of \u201ccabaret\u201d places affording dancing privileges to its patrons.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 12-540 (4) is consistent with the federal government\u2019s application of its tax on cabarets. This is significant because the elimination of the federal cabaret tax prompted the enactment of our cabaret tax in order to capture some of the revenue freed up by that elimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">From 1917 until 1965, the Internal Revenue Service imposed a federal admissions tax on performances and entertainment that exempted establishments providing \u201cmechanical music alone.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4231 (6) (repealed 1965). When, as in this instance, the language used in the federal tax statutes is nearly identical to that before us, we may look to federal law to guide our interpretation of the state statute. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services </em>v. <em>Peska, </em>220 Conn. 77, 83, 595 A.2d 348 (1991). We find the evolution of the federal law to be instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The federal admissions tax, enacted during World War I as part of the War Revenue Act, c. 63, 40 Stat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>300, 318 (1917), imposed a tax on amounts paid \u201cfor admission to any public performance for profit at any cabaret or other similar entertainment to which the charge for admission is wholly or in part included in the price paid for refreshment, service or merchandise.\u201d The statute, however, contained no definition of either \u201ccabaret\u201d or other \u201csimilar entertainment.\u201d Soon after the implementation of that act, therefore, the Department of the Treasury issued an administrative definition of the statutory terms, determining that \u201c \u2018[cjabaret or other similar entertainment\u2019 includes every hotel, restaurant, hall, or other public place at or in which, in connection with the service or sale of food or other refreshment or merchandise, there is conducted any vaudeville or other performance or diversion in the way of acting, singing, declamation or dancing, either with or without instrumental or other music. Every form of entertainment so conducted is included, except that furnished by orchestras performing instrumental music only, unaccompanied by any other form of entertainment. A hotel, restaurant, or hall affording, in connection with the service of refreshment, food or merchandise, entertainment in the form of dancing by its patrons is included.\u201d T.D. 2603, 19 Treas. Dec. Int. Rev. 370, 371 (1917). A distinction was made between \u201cdancing, either with or without instrumental or other music,\u201d which subjected an establishment to tax, and \u201cinstrumental music only unaccompanied by any other form of entertainment,\u201d which created no tax liability. This definition, with minor changes, was soon thereafter incorporated in a formal regulation. Treas. Reg. 43, set forth in T.D. 2681, 20 Treas. Dec. Int. Rev. 93, 98 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Although the regulations were modified and expanded over the next twenty-three years, the Department of the Treasury consistently took the position that the admissions tax applied to a wide variety of estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>lishments offering dancing privileges. See <em>Geer </em>v. <em>Birmingham, </em>88 F. Sup. 189, 198-210 (N.D. Iowa), rev\u2019d, 185 F.2d 82 (8th Cir. 1950), cert. denied, 340 U.S. 951, 71 S. Ct. 571, 95 L. Ed. 686 (1951). In 1942, Congress amended the admissions tax statute to provide, for the first time, a statutory definition of the term \u201ccabaret or similar place.\u201d Revenue Act of 1942, c. 619, 56 Stat. 798, 981 (1942). This amendment provided that \u201c[a]ll amounts paid for admission, refreshment, service or merchandise, at any roof garden, cabaret, or other similar place furnishing a public performance for profit ...\u201d were subject to a tax. \u201c[Rjoof garden, cabaret, or other similar place\u201d was defined to include \u201cany room in any hotel, restaurant, hall, or other public place where music and dancing privileges or any other entertainment, except instrumental or mechanical music alone, are afforded the patrons in connection with the serving or selling of food, refreshment, or merchandise.\u201d Id. According to the Senate and House of Representatives reports accompanying the Revenue Act of 1942, the amendment confirmed the interpretation of the statute by the Department of the Treasury. H.R. Rep. No. 2586, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 79 (1942); S. Rep. No. 1631, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 268 (1942). Following the enactment of this clear statutory exception for \u201cinstrumental or mechanical music alone,\u201d the Department of the Treasury amended its regulations to provide that \u201c[wjhere music, whether by an orchestra, a mechanical device, or otherwise, and a space in which the patrons may dance is furnished in the dining room of a hotel, or in a restaurant, bar, etc., the entertainment constitutes a public performance for profit at a roof garden, cabaret or similar place, and the payments made for admission, refreshment, service, and merchandise are subject to the tax.\u201d T.D. 5192, 1942-2 C.B. 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">As a result, the federal courts have decided numerous cases involving establishments that allow their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>patrons to dance to instrumental or mechanical music and have consistently held that the provision of \u201cdancing privileges\u201d was sufficient to incur tax liability. See <em>Billen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>273 F.2d 667 (10th Cir. 1960); <em>Godwin </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>249 F.2d 356 (8th Cir. 1957); <em>Crapps </em>v. <em>Duehay, </em>208 F. Sup. 344 (E.D.S.C. 1962); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>162 F. Sup. 449 (D. Md. 1957); <em>In re Duffin, </em>141 F. Sup. 869 (S.D. Cal. 1956). As the court stated in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>327 F.2d 732, 736 (5th Cir. 1964), \u201cthe [Revenue Act of 1942] expressly excludes places where mechanical music alone is furnished, but when a place for dancing is added, mechanical music alone is no longer furnished and this exclusion is no longer effective to bring an establishment out of the coverage of the statute.\u201d We concur with this reasoning and we adopt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Because the Graffiti Lounge provided dancing privileges, the exception set forth in \u00a7 12-540 (4) does not preclude taxation and we conclude that the trial court correctly found that the defendant properly imposed the cabaret tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-9\"> General Statutes 12-540 provides: \u201cdefinitions.

If he shall determine therefrom that there is a deficiency with respect to the payment of any such tax due under the provisions of this chapter, he shall assess or reassess the deficiency in tax, give notice of such deficiency assessment or reassessment to the taxpayer and make demand upon him for payment.

When it appears that any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency assessment is made is due to negligence or intentional disregard of the provisions of this chapter or regulations promulgated thereunder, there shall be imposed a penalty equal to ten per cent of the amount of such deficiency assessment, or fifty dollars, whichever is greater. When it appears that any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency assessment is made is due to fraud or intent to evade the provisions of this chapter or regulations promulgated thereunder, there shall be imposed a penalty equal to twenty-five per cent of the amount of such deficiency assessment.

In its posttrial brief, however, the plaintiff argued that it fell outside the scope of the taxing statute and asked the court to construe \u00a7 12-542 strictly against the state. Whether a particular statute is a tax imposition statute or a tax exemption statute often determines whether a taxpayer is entitled to a construction in his or her favor or whether the statute must be construed in favor of the state. <em>Altray Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>224 Conn. 426, 432, 619 A.2d 443 (1993). The principles of statutory construction that govern the applicability of a tax exemption are well established. \u201cFirst, statutes that provide exemption from taxation are a matter of legislative grace that must be strictly construed against that taxpayer. Second, any ambiguity in the statutory formulation of an exemption must be resolved against the taxpayer.

Otherwise, a taxing statute is construed against the state and in favor of the taxpayer. <em>Morton Buildings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>222 Conn. 49, 54, 607 A.2d 424 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Our decision in this case, however, does not turn on the distinction between a statutory exception or exemption. We conclude that because it provided dancing privileges, the Graffiti Lounge is a cabaret. Therefore, even if \u00a7 12-542 imposes a tax on cabarets, as defined by \u00a7 12-540 (4), and the state thus had the burden of proving that the Graffiti Lounge was a cabaret, the state met its burden by virtue of the undisputed fact that dancing privileges were provided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b385-5\"> Because we decide this case on the basis of dancing privileges, we need not determine whether the Duke was a \u201csingle performer alone\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12-540 (4).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
