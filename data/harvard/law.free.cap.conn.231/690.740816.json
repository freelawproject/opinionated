Although the claimants\u2019 cases were tried together, each has a unique factual situation that will be discussed individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Gluck was a real estate salesperson for the defendant from January, 1982, until March, 1988. Gluck claimed that in 1987, William Raveis, the defendant\u2019s president, promised a full commission to the salesperson who first introduced him to new office space suitable for the company to purchase or lease in New Haven. The claimant alleged that she was the first person to introduce Raveis, through her office manager Carole Anne Pepe, to a property at 199 Whitney Avenue in New Haven, which eventually was leased by the defendant for business purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Two other salespersons in the same office also claimed that they were entitled to receive a commission from the defendant because of the defendant\u2019s lease of the property. On June 21, 1988, after Gluck had left the company, the defendant\u2019s regional vice-president, Chris Cooke, informed Gluck by letter that she would be paid only $2400 of the $12,000 commission received by Raveis, $6000 of which had been expended for legal fees necessitated by problems connected with the lease of the property. Of the $6000 remaining, Cooke determined that Gluck was entitled to 40 percent, while the other two salespersons who claimed the commission were each entitled to receive 30 percent of the commission. Pursuant to \u00a7 31-72, the plaintiff brought this action on Gluck\u2019s behalf to collect the full amount of the unpaid commission allegedly due Gluck.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>From 1986 to 1988, Lyren was the sales manager for the defendant\u2019s Greenwich office and later for the defendant\u2019s Trumbull office. For the first year Lyren was paid $2000 per month plus a 5 percent override<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on every commission generated by the office. Thereafter she was paid a straight 8 percent override on commissions. Lyren alleged that she was owed overrides on transactions on which binders<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> had been executed before she had left the company. After she resigned, Lyren received no compensation from the defendant despite her repeated requests for payment of the overrides on those real estate transactions. The plaintiff brought this action on behalf of Lyren pursuant to \u00a7 31-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The claims of both Gluck and Lyren were tried together.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court found that both claimants were employees for purposes of \u00a7 31-72 as that term is defined in General Statutes \u00a7 31-71a.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court thereafter determined that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the sum of $24,068.29; $12,000 of that sum was owed to Gluck and $12,068.29 was owed to Lyren.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). The only issues before us are whether the trial court was correct in finding that: (1) the claimants, as employees rather than independent contractors, fell within the purview of \u00a7\u00a7 31-72 and 31-71a; and (2) Lyren had met her burden of proof with regard to damages. We conclude that the trial court correctly determined both issues and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The plaintiff successfully argued to the trial court that the claimants were employees of the defendant company and that consequently she was authorized to bring a civil action pursuant to \u00a7 31-72 to collect unpaid wages owed to them. The defendant argued in the trial court and in this court that the claimants were not employees, but rather were independent contractors, and therefore were not within the purview of \u00a7 31-72. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The defendant\u2019s first argument is that the claimants\u2019 status as independent contractors was definitively established by Gluck\u2019s admission to that effect during her trial testimony. \u201cWhether a party\u2019s statement is a judicial admission or an evidentiary admission is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>factual question for the trial court.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 6.5, p. 132, citing <em>Sweet </em>v. <em>Sweet, </em>190 Conn. 657, 662, 462 A.2d 1031 (1983) (\u201c[wjhether these statements when viewed as a whole result in a judicial admission is a determination best left to the trial court which observed the witnesses, heard the testimony and was the sole judge of the weight to be accorded such testimony\u201d). The trial court, in holding that the claimants were employees of the defendant and not independent contractors, necessarily concluded that Gluck\u2019s statement was not a judicial admission.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If Gluck\u2019s statement was merely an evidentiary admission, her view of her relationship to the defendant is not dispositive. For instance, in <em>Latimer </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>216 Conn. 237, 251, 579 A.2d 497 (1990), we found an employer-employee relationship even in the face of a signed agreement stating that the parties were independent contractors. In determining whether an employment relationship exists, \u201c \u2018[w]e look beyond the plain language of the contract to the actual status in which the parties are placed.\u2019 \u201d Id., 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The defendant\u2019s next argument is that the claimants in this case could not be considered employees in light of the language of the governing statutes. Section 31-72 allows the labor commissioner to collect the full amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>of any unpaid wages that an employer has failed to pay an employee. The terms employer, employee and wages are defined in \u00a7 31-71a. An employer \u201cincludes any individual, partnership, association, joint stock company, trust, corporation, the administrator or executor of the estate of a deceased person, the conservator of the estate of an incompetent, or the receiver, trustee, successor or assignee of any of the same, employing any person . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-71a (1). An employee \u201cincludes any person suffered or permitted to work by an employer.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-71a (2). The term wages is defined to include \u201ccommission.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-71a (3). The purpose of \u00a7 31-72 is remedial, and therefore it must be given a liberal construction in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit. <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Maiocco, </em>209 Conn. 579, 595, 552 A.2d 1207 (1989). From a reading of the plain language of these statutory provisions, it would appear that a real estate salesperson, engaged by a real estate brokerage firm doing business as a corporation and compensated by commission, would be someone who was \u201csuffered or permitted to work by an employer,\u201d and hence an employee. General Statutes \u00a7 31-71a (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Application of our prior case law confirms that the trial court properly concluded that these particular claimants were employees, within the purview of \u00a7 31-72, rather than independent contractors. \u201cThe determination of the status of an individual as an independent contractor or employee is often difficult . . . and, in the absence of controlling considerations, is a question of fact.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Latimer </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 249. It has long been established that \u201c[t]he fundamental distinction between an employee and an independent contractor depends upon the existence or nonexistence of the right to control the means and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>methods of work.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 248; <em>Silverberg </em>v. <em>Great Southwest Fire Ins. Co., </em>214 Conn. 632, 639, 573 A.2d 724 (1990); <em>Panaro </em>v. <em>Electrolux Corp., </em>208 Conn. 589, 603, 545 A.2d 1086 (1988); <em>F.A.S. International, Inc. </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>179 Conn. 507, 512, 427 A.2d 392 (1980); <em>Beaverdale Memorial Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Danaher, </em>127 Conn. 175, 179, 15 A.2d 17 (1940); <em>Aisenberg </em>v. <em>C. F. Adams Co., </em>95 Conn. 419, 421, 111 A. 591 (1920). \u201cThe test of the relationship is the right to control. It is not the fact of actual interference with the control, but the right to interfere, that makes the difference between an independent contractor and a servant or agent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Latimer </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>supra, 248; <em>Caraher </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>124 Conn. 409, 413-14, 200 A. 324 (1938). An independent contractor has been defined as \u201cone who, exercising an independent employment, contracts to do a piece of work according to his own methods and without being subject to the control of his employer, except as to the result of his work.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Silverberg v. Great Southwest Fire Ins. Co., </em>supra, 639; <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>R. A. Sherman\u2019s Sons Co., </em>86 Conn. 292, 297, 85 A. 514 (1912).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The so-called \u201cABC test\u201d which is used to determine the existence of an employment relationship for the purpose of unemployment compensation; see General Statutes \u00a7 31-222 (a) (1) (B) (ii); <em>F.A.S International, Inc. </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 512;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is also applicable here. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>The paramount factor in that three part test to determine whether a person is an employee is the first, which is the right to control not only the results of work but also the methods of work. This control test is by nature a balancing test. \u201c \u2018The determination of general control is not always a simple problem. Many factors are ordinarily present for consideration, no one of which is, by itself, necessarily conclusive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Silverberg </em>v. <em>Great Southwest Fire Ins. Co., </em>supra, 214 Conn. 639; <em>Bourgeois </em>v. <em>Cacciapuoti, </em>138 Conn. 317, 321, 84 A.2d 122 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In the present case, the trial court found that the defendant retained the right to control, and actually exerted a great deal of control over, the real estate salespersons and sales managers affiliated with it. Both salespersons and managers were required to attend mandatory office meetings; both did business under the defendant\u2019s name; both used the company letterhead, business cards and supplies; both were required to attend training sessions; and both were threatened with discharge if they did not comply with these requirements. \u201cThe right to terminate [an employment] relationship without liability is not consistent with the concept of an independent contract.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Latimer </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 249. Additionally, the managers were required to read The Book of Five Rings and to discuss a book report about its themes, \u201cdiscussing how we were then to treat our competitors like the Samurai warriors.\u201d Gluck was required to put in specified hours of floor time and Lyren was required to work forty hours per week plus put in an office appearance on weekends.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>The defendant claims that both claimants were independent contractors because they received 1099 forms rather than W-2 forms for income tax purposes, and that they did not receive medical benefits. While these factors weigh in the defendant\u2019s favor, they are insufficient to persuade us that the claimants were not employees for the narrow purposes of \u00a7 31-72. The defendant also claims that its real estate salespersons are not employees because they explicitly are not covered under the Unemployment Compensation Act, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-222 (a) (5) (K),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 20-312b.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As the plaintiff aptly notes, however, the legislature did not exempt real estate salespersons from \u00a7 31-72, and in fact defined \u201cemployee\u201d quite broadly in \u00a7 31-71a (2). If the legislature had intended to exempt real estate salespersons from the operation of \u00a7 31-72, it obviously was capable of doing so, as is evidenced by their exemption from the Unemployment and Workers\u2019 Compensation Acts. Its failure to do so is an indication of a contrary intention. See <em>In re Ralph M., </em>211 Conn. 289, 306, 559 A.2d 179 (1989) (\u201cwe apply the tenet of statutory construction that [wjhere a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject ... is signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>cant to show that a different intention existed\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The factors delineated above indicate that the right of the defendant to control its employees far outweighs the factors that indicate an independent contractor relationship. See <em>Silverberg </em>v. <em>Great Southwest Fire Ins. Co., </em>supra, 214 Conn. 639. Because the ABC test is conjunctive, and because we conclude that the defendant in the present case had the right to control the claimants, we need not address the second and third parts of the test. See footnote 8. We conclude that, in the particular circumstances presented, the trial court\u2019s determination that Gluck and Lyren were employees of the defendant, bringing them within the purview of \u00a7 31-72, is legally and logically correct and finds support in the facts that reasonably could have been found by the trial court. <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The defendant next claims that the plaintiff failed to prove that the real estate transactions for which binders had been executed<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> while Lyren was in the defendant\u2019s employ actually had closed so as to enable the defendant to receive its commission. Because it was conceded that Lyren was not eligible to receive her overrides until the defendant received its commissions, the defendant maintains that the plaintiff had not met her burden of proof with regard to damages in Lyren\u2019s case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">It is axiomatic that the trier of fact may draw reasonable and logical inferences from the facts proven. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>230 Conn. 686, 692, 646 A.2d 147 (1994). In doing so, finders of fact \u201care not expected to lay aside matters of common knowledge or their own obser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>vation and experience of the affairs of life, but, on the contrary, to apply them to the evidence or facts in hand, to the end that their action may be intelligent and their conclusions correct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 693. Our review of the fact finder\u2019s inferences is limited to determining whether the inferences drawn are \u201c \u2018so unreasonable as to be unjustifiable.\u2019 \u201d Id., 692, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>127 Conn. 543, 555, 18 A.2d 895 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In the present case, the plaintiff had the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant owed Lyren the overrides on transactions that had been hindered before Lyren had left the defendant\u2019s employ, but that had closed after she had left. The plaintiff produced evidence that binders for thirty-seven properties were outstanding at the time Lyren left the defendant\u2019s employ.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>found that \u201c[tjhese binders were all based on contracts to purchase real estate as to which deposits had been lodged with the defendant and, although it is possible that a purchaser would renege on one, it is unlikely and such a remote possibility may reasonably be eliminated in estimating the amount of the commissions received by the defendant.\u201d The evidence did not reflect, and the defendant does not point to anything in the record to indicate, that there were contingencies in these underlying contracts. The binder sheets produced by the plaintiff listed, for each property, only a contract date and a closing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">It was the plaintiffs burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Lyren was owed her overrides. In order to satisfy the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, all the plaintiff need to have shown was that it was more likely than not that the defendant received its commissions on the transactions on which binders had been executed before Lyren had left the defendant\u2019s employ. See C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, supra, \u00a7 4.4.1, p. 73 (\u201c[t]he burden of persuasion can be satisfied by circumstantial evidence if the trier finds that the facts from which the trier is asked to draw the inference are proven and that the inference is not only logical and reasonable, but strong enough so that it can be found to be more probable than not\u201d). The trial court, sitting as a finder of fact, was free to apply its common knowledge and experience to infer from the facts proven that it was more likely than not that the transactions on which binders had been executed resulted in closings from which the defendant received its commissions. Under the limited circumstances of this case, we find that the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>inference was not \u201cso unreasonable as to be unjustifiable.\u201d Lyren, therefore, was entitled to her overrides.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">In this opinion Peters, C.

He also testified that he sent a letter to the defendant \u201crequesting either payment or information as to why the monies were not due, and that was again ignored.\u201d Eagan went on to say that \u201c[tjhere was no cooperation whatsoever at any time.\u201d It is apparent that the defendant refused to cooperate in discovery, which is directly contrary to the open discovery doctrines in Connecticut. See Practice Book \u00a7 218; <em>Lougee </em>v. <em>Grinnell, </em>216 Conn. 483, 489, 582 A.2d 456 (1990) (\u201cPractice Book \u00a7 218 . . . liberally permits discovery of information \u2018material to the <em>subject matter </em>involved in the pending action\u2019 \u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Sanderson </em>v. <em>Steve Snyder Enterprises, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 134, 140, 491 A.2d 389 (1985) (this jurisdiction has liberal discovery doctrines). Further, defense counsel conceded at oral argument before this court that such documents existed and that he had had them with him during the trial but that he never turned them over because the plaintiffs attorney neglected to request specifically that they be handed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>over at trial. It would not be wise precedent to hold that by stonewalling, a defendant could ensure the defeat of its opponent\u2019s claim, especially where the defendant had superior information regarding that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b725-7\">Berdon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATx\">concurring and dissenting. I concur in the result, on the basis of a statutory analysis that, for the purposes of General Statutes \u00a7 31-72, Marilyn Gluck and Marilyn Lyren were employees. I would not, however, travel the route of the so called \u201cABC test\u201d referred to by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">In order to determine whether Gluck and Lyren come within the provisions of \u00a7 31-72 we must look to the specific statutory definition of employee. See <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>223 Conn. 336, 349, 612 A.2d 1203 (1992) (where legislature has specifically defined an operative term used within a statute, the court is bound to accept that definition). For purposes of \u00a7 31-72, an \u201cemployee\u201d broadly \u201cincludes any person suffered or permitted to work by an employer.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-71a (2). The plain language of \u00a7 31-71a encompasses <em>any </em>person who performs work for an employer. Wages, for the purposes of \u00a7 31-72, include \u201ccompensation for . . . services rendered by an employee, whether the amount is determined on a time, task, piece, <em>commission </em>or other basis of calculation . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 31-71a (3). Therefore, according to the expansive plain language of \u00a7 31-71a, and for the purposes of \u00a7 31-72, the relationship between the defendant and Gluck and Lyren was one of \u201cemployer\u201d and \u201cemployee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">Furthermore, if the legislature had intended a more restrictive definition for employees who are entitled to the remedy pursuant to \u00a7 31-72, it would have provided for it as it did in other statutes governing labor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 31-58 (f) (restrictive definition of \u201cemployee\u201d for purposes of minimum wages); General Statutes \u00a7 31-222 (a) (5) (K) (for purposes of unemployment compensation, real estate salespersons are specifically excluded); General Statutes \u00a7 20-312b (for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation, real estate salespersons are specifically excluded). \u201c[Statutes are to be interpreted with regard to other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In re <em>Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 524, 613 A.2d 748 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Moreover, given the remedial purposes of the statute, \u00a7 31-72 must be given a liberal construction in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit. See <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Maiocco, </em>209 Conn. 579, 595, 552 A.2d 1207 (1989). It is obvious that the legislature intended to provide an effective remedy for persons who have not been paid their wages or other compensation including commissions. Accordingly, I agree that Gluck and Lyren were employees under the broad definition of \u00a7 31-71a (2) for purposes of collecting their compensation pursuant to \u00a7 31-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">I disagree, however, with the majority in regard to the damages awarded to Lyren. There was undisputed evidence that Lyren was not entitled to her override commissions of 8 percent unless each real estate transaction that was subject to a \u201cbinder\u201d resulted in a \u201cclosing\u201d\u2014that is, a consummated real estate transaction where title was transferred to the purchaser and the defendant received its commission. There was no evidence presented at trial that these binders for which Lyren claimed overrides ever closed. The trial court recognized this, but drew an inference that they did close on the grounds that: (1) it was \u201creasonable to assume that in 1988 at the height of the real estate boom these [transactions closed]\u201d; and (2) each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>\u201cbinder\u201d was accompanied with a deposit from the purchaser and \u201calthough it is possible that a purchaser would renege on one, it is [an] unlikely and . . . remote possibility . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">These binders, that evince the formation of contracts, are usually conditioned on many contingencies including mortgage approval, physical inspection, and the outcome of the title search. The failure of any one of these conditions could prevent a closing and result in the return of a buyer\u2019s deposit. Therefore, Lyren\u2019s proof that several properties were subject to binders at the time Lyren left the defendant\u2019s employment cannot be used to infer that those properties actually closed and that Lyren is entitled to her overrides. The trial court\u2019s inference to the contrary was not reasonable. Inferences are capable of bridging many gaps. But the span of this gap is too wide logically to support such an inference. (Paraphrasing Rutledge, J., in <em>Galloway </em>v. <em>United States, </em>319 U.S. 372, 386, 63 S. Ct. 1077, 87 L. Ed. 1458, reh. denied, 320 U.S. 214, 63 S. Ct. 1443, 87 L. Ed. 1851 [1943]). In order to establish a prima facie case and sustain its burden of production, the plaintiff must present sufficient evidence \u201cto remove the issue from speculation or conjecture . . . .\u201d C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 4.3, p. 72; <em>Terminal Taxi Co. </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>156 Conn. 313, 316, 240 A.2d 881 (1968). Lyren did not present sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case on damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Indeed, in this case, the plaintiff implicitly recognized that the evidence upon which she relied was insufficient to infer that the binders resulted in closings because she sought to bolster Lyren\u2019s case by relying on a negative inference. The plaintiff attempted to invoke the negative inference that the properties subject to binders closed because the defendant failed to produce evidence that any of the subject properties did not close, and such information would have been within the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>power to produce had this occurred. The majority appropriately refused to employ a negative inference to determine whether the plaintiff had established a prima facie case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The fact remains that the plaintiff has produced insufficient evidence to establish that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>properties closed and therefore has not shown that Lyren is entitled to receive overrides on those properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Accordingly, I would find that in Lyren\u2019s case, the trial court was not correct in drawing the inference that the binders resulted in closings. I would reverse and remand the Lyren case to the trial court for a new trial on damages. I would affirm the judgment of the trial court in regard to the case of Gluck.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-5\"> Negative inferences cannot be invoked to establish a prima facie case and can be used only by the trier in weighing the evidence and determining the ultimate burden of persuasion. <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 676, 165 A.2d 598 (1960); <em>Doty </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>120 Conn. 672, 679, 182 A. 468 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The <em>Secondino </em>adverse inference has come under criticism by legal scholars. Professor Colin C. Tait writes: \u201cThe continuing validity of the \u2018missing witness\u2019 rule should be called into question. Not only does it consume an undue proportion of the attention of both appellate courts, its underlying premise has been substantially undermined. The rule originated at a time when parties \u2018vouched\u2019 for the veracity of their witnesses so that an opponent dared not call an adverse witness. Since a partial witness would be called only by the favored party, that party\u2019s failure to call the witness, if available, warranted a negative inference. The voucher rule no longer applies in Connecticut. Under Connecticut\u2019s modern rules a party may call an adverse witness, including the opposing party. If an adverse witness is called, the party calling that witness may use leading questions to interrogate the witness and, if necessary, to impeach the witness. In addition, Connecticut permits widespread discovery so that all parties know, and may depose, all relevant witnesses before trial. Thus, each party should in fact know which witnesses are favorable to which side. That being so, why should a party not be required to call any witness favorable to his cause? If a witness is available, he is equally available to both sides. If a witness has information favorable to one side, why shouldn't that side call that witness and bring out that information instead of relying on a negative inference based on ignorance that such a witness might have some unspecified information that might be unfavorable to the other party? See <em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>911 F.2d 1044, 1046-1048 (5th Cir. 1990). Moreover, the <em>Secondino </em>rule is costly. It consumes the time of both the court and the parties, and it incurs expense even for parties who do not wish to call a witness, since they must nevertheless pay to have witnesses available to preclude the assertion of an adverse inference.\u201d C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (Sup. 1994) \u00a7 11.5.4, pp. 50-51. Indeed, its misuse in Connecticut is apparent and could have life and death consequences. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 324-34, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994) <em>(Berdan, J., </em>dissenting) (majority suggested that state is entitled to <em>Secondino </em>adverse inference jury instruction for failure to call psychiatric witness whom defense consulted in capital murder trial notwithstanding attorney-client privilege).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
