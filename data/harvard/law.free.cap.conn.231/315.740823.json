The statute exempts the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>cost of \u201chazardous waste removal services\u201d from sales and use tax, and the department of revenue services defines asbestos as a \u201chazardous waste.\u201d Department of Revenue Services Ruling 89-230 (November 21, 1989). Because we conclude that tangible personal property purchased and consumed by asbestos removal contractors is not services within the meaning of \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I), we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The record establishes the following undisputed facts. The plaintiff, A AIS Corporation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is a contractor engaged in the business of providing asbestos abatement services. Asbestos includes any of several fibrous minerals that commonly were used as insulation until it was discovered that the inhalation of asbestos fibers may cause a variety of lung diseases, including cancer. Therefore, extensive precautions are taken in preparation for asbestos removal and in the actual removal process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>As a contractor engaged in asbestos removal services, the plaintiff must purchase disposable supplies and materials, including paper uniforms, filters, plastic covering, plastic bags, tape and other miscellaneous materials, that are used in the process. The cost of these materials accounts for approximately 10 to 15 percent of the amount paid for the service by the owner of the property. Because the industry assumed that tangible personal property used to remove asbestos was excluded from the sales and use tax pursuant to \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I), none of the plaintiffs suppliers required it to pay sales tax on the purchase of these materials. The defendant, the commissioner of revenue services, determined, however, that tangible personal property purchased by contractors for use in the removal of asbestos is subject to sales and use tax and levied a deficiency assessment against the plaintiff pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-415.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff then petitioned the defendant for a hearing and reassessment under General Statutes \u00a7 12-418,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>arguing that \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I) exempts materials as well as labor from the sales and use tax. After the defendant found that it had assessed the deficiency properly and denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>a hearing, the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-422.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That court determined that the plaintiff had failed to sustain its burden of proof that the assessment had been erroneously levied and, accordingly, upheld the deficiency assessment. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The plaintiff made two arguments to the trial court. First, it argued that the tangible personal property used to remove asbestos was resold by the plaintiff to the service recipients and therefore was not taxable to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the plaintiff did not obtain a resale certificate and because it ultimately consumed the materials, the trial court found no merit in this argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ment. The plaintiff has not raised it before this court and, therefore, we do not address it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">In the alternative, the plaintiff argued that the meaning of \u201cservices\u201d under \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I); see footnote 1; includes both labor and tangible personal property. As the trial court reasoned, although the term \u201cservices\u201d is not defined for the purposes of chapter 219 of the General Statutes, entitled \u201cSales and Use Taxes,\u201d the term is used repeatedly throughout \u00a7 12-407 (2), the definitional section, as well as General Statutes \u00a7 12-412, the exemption section. The court concluded that when the legislature intended to exempt both services and tangible personal property from the tax, it clearly indicated this intent by explicitly including both terms. The court reasoned, therefore, that if the legislature had intended to exempt both labor and materials used for asbestos abatement services, it would have specifically provided for that exemption as it had in other legislative enactments dealing with the sales and use tax. Accordingly, the trial court determined that the plaintiff had failed to sustain its burden of proof and upheld the defendant\u2019s deficiency assessment. We agree with the reasoning and conclusion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">At the outset, we note the principles of statutory construction that govern the applicability of a tax exemption. \u201cFirst, statutes that provide exemptions from taxation are a matter of legislative grace that must be strictly construed against the taxpayer. Second, any ambiguity in the statutory formulation of an exemption must be resolved against the taxpayer. Third, the taxpayer must bear the burden of proving the error in an adverse assessment concerning an exemption.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number><em>Plastic Tooling Aids Laboratory, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>213 Conn. 365, 369, 567 A.2d 1218 (1990). Applying these principles to the present case, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiff failed to sustain its burden of proving that the \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I) exemption for \u201cservices\u201d includes tangible personal property purchased and consumed by asbestos removal contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Neither the plain wording of the statute nor the legislative intent supports the plaintiffs argument. It is fundamental that statutory construction requires us to ascertain the intent of the legislature and to construe the statute in a manner that effectuates that intent. <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 455, 459-60, 600 A.2d 310 (1991). \u201cIn seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation . . . .\u201d Id., 460. After considering the language of the statute, both alone and in the context of chapter 219 of the General Statutes, as well as the underlying legislative purpose of the exemption, we conclude that the sales and use tax exemption for asbestos removal services under \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I) does not include tangible personal property purchased and consumed by an asbestos removal contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 12-407 and 12-412 makes clear that \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I) does not include tangible personal property. First, \u00a7 12-407 (2)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> distinguishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>between tangible personal property and services. Section 12-407 (2) (i), (k), <em>(l) </em>and (m) define certain services as sales for purposes of the sales and use tax. Much of the remainder of the statute relates to the sales or leasing of \u201ctangible personal property.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 (2) (a), (b), (c), (d), (f), (g) and (j). Therefore, according to the plain language of \u00a7 12-407 (2), services are differentiated from tangible personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Second, \u00a7 12-412 indicates that an exemption for services does not encompass an exemption for tangible personal property.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is settled that statutes must be construed consistently with other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>coherent body of law. <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 524, 613 A.2d 748 (1992). In construing a statute, the court may look to other statutes relating to the same subject matter for guidance. <em>Vecca </em>v. State, 29 Conn. App. 559, 564, 616 A.2d 823 (1992). Exemptions under \u00a7 12-412 (21), (22), (29), (55), (68), (73) and (76) relate only to the sale of various tangible personal property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Section 12-412 (3) (B), (11), (36), (41), (58), (62), (74) and (77) exempt only services. Finally, \u00a7 12-412 (1), (2), (5), (8) and (35) specifically exempt both services and tangible personal property. Thus, when the legislature intended to exempt tangible personal property, services or both, it clearly provided for that specific exemption.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We assume the legislature recognized and intended the distinctions it incorporated in the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 12-407 (2) and 12-412. <em>Windham First Taxing District </em>v. Windham, 208 Conn. 543, 554, 546 A.2d 226 (1988). Therefore, the statutory differentiation between \u201cservices\u201d and \u201ctangible personal property\u201d in these sections indicates that the legislature intended the definition of services to exclude tangible personal property for the purposes of sales and use tax exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The plaintiff contends that asbestos removal services are unique in that the materials a contractor introduces onto a removal site are used only once and, thereafter, they become part of the hazardous waste. The plaintiff argues that because the tangible personal property and the removal services are inseparable, both should be exempt from the sales and use tax. We are not persuaded. The sales and use tax statutes indicate that the term \u201cservices\u201d does not include any tangible personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>property, spare parts or equipment that may be used in the performance of a service. When an exemption is intended for both service and materials utilized in the act of providing that service, the legislature has explicitly included each component. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-407 and 12-412.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Further, as the trial court recognized, the purpose of the exemption lends little support to the plaintiffs position. The tax exemption for hazardous waste removal services was included in an amendment to No. 84-507 of the 1984 Public Acts offered by Representative Warren G. Sarasin. The purpose of the exemption was to provide an incentive to property owners to remove voluntarily and dispose of hazardous waste properly rather than to dump it illegally. 27 H.R. Proc., Pt. 17,1984 Sess., pp. 6009-10, remarks of Representative Warren G. Sarasin. The intended beneficiaries of the exemption., therefore, are property owners and not asbestos removal contractors. The plaintiff argues that the added cost incurred due to the sales and use tax will be passed on to the owner and will act as a disincentive to voluntary removal, contrary to legislative intent. The property owners, however, remain tax exempt for between 85 and 90 percent of their total removal cost.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This substantial incentive to engage in the voluntary, legal disposal of hazardous waste furthers the legislative purpose of the exemption, and a sales and use tax on material purchased by the asbestos removal contractor does not defeat the tax advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The plaintiff relies heavily on a statement made by Senator John B. Larson, when he moved to place the public act on the consent calendar, characterizing the exemption as one for \u201cbusiness services as well as tangible supplies . . . .\u201d 27 S. Proc., Pt. 9, 1984 Sess., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>p. 3186. We are unpersuaded that this statement alone, which is contrary to the language of the amendment and to ample evidence that the legislature specifically distinguishes between services and tangible personal property, reflects a legislative intent to include personal property within the meaning of services. Indeed, when Representative Sarasin introduced the amendment, and testified regarding the purpose of the exemption, he described the exemption as extending to business services only. 27 H.R. Proc., Pt. 17,1984 Sess., p. 6009. We find the specific language of the statute in combination with the testimony of Representative Sarasin regarding the purpose and scope of the amendment, to be more probative of legislative intent than Senator Larson\u2019s isolated remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Because the plaintiff has provided nothing more substantial than the comment of a single senator to defeat the plain statutory language or to show a contrary legislative purpose or intent, we conclude that the trial court properly found that the plaintiff has failed to sustain its burden of proof. We conclude, further, that for the purposes of the sales and use tax under \u00a7 12-407 (2) (i) (I), the term \u201cservices\u201d does not include tangible personal property purchased and consumed by asbestos removal contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 provides in pertinent part: \u201cdefinitions.
