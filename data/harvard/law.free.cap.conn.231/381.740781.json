The plaintiff, RK Constructors, Inc., brought this action against the defendant Fusco Corporation (Fusco) after Fusco\u2019s agent negligently injured the plaintiff\u2019s employee on a construction job site.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff claimed that as a result of Fusco\u2019s negligence, the plaintiff\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation experience modification rating was reduced, which, in turn, caused the plaintiff\u2019s insurance premiums to increase and a potential dividend to be lost. Fusco filed a motion to strike the first and third counts of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint for failure to state a cognizable cause of action and, after a hearing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>trial court, <em>Koletsky, J., </em>granted its motion. The plaintiff thereafter appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The relevant facts may be summarized briefly as follows.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 24, 1989, Richard M. Aldrich, an employee of the plaintiff, was working as a carpenter at a construction site in Hartford known as the Goodwin Square Building. Fusco was the general contractor on the project, and had leased a crane from the S.G. Marino Crane Service Corporation in order to move materials to and from various floors of the Goodwin Building. While the crane was in the process of lowering a load of lumber from the thirty-first floor of the building, several planks fell from the sling that held them and struck Aldrich, who was working on the ground below. Because of the accident, the plaintiff incurred a reduced workers\u2019 compensation experience modification rating, and, as a result, suffered an increase in its insurance premiums and lost an anticipated dividend that it claims it otherwise would have received.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s sole contention is that the trial court incorrectly struck counts one and three of its complaint in which it sought to recover its economic losses for failure to state a cause of action against Fusco. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the court misconstrued the origin or cause of the injuries and relied upon inappropriate case law to justify its decision. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>\u201cThe motion to strike . . . replaced the demurrer in our practice. Its function, like that which the demurrer served, is to test the legal sufficiency of a pleading.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Alarm Applications Co. </em>v. <em>Simsbury Volunteer Fire Co., </em>179 Conn. 541, 545, 427 A.2d 822 (1980). In reviewing the granting of a motion to strike, we construe the facts alleged in the complaint in a light most favorable to the pleader. If facts provable under the allegations would support a defense or a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied. Id. \u201cIn order to reverse the judgment of the trial court, therefore, this court must find that the allegations of the plaintiffs complaint, if proven, would constitute negligence of the defendant.\u201d <em>Coste </em>v. <em>Riverside Motors, Inc., </em>24 Conn. App. 109, 111, 585 A.2d 1263 (1991).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The essential elements of a cause of action in negligence are well established: duty; breach of that duty; causation; and actual injury. <em>Catz </em>v. <em>Rubenstein, </em>201 Conn. 39, 44, 513 A.2d 98 (1986); <em>Calderwood </em>v. <em>Bender, </em>189 Conn. 580, 584, 457 A.2d 313 (1983); W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed. 1984) \u00a7 30, pp. 164-65. Our analysis in this case begins and ends with the first element, duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u201cThe existence of a duty is a question of law and \u2018[o]nly if such a duty is found to exist does the trier of fact then determine whether the defendant violated that duty in the particular situation at hand.\u2019 \u201d <em>Petriello </em>v. <em>Kalman, </em>215 Conn. 377, 382-83, 576 A.2d 474 (1990). If a court determines, as a matter of law, that a defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>ant owes no duty to a plaintiff, the plaintiff cannot recover in negligence from the defendant. Thus, \u201cwe must determine whether the [trial] court\u2019s conclusion that [Fusco] owed no duty to the plaintiff with respect to [causing an increase in workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums] was \u2018legally and logically correct.\u2019 \u201d Id., 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Duty is a \u201clegal conclusion about relationships between individuals, made after the fact, and imperative to a negligence cause of action. The nature of the duty, and the specific persons to whom it is owed, are determined by the circumstances surrounding the conduct of the individual.\u201d 2 D. Pope, Connecticut Actions and Remedies, Tort Law (1993) \u00a7 25:05, p. 25-7. Although it has been said that \u201cno universal test for [duty] ever has been formulated\u201d; W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, \u00a7 53, p. 358; our threshold inquiry has always been whether the specific harm alleged by the plaintiff was foreseeable to the defendant. \u201cThe ultimate test of the existence of the duty to use care is found in the foreseeability that harm may result if it is not exercised. ... By that is not meant that one charged with negligence must be found actually to have foreseen the probability of harm or that the particular injury which resulted was foreseeable, but the test is, would the ordinary [person] in the defendant\u2019s position, knowing what he knew or should have known, anticipate that harm of the general nature of that suffered was likely to result?\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Frankovitch </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>185 Conn. 14, 20-21, 440 A.2d 254 (1981); <em>Noebel </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>146 Conn. 197, 200-201, 148 A.2d 766 (1959); <em>Orlo </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>128 Conn. 231, 237, 21 A.2d 402 (1941). Thus, initially, if it is not foreseeable to a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position that harm of the type alleged would result from the defendant\u2019s actions to a particular plaintiff, the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>the existence of a duty to use due care is foreclosed, and no cause of action can be maintained by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">A simple conclusion that the harm to the plaintiff was foreseeable, however, cannot by itself mandate a determination that a legal duty exists. Many harms are quite literally \u201cforeseeable,\u201d yet for pragmatic reasons, no recovery is allowed. See, e.g., <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Conroy, </em>208 Conn. 392, 400-401, 545 A.2d 1059 (1988) (looking beyond foreseeability, this court imposed limitations on the right of a bystander to recover for emotional distress that allegedly resulted from medical malpractice of doctors in their treatment of the plaintiffs deceased mother). A further inquiry must be made, for we recognize \u201cthat \u2018duty\u2019 is not sacrosanct in itself, but is only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is entitled to protection.\u201d W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, \u00a7 53, p. 358. \u201cWhile it may seem that there should be a remedy for every wrong, this is an ideal limited perforce by the realities of this world. Every injury has ramifying consequences, like the rip-plings of the waters, without end. The problem for the law is to limit the legal consequences of wrongs to a controllable degree.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Maloney </em>v. <em>Conroy, </em>supra, 401-402. The final step in the duty inquiry, then, is to make a determination of \u201cthe fundamental policy of the law, as to whether the defendant\u2019s responsibility should extend to such results.\u201d W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, supra, \u00a7 43, p. 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Although this court has never examined the precise issue of duty presented by this appeal, we conclude that the trial court correctly cited <em>Steele </em>v. <em>J &amp; S Metals, Inc., </em>32 Conn. Sup. 17, 335 A.2d 629 (1974), in support of its holding. In <em>Steele, </em>an employer had brought a negligence action against a third party tortfeasor who had injured the employer\u2019s key employee. The employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>claimed that the injury to its employee caused its business to lose profits, and that the defendant was responsible to the employer for those damages. The defendant demurred, alleging that the plaintiff failed to state a viable cause of action. Despite the obvious foreseeability of the plaintiffs lost profits, the court nevertheless dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The plaintiff in the present case argues that <em>Steele </em>is inapposite for two primary reasons. First, it argues that the holding in <em>Steele </em>was premised upon the fact that the employer\u2019s damages resulted directly from the <em>injuries </em>suffered by the employee, whereas in the present case, the plaintiff\u2019s damages flowed from the <em>accident </em>itself. Second, the plaintiff argues that because Fusco, as an employer, must have been aware of the effects an accident would have upon the plaintiff\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation premiums and policy dividends, foreseeability existed and created a duty that may not be present in other contexts. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Although it may have been foreseeable to Fusco that by causing an accident to the plaintiff\u2019s employee, the plaintiff\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation premiums would increase, this fact alone does not conclude our inquiry. We must proceed to make the further policy determination of whether Fusco\u2019s responsibility for its negligent conduct should extend to these particular consequences and this particular plaintiff. It is irrelevant to this determination whether the plaintiff\u2019s damages flowed from the accident itself or from the resulting injuries to its employee. We fail to see the distinction. What is relevant, rather, is the measure of attenuation between Fusco\u2019s conduct, on the one hand, and the consequences to and the identity of the plaintiff, on the other hand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <em>Steele </em>court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>that when a defendant injures a plaintiffs employee, the nexus between that act and the plaintiff and its lost profits is simply too tenuous to impose liability for such collateral consequences. The factors in the present case are nearly identical. The defendant is a third party who caused physical injury, not to the plaintiff itself, but to the plaintiff\u2019s employee. Moreover, the alleged damages to the plaintiff that resulted from the physical injury to its employee are purely economic in nature. In the absence of a controlling statute or overriding public policy consideration, we conclude that the economic harm to the plaintiff in the form of increased premiums and lost dividends is simply too remote to be chargeable to the defendant third party tortfeasor, Fusco.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Although the plaintiff cites an Ohio case <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and a workers\u2019 compensation treatise<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as support for its proposed cause of action, we note that our decision follows those of numerous jurisdictions that have previously addressed the issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>trial court correctly granted Fusco\u2019s motion to strike counts one and three of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint for failure to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., and Borden and Dupont, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-8\"> The plaintiff's revised complaint was in four counts. Counts one and three set forth causes of action against Fusco, while counts two and four alleged causes of action against the S.G. Marino Crane Service Corporation, which is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\"> As Fusco noted in its brief, for the purpose of a motion to strike, the moving party admits all facts well pleaded. <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 108, 491 A.2d 368 (1985); <em>Alarm Applications Co. </em>v. <em>Simsbury Volunteer Fire Co., </em>179 Conn. 541, 545, 427 A.2d 822 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\"> The plaintiff repeatedly indicated before the trial court that this case does not involve any claims under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq. As stated by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, \u201c[t]he way I would have the Court look at it is it\u2019s just a regular tort damage . . . .\u201d Although Fusco argues that the Workers\u2019Compensation Act provides the exclusive remedy for an injured employer against a third party tortfeasor, in light of our conclusion that the plaintiff has not stated a common law negligence cause of action, we need not address that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\"> This inquiry is quite similar to the analysis that we engage in with respect to the third element of negligence, proximate causation. Indeed, as Profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>sors Prosser and Keeton have noted, \u201c[t]he question whether there is a duty has most often seemed helpful in cases where the only issue is in reality whether the defendant stands in any such relation to the plaintiff as to create any legally recognized obligation of conduct for the plaintiff s benefit. Or, reverting again to the starting point, whether the interests of the plaintiff are entitled to legal protection at the defendant\u2019s hands against the invasion which has in fact occurred. Or, again reverting, whether the conduct is the \u2018proximate cause\u2019 of the result. The circumlocution is unavoidable, since all of these questions are, in reality, one and the same.\u201d W.

Although Professor Larson indeed makes a case for allowing an employer to maintain a negligence cause of action against a third party tortfeasor for increased compensation premiums and lost dividends, he specifically limits this argument to cases in which the employer has no subrogation rights under the applicable workers\u2019 compensation third party statute. 2B A. Larson, supra, \u00a7 77.30, p. 14-1022. In the present case, the applicable workers\u2019 compensation statute allows an employer to assert subrogation rights to recover benefits paid to its employee; General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a); and the plaintiff in fact exercised those rights. See <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>Fusco Corp., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. CV 91-0503285 S (action withdrawn May 31, 1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b411-7\">Berdon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"APc\">concurring. I agree that the doors to the court should not be opened to allow a plaintiff employer to recover from the defendant tortfeasor damages in the form of increased premiums resulting from workers\u2019 compensation payments made to the injured employee. However, I agree not because, as the majority finds, the nexus between the conduct of the tortfeasor and the employer\u2019s economic injury is \u201ctoo tenuous to impose liability.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, I agree because the legislature has already provided a statutory remedy for the employer in such a case. This statutory rem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>edy provides the exclusive remedy that a plaintiff employer may seek from the third party tortfeasor and, as a practical matter, serves to make whole the employer so that it need not pursue additional, unenumerated remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">First, the legislature has already provided and defined the exclusive remedy for the plaintiff employer. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act); General Statutes \u00a7 31-291 et seq.; grants the employer of the injured employee the right to bring an action against the tort-feasor to recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to its injured employee. General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a). Similarly, the act grants the employer the right to intervene as a plaintiff in an action brought by the injured employee against the tortfeasor, and further provides that the employer shall take precedence over the injured employee in recovering any damages awarded. Id. In either case, the legislature allows the employer to recover from the liable third party tortfeasor \u201c(1) the amount of any compensation which he has paid on account of the injury . . . and (2) an amount equal to the present worth of any probable future payments which he has by award become obligated to pay on account of the injury. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">This statutory itemization indicates that the legislature intended these workers\u2019 compensation remedies to be the only ones available to a plaintiff employer in an action against a third party tortfeasor. See <em>Panaro </em>v. <em>Electrolux Corp., </em>208 Conn. 589, 605, 545 A.2d 1086 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 766, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982); see also <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>212 Conn. 462, 562 A.2d 517 (1989) (remedy provided by state products liability act bars action seeking additional damages). In such a situation, \u201c[a] damage suit as an alternative or additional source of compensation, becomes permissible only by carving a judicial excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>tion in an uncarved statute. ...\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Panaro </em>v. <em>Electrolux Corp., </em>supra, 605. This the court should not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Second, as a practical matter, the statutory remedy provided by the legislature should prevent an employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation premiums from increasing. The statutory remedy, in essence, allows the employer to recover amounts it has paid or will become obligated to pay to the employee as a result of the injury caused by the liable third party tortfeasor. If the employer, and the employer\u2019s insurer as a result of its subrogation rights, are thereby made whole for the workers\u2019 compensation benefits it paid out, the employer should not experience any change in its workers\u2019 compensation loss ratio. As a result, the employer should not suffer any significant increases in its workers\u2019 compensation premiums or costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Accordingly, I concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\"> would not reach the issue of whether the nexus between the conduct of the tortfeasor and the injury in this case is too tenuous to impose liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
