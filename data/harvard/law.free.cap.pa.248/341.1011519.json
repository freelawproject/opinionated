The officer, who did not know him, asked defendant\u2019s decedent if this was correct and whether he knew the man and would let him take charge of the machine, to which he replied in the affirmative. Maxwell then went into the street and started to crank the car; while he was so engaged, the car started, knocking him down, and the hub of one of the wheels caught in the plaintiff\u2019s dress and she was thrown to the ground, receiving the injuries complained of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-4\">Verdict for the plaintiff for $3,000, and judgment thereon.

Fleming for the injuries sustained by the appellee depends upon whether Maxwell was a mere interloper when he took charge of the automobile of the decedent or had been put in charge of it by the latter. This was a pure question of fact for the jury, and, as there was testimony that Fleming had placed him in charge of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>car, describing him to a bystander as an experienced chauffeur, the verdict was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
