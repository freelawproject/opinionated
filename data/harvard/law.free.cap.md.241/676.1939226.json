Kaczmarek, driving Canestrale\u2019s truck, which was. loaded with kitchen cabinets destined for College Park,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had reached a point on U. S. Route 40 A about 8 miles east of Hagerstown and some 1,000 feet from the summit of South Mountain, when the truck\u2019s engine, which earlier had evinced symptoms of malfunction, came to a complete stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-13\">The highway at this point is divided into three lanes, one for the downhill (westbound) traffic and two for the uphill (eastbound) traffic. The right uphill lane is for slow traffic, the left for faster traffic. Photographs in the record indicate the presence of a shoulder about six feet wide adjoining the slow lane. Kaczmarek, eastbound, had been moving uphill, in the slow lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Assisted by Michener, who was riding with him, Kaczmarek \u201cdrifted\u201d the truck backwards \u201conto the shoulder.\u201d Michener \u201cfigured * * * [they] had about four and a half feet off of the road and four and a half feet on the road.\u201d Kaczmarek dismounted, opened the hood and attempted repairs. He got back into the truck and tried, without success, to start it. All lights were then turned off to conserve the battery. Although flares were in the truck no attempt was made to use them.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Meanwhile, Weishaar, also eastbound on U. S. 40 A, was on his way up the mountain. He had just delivered 6,000 gallons of fuel oil in Hagerstown and was on his way back to Baltimore. He said it was clear at the foot of the mountain but as he ascended he \u201ccould see this fog rolling in just like smoke.\u201d He kept on and after a while, about 50 feet away, he saw \u201ca dark splotch through [the] fog which * * <em>* </em>[he] presumed was a slow moving truck.\u201d He did not attempt to pass on the left because a glance at the rear view mirror disclosed headlights behind him in the fast lane. He said he was unable to avoid striking the rear of Kaczmarek\u2019s truck. The impact was of such force that the Canestrale truck was tumbled over into the ditch bordering the dirt shoulder. Kaczmarek, Michener and Weishaar were injured, Weishaar\u2019s truck was damaged and Canestrale\u2019s truck was a total loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The trial resulted in judgments in favor of Canestrale ($2,-960) and Kaczmarek ($2,070) from which Weishaar has appealed. He has also appealed from the judgment in favor of Canestrale and Kaczmarek for costs in the counter claim filed by him. Canestrale\u2019s cross appeal is from the trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence bearing on damages arising out of the loss of the cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Weishaar\u2019s first two contentions can be treated together. He says there is in the record no evidence upon which a jury could erect a finding that he was negligent. Moreover, he says, Kaczmarek was negligent as a matter of law. We do not agree with either contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">The evidence abounds with instances of conflict and ambiguity. Weishaar said he was about 50 feet from Kaczmarek\u2019s truck when he first saw it and that he could not have seen it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>sooner because of the fog. On the other hand Kaczmarek said he could see \u201cpretty far up the road.\u201d Michener declared he could see \u201cclear to the top of the mountain,\u201d a distance he estimated to be \u201cabout a thousand feet.\u201d Trooper Snyder, who investigated the accident, testified that when he arrived (about 25 minutes later) he could see \u201cbetter than a hundred yards, a good hundred yards.\u201d Roy Harbaugh, who manages a towing service, said that, when he arrived \u201cit was very visible.\u201d Trooper Smith traversed South Mountain, westbound, \u201ca little just before eight o\u2019clock.\u201d He said the Canestrale truck was parked with its right tires off the roadway and that he saw it as soon as he came across the top of the mountain, two-tenths of a mile away. It will be observed that Michener\u2019s estimate (1,000 feet) was about the same. Wayne Lutz, westbound, passed by while Kaczmarek was \u201cdrifting\u201d the truck backwards. He said he could see 50 to 75 feet and that he could drive no faster than 20 miles per hour. Most of the witnesses described the situation as being alternately clear and foggy. One said it would \u201croll in and roll out.\u201d Others used the words \u201cspotty\u201d and \u201cpatchy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Weishaar\u2019s speed prior to, and perhaps at the instant of, the collision was. twenty-eight miles per hour. He so testified and his testimony was corroborated by the card removed from the Tachograph, a time-speed recording device which had been installed in his truck. Asked, on cross-examination, within what distance he could bring his truck to a stop he answered \u201croughly two hundred and fifty feet.\u201d Additionally pressed, still on cross-examination, he watered this down to \u201ca hundred and fifty or two hundred feet.\u201d Also he admitted he could see \u201conly fifty feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The determination of the limits of visibility at the time of the accident was an undertaking peculiarly within the province of a jury. The jury quite properly could have found that, during the 30 seconds just before the collision, Weishaar had a clear view ahead for a distance of 300 to 1,000 feet. Assuming such a finding, a simple and inexorable conclusion follows, namely, that Weishaar could have avoided the collision by stopping within the 250 feet he claims he required, and this provides a sound basis for a finding of primary negligence. <em>Ford </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number><em>v. Bradford, </em>213 Md. 534, 132 A. 2d 488 (1957); <em>Eisenhower v. Balto. Transit Co., </em>190 Md. 528, 59 A. 2d 313 (1948); <em>Robert v. Wells, </em>170 Md. 367, 184 Atl. 923 (1936); <em>Transportation Co. v. Mumford, </em>154 Md. 8, 139 Atl. 541 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">To support a holding that Kaczmarek was guilty of negligence as a matter of law there must be found in the evidence some prominent and decisive act, or failure to act, which permits of but one interpretation and in regard to which there is no room for reasonable minds to differ. <em>Thomas v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>211 Md. 262, 127 A. 2d 128 (1956); <em>Lindenberg v. Needles, </em>203 Md. 8, 97 A. 2d 901 (1953); <em>Beck v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>190 Md. 506, 58 A. 2d 909 (1948). Weishaar argues that parking the truck partly on the paved road and partly on the shoulder is such an act. A similar situation was presented in <em>Coastal Tank Lines, Inc. v. Kiefer, </em>194 Md. 81, 69 A. 2d 790 (1949). In that case a truck loaded with kerosene became disabled because of a broken fuel pump. The driver, by making use of the starting motor was able to place the truck so that its right wheels were on the edge of the right hand side of the paved portion of the road. There was a grass shoulder two feet wide and next to the shoulder there was a ditch. The driver went off to get help and before he returned the plaintiff had collided with the rear of his truck. It was argued that this was negligent because Code, Art. 66 JL \u00a7 244 (a) and (b) (1957) [then <em>Art.66*4, </em>\u00a7 189 (a) and (b) (Cum. Supp. 1947) ] prohibits parking on the paved part of the highway. Since the wording of the statute remains unchanged, the language of Chief Judge Marbury, who wrote the Court\u2019s opinion, is generally applicable to the case at bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">\u201c* * * This section, however [\u00a7 244] only requires this to be done [parking on the shoulder] \u2018when it is practical,\u2019 and there is an exception in Section (b) for any disabled vehicle when it is impossible to avoid stopping and temporarily leaving such vehicle on the paved portion of the highway. The Legislature could not have intended the driver of a heavily loaded truck, such as the one in this case, to drive off on a grass shoulder which could not support the load and thereby mire his vehicle indefinitely, if it did not actually run into the ditch. * * *\u201d <em>Id </em>at 89-90.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>There was. testimony in the instant case that the shoulder was \u201cmuddy\u201d and there were references to a \u201cguard rail.\u201d A \u201cguard rail\u201d does not appear in the photographs but there is a snowbank which might be covering one.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Kaczmarek might have been able to maneuver his truck so as to place it more on the shoulder and less on the road but it is not likely he would have been able to move it more than another foot off of the paved part of the road. This would, however, have been a chancy operation and<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we must reject the argument that he was negligent as a matter of law, in not making the attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Weishaar also argues that the failure to put out flares constitutes negligence as a matter of law. If visibility had been limited to 50 feet at the time of, and just before, the collision, and the evidence in regard thereto was clear, uncontradicted and uncontroverted, the argument might be persuasive, but, as we have pointed out, there is a sharp conflict in this area. There was evidence that \u201c* * * vehicles * * * [were] clearly discernible at a distance of 300 feet ahead\u201d and in these circumstances Code, Art. 66)4, \u00a7 271 (a) (1957) does not require the display of \u201clighted lamps and illuminating devices.\u201d Kaczmarek was required by Code, Art. 66)4, \u00a7 300 (a) (1957) to carry flares, and it is agreed flares were in his truck, but \u00a7 300 (b) does not require their display except \u201cduring the period when lighted lamps must be displayed on vehicles.\u201d \u00a7 271 (a). The jury might very well have found that Kaczmarek rightly judged visibility to be sufficient to obviate the necessity of setting out flares. In any event, while a violation of a statute is evidence which may support a finding of negligence, it is not, without more, conclusive of negligence. <em>Ford v. </em>Bradford, <em>supra. </em>We might agree that he would have been well advised to set out flares but we must reject the argument that his failure to do so, under the circumstances, made him negligent as a matter of law. <em>Ford v. Bradford, supra; Meldrum v. Kellam Distr. Co., </em>211 Md. 504, 128 A. 2d 400 (1957); <em>Miles v. Webb, </em>162 Md. 269, 159 Atl. 782 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Weishaar next contends that an improper instruction was granted at the request of Kaczmarek and that a proper instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>tion requested by him was refused. The record does not reveal what Kaczmarek requested in the way of an instruction but it seems to have dealt with the provisions of Code, Art. 66jL \u00a7 244 (1957).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our examination of the court\u2019s instructions to the jury persuades us that his comments about the requirements of \u00a7 244 were fair and neither confusing nor misleading.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Judge McLaughlin refused Weishaar\u2019s request for an instruction to the effect that the operator of a motor vehicle has a right to assume, even though visibility may be affected by fog, that the road ahead is safe for travel unless a danger is indicated by a red light or other warning signal. It is argued that the decision of our predecessors in <em>Marshall v. Sellers, </em>188 Md. 508, 53 A. 2d 5 (1947) supports the right to such an instruction. The judge did tell the jury that Weishaar \u201chad the right to assume that there wouldn\u2019t be anybody stopped out there,\u201d but he went on to say that he was still obliged to \u201cmake proper observation and keep a lookout for anything that might be there.\u201d We think Judge McLaughlin correctly refused the proffered instruction and that his instruction to the jury, taken as a whole, was within the scope of the holding in <em>Marshall v. Sellers, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Immediately after the accident Canestrale ordered a replacement for the truck which had been destroyed. Because the body had to be specially fabricated for his use, delivery was not accomplished until five weeks later, during which time, in order to continue his business, he was obliged to hire a truck. He was permitted, over objection, to show that this cost him, at $175 per week (conceded to be reasonable) a total of $875, which amount the jury included in its verdict under the instructions of the court. Weishaar argues this is reversible error on the part of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\"><em>Barnes v. United Railways Co., </em>140 Md. 14, 116 Atl. 855 (1922) is cited in support of the proposition that when a motor vehicle is totally destroyed, and there is a recovery for its full value, there can be no recovery for loss of use. There was dictum to that effect in <em>Barnes </em>and, generally speaking, it is a correct statement of the law but there is a well recognized exception, which, while we seem not to have had occasion to consider it in the past, is, nevertheless, applicable in the case at bar. In the comment to \u00a7 927 of the Restatement, Torts (1939) it is said that \u201cdamages can properly include an amount for expenses in procuring a necessary substitute or for the value of the use of a substitute until a replacement of the subject matter can be made * *</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\"><em>Guido, et al. v. Hudson Transit Lines, </em>178 F. 2d 740 (3rd Cir. 1950), in the words of Judge Goodrich, who wrote the court\u2019s opinion, \u201cis an almost perfect moot court case,\u201d and, we might add, singularly apposite to the instant case. The plaintiff there, because of post-war shortages, was not able to buy a new truck for two years. There was no attack upon the reasonableness of plaintiff\u2019s conduct nor the accuracy of his testimony. The same is true in respect of Canestrale. We think the language of Judge Goodrich, which we quote below, states the proper rule to be applied in the case at bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">\u201cThe rule is well established that the measure of damages for the conversion or destruction of a chattel is the market value of the chattel at the time and place of the conversion or destruction. While this is some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>times stated as though it were a rule applicable to vehicles it is a general rule applicable to all kinds of chattels. The justification for it is that this provides a convenient rule of thumb and, in case the article is readily replaceable on the open market, compensates the owner for his loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">\u201cThe difficulty comes when this convenient rule of thumb is sought to be applied to every case regardless of the circumstances. This the defendant would have us do here and cites authorities which have taken this ironclad view of the matter. [Citing cases.] The fear of allowing \u2018speculative\u2019 damages has scared some courts into applying what Mr. Justice Christiancy years ago called \u2018the certainty of injustice.\u2019 [Allison v. Chandler, 1863, 11 Mich. 542, 555.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">\u201cThe general principle which should govern the matter is quite clear. Damages are supposed to compensate the injured person for the wrong which has been done him. [Restatement, Torts, \u00a7 910.] If his loss is greater than the market value of the chattel at the time of its destruction, an owner should, on principle, be allowed additional items which will adequately compensate him unless some of those claimed items are so speculative as to create danger of injustice to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">\u201cHere we have the perfect case for the allowance of the additional element of damages. As pointed out above, the plaintiffs\u2019 case removed the possibility of speculation by careful proof which showed not only the possibility of profitable use but an actual contract for that use. This case, therefore, fits perfectly into the statement of the measure of damages set out in Section 927 of the Restatement of Torts.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 742.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-9\"><em>Accord, Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. Co. v. Elk Refining Co., </em>186 F. 2d 30 (4th Cir. 1950); <em>Buchanan v. Leonard, </em>127 Fed. Supp. 120 (D. Col. <em>1954); Louisville &amp; I. R. Co. v. Schuester, </em>183 Ky. 504, 209 S.

In our judgment the court correctly admitted the testimony and thereafter fully and fairly instructed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Canestrale\u2019s cross appeal arises out of the exclusion of a bill offered to prove the value of the cargo which was destroyed in the accident. It is conceded that San Tourneau Cabinets was the owner of the cabinets and that Canestrale was obligated to pay for them. It is conceded also that as bailee he had a right to sue for their destruction. The only evidence offered to prove their value was the bill from San Tourneau to Canestrale. The court admitted the bill subject to exception but struck it at the conclusion of the evidence, correctly, we think, since its admission would have violated the rule against hearsay evidence. <em>Glen Burnie Plaza v.
