They hid the rifles and, a short time thereafter, took them to an auction where they were sold, one being registered by the appellant; the other by the accomplice. The stolen rifles were recovered, and, upon arrest, appellant admitted he and the accomplice, together, had taken the rifles to the auction, told conflicting stories as to how he had acquired his, and finally stated that he had purchased it from the accomplice. Appellant, testifying in his own behalf, told substantially, the same story from the witness stand, and admitted the accomplice had given him a portion of the money received by the accomplice for the rifle registered by him, which apparently was the more valuable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Other witnesses testified that appellant and the accomplice were seen together at, or near, the time set by the accomplice as the time of the breaking, at a place within easy traveling distance, by automobile, to the cabin; and that appellant and the accomplice came to, and attended, the sale together, each registering other articles (such as a grill, a hot plate, a toaster, and an iron) in addition to the rifles.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">It is obvious' that the above was sufficient, if believed by the trial judge, to establish all of the essential ingredients of the crime of burglary; and a careful examination of the entire evidence fails to reveal that the trial judge\u2019s finding of \u201cguilty\u201d was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">\n<em>Judgment and sentence affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
