Director, </em>230 Md. 632, 187 A. 2d 473 (1963). It was entirely proper for the trial judge to dismiss petitioner\u2019s application, in accordance with the provisions of Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 645 H (1957 Cum. Supp. 1964), which were in effect at the time of the hearing. (The provisions of \u00a7 645 H have since been incorporated in \u00a7 645 A (c) (1957 Cum. Supp. 1965)). The trial court properly dismissed the petition without a hearing or the appointment of counsel.
