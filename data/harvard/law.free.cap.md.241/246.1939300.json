Alvan Jones (appellees) acquired a tract of land in Howard County containing 26.3 acres, 25 of which lie in the northeast quadrant of the intersection<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> formed by U. S. Route 29 (Columbia Pike) which runs north and south and Md'. Route 144 (Old Frederick Road) which runs east and west. The frontage on the north side of Route 144 is about 900 feet and on the east side of Route 29 about 600 feet. The balance (1.3 acres), triangular in shape, lies in the northwest quadrant, fronting about 500 feet on the west side of Route 29. The larger tract enjoys access to both Route 29 and Route 144 by private driveways, both of which had been in use before the appellees bought the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">Some time prior to December 1963 the State Roads Commission (Commission), by formal resolution designated Route 29, from U. S. Route 40 to the Montgomery County line (about 14 miles), a <em>controlled access arterial highway. </em>On 27 December 1963 the Commission filed the usual condemnation petition against appellees for the purpose of acquiring the 1.3 acre parcel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>on the west side of Route 29 and \u201call the right whatsoever of ingress and egress between the through highway [Route 29] and the remaining property of the * * * [appellees] * * * to the end that there will never be any vehicular, pedestrian and/or animal access to or from the through highway\u201d and appellees\u2019 remaining property. Simultaneously with the filing of the petition the Commission, complying with the provision of Code Art. 89 B, \u00a7 9 and Maryland Rule U, deposited with the clerk the sum of $4001. Responding to interrogatories several months later, the Commission declared that $4000 was for the 1.3 acre parcel and $1.00 was for the closing of the driveway and the denial of all access along Route 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">While negotiations between the parties failed to produce an agreement in respect of the value of the 1.3 acre parcel, the Commission <em>refused, to discuss </em>the question of compensation for the closing of the driveway and the denial of access, taking the position that there was no damage and, in any event, the damage to the appellees, if any, was not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Appellees responded by moving the court to enter a summary judgment in their favor \u201cas to that part of the plaintiff\u2019s suit relating to condemnation of their right of access to the east side of Route 29, so that the case * * * [might] proceed to trial only as to defendants\u2019 property on the west side of Route 29.\u201d On 12 January 1965 Judge Evans granted the motion for summary judgment, from which judgment the Commission has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The Commission contended, both in its brief and in its oral argument, that the closing of the driveway and the denial of access constitute a proper exercise of the police power and \u201ctherefore * * * [are] not * * * compensable item[s] of damage.\u201d It was unable, however, to reconcile this contention with the fact that the suit was brought pursuant to its powers of eminent domain and that it actually had paid damages into court. The amount, it is true, was nominal but it was the sum of money deemed by the Commission \u201cto be the fair value of the land and improvements taken and damages done to the aforesaid property.\u201d Several members of the Court commented, during argument, on the inconsistency of the Commission\u2019s position and in the ensuing colloquy there were indications that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the propriety of the use of the police power in this and similar situations could not be resolved in this litigation. Recognizing the probability of an adverse holding, counsel for the Commission agreed' to a suggestion by the Court that the case be re-argued on the basis of an appropriate stipulation. The stipulation, to which counsel for appellees also agreed, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">\u201c1. That the petition for condemnation for the denial of access and the $1.00 deposited therefor, shall be considered withdrawn from this case, prior to the hearing by the court below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">\u201c2. That this Honorable Court decide the issue of this case as if the same were filed as a Petition for a Declaratory Judgement, i. e. whether access under the facts of this case, can be denied under the Police Power, or must be acquired by condemnation under the principles of eminent domain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The Commission says that to make conventional highways safer for the transportation of the public it is necessary to use the police power to limit or deny access to the abutting landowner and that this is a proper exercise of the police power. It goes a long step further and contends that it is \u201cobvious\u201d that such a use of the police power \u201cis an inherent segment of the highway laws.\u201d The Commission concedes that heretofore it has accomplished denial of access along existing highways only by paying compensation to the abutting landowner, the amount thereof having been resolved either by agreement or by condemnation. It further concedes that this case reflects a proposed change in policy, which, if successful, will result in substantial economies in the area of right of way acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">It should be observed, as a prelude to the determination of the validity of the Commission\u2019s claim, that the police power inheres exclusively in the Legislature, and can be exercised by its creatures, such as the Commission, only to the extent it has been delegated. <em>Md. Coal Etc. Co. v. Bureau of Mines, </em>193 Md. 627, 640, 69 A. 2d 471 (1949); 16 C.J.S., <em>Constitutional Law, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 177-78 (1956); Oppenheimer, <em>Administrative Law in Maryland, 2 </em>Md. L. Rev. 185, 189 (1938). We shall concern ourselves, therefore, with the single question whether there has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>such a delegation. Any one undertaking this task would do well, by way of proper orientation, to keep in mind an observation made by Mr. Justice Holmes, in <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, </em>260 U. S. 393, 415-16 (1922):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">\u201cThe protection of private property in the Fifth Amendment presupposes that it is wanted for public use, but provides that it shall not be taken for such use without compensation. A similar assumption is made in the decisions upon the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Hairston v. Danville &amp; Western Ry. Co., </em>208 U. S. 598, 605. When this seemingly absolute protection is found to be qualified by the police power, the natural tendency of human nature is to extend the qualification more and more until at last private property disappears.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">\u201cWe are in danger of forgetting that a strong public desire to improve the public condition is not enough to warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the change.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">There is, of course, a veritable gallimaufry of judicial opinion in respect of the right of access of abutting owners to highways. As long ago as 1907 the Supreme Court felt compelled to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANH\">\u201cThe right of an owner of land abutting on public highways has been a fruitful source of litigation in the courts of all the States, and the decisions have been conflicting, and often in the same State irreconcilable in principle. The courts have modified or overruled their own decisions, and each State has in the end fixed and limited, by legislation or judicial decision, the rights of abutting owners in accordance with its own view of the law and public policy.\u201d <em>Sauer v. New York, </em>206 U. S. 536, 548, 51 E. Ed. 1176, 1182, 27 Sup. Ct. 686, 689 (1907).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">We content ourselves by observing that the situation has not improved and we draw not a little comfort from the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>it will not be necessary, in this case, to undertake either a discussion or a reconciliation of these seemingly myriad decisions, to say nothing of the output of the text writers and the legal periodicals.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In the April 1940 issue of the Maryland Daw Review there appeared a scholarly and exhaustive article by Robert R. Bowie, entitled <em>Limiting Highway Access, </em>4 Md. L. Rev. 219. Professor Bowie reviewed all of the extant decisions of this Court, and as well the decisions of many other courts, devoting special attention to <em>Baltimore v. Dobler, </em>140 Md. 634, 118 Atl. 168 (1922), (on a later appeal) 151 Md. 154, 134 Atl. 201 (1926), and <em>Krebs v. State Roads Comm., </em>160 Md. 584, 154 Atl. 131 (1931), on both of which the Commission places great reliance here. One of the conclusions reached by Professor Bowie was that \u201cso long as some reasonable means of access is preserved, the public may restrict or <em>destroy </em>the access of an abutting owner to a particular road by any measures designed to maintain, improve or preserve the highway or to protect its users, <em>without paying him compensation or damages.\u201d </em>4 Md. L. Rev. 219, 243. (Emphasis supplied.) Professor Bowie went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">\u201cIn conclusion it may be well to emphasize that this article has dealt only with the constitutional <em>power </em>of the state to limit the abutting owner\u2019s access in the public interest without compensation for resulting damage. <em>How far and in what cases that power should be exercised is of course a matter of legislative policy beyond the scope of this article.\u201d Id at 246 </em>(Second emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Whether it was merely <em>post hoc </em>or genuinely <em>propter hoc </em>we are unable to say; however, it is a fact that within less than a year after the publication of Professor Bowie\u2019s article the Regislature enacted Chapter 487 of the Acts of 1941, the provisions of which we have scrutinized and which we think are dispositive of the question now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">Chapter 487, <em>supra, </em>added to Article 89 B of the Code sections 214 to 219 (both inclusive) under the heading \u201cFreeways.\u201d Sections 214 and 215 are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>\u201c\u00a7 214. Establishment and construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">\u201c(a) Authority.\u2014The Commission may lay out, establish and construct any State highway as a freeway. A resolution adopted by the Commission stating that a proposed highway is to be constructed as a freeway shall be conclusive evidence that the highway, when constructed, is a freeway with all the characteristics and incidents prescribed by this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">\u201c(b) <em>No right of abutting owner to ingress and </em>egress.\u2014When a highway is constructed as a freeway, no owner of land abutting the highway or other person shall have any right of ingress or egress, to, from or across such abutting land to or from the freeway. The Commission in its discretion, at the time of the construction of the freeway or thereafter, may designate points at which access will be permitted, upon such terms and conditions as it may specify from time to time. (An. Code, 1951, \u00a7 165; 1941, ch. 487, \u00a7 150.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">\u201c\u00a7 215.

Definitions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">\u201cAs used in this subtitle the following words and terms shall have the following meanings, unless the context shall indicate another or different meaning or intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">\u201c(a) <em>Arterial </em>highway.\u2014The term \u2018arterial highway\u2019 shall mean a thoroughfare of one or more traffic lanes in each direction with or without physical separation of opposing traffic lanes, and which by the application of proper design standards such as adequate lane widths, adequate shoulders, proper sight distances and other such features of design can safely and expeditiously serve traffic volumes up to 3,000 vehicles per day, and shall embrace all bridges, tunnels, overpasses, underpasses, interchanges, entrance plazas, approaches and other structures which the Commission may deem necessary to the operation of the arterial highway, together with all property, rights, easements, franchises and interests acquired by the Commission for the construction and operation thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">\u201c(b) <em>Controlled access arterial </em>highways.\u2014The term \u2018controlled access arterial highway\u2019 shall mean a major thoroughfare of two or more traffic lanes in each direction having the same characteristics as an expressway except that the conflict of cross streams of traffic need not be eliminated at every intersection by means of grade separation structures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-11\">\u201c(c) <em>Expressway. </em>\u25a0\u2014\u25a0 The term \u2018expressway\u2019 shall mean a major thoroughfare of two or more traffic lanes in each direction, designed to eliminate principal traffic hazards, and shall embrace all bridges, tunnels, overpasses, underpasses, interchanges, entrance plazas, approaches, and other structures which the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>sion may deem necessary to the operation of the expressway, together with all property, rights, easements, franchises and interests acquired by the Commission for the construction and operation thereof, and having the following characteristics:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">\u201c(1) A median divider separating opposing traffic lanes to eliminate head-on collisions and sldeswiping; (2) grade separation structures to eliminate the conflict of cross streams of traffic at all intersections; (3) points of access and egress limited to predetermined locations; (4) vertical curves of lengths sufficient to provide long sight distances; and (5) shoulders of widths adequate to permit vehicles to stop or park off traffic lanes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Although these definitions seem to have been included mainly to provide a measure of clarity and exactitude to the 24 sections under the subtitle \u201cDistribution and Use of Special Funds,\u201d we think they also have sufficient relevance to the question before us to be helpful in reaching our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">A comparison of section 29 (b) with sections 214-219 makes it clear that there is no significant difference between a \u201ccontrolled access arterial highway\u201d and a \u201cfreeway.\u201d The only difference between the \u201ccontrolled access arterial highway\u201d and the \u201cexpressway,\u201d as defined in sec. 29 (c) is that \u201ccross streams of traffic need not be eliminated at every intersection by means of grade separation structures.\u201d Sections 213, defining \u201cparkways,\u201d and 214-219 defining \u201cfreeways\u201d are silent on the elimination of cross streams by grade separation structures. It must be assumed, therefore, that the Commission, in respect of \u201cparkways\u201d and \u201cfreeways,\u201d may, or may not, in its discretion, construct grade separation structures, just as it may, or may not, do so in the case of a \u201ccontrolled access arterial highway.\u201d The Commission may \u201cregulate, restrict or prohibit the use of such freeway (\u00a7217 (b)) [or parkway (\u00a7213 (d) (2))] by various classes of vehicles or traffic, * * *\u201d and while it may not do this on \u201ccontrolled access arterial highways\u201d it certainly would be a simple matter to change the designation of any such road from \u201ccontrolled access arterial highway\u201d to \u201cfreeway\u201d in the event it becomes necessary or desirable to regulate, restrict or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>prohibit certain classes of vehicles or traffic from using the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The \u201cfreeway\u201d sections make no mention of \u201cmedian dividers\u201d as do section 29 (b) and (c) but this does not mean the Commission may not install them; indeed, it is hard to imagine a \u201cfreeway\u201d which is not, or is not destined to be, a two lane divided highway. The requirement of limited points of access and egress appears to be common to \u201ccontrolled access arterial highways,\u201d \u201cexpressways,\u201d \u201cparkways\u201d and \u201cfreeways.\u201d The same is true of \u201clong sight distances\u201d and \u201cwide shoulders.\u201d Whatever nuances may be involved in the use of these terms in the internal workings of the Commission, we think that, as far as the acquisition of rights of way are concerned, and particularly in the circumstances here prevailing, the term \u201ccontrolled access arterial highway\u201d has the same meaning as the term \u201cfreeway.\u201d Moreover, the Legislature appears to have been like-minded when, in 1951, it enacted section 44, reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">\u201c\u00a7 44. Ingress and egress\u2014Width and locations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">\u201cIn order to promote and further highway safety, the State Roads Commission is hereby authorized to limit the width of points of existing ingress and egress and determine the locations of same that any commercial or industrial property owner or user may use into any existing State highway or section of State highway that carries an average traffic volume of more than 2,000 vehicles per day, such traffic volume to have been determined over a period of one year by procedures heretofore used by the State Roads Commission to establish densities of traffic. The Commission, if determined expedient for traffic safety, may so limit such width and location by any method it deems desirable, <em>provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to give the Commission the authority to deny any abutting property owner all access along any State highway except along freeways as defined in </em>\u00a7 <em>214 of this article. </em>(An. Code, 1951, \u00a7 32; 1951, ch. 611, \u00a7 21A.)\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Nor will any inconsistency be found in the language of sec. 7 of Art. 89 B, wherein the powers of the Commission are set forth, and which provides, in part, that it may \u201cacquire for the State of Maryland, <em>by agreement, gift, grant, purchase or condemnation proceedings </em>* * * <em>private property </em>* * * <em>including </em>* * * <em>rights or interests, franchises, privileges or easements </em>* * (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The Commission itself, until the change of policy earlier noted, has not (since 1941) attempted the closing of driveways or the denial of access by the exercise of the police power. In <em>Dudley, Jr. v. State Roads Comm., </em>224 Md. 613, 168 A. 2d 882 (1961) (decided on other grounds) it was noted that the deed to the Commission read, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">\u201c\u2018AND THE GRANTORS DO FURTHER GRANT\u2019 unto the State of Maryland to the use of the State Roads Commission, its successors and assigns, <em>any and all right whatsoever of the Grantors, </em>their heirs, successors and assigns, <em>of any means whatsoever of ingress and egress between the </em>THROUGH HIGHWAY and the remaining property across the line which is designated \u2018RIGHT OF WAY LINE OF THROUGH HIGHWAY\u2019 <em>to the end that there never will be any vehicular, pedestrian and/or animal access to or from said through highway and their remaining property </em>across those lines which are so marked on the above mentioned plats except by means of such public road connections to EXPRESSWAYS and/or private road connections to controlled access arterial highways as the \u2018COMMISSION\u2019, may construct, or permit to be constructed.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Consistent, long continued, unvarying administrative practice will not be disregarded, even at the instance of the administrative agency itself, except for the strongest and most urgent reasons. De<em>pt. of Tide Fisheries v. Sollers, </em>201 Md. 603, 95 A. 2d 306 <em>(1953); Bosley v. Dorsey, </em>191 Md. 229, 60 A. 2d 691 (1948); <em>Travers v.

Price, </em>183 Md. 443, 37 A. 2d 888 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>As has been noted the Commission relies heavily on <em>Doiler, supra, </em>and <em>Krebs, supra. </em>We think it is unnecessary to discuss either of those cases since they were decided before the Act of 1941. Also cited are <em>Langley v. Roads Comm., </em>213 Md. 230, 131 A. 2d 690 (1957) and <em>Turner v. State Roads Comm., 213 </em>Md. 428, 132 A. 2d 455 (1957). Both <em>Langley </em>and <em>Turner, </em>however, were median-strip cases in which neither the closing of a driveway nor the denial of access were involved. In <em>D\u2019Arago v. State Roads Comm., </em>228 Md. 490, 494-95, 180 A. 2d 488 (1962), also cited by the Commission, we held that where the highway in question is newly constructed, compensation will not be allowed unless the new road replaces or supersedes a previously existing road. Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e, for the Court, at 494, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">\u201cTurning to the appellant\u2019s first contention, it is clear that there never was any public road or right of way where the new Route 4 is now located. Hence, it is obvious that the appellant was not deprived of any easement of access to a highway which had been previously been appurtenant to her land. We find her claim for damages based upon denial of access to a new, limited-access highway, which did not replace or supersede any previously existing road, to be untenable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">\u201cAlthough the origin of the right of access to public streets inhering in abutting property owners is said to be obscure (see <em>Bacich v. Board of Control, 23 </em>Cal. 2d 343, 350, 144 P. 2d 818), <em>it is a well established right in the nature of an easement appurtenant to the abutting </em>lana5 <em>on an existing highway, and a condemnee is entitled to compensation for the taking thereof.\u201d </em>(Citing cases.) (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">The Commission emphasizes the fact that it relies principally on <em>People v. Ayon, </em>54 Cal. 2d 217, 352 P. 2d 519 (1960) and <em>Nick v. State Highway Commission, </em>13 Wis. 2d 511, 109 N. W. 2d 71 (1961). Denial of access was not involved in <em>Ayon. </em>Two-way traffic in front of the property was canalized by a median strip creating a situation almost precisely similar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>Langley, supra, </em>and <em>Turner, supra. </em>After holding that appellants had a right of direct access which could not be impaired without compensation, the court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\">\u201cUnder these well-settled rules the appellants are not entitled to compensation because of the divider strip placed in the middle of Azusa. They have direct access to that street and to traffic traveling in one direction on that street. * * * Nor can appellants complain because the relocation plan will divert some southbound' traffic from Azusa in front of appellants\u2019 property. A property owner has no right to compensation because traffic is rerouted or diverted to another thoroughfare even though the value of his property is substantially diminished as a result.\u201d 352 P. 2d at 523.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Because the Maryland and Wisconsin constitutions are similar, in that compensation is directed for <em>taking </em>private property but not for <em>damaging </em>private property, the Commission argues that <em>Nick, supra, </em>is entitled to great weight. If the <em>statutes </em>were the same, certainly, in assaying <em>Nick, </em>we should be obliged to give it greater weight, but, the statutes are not the same. Nowhere in the Wisconsin statute, 1 Wis. Stat., \u00a7 84.25 (1963), will there be found anything remotely resembling sections 44, 214 and 215 of Art. 89 B, <em>supra. </em>So, when the Wisconsin Supreme Court, after approving this use of the police power, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">\u201cNo doubt the control of his access to highway 30 impaired the value of his land * * * but at the time of the Commission\u2019s declaration Reinders still had access in every part of his land to highway 30 via use of Calhoun Road. His access to the highway is made more circuitous but no part of Reinder\u2019s land was taken. The diminution in its value due to-the exercise by the state of its police power in making highway 30 a controlled-access highway is not recoverable.\u201d 109 N. W. 2d at 73.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">it was using language which we are precluded from using because we are otherwise enjoined by our Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">A number of courts share the views we have expressed here<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>in. The Florida court, where constitutional provisions much like our own prevail,, in a recent case, had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">\u201cThe rights of abutting owners may be subordinated to the public, and to that end regulated * * *. But the situation in the present case is much more extreme. The right of access is not being regulated but is being destroyed. The petitioners are being relegated to entrance and exit via secondary roads running at right angles to the highway in question which their property fronts. This, we think, cannot be summarily done, and we think the legislature had no intention that it could be accomplished without compensation to the owners for loss that might be suffered by them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">\u201cIn Chapter 338 we find that although the first section, 338.01, confers on the \u2018highway authorities of the state [the extensive power] to plan, designate, establish, regulate, vacate, alter, improve, maintain, and provide limited access facilities\u2019 latter parts of the chapter impose conditions for the protection of property owners. In Sec. 338.04 it is specified that for the purposes of the law the authorities \u2018may acquire private or public property and <em>property rights for limited, access facilities </em>* * * <em>including rights of access </em>* * *.\u2019 (Italics supplied.) And immediately following in a second paragraph of the section, is this significant language: \u2018All property rights acquired under the provisions of this law shall be in fee simple.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">\u201cIn the situation described we are convinced the respondents should be enjoined from continuing with the conversion of the highway into a limited access facility or interfering with petitioners\u2019 right of ingress and egress until by eminent domain they have obtained the property and the property rights in fee .simple as the legislature directed. In the course of the proceedings the petitioners will have the opportunity to present evidence of the value to them of the \u2018property and property rights\u2019 including the right of \u2018access,\u2019 which will be acquired for \u2018limited access facilities.\u2019 Sec. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>338.04(1), supra.\u201d <em>Florida State Turnpike Authority v. Anhoco Corp., </em>116 So. 2d 8, 14 (Ela. 1959).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Language generally in accord with that used by the Florida court will be found in <em>Arkansas State Highway Comm. v. Arkansas P. &amp; L. Co., </em>231 Ark. 307, 330 S. W. 2d 77 (1959); <em>Department of Public Works and Buildings v. Wolf, </em>414 Ill. 386, 111 N. E. 2d 322 (1953)<em>; State v.

E. 2d 524 (1955); <em>Ashworth v. State Road Comm., </em>147 W. Va. 430, 128 S. E. 2d 471 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">While we think Judge Evans was entirely correct in granting the motion for summary judgment, further proceedings are necessary to bring the case to a conclusion. Since nothing will be gained by requiring the Commission to file a new condemnation petition, the trial court should strike out the summary judgment and allow the parties sufficient time to create, by appropriate pleadings, issues conformable to the decision reached herein. The costs will be paid by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\n<em>Case remanded under Maryland Rule 871 a without affirmance or reversal for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
