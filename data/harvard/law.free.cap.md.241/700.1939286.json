It is clear that the County board is vested with discretionary power and authority in connection with the building of new schools. See \u00a7\u00a7 3, 55 and 56 of Art. 77 of the Code (1965 Replacement Vol.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Wiley v. School Comm\u2019rs, </em>51 Md. 401, 404-05, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">\u201cIf the proposed act in establishing the high school be within the scope of the authority delegated, as it clearly is, it is not competent to [.sic] a court of equity [nor for a court of law by mandamus] to restrain the exercise of the discretion of the commissioners given by the statute, unless it be clearly shown that the power has been, or is about to be corruptly and fraudulently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>used. * * * Where the Legislature has confided the power of determining as to. the wisdom and expediency of an act authorized to be done, to a board of public functionaries, with them the decision * * * must rest. And that is the case here. The Board of County School Commissioners being clothed with power, in their discretion, to establish a county high school, their determination upon the subject cannot be reversed or controlled by a court of equity [or law].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">To the same effect are <em>School Commissioners v. Morris, </em>123 Md. 398; <em>School Com. of Car. Co. v. Breeding, </em>126 Md. 83, 88; and <em>Coddington v. Helbig, </em>195 Md. 330 (a case analogous to the instant case in that the protestants there sought to prevent the building of new schools and the closing of old ones), in which the Court held there was no proper allegation of illegality or fraud and that the broad authority given to build new schools where needed negated a finding that the bill alleged such a gross abuse of discretion as to amount to a breach of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The pleading of the protestants consists of a melange of allegations, none of which show familiarity or conformance with Md. Rule 301 b (applicable to both law and equity), which provides that a pleading shall contain such statements of fact as may be necessary to constitute a cause of action and shall not contain argument, inference or matters of law. At the argument protestants conceded that the first eight paragraphs of their pleading, which set out the background of the controversy, might not state a cause of action and relied on subparagraphs a through m of paragraph 9 as alleging fatal failures of the County board to act in the manner required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Judge Weant did not analyze each of subparagraphs a through m of paragraph 9 of the pleading although he found, as have we, that all the allegations of the pleading were subject to the destructive weaknesses referred to earlier. We think it unnecessary to deal with each of the subparagraphs one by one, although we have given each careful consideration. It is sufficient to say that they fall into one or more of three classifications: (a) They are conclusions rather than allegations of facts in that, for example, they allege that the Board did not obtain \u201cproper\u201d approval of contemplated action or did not \u201cproperly\u201d meet stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>utory requirements without specifying what was done or not done or why or to what extent it was not proper, (b) Other allegations concern complaints as to the action or inaction of State officials, (c) Still others allege failure of the County school officials to comply with an apparent mandatory statutory obligation but do so only in the words of the statute involved without further allegations which state or permit identification of the subject matter referred to, or state or fairly permit an inference as to the pertinence or relevance of the claimed breach of duty to the exercise of the statutory power of the County school authorities to select a site and build a school on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The paragraphs and subparagraphs of the pleading considered separately or as a whole simply do not specify that the County school officials have exceeded the powers given them by statute to build a new school or that in exercising these powers they have acted fraudulently or corruptly or in breach of their trust. This being so, the demurrer to their pleading rightly was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The answer to the protestants\u2019 plea that they should have been allowed to amend their pleading is that the trial judge has wide discretion in deciding whether to permit amendment after a demurrer has been sustained, Md. Rule 320, and if there is no showing of an abuse of discretion, his determination on the point will not be interfered with. <em>Tilghman v. Frazer, </em>198 Md. 250. The inadequate allegations of the protestants\u2019 pleading gave no sign that amendment could supply the necessary specifications that the school authorities had exceeded delegated powers or used those powers wrongly in the preparation for building or the building of the new school. It would seem, therefore, more appropriate for a new action to be commenced by the protestants, if the facts will permit such a course, than for them to attempt to amend the pleading in the present case. This was the conclusion reached in <em>Coddington v. Helbig, supra </em>(and in an analogous situation in <em>Masson v. Reindollar, </em>193 Md. 683). We see no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-6\">.
