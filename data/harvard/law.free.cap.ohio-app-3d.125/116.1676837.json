For the purposes of sentencing determination, we conclude that an order placing a defendant on probation under Ohio\u2019s prior sentencing scheme is the equivalent of a \u201ccommunity control sanction\u201d under its current plan. Therefore, we affirm appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>As part of a plea agreement, appellant, Michael L. Cooks, pled guilty to attempted perjury, a fourth-degree felony. At sentencing, the trial court determined that appellant was already on probation when he attempted to perjure himself. Additionally, the court, pursuant to R.C. 2929.11(B), concluded that if appellant was not sentenced to prison, then the seriousness of appellant\u2019s conduct would be demeaned. Accordingly, the court proceeded to sentence appellant to a seven-month term of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Appellant now appeals that sentence, setting forth the following single assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">\u201cThe Trial Court erred in sentencing the Defendant/Appellant to a seven (7) month prison term where the Court did not make a specific finding of any of the factors enumerated in Sections 2929.13(B)(1)(a) through 2929.13(B)(1)(h) of the Ohio Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">At issue here is the construction of statutes enacted by the General Assembly in its sweeping reform of Ohio\u2019s criminal sentencing procedures. See 1995 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 2 and 1996 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 269. R.C. 2929.11 defines the overarching policy considerations underlying felony sentencing in this state. The statute specifically states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">\u201c(A) * * * The overriding purposes of felony sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the offender and others and to punish the offender. \u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-11\">\u201c(B) A sentence imposed for a felony shall be reasonably calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of felony sentencing set forth in division (A) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning to the seriousness of the offender\u2019s conduct * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">R.C. 2929.12 makes clear th\u00e1t, unless a prison term is statutorily mandated, the implementation of the principles set forth in R.C. 2929.11 rests in the sound discretion of the court. The statute also sets forth a number of factors which the court is directed to consider in the exercise of that discretion. R.C. 2929.12(B) through (E).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">R.C. 2929.13 provides that offenders sentenced for fourth- or fifth-degree felonies, absent exceptions not relevant here, should ordinarily not be sentenced to prison unless the court finds present one of the aggravating factors enumerated in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1) and, \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in section 2929.12 of the Revised Code, finds that a prison term is consistent with the purposes and principles of sentencing set forth in section 2929.11 of the Revised Code and finds that the offender is not amenable to an available community control sanction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-14\">The R.C. 2929.13(B)(1) factors are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\u201c(a) In committing the offense, the offender caused physical harm to a person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\">\u201c(b) In committing the offense, the offender attempted to cause or made an actual threat of physical harm to a person with a deadly weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">\u201c(c) In committing the offense, the offender attempted to cause or made an actual threat of physical harm to a person, and the offender previously was convicted of an offense that caused physical harm to a person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">\u201c(d) The offender held a public office or position of trust and the offense related to that office or position; the offender\u2019s position obliged the offender to prevent the offense or to bring those committing it to justice; or the offender\u2019s professional reputation or position facilitated the offense or was likely to influence the future conduct of others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">\u201c(e) The offender committed the offense for hire or as part of an organized criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">\u201c(f) The offense is a sex offense that is a fourth or fifth degree felony violation of [certain specific statutes].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-9\">\u201c(g) The offender previously served a prison term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-10\">\u201c(h) The offender previously was subject to a community control sanction, and the offender committed another offense while under the sanction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">If the court fails to find any of the (B)(1) factors and, \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in section 2929.12 of the Revised Code, finds that a community control sanction or combination of community control sanctions is consistent with the purposes and principles of sentencing set forth in section 2929.11 of the Revised Code, the court shall impose a community control sanction or combination of community control sanctions upon the offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">Appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s finding that he was on probation at the time of his offense is not one of the factors listed in R.C. 2929.13(B)(1). Therefore, appellant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing him to prison. This argument fails for two independent reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\"> First, we hold that probation under the former statutory scheme is the equivalent of a community control sanction under the new sentencing plan. Compare R.C. 2929.15 with former R.C. 2951.02, 1995 Sub.H.B. No. 167, 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2278. Both provide for supervised release in lieu of incarceration. Consequently, appellant committed his most recent offense while under a sanction pursuant to R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">Second, a finding of one of the R.C. 2929.13(B)(1) factors is not solely determinative of whether a defendant is to be imprisoned or subject to community control sanctions. R.C. 2929.13(B)(2)(a) and (B)(2)(b) form a stasis. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>balance for or against imprisonment may be tipped one way or another by an R.C. 2929.12(B)(1) finding, but such a finding is not dispositive. The sentencing court must still exercise its discretion after considering the R.C. 2929.12 factors to determine whether the purposes and principles articulated in R.C. 2929.11 are served by the sentence imposed. On appeal, the conclusion of the sentencing court will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion. An abuse of discretion is more than an error of law or of judgment; the term connotes that the court\u2019s attitude is arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable. <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 98, 7 O.O.3d 178, 181-182, 372 N.E.2d 804, 808-809.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In this matter, we note that the sentencing court\u2019s order is considered and well reasoned. There is no indication that the court abused its discretion when it fashioned the order. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The judgment of the Sandusky County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Costs to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-8\">Melvin L. Resnick, P.J., and Glasser, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
