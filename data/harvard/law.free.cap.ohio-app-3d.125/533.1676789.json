Appellant held this position until January 2, 1996. On that date, the trustees conducted an organizational meeting and voted not to rehire appellant as the zoning inspector.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Trustee Lou Ann Lehmiller stated on the record that she voted not to rehire appellant because he had issued a zoning permit to Stark Community Dispatch, a company that provides dispatch services for local fire departments, to operate in an area zoned rural residential. After nearly three years of operation in the rural residential zone, Stark Community Dispatch filed an application for reclassification of property. The Stark County Regional Planning Commission recommended approval of the proposed rezoning to the Canton Township Zoning Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Appellant appealed his termination to the Stark County Court of Common Pleas on March 20, 1996. Appellee moved for summary judgment, and appellant moved for partial summary judgment. On March 12, 1997, the trial court issued a judgment entry granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying appellant\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Appellant timely filed his notice of appeal and sets forth the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">\u201cI. The Stark County Court of Common Pleas erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment as there is a material issue of fact regarding Mr. Merritt\u2019s liberty interest in continued employment by the Canton Township . Board of Trustees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-10\">\u201cII. The Stark County Court of Common Pleas erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment as there is a material issue of fact regarding whether Mr. Merritt\u2019s employment relationship was changed from an at-will relationship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">Summary Judgment Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">Summary judgment proceedings present the appellate court with the unique opportunity of reviewing the evidence in the same manner as the trial court. <em>Smiddy v. The Wedding Party, Inc. </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 35, 36, 30 OBR 78, 78-79, 506 N.E.2d 212, 215. Therefore, we must refer to Civ.R. 56, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-13\">\u201cSummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleading, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence in the pending case, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. * * * A summary judgment shall not be rendered unless it appears from such evidence or stipulation and only therefrom, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, such party being entitled to have the evidence or stipulation construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Pursuant to this rule, a trial court may not enter summary judgment if it appears that a material fact is genuinely disputed. The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. The moving party may not make a conclusory assertion that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case. The moving party must specifically point to some evidence which demonstrates that the moving party cannot support its claim. If the moving party satisfies this requirement, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to set forth specific facts demonstrating that there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial. <em>Vahila v. Hall </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 421, 429, 674 N.E.2d 1164, 1170-1171, citing <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 662 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">It is based upon this standard that we review appellant\u2019s assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Appellant contends, in his first assignment of error, that he had a liberty interest in his continued employment by appellee such that he was entitled to procedural due process. Based upon this liberty interest, appellant claims that he was entitled to a predeprivation hearing and a full name-clearing hearing following the termination of his employment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">In addressing this assignment of error, we must first determine whether appellant was a classified or unclassified employee with the township. Pursuant to R.C. 124.11(B) and 124.01(G), we find that appellant was an unclassified employee. R.C. 124.11(B) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">\u201cThe classified service shall comprise all persons in the employ of the state and the several counties, cities, city health districts, general health districts, and city school districts thereof, not specifically included in the unclassified service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">Townships and villages are not included in the above definition. Further, Canton Township is not a \u201ccivil service township\u201d as defined in R.C. 124.01(G). \u201cCivil service township\u201d is there defined as \u201cany township with a population of ten thousand or more persons residing within the township and outside any municipal corporation, which has a police or fire department of ten or more full-time paid employees, and which has a civil service commission established under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>division (B) of section 124.40 of the Revised Code.\u201d Canton Township has not created a \u201ccivil service township.\u201d Further, the employee manual that appellant refers to provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">\u201cSECTION 1 Canton Township Trustees\u2019 Authority</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">\u201cThe Canton Township Trustees by statute, may suspend, demote or discharge employees in their employ. Generally, all employees serve at the pleasure of the Board of Trustees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">An unclassified employee is appointed at the discretion of the appointing authority, accrues no tenure, and serves at the pleasure of the appointing authority. An unclassified employee can be dismissed from his or her position without cause absent any discrimination or malfeasance. <em>Deoma v. Shaker Hts. </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 72, 81, 587 N.E.2d 425, 430-431, <em>Eudela v. Ohio Dept. of Mental Health &amp; Mental Retardation </em>(1986), 30 Ohio App.3d 113, 30 OBR 213, 506 N.E.2d 947, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Lee v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 620, 622, 602 N.E.2d 761, 762-763.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Employees in unclassified service hold their positions at the pleasure of the appointing authority, may be dismissed from their employment without cause, and are afforded none of the procedural safeguards available to those in classified service. <em>Suso v. Ohio Dept. of Dev. </em>(1993), 93 Ohio App.3d 493, 499, 639 N.E.2d 117, 120-121, <em>Huber v. Celebrezze </em>(1984), 14 Ohio App.3d 299, 301, 14 OBR 356, 358-359, 471 N.E.2d 181, 183-184. Thus, an unclassified employee, lacking a property right, may be discharged without a hearing. <em>Shearer v. Cuyahoga Cty. Hosp., Sunny Acres </em>(1986), 34 Ohio App.3d 59, 60, 516 N.E.2d 1287, 1288. Based upon the Ohio Revised Code and case law, we find that appellant was an unclassified employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">We will now address appellant\u2019s claim under Section 1983, Title 42, U.S. Code. In order to state a claim under Section 1983, appellant must demonstrate that his procedural due process rights were violated. To establish a due process violation, it must be shown that the conduct complained of deprived appellant of a liberty or property interest without adequate procedural safeguards. <em>Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth </em>(1972), 408 U.S. 564, 569, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2705, 33 L.Ed.2d 548, 556. We have already determined that appellant has no property interest in his employment as an unclassified employee. Absent a property interest, a name-clearing hearing is required only if the employer creates and disseminates a false and defamatory impression about the employee in connection with his termination so as to infringe his right to liberty. <em>State ex rel. Kilburn v. Guard </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 21, 23, 5 OBR 81, 83-84, 448 N.E.2d 1153, 1155-1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>A liberty right is infringed when the following elements are established: \u201c(1) a false statement (2) of a stigmatizing nature (3) attending a governmental employee\u2019s discharge (4) made public (5) by the governmental employer (6) without a meaningful opportunity for employee name clearing.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Buxton v. Plant City </em>(C.A.11, 1989), 871 F.2d 1037, 1042-1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Appellant fails to meet the first requirement to establish the infringement of a liberty right because we find, as did the trial court, that Lehmiller\u2019s statement was not false. Appellant signed the zoning permit allowing Stark Community Dispatch to establish business in an area zoned rural residential. Appellant did not even attempt to prove this statement false. Further, appellant produced no evidence that his employment opportunities were foreclosed. Appellant admitted that he did not try to find another job and also stated that the nonrenewal did not affect his ability to find another job because persons he has consulted with know him.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Based upon the above, we find that appellant did not have a property interest or a liberty interest in continued employment by Canton Township. Therefore, he was not denied procedural due process when he was not afforded a predeprivation hearing or full name-clearing hearing following the termination of his employment. The trial court properly granted summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Appellant contends, in his second assignment of error, that the Canton Township Employee Handbook altered the employer-employee relationship from an at-will relationship and that appellant was therefore justified in relying on the terms of the handbook. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Prior to addressing this assignment of error, we note that a question exists concerning the validity of the handbook. This is due to the fact that the outgoing board of trustees attempted to adopt an employee handbook prior to leaving office. However, the outgoing board did not declare an emergency, which would have eliminated the necessity of two readings before the public. Appellee claims that the handbook is therefore void <em>ab initio. </em>We will not directly address this issue on appeal, but instead assume that the handbook was properly adopted by the outgoing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Appellant claims, in his complaint, that his employment was governed by R.C. 511.10. This statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-11\">\u201cThe board of township trustees may appoint such superintendents, architects, clerks, laborers, and other employees as are necessary and fix their compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>tion. Any person so appointed may be removed by a majority of the members of such board at any time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe power to appoint without interference also implies the power to discharge.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Minor v. Eschen </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 134, 139, 656 N.E.2d 940, 945. Clearly, this statute, which appellant relies upon, establishes that his employment as at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Appellant also argues under this assignment of error that the language \u201call civil service rules and regulations\u201d changed his status of employment. We disagree because, as noted in appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, Canton Township is not a civil service township as defined in R.C. 124.01(G). Further, the handbook contains language that specifically precludes the creation of classified service. See Section 1 of the employee handbook, addressing township trustees\u2019 authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">We also find that appellant\u2019s claim that he has an oral contract of employment is invalid, under R.C. 1335.05, because it violates the Statute of Frauds in that any contract for more than one year must be in writing. Finally, and most important, appellant admitted, at his deposition, that he did not rely upon the employee handbook. Appellant testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">\u201cQ: All right. You weren\u2019t relying upon this handbook, were you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">\u201cA: With respect to what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">\u201cQ: Relative to governing the future terms of your employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-11\">\u201cA: No. I had no reason to because there was nothing that I had done to cause me to be discharged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-12\">\u201cQ: I guess my question is you weren\u2019t relying on the handbook; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-13\"><em>(6* * </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-14\">\u201cA: No. Why should I?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-15\">We find that the employee handbook did not alter appellant\u2019s employment with Canton Township so as to create any contractual rights. Further, appellant admitted that he did not rely upon the handbook. The trial court properly granted summary judgment, as no material issue of fact exists as to whether the employer-employee relationship was altered by the employee handbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-16\">Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-17\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Stark County, Ohio, is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-18\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Reader, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b570-4\">Gwin, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b570-5\">Gwin, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A04\">dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">I dissent in part from the decision reached by the majority because I believe on this record that appellant was entitled to a full name-clearing hearing. Trustees Lehmiller and Decker voted not to rehire appellant because he allegedly permitted Stark Community Dispatch to operate illegally and because he neglected his duties as zoning inspector. The trustees refused appellant\u2019s requested name-clearing hearing because they were informed, incorrectly, that appellant\u2019s request was untimely. The trustees acknowledged that if appellant\u2019s request had been timely, they would have afforded him the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The trial court and the majority find that the statements were true. In his deposition, appellant testified that the publicity surrounding Stark Community Dispatch and the illegality of its operations gave rise to speculation and innuendo regarding appellant\u2019s role in the situation, which damaged his personal reputation in the community, even if, as the majority points out, it did not damage him in the eyes of the persons with whom he consulted. I believe that this is sufficient to entitle appellant to a name-clearing hearing to put to rest the speculation and innuendo occasioned by the trustees\u2019 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">I concur in the balance of the majority\u2019s findings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
