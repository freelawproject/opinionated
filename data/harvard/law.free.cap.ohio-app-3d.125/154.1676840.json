Palermo.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">Defendant Capri Enterprises, Inc., operates Capri Lanes, a bowling alley located at 5860 Roche Drive, Columbus. Virginia A. Palermo, at all times relevant to the facts of this case, worked as a bartender at Capri Lanes under the employment of Capri Enterprises, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">Bruce Walker, Jr., died in the early morning hours of January 16, 1994; decedent was a patron at the Capri Lanes at the time of his death. The coroner\u2019s report listed the immediate cause of death as \u201cacute ethanol intoxication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">On November 27, 1996, plaintiff, as the administrator of decedent\u2019s estate, brought a wrongful death action against defendants. Plaintiffs complaint alleged that defendants had served alcohol to decedent while he was already intoxicated and subsequent to a 2:30 a.m deadline for serving alcohol, in violation of the establishment\u2019s liquor permit. It alleged that defendants\u2019 actions in serving alcohol to decedent proximately caused his death and set forth causes of action for negligence, reckless, willful, wanton and/or intentional misconduct, <em>respondeat superior, </em>and negligent hiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">On January 22,1997, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. In the accompanying memorandum, defendants argued that Ohio case law as well as public policy precluded a claim against a liquor permit holder. Defendants also argued that the claim against defendant Virginia Palermo was barred by the two-year statute of limitations under R.C. 2125.02(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">On February 10, 1997, plaintiff filed a memorandum in opposition to defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Attached to the memorandum was the affidavit of Alfred E. Staubus, Ph.D. Defendants filed a reply memorandum on March 3, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>By entry filed April 10, 1997, the trial court rendered a decision granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The trial court, in granting summary judgment as to defendant Capri Enterprises, Inc., relied on the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Smith v. 10th Inning, Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 289, 551 N.E.2d 1296. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Palermo on the basis that the wrongful death claim against Palermo was filed more than two years after decedent\u2019s death, and thus fell outside the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">On appeal, plaintiff sets forth the following single assignment of error for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">\u201cThe Franklin County Court of Common Pleas erred in granting summary judgment to defendant Capri Enterprises, Inc. because its decision was based solely upon an unprecedented, overbroad and inaccurate interpretation of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Smith v. The 10th Inning, Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 289 [551 N.E.2d 1296].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Under his single assignment of error, plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in holding that public-policy considerations preclude recovery by an intoxicated patron or the administrator of the patron\u2019s est\u00e1te in an action against a liquor permit holder. More specifically, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in its application and reliance on the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Smith, supra, </em>and therefore improperly granted summary judgment in favor of defendant Capri Enterprises, Inc. (hereinafter \u201cdefendant\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">In <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 472, 364 N.E.2d 267, 274, the Ohio Supreme Court discussed the applicable standard in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">\u201cCiv.R. 56(C) specifically provides that before summary judgment may be granted, it must be determined that: (1) No genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that conclusion is adverse to that party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">In <em>Smith, supra, </em>49 Ohio St.3d 289, 551 N.E.2d 1296, the court held in the syllabus that \u201c[a]n intoxicated patron has no cause of action against a liquor permit holder under R.C. 4301.22(B) where the injury, death or property damage sustained by the intoxicated patron off the premises of the permit holder was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>proximately caused by the patron\u2019s own intoxication.\u201d Under the facts of <em>Smith, </em>the plaintiff, a patron of the defendant\u2019s liquor establishment, left defendant\u2019s tavern and was involved in an automobile accident in which he sustained injury. The issue before the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Smith </em>was whether an intoxicated person could bring a cause of action for damages under R.C. 4301.22(B) against the permit holder that sold him or her the intoxicating beverages. R.C. 4301.22(B), which is applicable to permit holders, provides that \u201c[n]o permit holder * * * shall sell * * * intoxicating liquor to an intoxicated person.\u201d In the <em>Smith </em>decision, the Ohio Supreme Court, citing public policy considerations, held that such a cause of action did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Plaintiff asserts that the facts of the instant case are distinguishable from <em>Smith. </em>First, plaintiff contends that the tortious activity alleged in <em>Smith </em>was simply that defendant served plaintiff alcohol after he was already intoxicated, while in the instant case plaintiffs theory of liability is predicated upon the additional claim that defendant served the decedent after the hours of 2:30 a.m., in violation of state law and contrary to the deadline prescribed in defendant\u2019s liquor permit. Thus, plaintiff argues, under the facts of <em>Smith, </em>the issue of serving alcohol to an intoxicated person necessarily implicated a subjective evaluation by a bartender to determine whether a patron had consumed too much alcohol. Plaintiff contends that the duty of a liquor establishment not to serve alcohol to patrons after the mandatory closing time is distinguishable because it involves no such subjective evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Plaintiff also contends that <em>Smith </em>is distinguishable because the injury sustained by the intoxicated patron in that case occurred off the premises of the permit holder as opposed to the facts of the instant case, where decedent was found dead at defendant\u2019s establishment. Furthermore, plaintiff argues, the cause of action in <em>Smith </em>involved a claim of negligence <em>per se, </em>whereas in the instant case plaintiff seeks recovery for causes of action recognized under common law. We note that, although not cited in plaintiffs initial brief before this court, plaintiffs reply brief states that \u201c[l]iability is based upon R.C. 4399.18, which calls for liability of a permit holder if a person is injured on the permit holder\u2019s premises, and the injury was proximately caused by the permit holder or his employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Subsequent to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Smith, </em>a number of appellate courts have reviewed actions brought by patrons or their representatives for injuries received by those patrons after consuming intoxicating liquors at a liquor establishment. Our review of Ohio case law fails to reveal any case subsequent to <em>Smith </em>(nor has plaintiff cited such a case) in which a court has determined that a cause of action exists on behalf of an adult intoxicated patron or his or her estate against a permit holder, regardless of whether the theory of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>recovery was under common-law negligence or pursuant to a statute such as R.C. 4399.18. Rather, appellate courts have held, similar to the trial court in the instant case, that the holding of the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Smith </em>is based upon broad public policy considerations that extend beyond actions brought under R.C. 4301.22(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Thus, in <em>Fifer v. Buffalo Cafe </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 297, 601 N.E.2d 601, the court held that an administrator of the estate of the decedent, who died of acute alcohol intoxication after consuming liquor at defendant\u2019s cafe, did not have a common-law negligence claim against defendant based on statutes prohibiting the sale of alcohol to a visibly intoxicated person or to a person who habitually drinks alcohol to excess. The court in <em>Fifer, </em>citing <em>Smith, </em>reasoned that the statutes relied upon by plaintiff were not enacted to benefit intoxicated persons. In <em>Fifer, </em>the court rejected plaintiffs contention that <em>Smith </em>precluded a cause of action under R.C. 4301.22 only where the injury occurred off-the premises of the liquor permit holder, holding that \u201c[w]e believe that for the public policy reasons stated in <em>Smith, </em>the intoxicated patron has no cause of action under R.C. 4301.22, regardless of where the injury occurred.\u201d <em>Fifer, supra, </em>at 300, 601 N.E.2d at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">In <em>Gillum v. Fairgreens Country Club </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 60, 673 N.E.2d 637, plaintiff, the administrator of a decedent\u2019s estate, brought a wrongful death action against the defendant country club for loss of consortium, asserting that defendant negligently served alcohol to the decedent while he was visibly intoxicated and that the negligence proximately resulted in a fatal automobile accident. In the complaint, plaintiff alleged that defendant\u2019s conduct \u201cwas not merely negligent, but \u2018also demonstrated malice, aggravated and egregious fraud, oppression and insult.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 673 N.E.2d at 638. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant, holding that defendant owed no duty to the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">On appeal, plaintiff asserted that she had a common-law negligence action against defendant based upon defendant\u2019s alleged violation of R.C. 4301.22(B) and that the action should allow her to recover damages for loss of consortium \u201ceven though the loss was at least partially caused by the intoxicated decedent himself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64-65, 673 N.E.2d at 640. The plaintiff in <em>Gillum </em>argued that the facts in <em>Smith </em>were distinguishable because, in <em>Smith, </em>the establishment held a liquor permit, while the defendant in <em>Gillum </em>apparently sold alcohol without a permit. Plaintiff further asserted that a cause of action should he \u201cif more than one proximate cause, <em>i.e., </em>one apart from the intoxicated patron\u2019s own negligence, contributed to the accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66, 673 N.E.2d at 641. Thus, plaintiff argued that the issue of distribution of fault should be submitted to the jury based upon Ohio\u2019s comparative negligence scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Regarding the claim that defendant engaged in the sale of liquor without a permit, in violation of statute, the court noted that the purpose of R.C. 4803.25 \u201cwas primarily to raise revenue and to regulate which businesses should hold a permit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court concluded that, since the statute was not intended to afford potential plaintiffs protection from this type of harm, the fact that defendant \u201cdoes not possess a liquor permit has no bearing on whether its act of selling alcohol to Gillum does or does not constitute negligence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The court in <em>Gillum </em>next addressed plaintiffs argument that the holding in <em>Smith </em>barred an intoxicated patron\u2019s cause of action only when the injury was proximately caused by the patron\u2019s own intoxication. The court rejected this argument, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">\u201cAppellant asserts that because the patron\u2019s own intoxication may not always be solely responsible for the injury, this leaves open the possibility of more than one proximate cause. Appellant argues that because this possibility exists, the causation issue should be submitted to the jury, which should then determine which actors should bear responsibility and allocate the appropriate portion of fault to each.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">\u201cIn addressing appellant\u2019s argument, we acknowledge that under Ohio\u2019s comparative negligence system, such an allocation of fault by the jury may seem logical. See <em>Hicks v. Consol. Rail Corp. </em>(1993), 92 Ohio App.3d 636, 640, 637 N.E.2d 19, 22. We note, however, that the court in <em>The 10th Inning </em>considered this possibility and rejected the idea on the same public policy grounds that decided the outcome of the entire case. The court wrote as follows concerning this idea:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">\u201c \u2018Some might suggest that this court permit a cause of action by the intoxicated patron and allow the court or jury to determine the comparative negligence of the permit holder and the intoxicated patron. While this alternative seems attractive, we decline such a course * * *.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 291, 551 N.E.2d at 1298.\u201d <em>Gillum, supra, </em>110 Ohio App.3d at 67, 673 N.E.2d at 641-642.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-9\"><em>Monateri v. Potito, Zebark, Inc. </em>(Dec. 18, 1992), Lake App. No. 92-L-088, unreported, 1992 WL 387363, involved a case in which the plaintiff, a paraplegic, had patronized defendant\u2019s bar for approximately four and one half hours; she was later discovered slumped in her wheelchair, unconscious, in the parking lot of the bar. In that case, the court discussed the relationship between R.C. 4399.18 and 4301.22(B) in light of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Smith. </em>The court noted that R.C. 4399.18 represented a codification of preexisting public policy, <em>Gressman v. McClain </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 359, 362, 533 N.E.2d 732, 735-736, and the court concluded that \u201cwhether a particular case was decided pursuant to R.C. 4399.18 or 4301.22(B) is of little consequence.\u201d <em>Monateri, supra. </em>The <em>Monateri </em>court thus concluded that although the cause of action in <em>Smith </em>arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>prior to the enactment of R.C. 4399.18, and the injury in that case occurred off the permit holder\u2019s premises, \u201cthere is a strong public policy against allowing a patron to recover for harm caused to himself or herself due to his or her own overindulgence whether on or off the premises, absent a situation governed by R.C. 4399.01.\u201d <em>Monateri, swpra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Accordingly, the holdings in these cases indicate that appellate courts have not limited the holding in <em>Smith </em>solely to actions brought asserting negligence <em>per se </em>under R.C. 4301.22(B). Further, these cases have declined to distinguish the holding in <em>Smith </em>to allow a recovery where the injury occurred on the premises as opposed to off the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">As noted above, plaintiff contends that the instant case is distinguishable from other Ohio cases because it involves a violation of a statute prohibiting the sale of liquor after hours. Regarding the issue of when a statutory violation may give rise to a civil action, one commentator has noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">\u201cIt is not every provision of a criminal statute or ordinance which will be adopted by the court, in a civil action for negligence, as the standard of conduct of a reasonable person. Otherwise stated, there are statutes which are considered to create no duty of conduct toward the plaintiff, and to afford no basis for the creation of such a duty by the court. The courts in such cases have been careful not to exceed the purpose which they attribute to the legislature. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\"><em>\u00ab </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">\u201cIn many cases the evident policy of the legislature is to protect only a limited class of individuals. If so, the plaintiff must bring himself within that class in order to maintain an action based on the statute. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">\u201cThe purpose of the legislation is of course a matter of interpretation of its terms, in the light of the evil to be remedied. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-11\">\u201cThe same limitation of the effect of the statute to accomplish only the supposed policy of the legislature is found in the overlapping requirement that the harm suffered must be of the kind which the statute was intended, in general, to prevent.\u201d Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts (5 Ed.1984) 222, 224-225, Section 36.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">At issue in the instant case is the purpose of Ohio\u2019s statutory provisions prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors after certain hours. This issue was addressed by the court in <em>Lajoie v. Maumee River Yacht Club </em>(Feb. 2, 1990), Lucas App. No. L-89-014, unreported, 1990 WL 7976, in which a plaintiff alleged that the defendant establishment was negligent in serving alcoholic beverages beyond authorized hours. Under the facts of that case, the plaintiffs husband, after consuming alcohol at a yacht club in the early morning hours, lost his balance while walking along a dock, fell in the water, and drowned. Plaintiff alleged that the defendant had been negligent in serving alcoholic beverages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>either beyond the time authorized under its liquor permit or after 2:30 a.m. on a Sunday, in violation of R.C. 4301.22(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The court in <em>Lajoie, </em>relying in part on provisions of the treatise cited above, rejected plaintiffs argument, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">\u201cIt is well-settled law in Ohio that for violation of a statute to constitute negligence per se the injured person must be a part of the class the statute was designed to protect. See <em>Marsh v. Koons </em>(1908), 78 Ohio St. 68, 84 N.E. 599, paragraph one of the syllabus. It is also clear that prohibiting liquor sales after a certain hour or limiting sales on Sunday are \u2018intended only to protect such interests * * * as public peace, morality and quiet, rather than the safety of any particular class of individuals.\u2019 Keeton, Prosser and Keeton on Torts (5th Ed.1984), 222-223, Section 36.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">We agree with the court in <em>Lajoie </em>that a statute prohibiting the sale of liquor after a certain hour is intended to protect the public at large rather than afford protection to a particular class of individuals, <em>i.e., </em>intoxicated patrons. Thus, we find unpersuasive plaintiffs argument that a violation of the statute at issue would give rise to a cause of action on behalf of an intoxicated person or his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">As previously noted, in his reply brief, plaintiff cites R.C. 4399.18, a statute that contemplates possible liability for injury occurring on a permit holder\u2019s premises. Specifically, R.C. 4399.18 states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">\u201cNotwithstanding division (A) of section 2307.60 of the Revised Code and except as otherwise provided in this section and in section 4399.01 of the Revised Code, a person, and the executor or administrator of the estate of a person, who suffers injury, death, or loss to person or property as a result of the actions or omissions of an intoxicated person do not have a cause of action against a liquor permit holder or an employee of a liquor permit holder who sold beer or intoxicating liquor to the intoxicated person unless the injury, death, or loss to person or property occurred on the liquor permit holder\u2019s premises or in a parking lot under the control of the liquor permit holder and was proximately caused by the negligence of the liquor permit holder or an employee of the liquor permit holder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">We note that at least two appellate courts have construed the language of R.C. 4399.18 to prohibit a cause of action by an intoxicated patron. See <em>Fifer, supra, </em>76 Ohio App.3d at 299, 601 N.E.2d at 602 (\u201cR.C. 4399.18 only provides a cause of action to third parties for injuries caused by an intoxicated patron\u201d); <em>Gillum, supra, </em>110 Ohio App.3d at 64, 673 N.E.2d at 639-640 (R.C. 4399.18 inapplicable to action by intoxicated patron because the statute\u2019s language limits recovery to innocent third parties who are injured by dram shop\u2019s negligent sale of liquor). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Although we do not construe the language of R.C. 4399.18 as narrowly as those courts, we nevertheless conclude that the trial court in the instant case properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants based upon the court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">As noted by the court in <em>Gillum, </em>while it is possible that \u201cthe patron\u2019s own intoxication may not always be solely responsible for the injury,\u201d leaving open the possibility of \u201cmore than one proximate cause,\u201d the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Smith </em>considered this issue in light of Ohio\u2019s comparative negligence system and \u201crejected the idea on the same public policy grounds that decided the outcome of the entire case.\u201d <em>Gillum, supra, </em>110 Ohio App.3d at 67, 673 N.E.2d at 641. Specifically, the court in <em>Smith </em>held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">\u201cSome might suggest that this court permit a cause of action by the intoxicated patron and allow the court or jury to determine the comparative negligence of the permit holder and the intoxicated patron. While this alternative seems attractive, we decline such a course for several reasons. Basically, comparing the negligence of the parties in this context presents a classic \u2018chicken or egg\u2019 question: Is the permit holder who admittedly has experience in knowing the predilections and capacities of his or her customers more negligent or blameworthy than the intoxicated patron who is clever enough to mask his or her own intoxication in order to be served another drink[?] In any event, we find that one of the strongest reasons compelling rejection of such a cause of action by the intoxicated patron against the permit holder is one grounded firmly in commonsense public policy; namely, that an adult who is permitted to drink alcohol must be the one who is primarily responsible for his or her own behavior and resulting voluntary actions. Clearly, permitting the intoxicated patron a cause of action in this context would simply send the wrong message to all our citizens, because such a message would essentially state that a patron who has purchased alcoholic beverages from a permit holder may drink such alcohol with unbridled, unfettered impunity and with full knowledge that the permit holder will be ultimately responsible for any harm caused by the patron\u2019s intoxication. In our opinion, such a message should never be countenanced by this court.\u201d <em>Id., </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 291-292, 551 N.E.2d at 1298.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">As previously discussed, plaintiff has failed to cite any authority subsequent to <em>Smith </em>in which an adult intoxicated patron has recovered from a permit holder for injuries sustained for injuries resulting from the patron\u2019s own intoxication. Rather, courts have consistently held, based upon the policy considerations expressed in <em>Smith, </em>that a cause of action does not exist under such circumstances even though the theories of recovery have differed from the <em>Smith </em>case. In the present case, we agree with the trial court\u2019s determination that the holding in <em>Smith </em>was based upon broad public-policy considerations that are not limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>solely to actions brought pursuant to R.C. 4301.22(B). Further, under the facts of the instant case, we find that the trial court properly concluded, based upon the holding in <em>Smith, </em>that Ohio law and public policy do not provide a cause of action against a permit holder by an intoxicated patron or his estate for injuries sustained by the patron as a result of consuming alcohol. Thus, the trial court did not err in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. While the rationale of <em>Smith </em>compels our decision to affirm the trial court, we urge the Supreme Court to revisit this matter, as the alleged facts of this case suggest that under at least some circumstances, liquor permit holders should assume some responsibility for their conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Based upon the foregoing, plaintiffs single assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b193-7\">Peggy Bryant, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b193-8\">Tyack, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-11\">. Plaintiff does not, in his appeal, challenge the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Virginia A. Palermo. As noted under the facts, the trial court concluded that plaintiff's claim against Palermo was barred by the two-year statute of limitations of R.C. 2125.02(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b193-9\">Tyack, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AO\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">The facts before us indicate that Bruce Walker, Jr., was an alcoholic. He was known to be an alcoholic by employees of Capri Enterprises, Inc., especially Virginia Palermo. On the night Walker died, Palermo apparently gave him a bottle of Wild Turkey and allowed him to finish drinking himself to death. Her only precaution was to take his car keys away from him, so he would not attempt to drive in his drunken state.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">Walker drank until he passed out. Nobody apparently took much notice, leading me to believe that employees of Capri Enterprises, Inc., had seen Walker consume incredible amounts of alcohol before. He passed out long after the bar and bowling alley were supposed to have closed. He passed out long after the employees had to have known he was intoxicated. He passed out when only a handful of people were still present. Therefore, we are not addressing a situation where liability should be considered for a liquor license holder who had some excuse for not knowing that it was endangering a patron.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">The autopsy performed upon Bruce Walker, Jr., indicated that at the time he died, he had a blood-alcohol level of .39 grams percent. Given Walker\u2019s weight of two hundred fifty-two pounds, I conclude that he probably had consumed in excess of thirty drinks during the hours before his death. If the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>family members who saw him at 1:45 a.m. is to be believed, many of those drinks had to have been consumed after the bar was supposedly closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">This case does not present a situation where a person who drank too much is attempting to reap some sort of financial reward. The person who drank too much is dead. Instead, this case involves the question of whether or not the heirs of Bruce Walker, Jr., have some financial claim against the bar which recklessly provided him the means to kill himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">I personally believe that <em>Smith v. 10th Inning, Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 289, 551 N.E.2d 1296, was incorrectly decided. However, even if correctly decided, the <em>Smith </em>case should not be extended to provide protection in situations such as the one presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Human nature being what it is, there will always be some bar owners who are more concerned about making a profit than about looking out for the welfare of patrons \u2014 not to mention the welfare of innocent motorists or family members of alcoholics. There is much more profit to be made from serving an alcoholic dozens of drinks than there is to be made from honoring the letter and spirit of the law about when to stop serving alcohol. Some of this profit should go to the heirs of the Bruce Walker, Jrs. of Ohio and to increased premium rates for the insurance companies of Ohio once the fact is known that part of the financial risk from misconduct such as is presented here must be borne by those permit holders who flagrantly ignore their legal responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Needless to say, I would not affirm the summary judgment rendered by the trial court. Since a majority of this court does, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
