Williams, appeals the trial court's denial of his motion to withdraw his pleas of guilty to one count of armed robbery and one count of obscenity. Mr. Williams specifically contends that it was an abuse of the trial court's discretion to deny his request made prior to sentencing in light of his assertion that he did not fully understand the sentence that was agreed to as a part of the plea agreement. For the reasons that follow, finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm the trial\n   court's ruling and, accordingly, affirm Mr. Williams' convictions and sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 25, 2015, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney filed a bill of information charging Mr. Williams with one count of armed robbery, a violation of La. R.S. 14:64 (count one), and one count of obscenity, a violation of La. R.S. 14:106 (count two). At his arraignment on July 6, 2015, Mr. Williams entered pleas of not guilty to both counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 11, 2015, defense counsel filed a motion for a competency examination on the ground that Mr. Williams had previously been diagnosed and treated for mental illness. Thereafter, Mr. Williams was examined by experts, Dr. Rafael Salcedo, a forensic psychologist, and Dr. Richard Richoux, a forensic psychiatrist, for purposes of determining whether Mr. Williams suffered from any mental disorder affecting his competency to proceed to trial and to assist counsel in the preparation of his defense. A competency hearing was held on March 9, 2016. According to the experts' report entered into evidence at the hearing, Drs. Salcedo and Richoux determined that their examination failed to reveal evidence that Mr. Williams was manifesting any signs or symptoms of a psychiatric disorder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, despite \"significant substance abuse problems involving daily use of both marijuana and cocaine when ... not in institutional confinement,\" the experts opined that Mr. Williams fully understood the nature of the proceedings and the charges against him, and was capable of assisting his attorney in preparing his defense. Relying on the experts' findings outlined in their report, which included their assessment of Mr. Williams' \"serious drug addiction,\" the trial court found Mr. Williams competent to proceed to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Also on March 9, 2015, immediately following the competency hearing, defense counsel informed the court that she had shown to Mr. Williams all of the discovery, including various videos/audios, which the State intended to use against him at trial to support a conviction, and that Mr. Williams had been made \"completely aware of all of the State's evidence against him.\" Defense counsel further advised that, based on his two prior felony convictions, Mr. Williams had been determined to be a multiple felony offender and that, as such, he had been advised that his status as a \"triple bill\" would dramatically increase in his sentencing range and exposure at trial (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 66 to 198 years) if convicted on the charge of armed robbery (or any felony). Additionally, defense counsel stated Mr. Williams had been informed of the State's plea offer-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 35 years' imprisonment, with no multiple bill\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   -but that, despite her professional recommendation that accepting the plea was in his\n   best interest and that the \"35 years [was] a today offer,\" Mr. Williams had chosen to refuse the offer in favor of proceeding to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Because of Mr. Williams' refusal to accept the plea offer in favor of trial, defense counsel requested that the trial court conduct a\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   hearing, the trial judge explained to Mr. Williams that, if convicted of armed robbery, he would be a triple felony offender subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 66 years up to 198 years at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence. The trial judge further explained to Mr. Williams-and Mr. Williams stated that he understood-that if he agreed to plead guilty, the State would agree not to file a multiple offender bill against him and that, \"based upon [his] attorney's efforts on [his] behalf,\" the court would \"reluctantly\" agree to sentence him to only 35 years, which was a \"today only option,\" but that if he refused to plead guilty, \"all bets were off\" in terms of what sentence the court might give, which the trial court \"promise[d]\" would not \"be only 35 years after today.\" When asked by the court if he still wished to proceed to trial, Mr. Williams responded that he would \"take 35.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Williams then withdrew his former pleas of not guilty and entered pleas of guilty as charged on both counts for an agreed upon sentence of 35 years imprisonment in the Department of Corrections without benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence as to count one, and three years' imprisonment in the Department of Corrections as to count two, with the sentences to run concurrently. Thereafter, the trial court conducted a lenghthy plea colloquy with Mr. Williams, wherein he of his\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   rights,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   including his right to a jury trial or by judge alone, his right to the presumption of innocence, his right to confront his accusers and to call witnesses or present favorable evidence, his privilege against self-incrimination, and the right to appeal his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court also reviewed with Mr. Williams the possible sentencing ranges for an armed robbery conviction and an obscenity conviction. The trial court further confirmed with Mr. Williams that he understood that if the court were to accept his guilty pleas, he would be sentenced to\n   35 years at hard labor in the Department of Corrections without benefits on the armed robbery charge, and to three years at hard labor on the obscenity charge, with the sentences ordered to be run concurrently, and with credit for time served on both charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During the plea colloquy, when the trial court specifically inquired as to whether Mr. Williams was suffering from any type of physical or mental impairment that would affect his ability to enter into the plea agreement, Mr. Williams responded in the negative. Mr. Williams confirmed that he could read, write and understand the English language. In response to further inquiry by the trial court, Mr. Williams indicated that he was satisfied with his counsel's legal representation and that he had not been forced, threatened, or coerced in any way to accept the plea deal. The trial court established that Mr. Williams understood the timeline for appealing his sentence and/or applying for post-conviction relief, and that he understood his guilty plea could be used to enhance the penalty for any future felony conviction. The trial court confirmed with Mr. Williams that his attorney had reviewed the \"waiver of constitutional rights plea of guilty form\" with him, that he had initialed each of the provisions on the form, and that it was his signature on the form acknowledging that his rights had been explained to him and that he wished to waive those rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Throughout the plea colloquy, Mr. Williams indicated that he understood his rights, that he wished to waive his rights, and that he understood the consequences of his guilty plea, including the sentences that would be imposed in accordance with the plea agreement. Following this detailed exchange with Mr. Williams in open court, the trial court accepted Mr. Williams' guilty pleas as having been knowingly, intelligently, freely and voluntarily made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 14, 2016, Mr. Williams appeared for sentencing, at which time he made an oral motion to withdraw his guilty pleas on the grounds that he was under duress at the time he accepted the plea offer, and that he \"did not truly comprehend and understand\" the sentence that was agreed to as a part of the plea. When questioned by the trial court regarding what specific aspect of his plea was causing him confusion, Mr. Williams replied that he wanted to \"take [his] plea back\" because, \"at the time [he] couldn't really read\" the \"paper that [he] was signing for [his] sentence,\" and \"didn't really understand what [he] was signing.\" Asserting no specific basis for his inability to read or comprehend, and despite the affirmative answers he provided in response to the trial court's prior questioning during the\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   colloquy, Mr. Williams stated that he did not understand any aspect of the plea agreement, in particular, the sentence that he would receive as a result of the plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The following discussion then took place between the trial judge and Mr. Williams:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   What is your understanding what will happen if the Court allows you to withdraw your guilty plea?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE DEFENDANT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   By losing trial, I would get the max that I supposed to have, the sentence I supposed to have and you would take back what you offered me the first time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   You know that you are a multiple offender, correct, you have felony convictions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE DEFENDANT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   That if you are convicted at trial [it] would be held against you to enhance your sentence to [sic] essentially you would be looking at the rest of your life in prison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   THE DEFENDANT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   And the sentence that I have indicated to you at the time of your plea that I would give to you was 35 years of hard labor with[out] benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE DEFENDANT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   How long would I have to do that before I would be eligible for parole?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   My job, as I told you, would be to sentence you to 35 years at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence and then any type of good time or any other calculation is not made by the Court. That is something that is up to the Department of Corrections.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   MS. BOURG:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   And Your Honor, just for the record, Mr. Williams asked me the same question. I told him that we do not make good time calculations, it is up to the Department of Corrections. I also told him it is my belief that I would tell him it is my understanding he will do 85 percent because it is a crime of violence. But I did explain we don't make good time calculations or guarantees. It is pleading to 35 and time less than that would be up to them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Mr. Williams, you were born what year?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   THE DEFENDANT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   '88.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   You are 27 years old and again under the plea that you entered previous in this case back on March the 9\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , this Court indicated to you that it would sentence you to 35 years and were this Court were [sic] to allow you to withdraw that plea, you would be looking at potentially life in prison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE DEFENDANT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The trial court then denied Mr. Williams' request to withdraw his guilty pleas. In so ruling, the trial judge acknowledged that even though prior to taking the plea Mr. Williams had expressed some reservations, a full\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   colloquy had taken place and, in his estimation, Mr. Williams understood the plea form, as well as the implications of his guilty plea. The trial judge further explained that if allowed to withdraw the pleas and proceed to trial and found guilty on the felony charge, Mr. Williams would be exposing himself to a virtual life sentence, but that under the plea agreement, he would be sentenced to 35 years imprisonment. Following its denial of Mr. Williams' request to withdraw his plea, the trial court sentenced him to 35 years in the Department of Corrections in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Mr. Williams subsequently filed an application for post-conviction relief on November 20, 2017 seeking an out-of-time appeal. On November 29, 2017, the trial court granted Mr. William's request for an out-of-time appeal and dismissed his application for post-conviction relief, without prejudice. The instant appealed followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In his sole assignment of error, Mr. Williams contends that, based on his assertion that he did not fully understand the sentence that was agreed to as a part of the plea agreement, it was an abuse of the trial court's discretion to deny his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. Mr. Williams'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   competency to proceed to trial was placed at issue early on in these proceedings as evidenced by his prior motion for a competency examination, which he argues demonstrates his inability to understand the sentences or the consequences of his guilty pleas. For the following reasons, based upon our review of the record and the transcript of the hearings, finding no abuse of discretion, we find no error in the trial court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   A defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    State v.

A guilty plea is constitutionally infirm if it is not entered freely and voluntarily, if the\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   colloquy is inadequate, or when a defendant is induced to enter the plea by a plea bargain or what he justifiably believes was a plea bargain and that bargain is not kept.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Specifically, we find that the record on appeal fully supports the trial court's factual determination that Mr. Williams voluntarily entered his guilty pleas with a full understanding of the consequences. Mr. Williams does not allege that the trial court failed to advise him of his constitutional rights, nor does he allege that he was coerced in any way to enter his plea. Rather, Mr. Williams alleges that based solely on his statements to the trial court that he did not understand the sentence or the implications of his guilty plea, which he contends was supported by the fact that he had previously filed a motion for a competency examination, the trial court should have allowed him to withdraw his guilty plea. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The record shows that Mr. Williams' competency hearing-wherein he was found competent to proceed to trial-was held on the same day that the trial court, after having engaged in a lengthy plea colloquy with Mr. Williams advising him of his rights, his sentencing exposure, and after having been convinced that he fully understood the nature of the charges against him and the sentences to be imposed in accordance with the plea agreement, accepted Mr. Williams' guilty plea to the charged offenses as being freely and voluntarily made. We find no evidence in the record, other than his bald assertions to the contrary, that would lead us to conclude that Mr. Williams, who had been found competent to proceed to trial only moments before, did not maintain his competency at the time he entered his guilty pleas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Our review of the jurisprudence further supports our conclusion.

Further, we noted that the defendant had the opportunity during the plea colloquy to inform the trial court that he did not understand the proceedings against him, but failed to do so, and neither the trial court nor counsel, who observed the defendant at the time of his guilty plea, found any reason to question his ability to follow the court proceedings.

After reviewing the record, we find that at the time Mr. Williams entered his guilty pleas-as did the trial courts in both\n   <em>\n    Tranchant\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Romious\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , where the defendants had previously participated in competency hearings and were deemed competent to proceed-the trial court specifically addressed whether any type of mental impairment existed that would affect his capacity to proceed and only after confirming with Mr. Williams that none did, agreed to accept his guilty pleas.

On appeal, this Court rejected the defendant's argument because the record revealed that the defendant had been fully informed of his rights and the consequences of his guilty plea. In particular, the record confirmed that the trial court had engaged the defendant in a lengthy plea colloquy wherein he had been specifically advised of his possible sentencing exposure if he proceeded to trial and was convicted, and that, as a fourth felony offender, he was facing potential life imprisonment. The trial court further explained that upon its acceptance of his guilty plea, the defendant would be sentenced to 20 years at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence and that the State would agree not to file a multiple offender bill against him. The record further confirmed that the defendant indicated that he understood his sentencing exposure if he proceeded to trial, as well as the actual sentence that would be imposed, and that he believed that the plea agreement was in his best interest. Having determined on the record that the defendant's guilty plea was freely and voluntarily made, and that the defendant was adequately advised of his\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   rights, we affirmed the trial court's ruling refusing to allow the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86-87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This Court also affirmed the trial court's denial of the defendant's motion to withdraw her guilty plea prior to sentencing in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The record reflects that Mr. Williams underwent a competency evaluation wherein it was determined that, although he had a history of substance abuse, he fully understood the nature of the proceedings and the charges against him. Once found competent to proceed to trial, the record shows that the trial court conducted a\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   hearing, wherein it was established that Mr. Williams' counsel had made him aware of all of the State's evidence against him, including various audios/videos, and had advised him of the State's plea offer, which, in her professional judgment, was in his best interest. The trial court advised Mr. Williams of his status as a multiple felony offender and that, as such, if convicted at a trial, he would face an enhanced sentencing range of 66 to 198 years imprisonment-a virtual life sentence-without benefits, but that if he pled guilty \"today,\" the State would agree not to file a multiple bill of information against him and the court would agree to impose a sentence of 35 years. When asked if he understood and wanted to proceed to trial, Mr. Williams advised the court that he did understand and that he did not want to go to trial, but would, instead, \"take the 35.\" The record further shows that, prior to accepting Mr. Williams' guilty pleas, the trial court personally addressed Mr. Williams and conducted a lengthy\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   colloquy with him during which Mr. Williams was advised of his constitutional rights, denied that he was being forced or coerced to enter his guilty pleas, and confirmed that he was satisfied with his counsel's representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Further, we find the record belies Mr. Williams' contention that he had difficulty reading and understanding the guilty plea form and that his plea was made without a full understanding of the sentence that was agreed to as part of the plea agreement. The court appointed forensic experts both agreed that, despite his history of substance abuse, Mr. Williams was able to understand the proceedings and charges imposed against him. Moreover, when specifically asked by the trial court whether he was suffering from any type of physical or mental impairment that would affect his ability to enter into the guilty plea, Mr. Williams responded in the negative. When asked whether he was able to read and understand the English language, Mr. Williams responded affirmatively. The record reflects that the trial court specifically explained to Mr. Williams the sentencing ranges for a conviction of armed robbery and a conviction of obscenity, and that his pleading guilty to a felony charge exposed him to greater penalties as a habitual offender if found guilty of a felony in the future. The record confirms that Mr. Williams indicated he understood that if the court were to accept his guilty pleas, the judge intended to sentence him to 35 years imprisonment in the Department of Corrections, with credit for time served on both counts, without benefits. Mr. Williams confirmed that his counsel had explained the guilty plea form to him and that the initials and signature on the form were his own. Additionally, the guilty plea form, signed by both Mr. Williams and his counsel, specifically set forth that upon acceptance of his guilty plea, Mr. Williams' sentence would be 35 years imprisonment without benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence. At no time during the lengthy plea colloquy did Mr. Williams inquire of the court regarding whether he would be eligible for \"good time served\" if he pled guilty. This question was first raised at the commencement of the sentencing hearing when Mr. Williams requested to withdraw his guilty plea. As set forth hereinabove, the record reflects that at that time, the trial judge again personally addressed Mr. Williams in an attempt to ascertain whether, in fact, Mr. Williams truly did not understand the plea agreement, and explained to him that, at 27 years old, given his sentencing exposure if found guilty at trial, the plea agreement was in his best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We find the record clearly establishes that Mr. Williams was advised of-and that he understood-the sentences that would be imposed by the trial court upon acceptance of his guilty pleas. While Mr. Williams may now be dissatisfied with his sentences, this does not provide a basis for the withdrawal of his guilty pleas.\n   <em>\n    State v.
