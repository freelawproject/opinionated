For the following reasons, we affirm Defendant's convictions. As to the sentences ordered on each of the six counts, we affirm the term of the sentences imposed, vacate the requirement that each sentence is to be served consecutively, amend the sentences to order that all sentences are to be served concurrently, amend the sentence on count one to delete the parole restriction; and, as amended, we affirm the sentences on each count. Additionally, we remand the matter with instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 1, 2015, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney filed a bill of information charging Defendant with one count of possession with intent to distribute heroin, in violation of La. R.S. 40:966(A) (count one), four counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of La. R.S. 14:95.1 (counts two, three, five, and six), and one count of possession of oxycodone, in violation of La. R.S. 40:967(C) (count four).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The six separate counts for which Defendant was charged all arose out of a single search warrant executed on March 19, 2015 at defendant's residence located at 1602 Clearview Parkway, Apartment A, in Metairie, Louisiana during which law enforcement seized a significant amount of heroin packaged for sale, drug paraphernalia, multiple cell phones, a large amount of cash, and four guns. Defendant pleaded not guilty to the counts at his arraignment on May 19, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 15, 2015, Defendant's motions to suppress statement and evidence were denied by the trial court. Trial commenced before a twelve-person jury on January 18, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At trial, Gregory Morrow, a recovering heroin addict, testified that in 2014 he was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) as a confidential informant. While working with the FBI, Morrow purchased heroin from Julius Hankton-Defendant-known to him as \"Ju,\" on November 7, 19, and December 5, 2014, in quantities of one-half to one gram for which he would pay approximately $50 to $100. Morrow testified that he would call Defendant to set up the drug transaction and that his phone conversations were recorded by the FBI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He explained that prior to meeting Defendant, he would be searched to verify that he did not have any drugs in his possession before receiving the money from law enforcement to purchase the drugs and would then engage in the hand-to-hand drug transaction with Defendant while under surveillance of law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A video of the November 7, 2014 drug transaction between Defendant and Morrow was played for the jury. On the video, a vehicle driven by Defendant is shown pulling up to Morrow's vehicle where the\n   passenger of Defendant's vehicle then hands Morrow a gram of heroin in exchange for $100. A second purchase made by Morrow on November 19, 2014, from Defendant was for half a gram of heroin and was also recorded on video; however, Morrow testified that the video did not capture Defendant, who had given him the heroin and was out of sight of the surveillance camera. Also, on December 5, 2014, Morrow made a third purchase of heroin from Defendant near the Brother Martin football field, which was not captured on video because he was instructed by Defendant to exit his vehicle and enter Defendant's vehicle where Defendant sold him the heroin out of sight from the surveillance camera positioned in Morrow's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Stacey Taranto of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office testified that in 2014 and 2015 she was a member of the narcotics unit working as a Task Force Officer with the FBI. Officer Taranto testified that the task force she participated in was a multi-jurisdictional unit comprised of members of local law enforcement and FBI agents in the greater New Orleans area who conducted narcotics investigations. She further explained that she conducted surveillance of the controlled buys testified to by Morrow and that, in March of 2015, she participated in the execution of a search warrant at Defendant's residence: 1602 Clearview Parkway, Apartment A, in Metairie, Louisiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Officer Taranto testified that during the November 19, 2014 controlled buy, she observed a silver BMW pull into the meeting location set up between Defendant and Morrow, where she observed a black male wearing a black sweatshirt with the letters \"O-B-E-Y\" written on it, exit the vehicle he was driving and conduct a hand-to-hand drug transaction with Morrow. She further explained that during her surveillance of the drug transactions conducted on November 19, 2014 and December 5, 2014, she was able to obtain the license plate numbers from the vehicles driven by Defendant and discovered that the vehicle used in November was registered to a female by the name of Jasmine Chaney-Defendant's girlfriend-who resided at 1602 Clearview Parkway, Apartment A, in Metairie, Louisiana, and the vehicle used in December 2014 was a rental car which had been rented under the name Jasmine Chaney. Officer Taranto testified that she performed a traffic stop of the vehicle following the December 5, 2014 drug transaction and confirmed Defendant as the driver of the vehicle. A search of the vehicle driven by Defendant revealed a black sweatshirt with the letters \"O-B-E-Y\" written on the front, a cell phone,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and two small bags of heroin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Special Agent Christopher Bauer of the New Orleans Division of the FBI and member of the Violent Crimes Task Force participated in the controlled buy on November 19, 2014, during which he observed a silver BMW pull into the parking lot at the meeting location alongside Morrow's vehicle. He then observed a black male wearing a sweatshirt with the letters \"O-B-E-Y\" written across the front exit the BMW and interact with Morrow. Special Agent Bauer also confirmed his participation in the stop of the vehicle Defendant was driving after the December 2014 controlled buy. Special Agent Bauer indicated that Defendant was arrested at the time of the stop but was subsequently released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Special Agent Bauer testified that subsequent to Defendant's release, a warrant was obtained for the search of Defendant's apartment. During the execution of the search warrant, Defendant was detained,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a search of his pants\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   revealed 26 small plastic baggies containing heroin and eight pills that tested positive for oxycodone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, a Glock 17 pistol, Glock 29, Glock 21, an AK-47 rifle, ammunition, multiple cell phones, a scale, and over $20,000 in cash were seized during the search of the master bedroom in which Defendant's pants were located. Upon discovery of the evidence, Defendant admitted his ownership of \"all the stuff in the house.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   FBI Special Agent Crystal Bender, also of the New Orleans Violent Crimes Task Force, likewise testified regarding the various monitored phone conversations between Morrow and Defendant during which the narcotics transactions were arranged, as well as the monitored video recordings of the controlled buys that took place. Agent Bender explained that surveillance of the Clearview apartment was also conducted during which Defendant was seen entering and exiting the residence. At one time, Defendant was seen exiting the apartment, approaching the driver of a white sedan, leaning inside the vehicle, and retreating back into the apartment after a couple of seconds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Agent Bender further testified regarding a controlled buy between Defendant and an unnamed confidential informant on May 8, 2014, which was recorded on video surveillance and played for the jury. Agent Bender identified Defendant from the video and confirmed that in exchange for $100, the confidential informant received .31 grams of heroin. She explained that the quantity received was less than the amount paid. A recorded phone conversation between Defendant and the confidential informant was played during which Defendant explained that the reason it was \"short\" was because it was \"bricked up,\" meaning it had been cut off of a \"solid piece.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Sergeant Joshua Collins, an expert in the field of quantity, packaging, pricing, and distribution of narcotics, testified that the 26 bags of heroin individually packaged within a larger plastic bag weighing approximately 21 grams, the $20,000, and the scale all found in Defendant's apartment are indicative of street-level distribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   David Cox, an expert in forensic analysis and identification of DNA, testified that a DNA sample was obtained from one of the firearms-the AK-47 rifle-found in Defendant's apartment which was consistent with being a mixture of DNA from two individuals, for which Defendant was excluded as a contributor. However, Mr. Cox testified that the findings of the testing did not necessarily indicate Defendant had never handled the AK-47, just that his DNA was not contained on the swab collected from the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A stipulation was accepted by the parties that Sergeant Joel O'Lear, an expert\n   in fingerprint examination and comparison, if called, would testify that he compared State's Exhibit 1-the latent fingerprint card of Defendant-to State's Exhibits 2 and 3-certified conviction packets for Defendant-and concluded that Defendant's fingerprints matched those contained on the certified conviction packets, establishing the prior felonies as alleged in counts two, three, five, and six.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the conclusion of the trial, the following day, the jury found Defendant guilty as charged. Prior to sentencing Defendant on March 13, 2017, the trial court denied Defendant's oral motion for new trial. After a waiver of delays, the trial court sentenced Defendant on count one, to 50 years imprisonment at hard labor, with the first ten years to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence; on each of counts two, three, five, and six, to 20 years imprisonment at hard labor to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence; and on count four, to two years imprisonment at hard labor. The trial court further ordered Defendant's sentences on all counts to be served consecutively to each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On July 19, 2017, Defendant filed a motion for out-of-time appeal, which was granted by the trial court on July 24, 2017. The instant appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, Defendant alleges 1) the trial court improperly impinged upon his right of confrontation, and 2) the trial court imposed an unconstitutionally excessive sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Right of confrontation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In his first assignment of error, Defendant argues that because his primary accuser was a named cooperating informant, the trial court committed reversible error when it prohibited him from directly confronting and cross-examining Morrow-the informant-regarding the full scope of bias and inducement under which his testimony was offered to the jury. Thus, given the importance of the informant's testimony, Defendant maintains that the error was not harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The State asserts that Defendant has failed to preserve this issue for appeal. Nevertheless, the State maintains Defendant was fully able to cross-examine Morrow on issues related to his credibility absent a few questions to which objections were properly sustained. Regardless, the State contends any alleged error claimed by Defendant would be harmless in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused in a criminal prosecution the right to confront the witnesses against him. The Confrontation Clause of the Louisiana Constitution specifically and expressly guarantees the accused the right \"to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him.\" La. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 16 ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, given the importance of Morrow to the State's case, Defendant asserts the trial court erred in precluding him from cross-examining Morrow regarding the payments he received from law enforcement for his participation as an informant and the extent of the uncharged criminal wrongdoing offered to him in exchange for his cooperation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Specifically, Defendant sets forth two instances during his cross-examination of Morrow where the trial court allegedly impinged on his Sixth Amendment right. The first is the following exchange during which he was allegedly precluded from questioning Morrow regarding other narcotics transactions he had previously engaged in-other than those in this case-and which law enforcement elected to \"look the other way[:]\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   DEFENSE: So - and by the way, not only were you not arrested for selling heroin, but you were paid money; right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   MORROW: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   DEFENSE: So the Government pays you - how much money did they pay you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   MORROW: Um, two or three hundred dollars a time; something like that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   DEFENSE: I'm in the wrong business. So every time you go and do something for them, you get paid two hundred dollars; and you can buy and use heroin, and sell heroin, and never worry about being arrested by them; right? Have you been arrested by them for any of your drug selling or using since this all began?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   MORROW: No, because nothing was around them?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   DEFENSE: What do you mean \"nothing was around them\"?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   MORROW: I said nothing I did was around them, so they didn't have any direct knowledge or any direct link to me using.

He maintains that Morrow was a critical witness against him; and without Morrow, there would have been \"a much less compelling case of guilt.\" Defendant comes to the conclusion that the trial court's restrictive rulings concerning additional unrelated narcotics transactions with individuals other than Defendant and the money received for those dealings were not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In order to preserve an issue for appellate review, a party must state an objection contemporaneously with the occurrence of the alleged error, as well as the grounds for the objection.

He argues that with the exception of his two-year sentence imposed on count four (possession of oxycodone), he received the maximum available sentences on all other counts, which were then ordered by the trial court to be served consecutively for a total of 132 years-a virtual life sentence-constituting a needless and purposeless infliction of pain and suffering. Defendant avers that his consecutive sentences result in a plainly unconstitutionally excessive sentence.

Second, Defendant had eight oxycodone pills, 26 baggies of heroin, a scale, four firearms, and over $20,000 in cash in his apartment in which his girlfriend and their four-year-old child were present.

The Louisiana Supreme Court has found generally in considering laws that make it illegal to possess a firearm while also possessing a controlled dangerous substance, \"there is\n   a rational relationship between the statute's scope, i.e., making it a felony for a person to possess a firearm in connection with a drug offense, even a misdemeanor drug offense, and its legitimate state purpose of preventing drug-related violence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

This statute was enacted not solely for the protection of police officers, as Defendant contends, but also for the protection of the general public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Further, the evidence at trial established that Defendant had an ongoing drug distribution business involving the sale of heroin for a profit, in quantities inconsistent with personal use. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   , 16-600 (La.

This Court found that the nature of the defendant's crime warranted the sentence of 20 years, noting that although the defendant was convicted of simple possession, the facts of the case and the defendant's history suggested his involvement in heroin distribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Also, Defendant's possession of four loaded guns while in possession of a significant quantity of heroin could have conceivably led to a violent outcome or injury to members of the public; thereby, rendering the nature of the single offense of La. R.S. 40:966(A) not inconsequential for sentencing purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Accordingly, the record amply justifies the sentences imposed by the trial court and the individual sentences are not grossly disproportionate to the offenses or impose needless and purposeless pain and suffering. Considering that Defendant's conduct constituted a threat to public safety, his prior criminal record for drug-related activity and violence, and the fact that the trial court was of the opinion that there was an undue risk that Defendant would commit another crime and is in need of correctional treatment, we find the individual sentences imposed do not shock this Court's sense of justice and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a 50-year sentence on count one and 20-year sentences on each of counts two, three, five, and six. However, we note there is an issue with the consecutive nature imposed on Defendant's sentences.

The defendant had several arrests and convictions as an adult for drug-related offenses and sold drugs on three occasions to an undercover officer within a five-week period. Although the supreme court found that none of the sentences were individually excessive, under the circumstances of that case, it found the sentences to be excessive in that they were ordered to be served consecutively\n   and ordered the sentences to be served concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   While the trial court may certainly consider the full context of the current charges, as well as many other factors in sentencing a defendant, it nevertheless is important to focus upon the facts of that particular record in first rendering the sentence and then upon review for constitutional excessiveness. In light of the record before us and the jurisprudence outlined above, we find the consecutive nature of Defendant's sentence, essentially exposing him to a total of 132 years of incarceration, shocks our sense of justice and is grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime. Moreover, it imposes an undue burden on the taxpayers of the state, who must feed, house, and clothe Defendant for potentially the rest of his natural life. As this 25-year-old man ages, these costs will only increase due to the need for geriatric health treatments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Bruce\n   </em>\n   , 11-991 (La.

The crimes with which Defendant was charged carry mandatory minimum sentences, indicating that the Legislature is deeply concerned with both heroin trafficking and guns in the hands of convicted felons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the amount of heroin seized, during execution of the search warrant, as well as the nature of its packaging, the accouterments of trafficking, and the four weapons seized, all indicate that Defendant was a serious drug dealer. The ongoing nature of Defendant's activities is further evidenced by the four separate predicating buys surveilled by law enforcement. A lengthy period of incarceration is justified and well within the trial court's broad sentencing discretion. Separation of Defendant from society for a significant period of time assures the community of safety from both his trafficking of a deadly drug and from his use of the four firearms found in his possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   With these factors in mind, while sentencing Defendant to the maximum term for five of the six charged offenses does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, ordering that the sentences be served consecutively for a full 132-year term does.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record contains scant evidence to support a finding that this case involved the most serious violation of the offenses and the worst type of offender. Maintaining each sentence rendered on the six counts for which Defendant was convicted, while vacating the consecutive nature of the six terms and ordering the six\n   sentences to be served concurrently, does not shock our sense of justice nor do we find it unconstitutionally excessive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   By removing the consecutive nature of the terms, we find the sentences imposed are supported by the jurisprudence, meet all of the societal goals of incarceration for Defendant without imposing an undue financial burden on the state, are more proportionate to the crimes committed in the instant case, and will eliminate the \"purposeful imposition of pain and suffering\" element that is prohibited by the federal and state constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Accordingly, we affirm Defendant's convictions on all six counts. Because the sentences imposed for Defendant's convictions all arose out of the same search warrant executed at the Defendant's Metairie residence, and were based on the same transaction or single course of conduct creating a presumption in favor of concurrent sentences under La. C.Cr.P. art. 883, we find that the aggregate of the sentences is unconstitutionally excessive and must be amended to provide that Defendant's sentences are to be served concurrently rather than consecutively. Therefore, we affirm in part, vacate in part, and amend in part the sentences imposed upon Defendant for the convictions on each of the six counts. Specifically, we affirm the term of the sentences imposed on each count, vacate the consecutive nature of the sentences, and amend the sentences to include an order that the sentences on each count are to be served concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    Errors Patent Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The record was reviewed for errors patent, according to La.

La. R.S. 40:966(B)(4)(a) provides that the penalty for this offense is \"imprisonment at hard labor for not less than ten years nor more than fifty years, at least ten of which shall be served without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence.\" In the present case, the trial court sentenced Defendant to 50 years imprisonment at hard labor with the first ten years to be served without benefit of probation,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     parole\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , or suspension of sentence. The statute does not provide for the prohibition of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   La.

Moreover, when a sentencing error involves the imposition of restrictions beyond what the legislature has authorized in the sentencing statute, the Louisiana Supreme Court has ruled that the Courts of Appeal \"should not rely on La.

C.Cr.P. art. 882 to correct an illegal sentence 'at any time.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    State v.
