Following the denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence and statements, he entered into the guilty plea on May 18, 2017, under the provisions of\n   <em>\n    State v. Crosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9676631\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/338/584/\">\n    338 So.2d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1976), reserving his right to appeal the adverse ruling on the motion to suppress. For the following reasons, we reverse the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress and enter an order denying the motion to suppress evidence and statements. We vacate defendant's conviction and sentence and remand the matter to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant, Juan Salinas, was arrested on February 1, 2015, along with defendant, Lance Cowans. On March 12, 2015, the St. Charles Parish District Attorney filed a bill of information charging defendant with possession with intent to distribute marijuana in violation of La. R.S. 40:966(A)(2). On April 7, 2015, defendant was arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty. On February 18, 2016, defendant filed motions to suppress evidence and statements. The State filed an opposition on July 29, 2016. On June 7, 2016, the trial court heard the motion to suppress and took the matter under advisement. The parties filed additional briefing and on September 7, 2016, the trial court denied the motion to suppress evidence and statements without reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 18, 2017, defendant withdrew his plea of not guilty and pleaded guilty as charged pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State v. Crosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . In accordance with the plea agreement, the trial court sentenced defendant to five years imprisonment with the Department of Corrections. The sentence was deferred under La. C.Cr.P. art. 893, and defendant was placed on five years of active probation. At the conclusion of sentencing, defendant orally moved for an appeal of the denial of the motion to suppress, which was granted pursuant to the court minutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 30, 2017, defendant filed a written notice of appeal indicating he sought to appeal the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress, but he did not include an order for the trial court's signature. On July 19, 2017, defendant filed a second written notice of appeal with an order, which was granted on August 1, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Because there was no trial, all facts were elicited at the hearing on the motions to suppress evidence and statements, which took place on June 7, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the June 7, 2016 suppression hearing, Agent Christopher Kenny and Agent George Carcabasis with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") testified that, in late 2014, they were investigating a suspect, Ricardo Hernandez, alleged to be involved in drug trafficking between the Houston and the Greater New Orleans area. As part of this investigation, Agent Kenny used a reliable confidential informant (\"CI\") and, in October 2014, he monitored the CI's meeting with Hernandez and two unknown individuals in the parking lot of an Applebee's Restaurant in Kenner, Louisiana. The CI and other individuals discussed the purchase of a large quantity of cocaine to be\n   delivered from Houston to a \"stash house\" near Baton Rouge. During the meeting, the original suspect indicated that defendant, one of the unknown individuals present at the time, was \"the main guy in charge,\" and that his relatives owned the drugs. The original suspect also indicated defendant was present to make sure everything ran smoothly. Hernandez and the other individuals wanted the CI to show or provide them with money before they would deliver the drugs. This did not occur and the agents did not see any drugs or money exchanged during the meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The agents similarly testified that following the meeting, they maintained surveillance of the vehicle, a blue Ford F-150 truck with a Texas license plate, containing Hernandez and the two other unknown individuals. Agent Kenny ran the license plate and learned that the vehicle was registered to defendant. Officers observed the vehicle go to 836 Fox Lane, a residence in St. Rose in St. Charles Parish, later determined to be the home of defendant, Lance Cowans, who was arrested with defendant. The residence was located on a dead-end street in an area where mostly families lived. The suspects stayed at the residence for only 15 to 20 minutes. Next, they drove to a parking lot at a nearby restaurant and sat in the truck for approximately an hour. Agents then observed the truck return to Fox Lane for 15 minutes. An undercover agent observed flashlights around the residence and shed area behind the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Agent Kenny testified that the Fox Lane residence was previously unknown to them, but after their surveillance they suspected it was a stash house for drugs. The truck and the men then drove away on I-10 heading west. Agents maintained surveillance on the truck in order to determine whether the suspects would stop at a stash house in Baton Rouge. When the truck passed the Baton Rouge area, they requested that a local police unit stop the truck in West Baton Rouge Parish in order to identify the occupants. During the stop, agents learned defendant's identity. No one was arrested, the vehicle was not searched, and the agents ceased surveillance. Because they believed the truck may be used for drug trafficking in the future, agents entered the truck's license plate number into the Louisiana license plate camera recognition system maintained by the Louisiana State Police. The system would alert the agents if the truck returned to Louisiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Several months later, on February 1, 2015, the agents received an email alert indicating the truck was travelling eastbound on I-10 near Lake Charles. Agent Kenny testified that they assumed the truck would return to Fox Lane as this was the only previous place they saw the truck visit. He and Agent Carcabasis attempted to locate the truck on the interstate, but they were unsuccessful. Agent Carcabasis contacted the St. Charles Parish Sheriff's Office (\"SCPSO\") for assistance. They provided the vehicle's description and license plate information. They also informed the SCPSO that the truck was possibly a \"load vehicle\" (one used to transport narcotics) and that, based on prior surveillance, it might be headed to Fox Lane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Sergeant Paul Walker of the SCPSO was on patrol when he observed the truck and its driver near Fox Lane at a Brother's Food Mart. Sgt. Walker then alerted the other units that he saw the vehicle drive down Fox Lane. The DEA agents met with Detective Allan Tabora of the SCPSO, as well as other SCPSO officers, in an empty parking lot near the intersection of Fox Lane and Airline Highway. As the group discussed their next move, several officers observed the truck disregard\n   a stop sign at the intersection of Airline Highway and Fox Lane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Detective Tabora and Detective Danny April with the SCPSO performed a traffic stop. Agents Kenny and Carcabasis spoke with defendant. Agent Kenny testified that defendant related that he travelled from Houston, stopped to eat at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in Baton Rouge, visited his friend on Fox Lane for about 15 to 20 minutes, and was headed back to Houston. Agent Kenny thought that it was odd that someone would drive for hours to see a friend and stay for only 15-20 minutes. He also testified that he noticed defendant's hands were shaking and very dirty. Defendant explained that his front tire was \"messing up\" and he had to fix it. Agent Kenny testified that he observed the tire and it appeared to be fine. Agent Kenny described defendant's demeanor as \"very nervous.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Detective Tabora also spoke with defendant and testified that he was nervous and stuttering. He asked defendant when he arrived in St. Rose and defendant responded noon; however, Detective Tabora noted that it was only 11:45 a.m. when they made the traffic stop. Defendant provided his license, insurance, and proof of registration, and eventually, he was asked to step out of the truck. Detective Tabora testified that six law enforcement officers were present at the traffic stop, including four SPCSO officers and two DEA agents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Detective Tabora testified that, based on the information provided by the DEA agents, as well as defendant's nervous behavior and statements regarding his travel itinerary, he requested a canine to perform an open-air sniff of the truck.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Detective Tabora testified that defendant then provided consent to search the truck. During the search, the agents and officer located several items, which they explained were commonly used to attempt to conceal the odor of illegal drugs. They located an excessive amount of fabric softener sheets in the center console, in a pocket behind the front seat and in the back seat. They also found coffee grinds throughout the truck and fish remains in the bed of the truck. They did not find any illegal drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   According to Detective Tabora, several officers relocated to the Fox Lane residence during the traffic stop to further investigate. Based on the items found in the truck during the traffic stop, as well as defendant's statements and demeanor, defendant was detained in handcuffs and placed in the back of a unit pending the outcome of the investigation at Fox Lane. Detective Tabora testified that defendant was advised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   warnings at some point either on Airline Highway or shortly thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Meanwhile, after receiving a briefing of the ongoing events at the scene of the traffic stop, Lieutenant Marlon Shuff and Sergeant Bradley Walsh with the SCPSO went to 836 Fox Lane, along with other detectives and patrol officers in their division, to continue the investigation by conducting a \"knock and talk\" at the residence. Lt. Shuff knocked on the door of the residence, but no one answered. A short time later, Cowans exited the residence located next door and identified himself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lt. Shuff recalled that he could immediately tell Cowans was nervous and he asked him if they could go inside the residence, but Cowans declined, stating they\n   could talk in the front yard. Lt. Shuff testified that he and Cowans were located in an area between Cowan's house and the neighboring property, and the two houses were very close to one another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Sgt. Bradley Walsh, with the SCPSO special investigations division, testified that he also left the traffic scene to go to Fox Lane and attempt contact with the homeowner. Sgt. Walsh witnessed another officer knock at the door, but no one answered. At that point, he saw Cowans come out of the neighbor's residence next door, where Lt. Shuff made contact with him. Sgt. Walsh started walking towards them. As he got closer to them, he could see between the two residences and saw what appeared to be a garage behind Cowans' house. He continued to walk towards the backyard of the residence and saw the structure had multiple bays with roll-up doors, which were open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Sgt. Walsh explained that he went to the back structure to do a protective sweep to make sure no one else was in the area behind the residence. He agreed on cross-examination that he had no information anyone else was at the residence as defendant told the officers he was the only one at the residence. Sgt. Walsh testified that in any type of investigation, it was common practice to do a protective sweep of the area for officer safety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He agreed that Cowans did not give him permission to do the sweep of his backyard, nor did he ask. Sgt. Walsh agreed he had no reason to believe a dangerous person might be present and officers did not have probable cause to obtain a search warrant for the Fox Lane residence at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As Sgt. Walsh approached one of the open garages, he noticed a tire sitting upright two to three feet inside of the entrance to the garage. He could see that a section of the tire had been cut out. He could also see a \"sawzall\" lying next to the tire, as well as freshly cut rubber from the tire. He testified that, as he stood outside the garage, he could see the \"gleanings of vegetable matter\" throughout the inside of the tire. On cross-examination, he admitted that he first saw discolored matter inside the tire and had to enter the garage in order to determine that it looked like marijuana. He returned to the front yard to advise Lt. Shuff regarding what he observed in the garage. Lt. Shuff went into the backyard and into the garage and, upon close inspection of the tire, observed a small amount of green vegetable matter, which field tested positive for marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sgt. Walsh helped take photographs of the premises that day, which he identified in court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   He agreed that the marijuana gleanings he saw inside the tire were not depicted in the photographs. The garage structure in the photographs had a concrete floor that did not extend or connect to a driveway outside of the structure. The driveway in the front of the house led into an enclosed carport. The garage in the back of the property was not visible from the front door or the driveway in the front of the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Lt. Shuff testified that, based on the information received from the DEA, the traffic stop and the discovery of the tire containing the green vegetable matter, they approached Cowans and told him they were securing his residence in order to obtain a search warrant. Cowans cooperated and after unlocking the door, restrained his two dogs, which were inside. The officers then conducted a protective sweep of the inside of the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Once inside the residence, Lt. Shuff and Sgt. Walsh both testified to smelling a strong odor of marijuana. As Sgt. Walsh walked down the hallway towards the bedrooms, another officer came out of the last bedroom and reported finding a large amount of marijuana in the shape of a tire. Cowans was arrested and\n   <em>\n    Mirandized\n   </em>\n   after the marijuana was found in the house. After the officers spoke with Cowans inside the residence, he indicated that defendant had \"just dropped off\" drugs. Defendant was then placed under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Detective Tabora testified he arrived at 836 Fox Lane approximately 15 minutes after Sgt. Walsh and Lt. Shuff left for the residence. Once he arrived, the officers briefed him on what they found during the protective sweep. Additionally, Detective Tabora observed packaging material and a digital scale inside the residence. Detective Tabora testified that he was the one who prepared an application for a search warrant, which included the findings from the protective sweep of the garage and residence. Detective Tabora, Lt. Shuff, and Sgt. Walsh testified that additional narcotics, including cocaine, steroids, and pills, as well as firearms, were found after the search warrant was executed. Following execution of the search warrant, defendant admitted that he delivered narcotics to 836 Fox Lane in the past and was paid $1,200. He stated that he was paid $1,000 to deliver the marijuana seized from Cowans' house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In his sole assignment of error, defendant contends the trial court erred by denying the motion to suppress the evidence and statements because the officers erroneously arrested him without probable cause and then brought him to Cowans' house. He also argues his detention was \"unabashedly pretextual\" and constitutionally unjustifiable based on the traffic violation. Defendant also challenges the protective sweep of Cowans' residence and its curtilage as violative of the Fourth Amendment because of the lack of exigent circumstances. He argues that the evidence (marijuana inside a shed in the backyard) was not inevitably discovered, nor did any exclusionary rule exception apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The State contends that law enforcement officers had the right to stop and detain defendant since he was the subject of an on-going DEA investigation of drug trafficking between Houston and New Orleans and was suspected of being the point person. The State argues that, once officers observed defendant running a stop sign, the officers had the right to stop him and detain him pursuant to La. C.Cr.P. art. 215.1 and\n   <em>\n    Terry v. Ohio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    392 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968), since defendant appeared nervous and considering the inconsistent accounts of his travel plans. The State notes that defendant consented to a search of his truck, which led to the discovery of items known for masking the odor of narcotics. The State further argues that the officers had the right to ensure their safety during the investigation that justified the protective sweeps and that defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in Cowans' home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The right of every person to be secure in his person, house, papers and\n   effects against unreasonable searches and seizures, is guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 5 of the Louisiana Constitution.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Lexis 42725 (W.D. Ky. 3/28/12), officers received a complaint that defendant was running a meth lab at a residence. Upon surveilling the home, they learned that the owner of one of the vehicles parked at the home had purchased a large, but legal amount of pseudophedrine, often used to make meth. Defendant's name also came up during the search of another suspected drug house. Officers decided to go to the house and talk to the defendant. When they arrived, they encountered two other individuals in the front of the house performing yard work. Officers asked where the defendant was, the two individuals responded that he was not home, and officers asked them to call defendant. One of the officers then began to perform a protective sweep to make sure no one else was at the residence. During the sweep, he went around to the back of the residence and observed items used in a meth lab in the backyard. The court set forth the following reasons when determining that the protective sweep was not warranted by the circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Considering Detective Travis's and Alexander's testimony regarding their articulated safety concerns, the Court finds that the protective sweep performed by Detective Travis was not reasonable under the circumstances. Detective Travis and Alexander have not articulated facts that would warrant a reasonably prudent officer to believe that the area to be swept harbored an individual posing a danger to those on the scene. Alexander testified that Joe and Dalton Wyatt told him that Defendant was not there, and that \"[they] took their word for it.\" Alexander and Detective Travis believed that Defendant was not there, as evidenced by their own testimony and their failure to\n   knock on the front door of the home. Thus, the fact that Defendant was known to carry weapons in the past is not a sufficient reason to perform the protective sweep. Additionally, Detective Travis testified that he did not know if any other individuals were present but that he performed the protective sweep to find out. Although there were cars present on the property, the officers could not detect the presence of any other individuals. Importantly, even if they detected the presence of others, there is no evidence that other individuals would pose a danger to the officers.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, the government has not met its burden of providing sufficient facts to support a reasonable belief that a third party was present on the premises who posed a danger to the officers. Thus, Detective Travis's warrantless sweep of the curtilage of the home was not justified.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10, 2012 U.S. Dist. Lexis 42725 at pp. 31-32\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In the instant matter, the facts do not support the officers' decision to enter Cowans' backyard to conduct a protective sweep. Prior to approaching the residence, officers did not witness the exchange of any drugs and their CI was not involved in the purchase of any drugs. Rather, officers obtained information from their CI that defendant was a drug trafficker and indicated he could deliver drugs to the CI from Houston. Officers observed defendant visit the Fox Lane residence for a brief period of time on two occasions. During the traffic stop of defendant's truck, officers found items that are used by drug traffickers to mask the odor of drugs, but located no drugs in the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Officers did not possess any information regarding the individuals residing at the Fox Lane residence, but suspected the home was possibly a stash house for drugs. Therefore, based on their suspicions, officers decided to conduct a knock and talk. Officers agreed they did not possess probable cause to obtain a search warrant. After officers knocked on Cowans' door, he exited a neighboring property and identified himself. Cowans denied officers' request to enter his home and told officers they could talk in the front yard. Cowans told officers no one else was present at the residence and officers testified that they had no reason to believe otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Sgt. Walsh testified that he did not obtain consent from Cowans to enter the backyard or the garage to conduct the protective sweep. He further testified that he was not in fear for his safety and that it was standard operating procedure to conduct a protective sweep, particularly in a narcotics investigation. Officers did not testify to any facts creating an exigent situation that would justify officers' entry into Cowans' backyard. Officers further failed to testify to any specific knowledge that additional individuals would be in the backyard or the house to raise concerns of officer safety. Officers cannot encroach upon the Fourth Amendment protections based solely on their belief that narcotics may be involved, particularly when officers have no surveillance or other evidence to establish that drug trafficking actually occurred at the suspected location. Furthermore, as explained above, officers cannot create exigent circumstances by deciding to conduct a knock and talk. The Court understands law enforcement's zeal. However, the quantity of\n   illegal narcotics seized does not retroactively supply probable cause or obviate the need for a search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In sum, the facts of this case do not show the entry into Cowans' backyard, without a warrant or consent, to conduct a protective sweep was justified by any reasonable articulable suspicion that someone would be in the backyard or that, even if present, would be any danger to anyone at the scene. We find that the state failed to meet its burden of proving that the protective sweep of the garage was justified pursuant to one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement. Accordingly, we find that the preponderance of the evidence clearly favors granting defendant's motion to suppress the evidence and statements resulting from the improper protective sweep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DECREE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For the following reasons, we reverse the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress and enter an order granting the motion to suppress evidence and statements.

A month later, DEA agents arrested an individual coming out of the defendant's house who agreed to cooperate with the agents and who advised the agents that the defendant was storing drugs in the house and that the defendant expected him to return to the house with a kilogram of cocaine. The court held that even though there was no evidence that the defendant posed a specific threat to officers, the warrantless entry into his house was justified based on officer safety because of the fact that drug traffickers often possess and use guns. Specifically, the court found that \"[a]lthough our review of the record reveals that there was no direct or circumstantial evidence supporting [the officer's] belief that [the defendant] or anyone else who may have been with [the defendant] posed any specific danger to [the officer], the officers, or the community at large, the absence of a particularized fear (at least in our Circuit) is not controlling,\" noting that \"[a]t the hearing, [the officer] repeatedly stated that he had no knowledge that [the defendant] had weapons or that [the defendant] was a violent person.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7649742\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/106/70/#p73\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7649742\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/106/70/#p73\">\n    at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Further, this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Doussan\n   </em>\n   , this Court upheld the denial of a motion to suppress evidence that was discovered during a protective sweep of a music studio. Based on information from a confidential informant (\"CI\") who had purchased marijuana at the studio from the owner (the defendant) in the past that a fresh supply was available, officers applied for a search warrant. Prior to issuance of the warrant, officers set up surveillance of the studio around 9:00 p.m. from around a block away and instructed the CI to return to make a purchase. The CI made the purchase, which field tested positive. The surveillance team witnessed three other people enter and leave the studio, one of whom was stopped and found to be in possession of marijuana. The surveillance team witnessed the owner repeatedly walking in and out of the studio as if he were nervous. After a fourth man arrived, officers became concerned defendant might destroy evidence, fearing that one of the visitors may have alerted defendant to the surveillance, as well as they did not have the manpower to handle all of the foot traffic at the studio. The supervising officer ordered officers to secure the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Officers approached the defendant, who was outside the studio with the fourth man, with guns drawn. The defendant fled inside the studio, locking the door. Officers pounded on the door, whereupon the defendant unlocked it, allowing the officers to enter. They performed a pat down search of his person and a protective sweep of the studio, during which they observed marijuana in plain view. Minutes after the studio was secured, officers received notice that the search warrant had been signed (around 9:45 p.m.), which arrived 10-15 minutes later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The defendant argued that the protective sweep was not justified, since the surveillance officers should have known, having observed the comings and goings from the studio, that there was no one inside the studio, and that there was no need for a protective sweep of the premises to search for accomplices. This Court upheld the protective sweep, however, on the basis that the surveillance lasted only about 45 or 50 minutes, and the officers \"could not have known whether anyone entered [the studio] before the surveillance began.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, this Court found that \"the officers were justified in conducting a protective sweep of the premises for their own safety, and to prevent the destruction of evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8437351\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/924/333/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8437351\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/924/333/\">\n    at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Similarly, in the present case, because the officers had not conducted surveillance of Mr. Cowans' residence on Fox Lane prior to arriving there, they could not have known whether anyone other than Mr. Cowans was either inside of the residence, behind the non-fenced-in residence, or in the open garages behind the residence. When Lt. Shuff was specifically asked if he knew whether any other people were present on the property, he stated that he did not know one way or the other. And although the officers were advised by Mr. Cowans that no one else was present at the home at that time, under the circumstances presented to the officers at that time, they had no way of knowing whether Mr. Cowans was being truthful with them in so stating at that time. Further, as argued by the State, the totality of the evidence shows that at the time of the protective sweeps, the officers were investigating serious and substantial allegations of narcotics trafficking at Mr. Cowans' residence, that by its very nature, narcotics investigations present dangerous circumstances to officers, and that the officers had credible evidence that on an earlier\n   occasion, numerous subjects known to be involved in narcotics trafficking had, in fact, been present at 836 Fox Lane, which they credibly suspected was a stash house for illegal narcotics, so as to justify the protective sweeps on the date in question. Accordingly, in my opinion, under the particular facts and totality of the circumstances presented, based on rational inferences from the facts presented, the officers acted reasonably and were thus justified in conducting the protective sweep for officer safety of the inside of Mr. Cowans' residence, behind his residence, and in the open garages behind his residence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   I agree with the majority, however, that protective sweeps are not permissible simply as a matter of \"routine procedure\" or \"common practice\" for officer safety. Rather, the facts and circumstances of each particular case must clearly justify that the protective sweep in question was conducted for actual officer safety purposes, based on rational inferences from the facts presented, as was the case here, in my opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent. I would uphold the validity of the warrantless search of Mr. Cowans' premises and affirm defendant's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    La.

The trial court found that the officers trespassed prior to obtaining the warrant when they went to a side door to knock and announce their presence and as a result, the search warrant based on drug and gun evidence obtained afterwards was fruit of the poisonous tree. In reviewing the evidence presented, the Supreme Court found that the officer standing at a front door which was chained shut with a lock affixed detected the smell of marijuana which prompted the officers to further investigate and discover an open and accessible side entrance. Upon knocking and announcing their presence, the earlier smell of marijuana, and the continuing commotion of people the officers could only dimly see once the door was opened, the court found that the officers were reasonable in directing the individuals to exit, detaining them, and conducting a protective sweep. The court found that \"[b]ecause the police were unsure if all occupants had actually exited, the sweep was justified for officer safety and to prevent evidence from being destroyed.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6818761,6818743\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/187/981/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6818761,6818743\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/187/981/\">\n     at 983\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
