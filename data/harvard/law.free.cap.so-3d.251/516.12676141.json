On that date, Arthur Huguley was operating a tractor-trailer rig in the course and scope of his employment with AAA Cooper Transportation, Inc. (AAA Cooper). The decedent, Curley Mouton, was driving in his Mack truck behind the AAA Cooper tractor-trailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While driving his tractor-trailer eastbound on Interstate 10, between mile markers 96 and 97, Mr. Huguley testified he heard a \"loud bang.\" Mr. Huguley continued driving on the interstate for approximately two miles after hearing the \"loud bang.\" Fearing he might have a tire blowout, Mr. Huguley decided to engage in a \"wiggle\" maneuver. This maneuver is accomplished by intentionally swaying the trailer back and forth, which allows the driver to see his trailer tires in his side view mirrors to determine if he suffered a blowout. Mr. Huguley chose to perform this \"wiggle\" maneuver rather than pulling onto the shoulder and getting out and inspecting his tires. When the \"wiggle\" maneuver was initiated, this apparently caused the blown out tire to rapidly come apart, which resulted in pieces of the tire flying into the air. Mr. Huguley later testified he recognized his back trailer tire had blown, because he saw tire debris flying in the air behind his rig.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Mouton was traveling behind the tractor-trailer as the debris began flying through the air. Shortly thereafter, the Mack truck being driven by Mr. Mouton left its lane of travel, struck and traveled through a guardrail on Interstate 10, flipped over, hit a tree, and landed upside down in a drainage ditch. Mr. Mouton died as a result of the crash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs, Linda Mouton (the surviving spouse of the decedent) and Cory Mouton (the major son of the decedent) filed separate wrongful death and survival actions against Defendants, Arthur Huguley, AAA Cooper, and Ace American Insurance Company (Ace). The suits were consolidated by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following a trial by jury, a verdict was returned in favor of Plaintiffs. The jury apportioned ten percent (10%) fault to Mr. Huguley and ninety percent (90%) fault to AAA Cooper for placing a defective tire on its tractor-trailer. Curley Mouton was found to be free from fault. The jury awarded damages in the following amounts:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-16\"><strong><em>Survival Action Damages</em></strong> Conscious Pain and Suffering, Mental and Physical $ 50,000.00 Past Medical Expenses $ 1,213.55 Funeral Expense $ 16,488.67 <strong><em>Wrongful Death Damages (sustained by Linda Mouton)</em></strong> Loss of Financial Support $100,000.00 Loss of Services $ 10,000.00 Loss of Love and Affection $150,000.00 Past and Future Mental Anguish, Grief and Anxiety $150,000.00 <strong><em>Wrongful Death Damages (sustained by Cory Mouton)</em></strong> Loss of Services $ 10,000.00 Loss of Love and Affection $ 75,000.00 Past and Future Mental Anguish, Grief and Anxiety $ 75,000.00</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In response to the jury verdict, Mr. Huguley and AAA Cooper separately filed Motions for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict (JNOV) and Motions for New Trial on Liability. The trial court denied these motions. Plaintiffs filed their own JNOV, seeking an increase in the survival action general damage award. The trial court granted the motion and increased the award for general damages in the survival action from $50,000.00 to $150,000.00. Costs were also taxed. In total, after the granting of the JNOV, the amount of damages awarded to both Plaintiffs was $737,702.52, plus court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 8, 2017, the trial court signed a judgment which taxed costs for expert fees and increased the survival action general damage award to $150,000.00. On March 1, 2017, Defendants filed a motion for suspensive appeal, obtained a signed order of appeal, and posted an appeal bond. The record was lodged in this court and briefs were filed. On review, this court determined the February 8, 2017, Final Judgment did not contain proper decretal language, including the names of the parties against whom judgment was rendered (with a specification of the percentages of fault as assessed by the jury) and a specification of the increase in the award of general damages in the survival action and other damages awarded by the jury. This court then issued a rule ordering Defendants to show cause, by brief only, why their appeal should not be dismissed as having been taken from the February 8, 2017 judgment that lacked proper decretal language, or, in the alternative, why the appeal should not be suspended pending the receipt of a judgment containing proper decretal language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 10, 2018, this court issued a ruling suspending the appeal and remanding the matter to the trial court with instructions to issue a judgment containing proper decretal language. Following remand and the issuance of a final judgment with proper decretal language, this consolidated appeal was lodged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In their appeal, Defendants have asserted the following assignments of error, which are summarized below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1. The jury erred in assessing no fault to Mr. Mouton.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   2. The jury erred in assessing ten percent (10%) fault to Mr. Huguley.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   3. The trial court erred in allowing Plaintiffs to argue various theories of how the accident occurred without supporting evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   4. The trial court erred by allowing Mr. Gillen to testify as an expert in the \"rules of the road\" governing commercial truck drivers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   5. The testimony of Mr. Gillen was so prejudicial that the appellate court should conduct a de novo review of the jury's findings of fact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   6. The trial court committed legal error when it allowed the Plaintiffs to argue to the jury that AAA Cooper was liable under La.Civ.Code arts. 2317 and 2317.1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   7. The Plaintiffs failed to plead a cause of action upon which relief could be granted against AAA Cooper under La.Civ.Code arts. 2317 and 2317.1, and therefore, that cause of action should not have been argued to the jury or included in the jury instructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   8. The jury committed manifest error by apportioning any fault directly to AAA Cooper under La.Civ.Code arts. 2317 and 2317.1 when the Plaintiffs failed to prove every essential element of that claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   9. The trial court erred in disregarding the jury's vast discretion and granting the JNOV increasing the award of general damages in the survival action; and, in the alternative, the award was abusively high and should be reduced.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   10. The trial court erred by awarding certain fees to Plaintiffs for Mr. Gillen's services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. The Jury's Findings of Fault.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Several of Defendants' assignments of errors contend the jury erred in its apportionment of fault. The appellate standard of review when examining a jury's findings of fault are well settled. An appellate court must give the jury's apportionment of fault great deference on review and must affirm that apportionment of fault unless it is manifestly erroneous or clearly wrong.\n   <em>\n    Dupree v. City of New Orleans\n   </em>\n   , 99-3651 (La. 8/31/00),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11245903\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/765/1002/\">\n    765 So.2d 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, we review the facts of the case only to determine if the jury's fault assessments were manifestly erroneous. Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be manifestly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    Stobart v. State, Dep't of Transp. and Dev.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7476636\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/617/880/\">\n    617 So.2d 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.1993). Further, where the findings are based on determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses, the manifest error standard demands great deference to the findings of fact.\n   <em>\n    Rosell v. ESCO\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7548305\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/549/840/\">\n    549 So.2d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.1989).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    a. Fault of Curley Mouton.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants first argue the jury erred in finding Curley Mouton free from fault in causing the accident. On review, we find the jury's determination that Mr. Mouton was free from fault was reasonable based on the evidence presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Todd Dauphinet, who was driving behind both Mr. Huguley's tractor-trailer and Mr. Mouton's truck when the accident happened, witnessed the accident, and gave the following statement at the scene:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   There was a 18-wheeler with a trailer in the left lane and a TK Stanley truck [Mr. Mouton's vehicle] was behind them. The front truck blew a tire going into the right lane together. But she\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Mr.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Mouton] had no room to go and was pushed over to the right lane. Last I seen truck was in the air.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In his testimony, Mr. Dauphinet expressed his opinion that Mr. Mouton did nothing wrong in his driving. He stated he was approximately \"three vehicles behind\" Mr. Mouton's truck. He testified at the time Mr. Mouton's vehicle left the road, the air was full of thick, white smoke and he \"could see [Mr. Mouton's] truck veering to the right towards the center line and then it worked back to the left side and then all of a sudden it took an immediate right and it just hit the hand rail.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Susie Wilridge was driving her vehicle behind Mr. Mouton's truck at the time of the accident, and testified she saw \"smoke and debris, tire debris.\" She stated the debris \"was coming at me.\" Ms. Wilridge further testified as follows concerning the events immediately precipitating Mr. Mouton's vehicle leaving the road:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q. What about the Mouton vehicle? Did you see whether it braked or not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A. It broke hard and then moved suddenly to the right. And then moved over like he was trying to get out of the way. Because the 18-wheeler was right there within a car or two lengths.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Q. Did you say you saw some smoke as well?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A. Yes, I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q. This debris that you saw on the roadway, rolling towards to you, how big was the debris?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A. As large as approximately two feet and then variable sizes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Q. Was there a lot of it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q. What did the Mouton vehicle do then?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A. I don't know at that time. I just saw it veered off and hit the railing and flip because I was driving, I broke hard, saw what was going on, looked and just kept trying to remain in control of my vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Q. How would you describe his departure from the roadway?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A. I would say it was fast. It wasn't like immediately but he was moving over like trying to get out of the way of hitting someone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Q. What did you see the Mouton vehicle do once it left the roadway? Or did you see it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   A. All I saw was he hit the guard rail and then it was moving - - flipped over. I couldn't look anymore than that because I had to look where I was going.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Valerie Wilridge was riding with her mother and testified she found \"nothing out of the ordinary\" with Mr. Mouton's driving. She stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A. We were driving behind him [Mr. Mouton].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Q. Okay. At any time was he driving erratically or speeding?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Q. Was he driving normal?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   A. Yes. We were driving just below the speed limit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Q. Okay. How do you remember that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   A. I remember that because the traffic was very heavy. So no one was really able to go the speed limit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As Plaintiffs note, even the testimony of Mr. Huguley indicates Mr. Mouton was driving safely and within the posted speed limit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Q. Mr. Huguley, you saw Mr. Mouton driving for several minutes at various times before this accident, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   A. One time when I passed him, when I was coming up on him to pass him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Q. You also saw him another time in the mirror?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Q. One or two times?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A. Well, two or three times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Q. Over a period of a couple of miles, you think?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   Q. Every time you saw him you were driving faster than he was, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Q. In fact, you were passing him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Q. You never saw him drive recklessly?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Q. You never thought he was speeding?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Q. You never saw him drive erratically; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Defendants contend there was no explanation offered at trial as to why Mr. Mouton lost control of his vehicle. Obviously, Mr. Mouton was unable to testify as to why he lost control of his vehicle. However, the testimony was clear that Mr. Mouton was operating his vehicle in a safe and careful manner, and suddenly veered off the road as white smoke and tire debris flew out from the AAA Cooper tractor-trailer. Thus, we cannot say the jury manifestly erred in determining Mr. Mouton was not at fault in causing the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    b. Fault of Arthur Huguley.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendants next contend the jury erred in assessing ten percent (10%) fault to Mr. Huguley. At trial, Mr. Huguley testified as follows concerning the sequence of events just prior to the accident:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Q. As you were passing Mr. Mouton and the two other vehicles you heard a loud bang, didn't you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Q. As a truck driver, you thought that was a tire.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   A. It sound like a tire but it didn't sound like a tire but it sound like a tire.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Q. So, it sounded like a tire but it didn't sound like a tire?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   A. Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Q. But being the driver that you are, you knew it was a tire.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   A. No. It's like I say, it sound like a tire and it didn't sound like a tire. It sounded like it was on the westbound side. So once I check my left mirror to see what was going on on the westbound side, I didn't see anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Q. What did you do next?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   A. What I did - I, uh, realized, well, if it's not on the westbound side, it's a possibility it could have been my tire. So I did a maneuver, what I call and a lot of more truckers call, \"a wobble.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Q. Wobble?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Mr. Huguley then explained to the jury what a \"wobble\" or \"wiggle\" maneuver is for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Q. And the purpose of this technique is if you suspect you have a flat tire, rather than have to pull over and get out and check your tire, you can wiggle the trailer, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Q. And when you wiggle the trailer, if you have a flat tire, that wiggle makes debris fly off the tire, doesn't it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   A. Not necessarily.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Q. If you have a flat tire, most of the time a wiggle makes debris fly off the tire, doesn't it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   A. The debris gonna come off the tire anyway. The wiggle is to check it to make sure it's your tire.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Q. With respect to a flat tire, this wiggle allows you check to see if you have a flat tire?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   A. Not really. What it - what it does is, well, what it does is you gradually turn the steering wheel to the left and it offset the trailer so you can see anything coming off. You gradually pull it back to the right just a little bit to see if anything is coming off your trailer. So, by me doing that, that let me know that it was my tire.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Q. If you have a flat, usually - \"usually\" you can see debris flying off the tire.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Mr. Huguley's testimony established, as he was passing Mr. Mouton around mile marker 96 or 97, he heard a loud bang and realized he may have suffered a tire blow out. Rather than pulling to the shoulder of the interstate and checking his tires, he continued driving for another two miles. He then decided to attempt a \"wiggle/wobble maneuver\" to help determine if he indeed suffered a tire blow out. By all testimony, this then caused his tire to rapidly disintegrate, causing debris to fly through the air. Valerie Wilridge stated there were pieces of tire \"everywhere,\" and that her mother broke hard and had to swerve to avoid the debris. She further testified tire debris would likely have struck the Wilridge vehicle, but it was striking Mr. Mouton's truck in front of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   At trial, Mr. Huguley acknowledged the Commercial Driver's Manual instructs a driver, if he believes he may have suffered a tire blow out, to immediately pull off the road and check the tires, \"even if the vehicle seems to be handling all right.\" He testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   Q. You just heard a loud bang or pop or whatever it was. You didn't pull over like the bible [the Commercial Driver's License Manual] says you should do, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Q. What did you do next?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   A. I did what they call - that I call a wiggle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Thus, Mr. Huguley's own testimony confirms, rather than following the Commercial Driver's License Manual, he decided to employ the \"wobble/wiggle\" technique, which caused a large amount of tire debris to fly through the air at Mr. Mouton's vehicle. Mr. Gillen, Plaintiff's accident reconstructionist, testified that the departure angle Mr. Mouton's truck made in leaving the road indicated \"a very extreme departure consistent with a sudden evasive maneuver by the driver.\" Mr. Gillen further testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Q. Do you have an opinion as to whether or not that was a reasonable action for [Mr. Huguley] to continue driving down the highway?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   A. I am of the opinion that that was not a reasonable action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   Q. Why was that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   A. For a professional truck driver or any driver to continue traveling down the interstate at an interstate speed suspecting that you may have possibly have experienced a blowout. I think that the safer option was what the commercial driver's license manual outlines and what your regular driver's license manual outlines. Reduce your speed; hold on to the steering wheel to maintain steerage;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   move over to the right and stop out of the roadway to check your tires.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   Q. And in your experience as an expert in the field of accident reconstruction and rules of the road, that someone would have an ample opportunity to do that in the three mile span on an interstate highway with what Mr. Huguley characterized as light traffic ahead of him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   A. Yes, sir. I think they had. Had he simply adjusted his speed, he could have reduced his speed to accommodate the traffic that he says was to his right. Let that traffic clear. Then move over to the right. Pull onto the shoulder. This is a straight long section of interstate with a ten foot wide paved shoulder wide enough to accommodate his eight foot wide truck. He ultimately pulled over to the shoulder and was clear of the roadway. But he had a three mile opportunity to do that prior to where he ultimately stopped.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   Q. He also had an exit to do it, didn't he?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   A. Yes, sir. He did. He went past the Scott exit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   Q. Mr. Gillen, what about the wiggle of his truck? You heard him testify about that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   A. I did. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   Q. Do you have an opinion as to whether or not a professional truck driver who suspects that they have a flat tire should wiggle a truck and trailer while traveling 67 miles an hour down the interstate highway?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   A. I am of the opinion that that is a completely unsafe maneuver. You're creating an instability with that trailer, which Mr. Huguley has acknowledged he was carrying a 44,000 pound load. To put that in perspective a Suburban, pretty big vehicle, weighs about 5,000. So he's got the equivalent of nearly nine Suburbans loaded in his trailer and he is testifying that he's going to wiggle that so he can get a better view of the tire rather than pull over and check on the shoulder. I have never seen that advocated in any driving manual. I have never heard of a truck driver doing that. And, again, I don't think that was a safe maneuver at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   After a review of the above testimony of the witnesses and experts, it is apparent the jury's finding of fault on the part of Mr. Huguley cannot be said to be manifestly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <em>\n    c. Fault of AAA Cooper.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   AAA Cooper was found at fault by the jury because it found the failed tire which led to the accident was defective. As Plaintiffs note, the following stipulation concerning the failed tire occurred at trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   THE COURT: Do you have a stipulation in reference to the plugs and patches?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   MR. LABORDE (Counsel for Plaintiffs): We have a stipulation regarding the retread tire. Your Honor, there was a conference among counsel and the Court just before our recess. And in light of defendant's [sic] not calling Keith Rombard, it is my understanding that defense counsel is willing to stipulate that the tire that blew out in this accident has been recapped or retreaded three times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   MR. MEEKS (Counsel for Defendants): And that is in Mr. Gillen's report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   MR. LABORDE: And that it had been plugged twice and patched twice before this accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   MR. MEEKS: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   THE COURT: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   As Plaintiffs note, this stipulation is sufficient to form a reasonable basis for the trial court to assign fault on the basis of custodial liability. The Louisiana Supreme\n   Court long ago in\n   <em>\n    Kent v. Gulf States Utilities Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9550461\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/418/493/#p497\">\n    418 So.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 497 (La.1982), stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   In a typical negligence case against the owner of a thing (such as a tree) which is actively involved in the causation of injury, the claimant must prove that something about the thing created an unreasonable risk of injury that resulted in the damage,\n   <em>\n    that the owner knew or should have known of that risk\n   </em>\n   , and that the owner nevertheless failed to render the thing safe or to take adequate steps to prevent the damage caused by the thing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The facts established the tire in question was approximately six to seven years old and had been retreaded three separate times. It was also plugged twice and patched twice. It was undisputed that AAA Cooper was aware of the tire's history. Despite this AAA Cooper made the choice to continue to use the tire rather than replace it with a new one. Mr. Huguley testified in his deposition he preferred new tires to retread tires because retread tires fail more often. However, Mr. Huguley noted that decision of which tires were placed on the tractor-trailer was made by AAA Cooper and not him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Defendants insist there was no proof that the failed, retreaded tire was a cause of the accident. This assertion is made despite the clear, unequivocal testimony of several witnesses that the Mouton vehicle sharply veered off the interstate right as tire debris began flying from the AAA Cooper tractor-trailer. The jury clearly found the defective tire was a cause of the accident and held AAA Cooper at fault for knowingly placing a defective tire on its tractor-trailer. We find no manifest error in this finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. Plaintiffs' Pleadings.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Defendants argue in several related assignments of error that Plaintiffs did not plead a cause of action upon which relief could be granted against AAA Cooper under La.Civ.Code arts. 2317 and 2317.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   As Plaintiffs point out, Defendants did not object to the inclusion of a fault blank for AAA Cooper, and therefore, that cause of action should not have been argued to the jury or included in the jury instructions. Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure Article 1793(C) addresses such an instance and provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   A party may not assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless he objects thereto either before the jury retires to consider its verdict or immediately after the jury retires, stating specifically the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection. If he objects prior to the time the jury retires, he shall be given an opportunity to make the objection out of the hearing of the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Pursuant to that article, this court has repeatedly held that a party waives its right to object to jury instructions on appeal if it does not object to the charges at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Libersat v.

Accordingly, Defendants have waived that argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Further, a review of Plaintiffs' petition shows it alleges that Defendants failed to maintain the tractor-trailer \"in a proper fashion and for its intended use.\" It was also asserted Defendants \"fail[ed] to promulgate and adhere to reasonable safety standards\" and \"fail[ed] to act as a prudent owner/operator/employer of commercial\n   vehicles.\" Clearly these allegations in the petition set forth the defect theory of the failed tire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   AAA Cooper also argues in brief the jury assessed it with ninety percent (90 %) fault solely on the basis of custodial liability. Such a conclusion is based only on speculation, as we cannot divine the reasoning the jury used in reaching its fault assessments. As Plaintiffs point out, it is certainly reasonable that AAA Cooper was found at fault for using a defective tire that had been repaired on seven separate occasions independent of custodial liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Plaintiffs also note the jury was not informed that fault on the verdict form could have been jointly rendered\n   <em>\n    in solido\n   </em>\n   against AAA Cooper and Mr. Huguley. AAA Cooper stipulated at trial that Mr. Huguley was in the course and scope of his employment with it at the time of the accident. Therefore, AAA Cooper would be responsible for the entire judgment amount as a result of vicarious liability regardless of the allocation of fault between itself and Mr. Huguley. As we have found no manifest error in the jury's determination that Mr. Mouton was not at fault in causing the accident, any error in the apportionment of fault between AAA Cooper and Mr. Huguley would be harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. Assignments of Error Related to Plaintiffs' Expert.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <em>\n    a. Qualification of Michael Gillen as an Expert.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Defendants next contend the trial court erred in allowing Plaintiffs' expert Michael Gillen to testify as an expert in accident reconstruction. It was established Mr. Gillen began investigating accidents in 1977 when he joined the Baton Rouge City Police Department. By his estimate, Mr. Gillen, during his nearly twenty years as a police officer, investigated over two thousand accidents. In 1996, he began National Collisions Technologies, Incorporated (NCTI), a company that investigates accidents. He estimated he had worked as an accident reconstructionist on approximately one thousand five hundred cases since starting NCTI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Mr. Gillen stated he had training from numerous universities, the Louisiana Highway Safety Commission and the Federal Highway Administration. He also has taught numerous continuing education courses in accident investigation and reconstruction. Mr. Gillen noted the Federal Highway Administration has a minimum standard guideline of three hundred hours for formal tested courses in accident reconstruction, and he had completed about one thousand three hundred hours of courses in accident investigation and reconstruction. These included courses specific to commercial vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Mr. Gillen noted he has been qualified as an expert in accident reconstruction in city, state and federal courts in Louisiana and Mississippi. The trial court, after noting Mr. Gillen previously appeared as an expert in its court, accepted him as an expert in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Interestingly, Defendants cite\n   <em>\n    Cheairs v. State ex rel.

As Plaintiffs note, in\n   <em>\n    Cheairs\n   </em>\n   the Louisiana Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether the expert in that case was properly qualified to testify. That expert, as in this case, was Michael Gillen.

We find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in allowing Mr. Gillen to testify as an expert in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Defendants specifically argued the trial court erred in allowing Mr. Gillen to \"testify as an expert in the 'rules of the road' governing commercial truck drivers.\" We find no merit in this contention, as Mr. Gillen simply read from the requirements of the Commercial Drivers' License Manual, which was admitted into evidence. Mr. Huguley acknowledged he was familiar with that manual and agreed they were the \"rules of the road for a truck driver.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <em>\n    b. Costs Taxed for Mr. Gillen's Expert Testimony\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Defendants also argue the expert costs taxed to them for Mr. Gillen's testimony were not reasonable. Plaintiffs were awarded $8,575.00 for Mr. Gillen's services and testimony in conjunction with the case. Mr. Gillen claimed $2,449.00 in costs associated with his trial attendance, travel and mileage. He also charged $6,126.00 for his investigation of the accident and his preparation for trial. Plaintiffs submitted the invoices from NCTI in their motion to tax costs. The trial court stated as follows regarding the amount claimed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   ... with the $8,575, I've seen Mr. Gillen's work. He's a well qualified expert. He came in and I know what his preparation time and his travel time and his testimony time. I find $8,575 to be reasonable for an expert with his knowledge and his trial preparation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Defendants also infer it was inappropriate for employees of NCTI to recheck diagrams and computations made by Mr. Gillen. However, as Plaintiffs note, they retained NCTI, of which Mr. Gillen is the owner and corporate representative, to investigate and reconstruct the accident. Thus, we find nothing improper or unreasonable with the involvement of NCTI's associates in the preparation of Plaintiffs' case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The trial court has great discretion in fixing fees for expert witnesses and determining the reasonableness of costs incurred by the prevailing party.\n   <em>\n    Otwell v.

At some point during the extraction, he stated Mr. Mouton became unresponsive. At that point, which Mr. Begnaud guessed was \"fifteen or twenty minutes\" after he arrived at the accident scene, Acadian Ambulance personnel were called in to check Mr. Mouton's vital signs. When it was determined he showed no signs of life, Mr. Mouton was pronounced deceased.

He hung upside down in his cab, undoubtedly in excruciating pain for approximately thirty minutes, until he eventually choked to death. All this while enduring the painful realization that his life was ending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Examining the record before us, we cannot say the trial court erred in finding the facts and inferences pointed so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the Plaintiffs that the motion for JNOV was properly granted. We also find no merit to Defendants' contention that the amount of damages awarded by the trial court was abusively high.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     V. Plaintiffs' Answer to the Appeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Plaintiffs answered the appeal and requested this court modify the awards for general damages to Cory Mouton and Linda Mouton. They assert these damage awards were an abuse of the jury's discretion and were abusively low.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   In considering whether an award of general damages is excessive or inadequate, we are guided by the decision in\n   <em>\n    Youn v. Maritime Overseas Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7489994\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/623/1257/#p1261\">\n    623 So.2d 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1261 (La.1993),\n   <em>\n    cert. denied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"231769,231786,229771,232716,230905,232875,235187,235448,231513,230810,233947,231102,235775\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/1114/\">\n    510 U.S. 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20S.%20Ct.%201059\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20379\">\n    127 L.Ed.2d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994), wherein our supreme court noted that \"the discretion vested in the trier of fact is 'great,' and even vast, so that an appellate court should rarely disturb an award of general damages.\" Under\n   <em>\n    Youn\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he initial inquiry is whether the award for the particular injuries and their effects under the particular circumstances on the particular injured person is a clear abuse of the 'much discretion' of the trier of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1260. Only after the initial inquiry is answered in the affirmative should the appellate court increase or reduce the award.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In making the initial\n   inquiry, the reviewing court should not use \"a scale of prior awards in cases with generically similar medical injuries to determine whether the particular trier of fact abused its discretion in the awards to the particular plaintiff under the facts and circumstances peculiar to the particular case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1260. Such prior awards should be considered only after the reviewing court concludes that there has been an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   The jury awarded wrongful death general damages of $300,000.00 to Linda Mouton and $150,000.00 to Cory Mouton. Plaintiffs contest these awards on appeal but did not include in brief what it considered an appropriate award nor any cited cases which would indicate the jury's awards were inadequate and an abuse of discretion. It is well settled that \"[g]eneral damages are those which are inherently speculative in nature and cannot be fixed with mathematical certainty.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

We have thoroughly considered the particular facts and circumstances of the losses suffered by Plaintiffs in this matter and cannot say the jury abused its great discretion in making its damage awards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <strong>\n    DECREE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the lower court is affirmed in all respects. All costs of this appeal are assessed to Defendants-Appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    Mr. Dauphinet testified he originally thought Mr. Mouton was a she, because when he got to the scene the body was so badly mangled he could not tell whether it was a man or woman, and Mr. Mouton's voice at that time was very high pitched.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
