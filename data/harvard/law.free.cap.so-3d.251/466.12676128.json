The 1008 was filed on August 23, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 23, 2018, Scott filed a motion for expedited hearing pursuant to La.R.S. 23:1121. Scott alleged that PCA failed to authorize an initial visit with his choice of treating physician, Dr. Brad LeBert, an otolaryngologist. Scott sought an order from the WCJ directing PCA to authorize\n   the initial visit with Dr. LeBert, to reimburse Scott for the cost of an audiogram, and to pay two penalties and attorney's fees for PCA's arbitrary and capricious behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   PCA responded by filing an exception of improper use of summary proceedings alleging that while Scott could utilize summary proceedings to have his choice of physician approved, he could not utilize summary proceedings for the imposition of penalties and attorney's fees. PCA also opposed Scott's motion and alleged that Scott's claim was prescribed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Scott's motion and PCA's exception came for hearing on February 23, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the hearing, the WCJ found that PCA did not have a \"pliable\" defense not to pay for the audiogram and ordered that the medical bill be repaid at full cost, that Scott's choice of treating physician be approved, and that PCA pay two separate penalties of $2,000.00 each and attorney's fees of $3,000.00. Scott's counsel was ordered to prepare a judgment. The judgment granting Scott's motion, imposing the penalties and attorney's fees, and denying PCA's exception was signed on March 21, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   PCA timely filed its notice of intent to seek writs, and the WCJ set a return date of April 25, 2018. PCA's request for a stay of the proceedings pending review of the issue was denied. This writ application was timely filed and did not include a request for a stay or for expedited consideration. Scott filed his opposition on May 3, 2018. A supplement was filed by PCA on May 8, 2018. This supplement included a complete copy of PCA's opposition to the motion for expedited hearing. A second supplement was filed by PCA on May 25, 2018.
