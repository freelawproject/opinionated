He walked into Building 12, containing several classrooms, and allegedly shot and killed seventeen people, including students and staff members. The timeline for the shooting is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   2:19 p.m. Cruz is dropped off near the school\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2:21 p.m. Cruz enters Building 12 and begins firing rifle\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2:22 p.m. A fire alarm is set off\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2:27 p.m. Cruz discards his weapon and exits out the west side of the building\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Approximately 70 surveillance cameras are installed at Douglas. The exterior cameras are mounted in plain sight and are \"completely visible\" to a person looking for\n   them. Without seeing the actual footage from the camera, one would not know:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Whether the camera is on or off;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 Whether the camera is working;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 How wide the angle is;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Where the camera is pointing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Whether the camera operates at night; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 How many frames per second the camera is recording.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 15, the Broward County Sheriff's Office (\"BSO\") subpoenaed all of Douglas's video surveillance footage. On February 16, the BSO executed a search warrant and seized the School Board's computers which housed the footage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Two weeks after the shooting, several media outlets petitioned for access to video recordings captured by Douglas's surveillance cameras.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Media's petition was filed pursuant to Article I, Section 24 of the Florida Constitution and Chapter 119, Florida Statutes, the \"Public Records Act.\" The respondents were the BSO, Scott Israel (BSO Sheriff), the School Board of Broward County, and Robert Runcie (Superintendent of Schools).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Media's petition averred \"extreme public interest\" in \"the response of law enforcement officers during the shooting and immediately thereafter.\" The petition mentioned school resource officer, Scot Peterson, by name. The petition was necessitated because the BSO refused to release the footage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The State Attorney's Office moved to intervene as the authority prosecuting Cruz. The State Attorney argued that the \"items sought constitute criminal investigative information\" that is exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The BSO responded to the petition, raising the same exemption, and other objections not relevant to this appeal. The School Board's response claimed that the footage was exempt from disclosure under Florida Statute section 119.071(3)(a), Florida Statutes - the \"security system plan exemption.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Before the hearing, the Media filed two DVDs in support of the petition. The first was a video of a press conference conducted by the BSO. In the press conference, Sheriff Scott Israel discusses the Douglas surveillance videos and informs the media that Officer Peterson was suspended based on his failure to enter Building 12 and engage the shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The second DVD was an interview with a Douglas student who described seeing Officer Peterson during the shooting. According to the student, Officer Peterson stood in a stairwell in an adjacent building, talking on his radio, with his gun pointed at Building 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Media also filed several exhibits including its public records request, other public records, and several articles about the shooting. The articles discussed Officer Peterson's actions as well as reports that other deputies remained outside during the shooting taking cover behind their vehicles. One article notes BSO policy which is that \"if real time intelligence exists the\n   sole deputy or team of deputies may enter the area and/or structure to preserve life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The circuit judge conducted an evidentiary hearing on March 8. The evidentiary portion of the hearing included testimony from the BSO's captain of criminal investigations. The captain testified that Cruz is the subject of an active criminal investigation and that the videotapes are part of the criminal investigative information file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The other relevant testimony about Douglas's surveillance system came from a BSO officer and an assistant principal. This testimony is discussed in more detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At the close of the hearing, the judge announced that he would be doing an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the footage, which had been redacted to obscure the faces of students and unknown witnesses. Ultimately, the court issued its order requiring the BSO to release the footage (the \"first order\"). None of the parties appealed the first order, and the BSO provided the specified footage to the Media.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Shortly before the video was released, the BSO published a detailed timeline of events culled from multiple sources, including Douglas surveillance videos. The timeline revealed that there are 70 surveillance cameras at Douglas and that the cameras are motion-activated. The published timeline stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The 45 acre campus is equipped to record 70 different camera angles. Most of these views provide coverage of student buildings, walkways and hallways. Building 12 was covered by thirteen interior cameras. School video time stamps are not exactly synchronized with BSO dispatch records. Cameras are also motion activated leaving gaps in coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After reviewing the BSO's newly-released timeline and the footage released March 15, the Media filed a Motion for Further Relief. The Media argued that the footage released was incomplete, edited, and not entirely responsive. The Media asked for \"full disclosure\" showing the law enforcement response so the public could \"evaluate and determine whether more could have, or should have, been done.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The School Board opposed releasing additional footage. It contended that the extensive video footage sought by the Media revealed much more than the \"minimal\" footage originally produced. It further argued that the Media had not stated any \"good cause\" for the additional footage because the additional footage sought captured officers' actions\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Cruz had dropped his weapon and exited the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Media's motion for further relief spurred three hearings and the appealed order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The first hearing was a case management conference held on March 23. The Media insisted that it was not seeking any footage of victims - that it was seeking only footage from the exterior cameras showing the law enforcement response. The circuit court clarified that \"anyone on the video, other than law enforcement,\" was going to be pixelated. The BSO did not object to producing additional footage. The court ordered the Media to narrow its request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Media then filed its \"Amended and Supplemental Motion for Further Relief.\" The Media specified that it was not seeking any video:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (a) depicting the victims of the shooting,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (b) showing the interior of any school building,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (c) specifically identifying any student, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (d) depicting Nikolas Cruz.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Media sought only video from cameras mounted on Buildings 12, 13, 6, 7, 9, 3, the gymnasium, and the auditorium which depicted law enforcement personnel responding to the shooting from 2:15-4:00 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The second hearing was conducted on April 2. The BSO stated that it was\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   opposed to releasing video showing first responders but it opposed releasing video showing victims or children's faces.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The School Board argued against releasing any more video. It argued that releasing additional video would reveal the vulnerabilities of Douglas's security system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   After clarifying what the Media was seeking and what the footage would reveal, the court found the request over-inclusive. The judge ordered that the footage to be released would stop at 3:00 p.m. An evidentiary hearing was set for April 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   At the final evidentiary hearing, a detective testified that Cruz had been indicted and was the subject of a continuing active criminal investigation. He said that the first law enforcement personnel seen on the video is at 2:32 p.m. He testified that of the 5-6 cameras that show first responders, 3-4 were not previously produced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The chief information officer for the BSO who oversees information technology for the entire Broward County School District testified that he is responsible for \"the installation and ongoing maintenance of the surveillance cameras.\" He testified that surveillance cameras at Douglas are \"not typically monitored,\" and that \"no one is sitting watching those cameras but they're recording so that if you need to go back and look at the footage, you can.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   A Douglas assistant principal responsible for technology, which included surveillance technology, testified that the cameras were used to monitor the students and to prevent truancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Another assistant principal expressed his concern that releasing video footage from more cameras would expose the school's blind spots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A Major with the school board police supported the view that releasing the videos would show what the school was not recording, jeopardizing the integrity of the security system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   After hearing argument the court found that an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the redacted footage would be appropriate. Two weeks later, the court issued its \"Order on Petitioners' Amended and Supplemental Motion for Further Relief,\" which is the subject of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The order found the footage to be a public record and rejected the State Attorney's attempt to bar disclosure under the \"active criminal investigative information\" exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Addressing the School Board's argument that the videos are exempt from disclosure because they \"relate directly to or reveal information about security systems,\" the court found that the videos \"minimally reveal information relating to the security system\" of Douglas, but concluded that \"good cause exists that permits disclosure:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   In making this decision, this Court has balanced the public's right to be informed regarding the law enforcement response against the potential harm to the current security system. After reviewing the video recordings, this Court finds that the potential harm to the current security system is outweighed by the strong public interest in disclosure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Upon finding good cause, the court held that section 119.071(3), Florida Statutes, did not bar disclosure of the video recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The BSO was ordered to produce the redacted versions of the video recordings to the Media. The State Attorney and the School Board each timely appealed, and the videos were not released pending the outcome of this case. As a sealed part of the record on appeal, footage from the five cameras was forwarded to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The videos here at issue are public records subject to disclosure within the meaning of Article I, section 24(a) of the Florida Constitution and Chapter 119, Florida Statutes (2018). The central issue before us is whether the footage is statutorily exempt from disclosure. An \"exemption\" is defined as \"a provision of general law which provides that a specified record ... is not subject to the access requirements of [the Public Records Act].\" \u00a7 119.011(8), Fla. Stat. (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Public Records Act \"is to be construed liberally in favor of openness, and all exemptions from disclosure construed narrowly and limited to their designated purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Barfield v.

I respectfully dissent from the majority's holding and conclusion that the \"good faith\" exception to the \"security plan\" exemption applies, so as to authorize release of the surveillance videos. More particularly, I conclude from the record that there was insufficient substantial competent evidence to support the trial court's finding that release of the surveillance videos would \"\n   <em>\n    minimally\n   </em>\n   reveal information relating to the security system.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Although the evidence showed there are 70 surveillance cameras on the Douglas campus, the appellants limited their request to video footage from exterior surveillance cameras covering six specific buildings, plus the gymnasium and the auditorium. What the majority does not discuss in any detail is the testimony of two school board witnesses detailing their concerns that release of the surveillance videos would expose \"holes\" or weaknesses in the \"security system net\" for the campus, of which the video cameras are a major component. One of the witnesses was an assistant principal at the Douglas campus; the second witness was a Major in the school district police force. The assistant principal was responsible for overseeing the security system for the Douglas campus; the Major was responsible for developing and maintaining the security system for the entire school district, and was specifically\n   familiar with the Douglas campus. Their testimony was in the nature of expert opinion, and the appellees did not impeach their testimony or opinions in any significant way. More importantly, the appellees called no witnesses at the evidentiary hearing and presented no conflicting or competing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   With all due respect to the trial judge, there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the exposure of the security net provided by the surveillance cameras was \"minimal.\" It is unclear from the record how many exterior security cameras were used to generate the video footage being released. It is also unclear from the record how those cameras interface, in terms of coverage, with the other exterior cameras which did not capture law enforcement images. Without knowing such information, I submit one cannot clearly understand the extent of the exposure of weaknesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Common sense would lead one to conclude that a surveillance system using 70 cameras covering numerous buildings over a large campus with a large student body requires sophisticated technical analysis to determine whether gaps in camera coverage create a risk to security. Two school board employees charged with the responsibility of developing and maintaining the security system for the Douglas campus opined the release of the requested footage would expose the system's weaknesses. More importantly, the risk of exposing weaknesses in the security system did not pertain to just the Douglas campus, but to other school campuses in the district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The trial court was free to reject the testimony and opinion of the school board witnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hay v. Hay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8447280,8447197,8447237\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/944/1043/\">\n    944 So.2d 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1046 (Fla. 4th DCA 2006) (\"The trial court is the judge of the facts and the credibility of the witnesses.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Santiago v.

However, assuming the trial court rejected the testimony, the appellee's failure to present countervailing evidence left the trial court with no evidence upon which to find the disclosure would \"\n   <em>\n    minimally\n   </em>\n   reveal information relating to the security system,\" or, more importantly, the weaknesses in the security system. To a lay person, it may seem that not knowing how many cameras were involved to generate the footage and how those cameras interface with other cameras in the system means the risk of exposure of weaknesses is minimal, but to persons knowledgeable about how security systems are designed and employed (through information mined from the internet or formal training), the requirement that the disclosure include all footages showing law enforcement presence would reveal information a lay person is unable to readily see and appreciate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   I completely agree that the public has the right to know and evaluate not only the response of law enforcement to an active shooter, but also what surveillance security measures school systems are using to detect the presence of unwanted intruders on public school campuses. Undoubtedly, the school board will be evaluated by the public on the already disclosed information that the surveillance camera system on the Douglas campus was not routinely monitored. But in granting an exemption to the public records law, for obvious safety reasons, the legislature did not intend for the public to know the\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   gaps in a security system. There was some evidence presented that the school board was assessing the need for changes to the current surveillance system. Once significant changes are made to the surveillance camera system, I would agree that the requested footage for February 14, 2018, should be released under the \"good faith\" exception, so the public can\n   have a better understanding of what happened that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   My final disagreement with the majority's opinion is that it does not address the request of the school board to further redact information in the video footage that reveals the camera number, the location of the camera, the camera angle, and where and how cameras are pointed at the perimeter of the campus. At a minimum, the school board's request should be granted to address the safety concerns I discuss in my dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   ON MOTION TO CERTIFY QUESTION OF GREAT PUBLIC IMPORTANCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   We deny the School Board's motion for certification.

As a matter of public safety for the children attending public schools in Broward County, or at least the Douglas campus, I simply contend the disclosure should be postponed until competent substantial evidence is presented that the public's right to know outweighs the safety risks of disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   I would certify to our supreme court the following question of great public importance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   WHEN IT IS DETERMINED THAT A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST \"RELATES DIRECTLY\" TO A SECURITY SYSTEM OF A PUBLIC BUILDING AND IS SPECIFICALLY EXEMPTED FROM DISCLOSURE UNDER SECTIONS 119.071(3)(A) AND 281.301(1), FLORIDA STATUTES, DOES THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO INFORMATION ABOUT GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS RESPONDING TO A VIOLENT ATTACK OCCURING IN A PUBLIC BUILDING CONSTITUTE A GOOD FAITH EXCEPTION TO THE EXEMPTION, WHERE THE DISCLOSURE COULD EXPOSE EXISTING GAPS IN A SECURITY SYSTEM, AND IF SO, TO WHAT EXTENT IS EXPERT EVIDENCE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE RISK OF EXPOSURE OF WEAKNESSES IN THE SECURITY SYSTEM?\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    The original Petition was filed by Cable News Network, Inc.; Miami Herald Media Company; and Sun-Sentinel Company, LLC.

Until cameras are enhanced, added, or relocated, security gaps in the existing system can be determined from the public disclosure.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
