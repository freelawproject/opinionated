Const. Art. VI, \u00a7 28, which permits a local governmental subdivision\n   to impose an occupational license tax not greater than that imposed by the state. This case is before us pursuant to our appellate jurisdiction, La. Const. Art. V, \u00a7 5 (D), because the ordinance has been declared unlawful and unconstitutional by the trial court. For the following reasons, we find the portion of the ordinance at issue is not an unconstitutional exercise of the City's taxing authority. We thus reverse the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   FACTS and PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 3, 2016, the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance to \"amend and reordain\" Sections 10-501, 10-502, and 10-511 of the New Orleans Municipal Code relative to the imposition and collection of \"an occupational license tax or excise tax on dealers of alcoholic beverages....\" Ord. No. 27179, Nov. 3, 2016. The ordinance, which is set forth in full below, was to take effect on January 1, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 2. The Beer Industry League of Louisiana and Wine and Spirits Foundation of Louisiana, Inc. filed a Petition for Injunctive Relief and Declaratory Judgment on December 22, 2016, against the defendants, the City of New Orleans and Norman S. Foster, then the Chief Financial Officer and the Director of Finance for the City of New Orleans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Louisiana Restaurant Association, Inc., on January 13, 2017, filed a similar petition, which was thereafter consolidated with the suit filed by the Beer Industry League and the Wine and Spirits Foundation, all of whom will be referred to as the plaintiffs. That same day the district court issued a temporary restraining order, which ordered the defendants \"restrained, enjoined, and prohibited from attempting to levy, or imposing, or collecting fees or taxes pursuant to New Orleans Code of Ordinances Secs. 10-501 and 10-511.\" The district court also set a hearing on the preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 30, 2017, the district court denied the preliminary injunction and dissolved the temporary restraining order previously issued. Thereafter, in April 2017, the City sent out a notice to certain alcohol dealers that it would begin enforcing the license taxes. The plaintiffs later filed a Motion to Escrow Funds seeking leave to deposit into the registry of the court any amounts collected pursuant to Section 10-501 et seq. The trial court granted the motion on August 30, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ordinance No. 27179 provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    AN ORDINANCE\n   </strong>\n   to amend and reordain Sections 10-501, 10-502, and 10-511 of the Code of the City of New Orleans, relative to imposition and collection of an occupational license tax or excise tax on dealers of alcoholic beverages, and to otherwise provide with respect thereto.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    WHEREAS\n   </strong>\n   , Article VI, Section 28 of the Louisiana Constitution authorizes a local governmental subdivision to impose an occupational license tax not greater than that imposed by the state; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    WHEREAS\n   </strong>\n   , Louisiana Revised Statutes 26:341 and 26:342 impose an excise or license tax on all beverages of high and low alcoholic content that are handled in the state; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    WHEREAS\n   </strong>\n   , the taxes imposed by the City of New Orleans are not greater\n   than those imposed by the state;\n   <strong>\n    NOW THEREFORE\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    SECTION 1.

The plaintiffs sought a judgment declaring Sections 10-501 and 10-511 of the Municipal Code unlawful and unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs asserted La. R.S. 47:360(D)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and La. R.S. 26:491\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   prohibit the imposition of occupational license taxes or license or excise taxes on wholesale dealers of alcohol. The plaintiffs eventually moved for partial summary judgment, seeking a declaration that certain parts of the City's ordinance were unlawful and unenforceable, namely Sections 10-501 and 10-511. The plaintiffs asserted the tax sought to be collected by the City was not an \"occupational license tax\" permitted under La. Const. Art. VI, \u00a7 28, which allows local governmental subdivisions to impose an occupational license tax not greater than that imposed by the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs argued the City's tax, which is referred to as the \"Gallonage Tax,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   was in addition to the limit of the occupational license taxes permitted by La. R.S. 47:354.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs argued Art. VI, \u00a7 28 does not permit local governments to impose an \"excise or license tax\" as described in Sections 10-501 and 10-511. The plaintiffs also argued La. R.S. 26:492(D) specifically prohibits municipalities from imposing a local tax on beverages of high and low alcohol content other than those imposed therein.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The City responded and also requested summary judgment asserting the excise or license taxes in Sections 10-501 and 10-511 were imposed in a manner \"consistent with the Louisiana Constitution, state law, and the City's Home Rule Charter.\" The City argued that La. Const. Art. VI, \u00a7 28 permits a local governmental subdivision to impose an occupational license tax not greater than that imposed by the state. The City asserted the state in La. R.S. 26:341 and 26:342 imposes an excise or license tax on all beverages of high and low alcoholic content that are handled in the state. The City argued this gallonage tax was an occupational license tax, and that the City therefore could impose a similar occupational license tax, so long as it did not exceed the limits of the state's occupational license tax. The City noted that its tax is substantially less than that imposed by the state statute. The City also argued that its home rule charter preceded the 1974 Constitution, and thus it retained all the powers to tax that were not inconsistent with the constitution. The City argued it validly exercised its independent taxing authority under La. Const. Art. VI, \u00a7 4 and its home rule charter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring Section 10-501 unlawful, unconstitutional, and unenforceable. The trial court found that the state gallonage tax, as set forth in La. R.S. 26:341 and 26:342, and mirrored by the City in Sections 10-501 and 10-511, was not an occupational license tax. The trial court found that the term \"occupational license tax\" or \"indirect\" tax is reserved for taxes imposed on the privilege of engaging in a particular activity, as opposed to a \"direct\" tax on designated property. The trial court reasoned that the gallonage tax is not exclusively imposed on the activity of being the first dealer in the state to handle a beverage with high alcohol content, but instead, the tax can be collected from any dealer in whose possession the beverage is found, if the first dealer escapes payment. The trial court reasoned that this provision \"makes liability for the tax more incidental to the possession of property than to the activity of dealing with it.\" The trial court also rejected the City's reliance on La. Const. Art. VI, \u00a7 4, noting the provision allows the City to retain only those home rule powers that are not inconsistent with the Louisiana Constitution, and that the gallonage tax is inconsistent with the constitutional provision vesting exclusive taxing authority in the state, except as otherwise provided in the constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The City now appeals the holding of the trial court. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the trial court's partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and find that Section 10-501 is neither unconstitutional nor unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   LAW and ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This case comes to us on a partial motion for summary judgment.

The City primarily contends the trial court erred in finding the gallonage tax is not an occupational license tax the City may constitutionally impose. Thus, we must decide whether the tax levied by the City on dealers who handle high alcohol content beverages is an occupational license tax permitted under La. Const. Art. VI, \u00a7 28. The plaintiffs contend the gallonage tax at issue is not expressly allowed by either the constitution or the legislature, and therefore is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   La. Const. Art. VII, \u00a7 1 (A) provides that \"Except as otherwise provided in this constitution, the power of taxation shall be vested in the legislature, shall never be surrendered, suspended, or contracted away, and shall be exercised for public purposes only.\" La. Const. Art. VII, \u00a7 30(A) provides that municipalities may exercise the power of taxation, but subject to the limitations elsewhere provided in the constitution under the authority granted by the legislature for parish, municipal, and other local purposes. However, La. Const. Art. VI, \u00a7 28 specifically allows municipalities to impose \"an occupational license tax\" no greater than that imposed by the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In amending and reordaining Sections 10-501 and 10-511, the City specifically referenced La. R.S. 26:341 and 26:342. The City and the plaintiffs disagree as to whether the gallonage tax set forth in the state statutes and the City's corresponding gallonage tax constitute occupational license taxes. If the state tax is an occupational license tax, then the City is authorized by the Louisiana Constitution to impose a similar tax under Art. VI, \u00a7 28. If the state gallonage tax is instead a tax directly on persons or property, then the City would be precluded from collecting it under La. Const. Art. VI, \u00a7 28. Accordingly, we must determine whether the state gallonage tax is an occupational license tax within the meaning of Art.

R.S. 47:341\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . La. R.S. 47:341, entitled \"Imposition of tax; municipalities\n   and parishes,\" provides that \"[a]ny municipality or parish shall have the right to impose a license tax on any person conducting any business herein enumerated within the territorial jurisdiction of the municipality or parish at a rate which shall not exceed the maximum tax rates set forth in this Chapter...,\" that is, Chapter 3 of Title 47. The plaintiffs correctly point out that wholesale dealers of alcohol are expressly exempt from the license tax authorized in Title 47 by virtue of a specific exemption set forth in La. R.S. 47:360. Yet, as the City points out, this provision by its own language expressly limits the exemption to a \"license tax imposed, assessed, or collected\n   <em>\n    under the provisions of this Chapter\n   </em>\n   ,\" that is, Chapter 3 of Title 47. La. R.S. 47:360(D) (emphasis supplied). The City contends, and we agree, this language contemplates that wholesale alcohol dealers may be assessed occupational license taxes pursuant to other chapters of the Revised Statutes,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Chapter 2 of Title 26 governing alcoholic beverage control and taxation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Indeed, Title 26 of the Revised Statutes, entitled \"Alcoholic Beverage Control Law,\" separately regulates alcohol sales as well as permitting and licensing requirements, with licensing and revenue provisions specific to the alcohol industry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   La. R.S. 26:341 and 26:344, found in Part III of Chapter 2, and entitled \"Gallonage Tax,\" require alcohol \"dealers\" to pay an \"excise or license tax\" that is based on the volume of all high alcoholic content beverages \"handled in Louisiana.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   This tax is \"in lieu of and exclusive of all other such state excise or license taxes.\" La. R.S. 26:343. As the City notes, there is no statutory exemption from these \"excise or license taxes\" for wholesale dealers of high alcoholic content beverages. \"Dealer\" for purposes of the Chapter is defined as \"every person who manufactures alcoholic beverages within Louisiana for handling in Louisiana or who imports alcoholic beverages from any state, territory, possession, or foreign country for handling in Louisiana or who, not being able to prove that the tax levied by this Chapter has been previously paid, sells, offers for sale, of has in possession for sale or other handling beverages of high alcoholic content.\" La. R.S. 26:241(4). \"Handle\" is defined as \"sell, use, distribute, store, consume, or otherwise handle.\" La. R.S. 26:241(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The City contends the gallonage tax is an occupational license tax because it indirectly taxes the handling of liquor and does not constitute a property tax upon the liquor itself. The gallonage tax expressly provides the tax is \"upon dealers,\" rather than consumers or the product itself. The tax is likewise triggered by business conduct, the City avers, namely the professional handling of alcohol, and designates a specific class of merchants (dealers) who are responsible for payment. The City argues the statute makes clear the gallonage tax is a prerequisite to the privilege of participating in the liquor industry by stating that dealers who fail to furnish the bond required by La. R.S. 26:348 in connection with the payment of state gallonage taxes may be ruled into court and\n   \"ordered to cease business as a dealer.\" La. R.S. 26:348(B)(2). Furthermore, \"[a]ny dealer who fails to file reports and pay the taxes due ... shall automatically be suspended from doing business and shall ... forfeit his bond.\" La. R.S. 26:354(H).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The plaintiffs counter that the characteristics of the state gallonage tax demonstrate that it is a direct tax on property in the control of whomever has possession of it and not an occupational license tax upon the activities of the dealer in handling the property. The plaintiffs point out that the language of La. R.S. 26:341 provides that it is a tax \"levied on all beverages of high alcoholic content handled in Louisiana.\" While it is collected by the \"dealer who first handles the alcoholic beverages in Louisiana,\" La. R.S. 26:344, the plaintiffs note the gallonage tax is described as \"taxes on beverages of high alcoholic content....\" La. R.S. 26:343. As noted previously, see Note 11, supra, the plaintiffs contend the legislature's recent revision of La. R.S. 26:341 striking the term \"license\" from the statute evinces the legislative intent to differentiate gallonage taxes from occupational license taxes of the sort contained in Title 47 or contemplated by La. Const. Art. VI, \u00a7 28. Further, the plaintiffs argue, La. R.S. 26:491 explicitly provides: \"No tax on the manufacture, distribution, transportation, or importation of alcoholic beverages shall be imposed by way of licenses, excise taxes, or otherwise by any police jury, municipality, or other local taxing authorities despite any special or general law to the contrary, except as expressly authorized by this Chapter.\" The plaintiffs contend that, other than for low alcoholic content beverages,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 26:492, there is no provision that authorizes municipalities to impose a tax similar to the state gallonage tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Occupational license tax is not defined in Art. VI, \u00a7 28 ; nor is it defined anywhere else in the Constitution or by statute. Therefore, we must examine the characteristics of the state gallonage tax to determine if it is a tax on activity or a tax on property.

The court first rejected the premise that the language of the taxing statute, to the effect that the tax was levied \"upon tobacco and tobacco products,\" required it to be classified as a tax on property.

The\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   court was required to determine whether the city's occupational license tax as measured by the gross sales of gasoline used in the generation of motive power was a prohibited \"excise, license or privilege tax\" on gasoline under the 1921 Constitution. The\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   court found that it was not a property tax, and explained as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   When a license tax is levied on [classes of persons, associations of persons and corporations pursuing any trade, business, occupation, vocation or profession], it is a tax levied on the activity or occupation of selling or otherwise dealing in or with certain property and perforce becomes a license, excise or privilege tax on the activity or occupation and not a direct tax on the property. It must be conceded that neither our general law nor our well-known jurisprudence recognizes an 'excise', 'license' or 'privilege' tax on property. It therefore becomes apparent that the tax levied by the Baton Rouge City Ordinance is not upon the gasoline itself as a property but is an excise, license or privilege tax levied upon the activity or occupation of selling at retail prices or otherwise dealing with gasoline or other motor fuels, i.e., an occupational license, excise or privilege tax which unmistakably means a tax upon the privilege of pursuing the said vocation or business or calling. Such an occupational tax has none of the attributes of an ad valorem tax. The tax does not fall upon the owner merely because of ownership. It is not measured by the value of gasoline and is not laid directly upon the property itself. The value of the gasoline may fluctuate at will by the\n   amount per gallon but the tax remains constant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3181739,9883975\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/la/236/521/\">\n    236 La. at 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3181739,9883975\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/la/236/521/\">\n    108 So.2d at 117-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Notably for our purposes, in examining the definition of an excise tax the\n    <em>\n     Roberts\n    </em>\n    court opined that an \"excise tax\"\n   </em>\n   has \"a wider and more comprehensive meaning\" than a license tax, and \" 'now includes every form of taxation which is not a burden levied directly upon persons or property, every form of charge imposed by public authority for the purpose of raising revenue upon the performance of an act, the enjoyment of a privilege, or the engaging in an occupation.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3181739,9883975\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/la/236/521/\">\n    236 La. at 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3181739,9883975\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/la/236/521/\">\n    108 So.2d at 115-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Ballentine's Law Dictionary, 1930 Ed, supplemented to 1954, p. 460).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Applying the reasoning of this court's jurisprudence, we find the state gallonage tax is an occupational license tax on dealers for the privilege of handling high alcoholic content beverages.
