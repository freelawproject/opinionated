Acting on that information, officers employed by the Housing Authority of New Orleans (\"HANO\")-Detective Marcus Dubuclet and his partner-conducted surveillance of the residence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the surveillance, Detective Dubuclet observed four or five non-resident males standing on a porch inside of a gated area in front of the residence engage in what he believed to be hand-to-hand narcotics transactions. They also appeared to be smoking marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In light of these observations, the officers obtained reinforcements and approached the group. Detective Dubuclet and his partner approached from the rear of the residence; the other officers approached from the front. As Detective Dubuclet was approaching, one of the other officers radioed that one of the males was holding what appeared to be a hand-rolled marijuana cigar. While Detective Dubuclet was still in the rear of the residence, the officers in the front approached and instructed the group to come to the gate. Instead, the defendant fled on foot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The officers in the front radioed that one of the males (the defendant) had fled. Detective Dubuclet gave chase. At some point during the chase, Officer Dubuclet and the defendant came face-to-face. Detective Dubuclet ordered the defendant to stop and advised him that he was under arrest. The defendant disregarded Detective Dubuclet's instruction and continued to flee. Detective Dubuclet resumed his pursuit of the defendant, during which Detective Dubuclet observed the defendant carrying a brown, hand-rolled cigar consistent with the description previously radioed by the other officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Detective Dubuclet apprehended the defendant. After a brief struggle, Detective Dubuclet placed the defendant under arrest and searched his person. During the search, Detective Dubuclet recovered the brown, hand-rolled cigar from the defendant's hand and a handful of pills from the defendant's front right pocket.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The hand-rolled cigar tested positive for marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On May 2, 2017, the State charged the defendant with possession with the intent to distribute methamphetamine, a felony violation of La. R.S. 40:967(A)(1) ; possession of tramadol, a felony violation of La. R.S. 40:969(C)(2) ; possession of oxycodone, a felony violation of La. R.S. 40: 967(C); possession of marijuana, a misdemeanor violation of La. R.S. 40:966(C)(1)(a) ; and resisting an officer, a misdemeanor violation of La.

On December 12, 2017, a hearing was held on the motion. At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court framed the issue as whether the police \"have to identify the insides of the hand[-]rolled cigarette in order to establish Probable Cause or is it enough that it looked like a hand[-]rolled cigarette which typically contains marijuana\" and requested that the parties brief that issue. After receiving the parties' briefs, the district court granted the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We granted the State's prior writ and vacated the district court's judgment. In doing so, we emphasized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [A]lthough the police \"may not detain individuals on the basis of an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch,\" the reviewing court should \"take into account\n   <em>\n    the totality of the circumstances in a process that allows the police to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available\n   </em>\n   to them that might well elude an untrained person.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although the officer did not actually see an object being passed between the two subjects, the officer believed that they were engaged in a hand-to-hand narcotics transaction. The officer conducted an investigatory stop of the defendant's vehicle. While approaching the defendant's vehicle, the officer observed the defendant make furtive movements. On arriving at the defendant's vehicle, the officer observed a blunt protruding from the lid of a cup just inside the defendant's vehicle.
