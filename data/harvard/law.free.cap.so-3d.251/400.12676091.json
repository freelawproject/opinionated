After remand, it is clear that defendant was misinformed of his sentencing exposure, i.e. he was told that he faced a sentence of life imprisonment without parole eligibility. We find that misinformation impeded his ability to make a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternatives. Therefore, we grant the application to remand to the district court with instructions that defendant be given the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   GENOVESE, J., would deny.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
