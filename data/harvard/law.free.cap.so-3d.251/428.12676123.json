After the parents' relationship ended, Mr. Miller, on August 1, 2014, filed a petition that sought to set custody and support. The parties stipulated to a joint custody arrangement, which designated Ms. Dicharry as the domiciliary parent and granted Mr. Miller physical custody on alternating weekends and a four-hour visit once per month. Following various motions by the parties, the trial court eventually issued a ruling that maintained Ms. Dicharry as domiciliary parent, but granted joint custody of the minor child with physical custody\n   to be shared equally. The ruling granting Mr. Miller joint custody was affirmed by this court in\n   <strong>\n    Miller v.

Mr. Miller indicated that he requested to be named domiciliary parent in order to make medical decisions for H.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 12, 2017, Ms. Dicharry filed a rule to modify visitation and child support, a motion for contempt, and a motion for a joint custody implementation plan. In her motions, Ms. Dicharry sought, among other things, modification of the 50/50 equal sharing to limit Mr. Miller's exercise of physical custody to every other weekend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following a hearing on August 7, 2017 in which the parties' motions were considered, the trial court issued both written reasons for judgment and a judgment on September 15, 2017. In its judgment, the trial court maintained the 50/50 custody arrangement with Ms. Dicharry as domiciliary parent, but ordered that Mr. Miller would have full authority to make medical decisions and ordered that H.M. be vaccinated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ms. Dicharry has appealed assigning the following as error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1. The district court erred by not finding that Mr. Miller resides in Texas and allowing him to continue the 50/50 custody arrangement[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2. The district court erred by granting Mr. Miller the right to make medical decisions and ordering that the parties' minor child be vaccinated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties have filed multiple pleadings with the trial court since the rendition of the September 15, 2017 judgment.

Ms. Dicharry avers that Mr. Miller never provided verification from his employer to show when he is off from work and that he will be able to exercise physical custody in Louisiana. Ms. Dicharry avers that Mr. Miller, in accordance with past practice, will likely bring H.M. to Texas during his custodial week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The paramount consideration in any determination of child custody is the best interest of the child.

When a trial court has made a considered decree of permanent custody, the party seeking a change bears the heavy burden of proving that the continuation of the present custody is \"so deleterious to the child as to justify a modification of the custody decree,\" or of proving by \"clear and convincing evidence that the harm likely to be caused by the change of environment is substantially outweighed by its advantages to the child.\"\n   <strong>\n    Bergeron v.

Accordingly, the trial court recognized that the heightened standard enunciated in\n   <strong>\n    Bergeron\n   </strong>\n   applied. In its reasons for judgment, the trial court found that Mr. Miller had been temporarily living in Texas during a training program for his employment. However, the trial court also noted that Mr. Miller indicated that once his training period-which was near completion-was over, and assuming he was hired by the company, he would be working on a week on/week off rotation in Texas. Mr. Miller testified that he would be able to spend his custodial week in Louisiana and work in Texas during his non-custodial week. Because Mr. Miller could exercise physical custody of H.M. in Louisiana, the trial court did not find a material change in circumstances to warrant changing its prior 50/50 custody order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court also acknowledged Ms. Dicharry's concerns about H.M. traveling to Texas and set limitations to alleviate those concerns. Specifically, the trial court ordered that physical custody be exercised in Louisiana. Additionally, the trial court ordered that if Mr. Miller was \"called to work in Texas during his custodial period, Mr. Miller will give the right of first refusal to Ms. Dicharry.\" Considering the foregoing, we cannot conclude that the trial court was manifestly erroneous in its factual determination, nor did it abuse its discretion in declining to change its prior custody order. Accordingly, Ms. Dicharry's first assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In her second assignment of error, Ms. Dicharry contends that the trial court erred by granting Mr. Miller, the non-domiciliary parent, the right to make medical decisions and ordering immunizations for H.M. Ms. Dicharry notes that she has always been the domiciliary parent and her decisions are presumed to be in the best interest of the child, and Mr. Miller must demonstrate otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LSA-R.S. 9:335(B)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Dicharry avers the\n   mere fact that she is opposed to immunizations was not sufficient grounds to warrant granting Mr. Miller the right to make medical decisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Dicharry contends that the trial court did not find that her refusal to vaccinate H.M. was not in the child's best interest, nor did the trial court find that there had been a material change in circumstances to justify a custody modification in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When parties are awarded joint custody, the court shall designate a domiciliary parent \"except when there is an implementation order to the contrary or for other good cause shown.\" LSA-R.S. 9:335(B)(1). Courts have inherent power to determine a child's best interest and to tailor a custody order that minimizes the risk of harm to the child.\n   <strong>\n    Lawson v. Lawson,\n   </strong>\n   48,296 (La.App. 2 Cir. 7/24/13),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7000177\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/121/769/#p774\">\n    121 So.3d 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 774. The trial court noted that the parties could not agree on medical decisions that must be made for the child, including whether the child should be vaccinated. The trial court retained Ms. Dicharry as domiciliary parent, but ordered that Mr. Miller have the authority to make medical decisions for H.M. and ordered that H.M., pursuant to Mr. Miller's request, be vaccinated. The trial court also provided that all medical, surgical, and dental records be made available and accessible to both parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Contrary to Ms. Dicharry's assertions, the trial court did not base its decision solely on Ms. Dicharry's belief that the child should not be vaccinated. Rather, the trial court, after considering the parties' testimony, found that Ms. Dicharry \"will not follow the standard medical practices recommended by pediatricians involved in the child's case.\" Specifically, Mr. Miller testified that he and Ms. Dicharry have \"gone down the avenue of trying to discuss and consult [about health care], and time and time again there's just been too many missed opportunities, direct violations of recommendations from the doctors, threats of lawsuits and being discharged from practices.\" In reviewing the evidence, the trial court noted that Mr. Miller presented a letter from Hansbrough, Peters, Traxler &amp; Scallan which stated that H.M. was discharged from their practice due to \"non[-]compliance of recommended medical care, and verbal threats of legal restitution from the mother.\" Ms. Dicharry testified that she never threatened to sue any physicians, but that some doctors \"did not want us in their practice because we couldn't agree on medical.\" Mr. Miller testified that he had never had any issues with H.M.'s physicians and that he would not do anything to cause them to resign or withdraw from caring for H.M. Additionally, the trial court also found that Ms. Dicharry, in contravention of its prior judgment, had failed to provide Mr. Miller notice seventy-two hours prior to scheduled doctor's appointments. Considering the trial court's factual determinations, we find no error in its conclusion that Mr. Miller met his burden to show \"good cause\" to grant him authority to make medical decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ms. Dicharry also contends that the trial court erred in ordering that H.M. be vaccinated. Ms. Dicharry contends that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution grants a parent the unilateral right to refuse routine immunization on religious grounds. Ms. Dicharry further avers that given the presumption afforded the decisions of domiciliary parents, a finding that her refusal to immunize was not in the best interest of the child has no basis in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   When questioned about the specifics of her religious beliefs against vaccinations, the following colloquy occurred between counsel and Ms. Dicharry:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Mr. Prendergast: Let's talk about doctors.

The trial judge recused himself, noting that while any purported relationship did not prejudice the case, he would recuse on the basis that \"it can cause an appearance of impropriety.\" The remainder of the pleadings do not appear in our record, but have been referenced in Mr. Miller's appellee brief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Louisiana Revised Statutes 9:335(B)(3) provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n    The domiciliary parent shall have authority to make all decisions affecting the child unless an implementation order provides otherwise. All major decisions made by the domiciliary parent concerning the child shall be subject to review by the court upon motion of the other parent.
