Phillip Moore, Gloria Moore, and Katelyn Moore sued Olshan Foundation Repair of Jackson, LLC (Olshan), and Wayne Brown in Perry County Circuit Court. Olshan and Brown sought to compel arbitration pursuant to an arbitration provision within a contract between Phillip Moore and Olshan for the repair of the foundation of the Moores' home. The circuit court ordered Phillip and Gloria Moore to arbitrate their claims. But because the circuit court declined to order Katelyn Moore to the arbitral forum, Olshan and Brown now appeal. We affirm the judgment of the Perry County Circuit Court denying the motion to compel arbitration filed by Olshan and Brown as to Katelyn Moore's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. On June 10, 2013, Phillip Moore contracted\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   with Olshan for repairs to the\n   foundation of the home he shared with his wife, Gloria Moore, and his adult daughter, Katelyn Moore. Phillip, Gloria, and Katelyn Moore sued Olshan and Brown in the Circuit Court of Perry County on April 29, 2016, requesting\n   <em>\n    contract\n   </em>\n   damages solely for Phillip Moore and Gloria Moore, including damages related to loss of value and expenses to repair their home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Katelyn Moore alleged intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress. The only remedy she sought is found in the unnumbered prayer for relief, separate and apart from the contract damages sought by Phillip Moore and Gloria Moore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. After Olshan and Brown moved to compel arbitration, the circuit court held a hearing. It then entered an order granting the motion with respect to Phillip and Gloria Moore's claims while denying the motion as it pertains to Katelyn Moore's claims. Regarding Katelyn Moore's claims, the circuit court reasoned that the terms of the contract were not broad enough to include Katelyn as a third-party beneficiary of the agreement and that the arbitration agreement could not be enforced against Katelyn on the grounds of estoppel \"as her claims are not based solely on the terms of the contract.\" The circuit court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Katelyn asserts claims for intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress and negligence which could be pursued regardless of whether or not there was a contract. Moreover, due to ambiguity in the Complaint, it is not clear to the [c]ourt if Katelyn is seeking to assert claims for breach of contract and breach of warranty. Those claims more properly belong to Phillip and Gloria.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court further held that Katelyn Moore was neither a third-party beneficiary nor a direct beneficiary of the Olshan contract, because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   the terms of the contract were not expressly broad enough to include Katelyn as a third-party by name or as one of a specified class, as Katelyn was not an\n   owner of the property. Furthermore, Katelyn was not a direct beneficiary of the contract. The fact that Katelyn resides in the home makes her an incidental, not direct beneficiary of the construction work performed by Olshan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rein v.

The circuit court held that the arbitration provision in the foundation-repair contract between Phillip Moore and Olshan was valid and enforceable and that Gloria Moore was a third-party beneficiary. Phillip and Gloria Moore declined to cross-appeal the circuit court's decision that the arbitration agreement was valid and enforceable respecting their claims. Accordingly, the validity of the arbitration provision, itself, is not before the Court. The only question is whether Katelyn Moore, a nonsignatory, is bound to arbitrate her claims against Olshan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7.

On February 27, 1925, the railroad, having conceived at that time the idea that, because Sideboard was not, and could not be, a member of the union, he could not enforce any rights under the union contract.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Sideboard was notified that on and after March 16, 1925, he would no longer be paid wages for the job he was performing, but rather would be paid lesser wages for a different job.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Sideboard continued working, and checks were sent to him regularly at the new, lower rate, stipulating that he was paid in full for services rendered.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Sideboard accepted and cashed the checks from March 16, 1925, to March 1, 1927, during all of which time Sideboard was appealing for recognition of his right to equal pay, by letter and by personal interviews from officer to officer of the railroad company, by successive steps finally to the president of the entire railroad system based in Chicago, Illinois. The appeals were met with consistent and persistent refusal, and finally, when he saw that there was no possibility of any change of attitude on the part of the railroad, Sideboard declined to accept or cash any further pay checks on and after March 1, 1927, and went without accepting or cashing the paychecks for an additional year, until the railroad discharged Sideboard from service.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Sideboard prevailed in a jury trial in Warren County.

As the majority recognizes, a party is bound by the principles of direct-benefit estoppel where the party \"seek[s] to enforce the terms of that contract or assert[s] claims that must be determined by reference to that contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Scruggs v.

Despite the majority's insistence otherwise, Katelyn (herself or, in the alternative, through her mother as her next friend and natural guardian) has asserted claims that must be determined by reference\n   to the contract. Under the complaint, Katelyn brought all five counts against Olshan and Brown. While the majority is quick to note the clear intent of the parties concerning the application of Mississippi law, it wholly ignores the Moores' admission on appeal that Katelyn brought all five counts in the complaint. On appeal, the Moores (including Katelyn) bluntly declare:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Katelyn, along with her parents Phillip and Gloria Moore, sued Olshan and Wayne Brown, as the employee and GM of Olshan, in Perry County Circuit Court for breach of contract, breach of warranty, negligence, fraud, and Intentional/Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (INIED) claims stemming from Olshan's failure to competently repair their foundation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This admission is nothing new, though, as the Moores (including Katelyn), in their response to the motion to compel, argued that \"[b]ecause the Moores' claims all\n   <em>\n    arise out of the same occurrence\n   </em>\n   , the claims should be resolved together, either through arbitration or trial.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 26. Instead of deferring to the language of the complaint and the Moores' claims, the majority is forced to draw the distinction that Katelyn has brought only count five against Olshan and Brown. This distinction is unsupported by the complaint and the entire record both in the circuit court and on appeal. The majority's attempt to justify its interpretation of the complaint by recognizing that Katelyn's damages were alleged separately is unavailing in light of the language of the complaint paired with the Moores' own understanding of the claims brought. Even if the circuit court was correct to interpret the complaint's use of the term \"the Moores\" as excluding Katelyn, Katelyn's continued insistence on appeal that she brought the claims alongside her parents renders this interpretation on appeal untenable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 27. Had Katelyn brought only count five, though, her claim still should be arbitrated. As to count five, the complaint's specific reference to Katelyn does not allege a cause of action against Olshan or Brown without the surrounding context of the breach-of-contract claims. As to Katelyn, count five states \"Katelyn Moore has autism and other mental complications which cause emotional distress due to limited coping skills with physical manifestations of migraine headaches.\" Alone, these allegations do not allege any cause of action against Olshan and Brown. Instead, the allegations claim that Katelyn's autism and other mental complications caused her emotional distress. These are, at best, damages. Only when the allegations are read in conjunction with the first phrase of Phillip's claim does Katelyn's claim become actionable. The first phrase of Phillip's claim in count five provides: \"Due to the actions of Olshan, as previously described in the statement of facts, and its negligence and breach of contract....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 28. The majority's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   is misplaced: in both those cases the Court declined to apply equitable estoppel, as the parties at issue were not bringing contact claims.\n   <em>\n    Simmons Housing, Inc. v.
