In the first iteration of this case, the chancery court examined the principles underlying\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   and found that Vincent Castigliola and David Kiyhet, attorneys for the estate of Dane Eubanks, should be awarded attorneys' fees from two minors out of a settlement they, and only they, obtained. After remand from this Court, the chancery court, for the second time, heard arguments as to whether Castigliola and Kiyhet should be awarded attorneys' fees from the two minors based on\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   out of the settlement they obtained. The remand required that the chancery court make specific findings of fact. This time, again without making any findings of fact and without any contradictory evidence being introduced, the chancery court reversed course and found that the factors for\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   were not met. Because the chancery court failed to follow remand instructions by failing to make findings of fact, and, because no contradictory evidence was adduced suggesting the factors for\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   were suddenly not met, this Court reverses and remands the\n   case for a further determination of attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. This case returns to this Court after a remand to the trial court regarding the determination of attorneys' fees. In 2006, sixteen-year-old Dane Eubanks was killed in an automobile accident. He was survived by his father, David Eubanks,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   his mother, Cecilia Eubanks, his brother Seth Eubanks, his maternal half-brother, Aiden Borries, and his paternal half-siblings, Allison Eubanks and David Eubanks Jr. He was also survived by his former stepfather, Kenny Borries, the father of Aiden. His mother, Cecilia Eubanks, signed a contingency-fee contract with attorney David Kihyet to file a wrongful-death suit. She then filed petitions to probate and to approve the contingency fee contract in the Chancery Court of Jackson County, which were approved. The court appointed Cecilia as administratrix.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Cecilia pursued a wrongful death claim against the driver of the vehicle in which Dane was a passenger. Allstate Insurance Company (\"Allstate\"), the insurer of the driver, offered to settle the case for $100,000, the bodily injury limits of the insured's policy. Cecilia filed a complaint to settle the wrongful death claim and to determine the heirs and wrongful death beneficiaries, which Kathy Huber, the mother of Allison and David Jr., joined. The chancery court approved the settlement, named Cecilia, Seth, Aiden, Allison, and David Jr. as the sole heirs and wrongful death beneficiaries, and ordered that the settlement proceeds be distributed equally.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. Meanwhile, Cecilia filed an uninsured-motorist claim under Kenny Borries's commercial-vehicle insurance policy with Allstate, arguing that Dane was a \"foster child\" under that policy. Allstate filed an action for a declaratory judgment in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, asking the court to declare that no uninsured motorist coverage existed for Dane under Borries's Allstate policy. The Estate and Cecilia filed a counterclaim arguing that Dane was covered by Borries's policy and that he was entitled to uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance coverage. It noted that \"[t]he injuries suffered by Dane Eubanks in the collision in issue resulted in compensable damages for pain, suffering, mental anguish, medical expenses, funeral expenses, loss of future earnings and other damages.\" Because of the complexity of the federal court litigation, Kihyet associated Vincent Castigliola Jr. as cocounsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. The parties held a settlement conference, at which they agreed to settle the claims for $250,000. Kihyet and Castigliola endeavored to maximize the settlement during the conference. Indeed, Allstate represented in federal court that Kihyet and Castigliola refused to settle for a lesser amount for the specific reason that the settlement would have to be split five ways. At the end of the settlement conference, Kihyet and Castigliola indicated to Allstate that they believed that Allison and David Jr. should not share in the settlement. The parties then agreed to allow the\n   chancery court to give final approval to the settlement and to decide any issues surrounding which individuals were entitled to share in the settlement proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. In the chancery court, the Estate and Cecilia maintained that the federal court settlement was for a contract claim and thus enured to the benefit of the Estate, and, accordingly, should be distributed to the heirs of the Estate,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the wrongful death beneficiaries. The Estate and Cecilia argued that Allison and David Jr., as half-siblings, were not heirs under Mississippi law, but conceded that they were wrongful death beneficiaries. Cecilia and the Estate sought clarification from the federal court regarding what claims the federal court case and settlement encompassed. Huber moved to intervene in the motion to clarify, but the district court denied the motion, finding that her children's interests were already represented. The federal court found that there was a valid meeting of the minds to settle \"all of the claims by the Estate which included a later division by the Estate to the five adjudicated heirs and wrongful death beneficiaries.\" It further found that \"how the proceeds are divided within the Estate is left to be determined by the Chancery Court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. The chancery court then divided the settlement equally among Cecilia, Seth, Aiden, Allison, and David Jr. The chancery court determined that \"since the settlement was to include all claims of the heirs and wrongful death beneficiaries, the proceeds should be divided equally pursuant to the Wrongful Death Statute.\" The chancery court also awarded attorneys' fees to Kihyet and Castigliola in the amount of their contingency fee of forty percent. It noted that the facts and issues were very close to those found in\n   <em>\n    Pannell v. Guess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7449738\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/671/1310/\">\n    671 So.2d 1310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1996). The court found that \"\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the attorneys for Cecilia and the Estate contributed to the acquisition of settlement proceeds.\" It further found that \"the sums obtained from Allstate would not have occurred but for their efforts.\" It determined that, while Allison and David Jr. were not bound by the contingency fee contract, they benefitted from the attorneys' work on the settlement. Based on\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   , the court calculated that attorneys' fees would amount to $226,000, for which Allison and David Jr. would be responsible for one-fifth each, two-fifths total. It calculated that, even if it discounted the attorneys' hourly rates due to their later having taken an adverse position to Allison and David Jr.,\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   would still result in total fees of $156,875. If the court held Allison and David Jr. to the forty percent contingency fee, the overall award of attorneys' fees for the entire settlement (including the earlier $100,000 settlement) was $140,000, which would render the portion Allison and David Jr. were to pay as $28,000 each, or $56,000 total. Thus, it ruled that \"in light of these calculations that although none of the minor children were bound by the contingency fee contract, the fee imposed therefrom is reasonable and more beneficial to the children than a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   based calculation.\" Based on the $250,000 settlement, the court then awarded attorneys' fees in the amount of $100,000, with Allison and David Jr. paying their equal shares of that. Huber appealed the award of attorneys' fees against Allison and David Jr., and Cecilia and the Estate cross-appealed, arguing that the chancellor erred by dividing the settlement equally among the wrongful-death beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. The Court of Appeals affirmed the chancery court's decision to divide the settlement equally among the wrongful-death beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Eubanks v.

This is especially true when the chancery court appeared to earlier find that the\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   factors\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   met, and then, without explanation or findings, simply reversed course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 13. The dissent claims that the chancery court was ordered only to make findings if it granted attorneys' fees. Yet, the Court of Appeals ordered the chancery court to make findings regarding its determination. It did not limit the requirement of findings only to a determination if the chancery court found for one of the parties, but not the other. The Court of Appeals stated: \"we reverse and remand to the chancery court for a determination of the attorneys' entitlement to the fee ... and for the chancery court to provide sufficient, detailed factual findings to aid and enable appellate review.\"\n   <em>\n    Eubanks I\n   </em>\n   , 197 So.3d at 894. Notably, the Court of Appeals did not state that factual findings would not aid and enable appellate review if the chancery court found that\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   existed; and indeed, in this exact situation, factual findings would aid and enable our appellate review. Regarding its mandate, the Court of Appeals cited Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 52(b) and\n   <em>\n    Topp\n   </em>\n   . Rule 52(b) states that \"[u]pon motion of a party ... or upon its own initiative ... , the court may amend its findings\n   or make additional findings and may amend the judgment accordingly.\" Miss. R. Civ. P. 52(b). Rule 52(b) does not qualify that the findings should only be made if the court finds for one party, but not for the other. Rule 52(a) states that in actions without a jury \"the court may, and shall upon the request of any party to the suit or when required by these rules, find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon ....\" Miss. R. Civ. P. 52(a).\n   <em>\n    Topp\n   </em>\n   cites Rule 52(a) and states that, while Rule 52(a) vests the trial court with discretion in making findings of fact and conclusions of law, \"[t]hat discretion ... should be exercised soundly consistent with established principles regarding the sound and efficient administration of justice. Trial and appellate courts have separate institutional roles.

The attorneys' goal in settling the doubtful claim in this case was to maximize settlement for all, without regard to how that settlement would ultimately be distributed. Only after settlement was achieved did the attorneys attempt to exclude Allison and David Jr. As in\n   <em>\n    Pannell v.

Certainly, in the case at hand, Kiyhet and Castigliola should not receive any payment from Allison and David Jr. for their work on how to distribute the proceeds of the settlement, as, in this regard, they worked against the interests of Allison and David Jr. However, Kiyhet and Castigliola obtained the settlement for the benefit of all who were to share in it, which ultimately included Allison and David Jr. Indeed, the federal court counterclaim stated that it was on behalf of the Estate and the wrongful death beneficiaries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cecilia's deposition in that case indicated that she understood that the half-siblings would share in the recovery. Allstate represented that Kiyhat and Castigliola refused to settle for a smaller amount because of the five-way division of the settlement. Even the federal court found that \"there was a valid meeting of the minds that Allstate agreed to pay $250,000 to the Estate for the settlement of all of the claims by the Estate which included a later division by the Estate to the five adjudicated heirs and wrongful death beneficiaries.\" Thus, they provided valuable services for Allison and David Jr. And Allison and David Jr. derived benefit from the efforts of Kiyhet and Castigliola, and they explicitly acquiesced to the settlement amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   They certainly accepted the money. Further, they had notice that Kiyhet and Castigliola expected to be paid from the settlement proceeds; indeed, they do not appear to complain about the attorneys' fees taken out of their portion of the first, $100,000 settlement. Thus, Kiyhet and Castigliola did perform services for Allison and David Jr., because they provided services to maximize the settlement for any and all who were to share in the proceeds, as explicitly recognized by the federal district court and Allstate. Only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the settlement was maximized to the benefit of all sharing in the proceeds\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   did Kiyhet and Castigliola take positions adverse to Allison and David Jr.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The chancery court appeared to be frustrated with the fact that Allison and David Jr., one of whom had no relationship to the deceased and the other who had little or no relationship with him, and neither of whom endeavored to spend the money to defend the suit from which this settlement arose, would reap the full financial benefit of the settlement without paying the attorneys who achieved that settlement for them. Yet, it then simply reversed its course without contradictory evidence, and without findings it declared that\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   was not met. It appears that the factors of\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   were met; yet, the appellate courts are again faced with the proposition of reviewing the chancery court's decision on this issue without any specific findings of fact, despite the record indicating that the chancery court changed\n   course without reviewing contradictory evidence and despite an explicit mandate from the Court of Appeals to make findings of fact on this issue to enable appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 17. To be certain, attorneys' fees associated with the motion to clarify in federal court should be deducted if the chancellor finds that\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   is met. However, Allison and David Jr. clearly derived a benefit from the settlement negotiations with Allstate pursuant to the federal court action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Franklin v.

During the settlement negotiations, the objective of Kiyhet and Castigliola was to maximize the monetary amount of the settlement. While they did raise concerns about Allison and David Jr. sharing in the settlement, Allstate refused to address those concerns and all parties agreed that the chancery court would decide the issue of the division of the settlement. Thus, only attorneys' fees and expenses incurred during and after the federal court settlement negotiations should be deducted from the calculation of Allison's and David Jr.'s equitable portion of those legal costs if the chancellor finds\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   is met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 18. The chancery court abused its discretion by reversing course on the\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   issue without the findings of fact it was specifically ordered to make. The factors of\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   do appear from the record to be met in this case, and the chancery court must make detailed findings on remand regarding its decision on\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   , whether it decides the\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   factors are met or are not met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3.

Eubanks argues alternatively that Kiyhet and Castigliola are due attorneys' fees based on the common-fund doctrine.

Because the chancery court again failed to make findings of fact to enable appellate review, and because the chancery court, without contradictory evidence or any explanation, reversed its determination in the first iteration of this case, this Court reverses the chancery court judgment and remands the case with specific instructions that the chancery court determine whether Allison and David Jr. should pay an equitable amount of attorneys' fees, and that the chancery court make specific and detailed findings of fact to support its decision, sufficient to enable appellate review. If the chancery court determines that attorneys' fees are warranted, it must be sure to disallow any fees connected to time spent contrary to the interests of Allison and David Jr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 21.\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   WALLER, C.J., KITCHENS, P.J., AND BEAM, J., CONCUR; RANDOLPH, P.J., CONCURS WITH ANALYSIS IN PARTS 1 AND 2 AND IN RESULT.

I also agree that the case should be remanded for the chancery court to clarify why its conclusion changed from the finding that\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   was met under the facts of this case to the finding that\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   was not met, as no contradictory evidence was entered at the hearing after the initial remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   I write separately as I believe the common-fund doctrine should be applied by the chancery court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 23.

The issue of Kihyet's and Castigliola's subsequent, possible conflicts of interest are tangential to their recovery of the fee. I would not condone any alleged, potential conflict of interest. Neither should the chancery court award any fee for time spent adverse to Allison and David Jr. However, as those conflicts are subsequent to the settlement, they are a dispute between Allison and David Jr. and Kihyet and Castigliola which should be settled in a different forum if Allison and David Jr. still are aggrieved after the chancery court's determination of a reasonable fee.

Further, I would instruct the chancery court to consider an award of attorneys' fees under the common-fund doctrine and agree with the majority that the chancery court should clarify why its decision as to\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   changed without any intervening, contradictory evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   RANDOLPH, P.J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    David had little to no contact with Dane, and, during these lawsuits, his parental rights were terminated and he was not a party to any of the litigation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    This settlement was for bodily injury to the decedent and is not subject to this appeal.

Eubanks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6786966\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/197/878/#p893\">\n    197 So.3d 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. Ct. App. 2014) (\n   <em>\n    Eubanks I\n   </em>\n   ). Contrary to the position taken by the majority, the chancellor did not violate the Court of Appeals' mandate when it reversed course and found that the elements of\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   were not met. Moreover, given the standard of review, the chancellor did not err in refusing to award a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   payment to attorneys who actively worked against the interests of the would-be payees. Accordingly, and with respect, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The chancellor violated no mandate.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 29. As the majority documents, after we granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   to review the Court of Appeals' opinion in\n   <em>\n    Eubanks I\n   </em>\n   , we split evenly on the issue of whether the facts of the case warranted a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   award. As detailed in our\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   opinion, the Court of Appeals' opinion on the issue therefore controlled.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Eubanks v. Eubanks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6786943\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/197/861/\">\n    197 So.3d 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 871 (\u00b6 52) (Miss. 2015) (\n   <em>\n    Eubanks II\n   </em>\n   ) . After detailing several factual shortcomings in the record, the Court of Appeals wrote, \"Such a basis for compensation\n   <em>\n    falls short of the showing required by quantum meruit recovery\n   </em>\n   , particularly against unrepresented minors, where the record shows no notice, informed consent, or acquiescence on behalf of David Jr. and Allison.\"\n   <em>\n    Eubanks I\n   </em>\n   , 197 So.3d at 893 (\u00b6 45) (emphasis added). Later, the Court directed the chancellor, \"We remand for further proceedings\n   <em>\n    for the chancellor to determine entitlement to the claimed fee\n   </em>\n   and to provide express findings in support thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 893 (\u00b6 46). The Court of Appeals' majority did not require the detailed factual findings the majority faults the chancellor for not providing, unless the chancellor awarded fees. The chancellor did not do so and, therefore, did not violate the applicable mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The chancellor did not err when, upon remand, she held that the attorneys who acted in direct conflict to the interests of the minors were not entitled to\n    <em>\n     quantum meruit\n    </em>\n    recovery.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 30.

In her July 2015 Judgment, the chancellor acknowledged the above-discussed directive from the Court of Appeals, writing, \"[T]he Court of Appeals instructed that in further proceedings the chancellor should determine entitlement to the claimed fee and to provide express findings in support thereof.\" She then found that \"insufficient evidence was offered to show that the\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   factors have been met.\" Although the majority and I disagree regarding whether the Court of Appeals' opinion required the chancellor to beef up her findings of fact should she find a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   award inappropriate, we have sufficient facts in the record to affirm her decision. I see no point in remanding the case to the chancellor when the record before us shows that she correctly decided the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 32. When we considered the instant matter after granting\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   before, I joined the four members of the Court who\n   would have held on appeal that the elements of\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   were not met.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eubanks II\n   </em>\n   , 197 So.3d at 870-871 (\u00b6\u00b6 50-52). Specifically, we would have held that the attorneys could not prove the second element, that they rendered valuable services on behalf of the minors they sought to charge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 871 (\u00b6 50). On behalf of the four, Presiding Justice Dickinson wrote as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Here, the second element clearly was not satisfied. Castigliola and Kiyhet were retained to represent the estate and engaged in settlement negotiations on behalf of the estate. What is more, Castigliola argued that he never represented David Jr. and Allison; he actively sought to preclude their recovery altogether of any portion of the settlements; he attempted to have the chancellor change her prior adjudication of beneficiaries and exclude David Jr. and Allison; and he worked to reduce the portion they finally obtained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 871 (\u00b6 51). It remains true that the conflict of interest between the attorneys and the minors created by the attorneys' active litigation against the minors' interest and Castigliola's admission that he never represented the minors conclusively demonstrate that the services rendered by the attorneys were not on the minors' behalf. The doctrine of\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   applies to situations where there is no legal contract but where the person sought to be charged is in possession of money or property which in good conscience and justice he should not retain but should deliver to another, the courts imposing a duty to refund the money or the use value of the property to the person to whom in good conscience it ought to belong.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Fitzner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9182404\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/881/164/#p174\">\n    881 So.2d 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 174 (\u00b6 25) (Miss. 2003) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hans v.

The Court should be loathe to hold that an attorney, whose actions toward a party in litigation would have constituted a serious ethical breach had the party in question actually been a client, should \"in good conscience and justice\" be paid by said party.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
