Mrs. Doty answered the appeal and is requesting that we award her additional attorney fees on appeal. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 6, 2015, Mrs. Doty filed suit against Brittany Nicole Fontenot, her\n   liability insurer, GoAuto Insurance Company, and her own uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM) insurer, State Farm, alleging that she suffered\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   damages as the result of a motor vehicle accident on March 28, 2015, in which her husband, Homer Doty, was struck while a pedestrian at the Prien Lake Mall in Lake Charles, Louisiana. According to the petition, Mr. and Mrs. Doty were walking in a pedestrian crosswalk when Ms. Fontenot struck Mr. Doty. Mrs. Doty heard her husband yell, turned, and saw Mr. Doty laying on the ground. Also according to the petition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Homer's immediate injuries were severe, including a fractured left foot, contusions on his legs, elbow, arms, and a concussion. These injuries led to Homer also being diagnosed with cellulitis (infection) of the legs, arms, and foot, chronic pain, bladder infections, anxiety, dementia, and paraplegia, causing him to be confined for 28 days to a hospital followed by being transferred to a nursing home for 54 days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The petition went on to assert that under State Farm's policy, Mrs. Doty's\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   damages represent a separate \"bodily injury,\" entitling her to recover above and beyond the money already paid to Mr. Doty. She demanded the limits of the policy plus penalties and attorney fees for what she alleged was State Farm's arbitrary and capricious refusal to pay. Mrs. Doty settled her claims with Ms. Fontenot and GoAuto, and dismissed them from the suit in March 2016, reserving her demands against all other persons, including, while not specifically naming, State Farm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 17, 2017, State Farm filed a motion for summary judgment in which it asserted that its policy limits had been exhausted with the payment of its full \"per person\" bodily injury limit of $50,000.00 to Mr. Doty. State Farm's argument was based upon its policy language, which provided (emphasis in original):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Limits\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1.

State Farm Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , 93-509 (La. 2/28/94),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7466594,7466515\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/632/736/\">\n    632 So.2d 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to entitle recovery of\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   damages under a separate per-person limit. The trial court denied State Farm's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The matter proceeded to trial. The evidence demonstrated that Mr. Doty was struck by Ms. Fontenot, who the parties stipulated was solely at fault. After the accident, Ms. Doty chose to drive Mr. Doty to West Cal-Cam Medical Center in Sulphur rather than have him transported to the nearer St. Patrick's Hospital in Lake Charles or Lake Charles Memorial Hospital. At West Cal-Cam, x-rays of Mr. Doty's ankle were misread, and he was diagnosed with sprain, whereas it was later determined that his left foot was fractured. Mr. Doty suffered throughout the weekend until Mrs. Doty took him to St. Patrick's, where his foot fracture was properly diagnosed. As a result of infection, Mr. Doty remained at St. Patrick's for twenty-eight days and another fifty-four days in rehabilitation at a nursing home. Mrs. Doty remained with her husband almost constantly while he was hospitalized and as much as the nursing home would allow while Mr. Doty was in rehab. Mrs. Doty was seen by Dr. Keith Lechtenberg of Lake Charles, who diagnosed her with anxiety that he attributed to her husband's condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The trial court awarded Mrs. Doty $50,000.00 in general damages, a $25,000.00 penalty for State Farm's arbitrary and capricious refusal to pay her UM claim within thirty days of written proof pursuant to La.R.S. 22:1892(B)(1), attorney fees of $11,175.00, expenses of $5,773.59, plus costs of court. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   State Farm assigns the following errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1) Denying its motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether it payment to Homer Doty exhausted its policy limits;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   2) Finding that the mental anguish suffered by Mrs. Doty rose to the level required in a\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   claim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   3) The award to Mrs. Doty was excessive; and,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   4) Awarding Mrs. Doty a penalty and attorney fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mrs. Doty answered the appeal and seeks additional penalties and attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of error 1\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A denial of summary judgment is an interlocutory judgment not subject to appeal; ordinarily, we are asked to review these through applications for supervisory writs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Louviere v.

Trial was held in this case; the speedy determination of the matter summary judgment could have prevented has been rendered moot. Accordingly, we will simply review the contention that Mrs. Doty's claims are subject to the same per-person UM limit from which Mr. Doty was compensated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Crabtree\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7466594,7466515\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/632/736/\">\n    632 So.2d 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , State Farm, which was the liability insurer of the tortfeasor, argued that the plaintiff-wife's\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   claim was \"derivative\" of her husband's bodily injuries; thus, the same per-person liability coverage limit applied to her recovery under\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   and her husband's injuries. The traditional characterization of a spouse's claim as \"derivative\" of the other spouse's injuries arises in the context of loss of consortium demands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sandoz v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7471628\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/620/441/\">\n    620 So.2d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.App. 3 Cir. 1993) ;\n   <em>\n    Ferrell v.

The supreme court found that under State Farm's policy language, Mrs. Crabtree's mental anguish constituted its own \"bodily injury,\" because the policy definition of the term was ambiguous. In the policy issued to the Crabtrees, the definition of \"bodily injury\" did not include the limiting word \"physical.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Recently, our sister court in the second circuit faced the identical issue. In\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   , 51,093 (La.App. 2 Cir. 1/25/17),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12364219\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/214/945/\">\n    214 So.3d 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   , 17-343 (La. 4/7/17),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12362746,12362739,12362732\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/218/112/\">\n    218 So.3d 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court reasoned that the\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   claims of a fourteen-year-old daughter who was walking with her mother when her mother was struck by a passing motorist were entitled to a separate per-person limit. The bodily injury definition in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   was identical to that in the present case. The insuring agreement provided that the per-person limit was \"the most\n   <strong>\n    we\n   </strong>\n   will pay for all damages resulting from\n   <strong>\n    bodily injury\n   </strong>\n   to any one\n   <strong>\n    person\n   </strong>\n   injured in any one accident, including all damages sustained by other\n   <strong>\n    persons\n   </strong>\n   as a result of that\n   <strong>\n    bodily injury\n   </strong>\n   .\" That language is substantially similar to the language in the Dotys' policy, with the only difference being use of the term \"person\" in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   as opposed to \"insured\" in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We agree with the second circuit's reasoning. As the supreme court noted in\n   <em>\n    Hebert\n   </em>\n   , 08-60 (La. 5/21/08),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8244870\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/982/770/\">\n    982 So.2d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the principal distinction between\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   damages and most wrongful death cases is the spatial or temporal proximity of the plaintiff to the scene of the accident. In a\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   case, the plaintiff is injured directly by proximity to the accident. Thus, in holding to well-settle jurisprudence on the language in the policy before us, State Farm's First assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of error 2\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In its second assigned error, State Farm contends that the trial court erred in finding that the mental anguish suffered by Mrs. Doty rose to the level required in a\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   claim. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The determination of the trial court that the claimant has proven her elements of a\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   claim is reviewed by this court for manifest error.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12364219\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/214/945/\">\n    214 So.3d 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the manifest error standard, the appellate court must review the record in its entirety to determine whether the factfinder's conclusions were reasonably supported by the record and whether those conclusions were clearly wrong.\n   <em>\n    Stobart v. State, through Dep't. of Trans. and Dev.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7476636\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/617/880/\">\n    617 So.2d 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   claims are governed by La.Civ.Code art. 2315.6, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A. The following persons who view an event causing injury to another person, or who come upon the scene of the event soon thereafter, may recover damages for mental anguish or emotional distress that they suffer as a result of the other person's injury:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (1) The spouse, child or children, and grandchild or grandchildren of the injured person, or either the spouse, the child or children, or the grandchild or grandchildren of the injured person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (2) The father and mother of the injured person, or either of them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (3) The brothers and sisters of the injured person or any of them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (4) The grandfather and grandmother of the injured person, or either of them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   B. To recover for mental anguish or emotional distress under this Article, the injured person must suffer such harm that one can reasonably expect a person in the claimant's position to suffer serious\n   mental anguish or emotional distress from the experience, and the claimant's mental anguish or emotional distress must be severe, debilitating, and foreseeable. Damages suffered as a result of mental anguish or emotional distress for injury to another shall be recovered only in accordance with this Article.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Thus, recovery of\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   damages requires proof that: 1) one is a member of the class to whom such a right of action is granted; 2) one saw the injury-causing event or came upon the scene of the event soon thereafter; 3) the harm sustained by the injured person must be such that one can reasonably expect a person in the claimant's position to sustain serious mental anguish or emotional distress; and 4) the mental anguish or emotional distress must be severe, debilitating, and foreseeable.\n   <em>\n    Castille v.

One, the amount of distress suffered by Louise at the time of the accident; two, the distress suffered by the continuing medical issues of Homer over the weekend before it was determined that the injuries which he suffered were more severe than originally diagnosed at the Sulphur Hospital Emergency Room; three, the distress that she suffered while Homer received intense, complicating, and often problematic medical treatment at St. Pats Hospital for twenty-eight days; and four, the continuing distress and matters of continuing concern for Homer while he languished for an additional fifty-three days in a rehab hospital. Testimony was also received regarding Louise's need to consult her personal physician during this \"trying period\" from Dr. Lechtenberg regarding the complaints presented to him by Louise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Based on the unique circumstances of this case, like so many are, this court determines that Louise is certainly entitled to damages as those damages have certainly been demonstrated as an appropriate LeJuene [sic] claim.

This is an error of law. Her distress from Mr. Doty's continuing difficulties over the weekend immediately following the accident are not compensable under\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   . Mrs. Doty's distress from Mr. Doty's hospitalization at St. Patrick's is not compensable under\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   . And, lastly, Mrs. Doty's distress at witnessing her husband's rehabilitation is not compensable under\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   . All these elements are part of her loss of consortium claim, which is subject to the same per-person UM limit as Mr. Doty's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   To reiterate what the supreme court stated in\n   <em>\n    Trahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11646402\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/728/1273/#p1279\">\n    728 So.2d 1273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1279 (emphasis added), \"The Legislature apparently intended to allow recovery of bystander damages to compensate for\n   <em>\n    the immediate shock\n   </em>\n   of witnessing a traumatic event which caused the direct victim immediate harm that is severe and apparent,\n   <em>\n    but not to compensate for the anguish and distress that normally accompany an injury to a loved one under all circumstances\n   </em>\n   .\" Typically, as I will discuss further, the insurer is the party that confuses\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   damages with loss of consortium; here, it is the majority. The amount of time that Mr. Doty spent in the hospital and in rehab is completely irrelevant to what trauma his wife received at the scene of the accident; all Article 2315.6 entitles her are damages for that immediate shock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Perusal of Mrs. Doty's testimony demonstrates that during her husband's hospitalization and rehabilitation, she lost ten pounds because she never left her husband's side while he was at St. Patrick's. Her husband entered St. Patrick's on or about March 30, 2015. He stayed in St. Patrick's twenty-eight days, or until April 27, 2018, when he was transferred to Resthaven Nursing Home.

Although\n   <em>\n    Crabtree\n   </em>\n   also suggested the use of the word \"external\" in addition to \"physical\" to clarify the definition of \"bodily injury,\" the use of the word \"external\" could have had unintended consequences. For example, if an external, physical injury were required to qualify as a \"bodily injury\" to trigger a separate \"each person\" limit, a person who sustained internal injuries, such as a damaged organ, without sustaining external injuries such as bruises or lacerations, would not be entitled to a separate \"each person\" limit. As that result was not intended by the policy and would lead to inequitable and illogical results,\n   <em>\n    we find that the addition of the word \"physical\" is sufficient under\n   </em>\n   Crabtee [sic]\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    differentiate a \"bodily injury\" sustained in a physical manner, which would be entitled to separate per person limits, from an injury which is emotional in nature and, though might have physical consequences, is not a \"physical\" bodily injury\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8244870\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/982/770/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8244870\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/982/770/\">\n    at 776-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The supreme court noted the truly salient distinction between\n   <em>\n    Crabtree\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hebert\n   </em>\n   : Mrs. Crabtree was deemed\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   to have suffered bodily injury \"in the same accident\" with her husband because she actually witnessed her husband being \"violently struck and severely injured by an oncoming car.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7466594,7466515\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/632/736/\">\n    632 So.2d at 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The bodily injury definition in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   was identical to that in the present case. The insuring agreement provided that the per-person limit was \"the most we will pay for all damages resulting from bodily injury to any one person injured in any one accident, including all damages sustained by other persons as a result of that bodily injury.\" That language is substantially similar to the language in the Dotys' policy, with the only difference being use of the term \"person\" in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   as opposed to \"insured\" in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   I am persuaded by the second circuit's reasoning. As the supreme court noted in\n   <em>\n    Hebert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8244870\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/982/770/\">\n    982 So.2d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the principal distinction between\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   damages and most wrongful death cases is the spatial or temporal proximity of the plaintiff to the scene of the accident. In a\n   <em>\n    Lejeune\n   </em>\n   case, the plaintiff is injured more directly by proximity to the accident than is a wrongful death plaintiff, who suffers damages as a result of the accident. I concur in the majority's finding that Mrs. Doty's claim under Louisiana Civil Code article 2315.6 is subject to a separate per-person coverage limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   State Farm complains of the trial court's award of penalties and attorney fees.

La.R.S. 22:1893(A)(1).
