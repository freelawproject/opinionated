(\"Franks Construction\"), a subcontractor,\n   intervened in the Petition to Enforce Lien and For Damages (\"Petition to Enforce Lien\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed by the general contractor, Roy Anderson Corp. (\"RAC\"), against the property owner, 225 Baronne Complex, L.L.C. (\"225 Baronne\"). Franks Construction appeals the district court's judgment which granted 225 Baronne's peremptory exception of no right of action, finding that Franks Construction had no right to intervene in the Petition to Enforce Lien. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   225 Baronne and RAC entered a Contract in the amount of $61,300,000.00 for the renovation and reconstruction of property located at 225 Baronne Street in New Orleans, Louisiana (the \"Project\"). On March 17, 2014, RAC subcontracted with Franks Construction for Franks Construction to complete certain portions of the work that 225 Baronne had contracted with RAC to perform.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   RAC filed a Petition to Enforce Lien on December 21, 2016, alleging that 225 Baronne had failed to pay RAC the total amount due for the work it had performed on the Project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Paragraph 4 of the Petition to Enforce Lien alleged the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 8, 2013, the Contract was recorded with a Notice of Construction Contract as Instrument No. 2013-42883 with the Recorder of Mortgages for Orleans Parish.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 18, 2017, Franks Construction filed a Petition for Intervention (the \"Intervention\") into the Petition to Enforce Lien, pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 1091.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Franks Construction alleged it was entitled to intervene against both RAC and 225 Baronne to enforce its rights as a third person with an interest in the Petition to Enforce Lien. Franks Construction contended that it had entered into three subcontracts with RAC totaling $6,691,448.00. It alleged that delays, scheduling, and other management problems caused by RAC made it spend an additional 305 days on the Project and incur total damages in the amount of $8,372,629.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Franks Construction\n   joined with RAC to seek relief for any \"pass-through\" claims RAC might recover against 225 Baronne.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Franks Construction also pled that it had filed a demand for arbitration in December 2016 with the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") against RAC to recover those damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   225 Baronne filed a peremptory exception of no right of action (the \"Exception\") in response to the Intervention. 225 Baronne alleged that RAC had furnished and maintained a payment bond (the \"Bond\") of solvent, legal sureties for the work to be performed under the Contract and attached the Bond to the notice of the Contract that was recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Mortgages for Orleans Parish (\"Recorder of Mortgages\"). The furnishing of the Bond and the recordation were completed prior to work commencing on the Project in accord with La. R.S. 9:4812(A)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the LPWA. Accordingly, it argued that as the owner, La. R.S. 9:4802(C) relieves it of claims asserted against it by the subcontractor, Franks Construction, which arise from the performance of the Contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Franks Construction did\n   not have a right to intervene in the Petition to Enforce Lien; instead, 225 Baronne urged that Franks Construction's only LPWA remedies were limited to the arbitration action it had filed against RAC and its suit against the Bond.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 16, 2017, the district court heard arguments on the Exception, and orally sustained the Exception on the same date.

It further asserts that RAC had informed Franks Construction that Franks Construction's outstanding claims were \"pass through\" claims that could be recouped only if RAC successfully recovered those claims against 225 Baronne. Therefore, Franks Construction alleges that it had the right to intervene to aggressively protect its own interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Franks Construction contends the district court, in sustaining 225 Baronne's Exception, erred in: (1) basing its ruling on evidence which was not made a part of the record; (2) granting the Exception premised on an affirmative defense- La. R.S. 9:4802(C) -rather than an evaluation of Franks Construction's procedural capacity to assert the intervention; (3) failing to evaluate Franks Construction's right to intervene under the criteria enunciated pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 1091 ; (4) concluding that Franks Construction had no justiciable interest connected to the object of the existing litigation; and (5) dismissing Franks Construction's Intervention with prejudice without affording Franks Construction the opportunity to amend its Intervention to remove the grounds for the Exception. We will discuss each alleged error, although some may be combined for consistency and ease of reading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bond Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Franks Construction urges that comments from the district court suggest it granted the Exception based on 225 Baronne's argument that, as the owner of the property, Franks Construction did not\n   have a right of action against it because the Bond had been furnished and the Contract recorded in accordance with La. R.S. 9:4802(C). Our jurisprudence is well-settled that an appeal is taken from a final judgment and not the district court's reasons for judgment; however, an appellate court may consider the reasons for judgment in determining whether the district court committed legal error.\n   <em>\n    Winfield v. Dih\n   </em>\n   , 2001-1357, p. 8 (La.

What that does is, is it precludes subcontractors and suppliers like Ronald Franks Construction from filing direct actions against the project owner and so the - - Ronald Franks in enforcing its lien rights has to file suit against the bond which it has in an action in [sic] Eastern District. It's also initiated arbitrate [sic] against Roy Anderson to assert its claim against Roy Anderson.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In a colloquy with counsel for Franks Construction's, the district court inquired:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   But don't you have to go after the bond? I don't understand how you can file suit in this. I'm having a hard time with that. Isn't your only right is to go against the surety bond?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   MR. RICHESON:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Yeah. We can also go against Roy Anderson.

As the burden of proving the grounds for the Exception rests with the mover, Franks Construction contends 225 Baronne did not meet its burden of proof. This assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   La. C.E. art. 201(C) permits a court to take judicial notice of adjudicative facts, whether requested or not. A judicially noticed fact, pursuant to La. C.E. art. 201(B), requires that the fact be one that is not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court; or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned. Established jurisprudence provides that the second criterion-a fact capable of accurate and ready determination-may be established by public records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Here, the facts establish that Franks Construction, in enforcing its lien rights, filed an action against the Bond in Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans-which was later removed to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. We also note that RAC's verified Petition to Enforce Lien represents that the Bond was recorded;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   and, 225 Baronne's Answer admits that the Bond was recorded. Moreover, Franks Construction does not contest that the Bond was recorded in its Intervention or in its argument before the district court, nor in the present appeal. Similar to other public records, a \"trial court may take judicial notice of records in its own Clerk's office.\"\n   <em>\n    Louisiana Lift &amp; Equipment, Inc. v. Eizel\n   </em>\n   , 33,747, p. 8 (La.

R.S. 9:4802(C) in determining it did not have a right of action to intervene in the Petition to Enforce Lien; (2) failed to evaluate its right to intervene pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 1091 ; and (3) erroneously concluded that Franks Construction had no justiciable interest in connection to the Petition to Enforce Lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Franks Construction emphasizes that it meets the criteria to intervene. This Court acknowledges this argument may have merit. Louisiana courts have interpreted La. C.C.P. art. 1091 to allow intervention where a justiciable right exists and that right has a connexity with the facts, circumstances, and objects of the main demand.\n   <em>\n    Harrison v. Gaylord's Nat'l Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7557580\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/539/909/#p910\">\n    539 So.2d 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 910 (La. App. 4th Cir. 1989). A \"justiciable right\" for purposes of La. C.C.P. art. 1091\"means the right of a party to seek redress or a remedy against either plaintiff or defendant in the original action or both, and where those parties have a real interest in opposing it.\"\n   <em>\n    Amoco Prod.

App. 4th Cir. 1984). Connexity exists if the intervenor's claim is \"so related or connected to the facts or object of the main action that a judgment on the main action will have a direct impact on the intervenor's rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7631026\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/455/1260/#p1264\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Franks Construction's Intervention seeks to recover damages arising out of the Contract between RAC and 225 Baronne, and Franks Construction's subcontract. Franks Construction demonstrates connexity in that any judgment on the Petition to Enforce Lien may directly impact Franks Construction's ability to recover damages for outstanding monies allegedly owed on the Project, including damages for pass-through claims. However, notwithstanding that Franks Construction may meet the criteria to intervene, the issue before us is whether Franks Construction has a right of action to intervene. We answer that inquiry in the negative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Clearly, two different laws apply to this dispute- La. R.S. 9:4802 and La. C.C.P. art. 1091. Where there is a conflict of laws, Louisiana courts apply La. C.C. art. 13 to resolve the conflict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, we shall apply Article 13 to determine whether the intervention rights afforded by La. C.C.P. art. 1091 or the rights of subcontractors and owners conferred by La. R.S. 9:4802 control whether Franks Construction has a right of action to intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Pumphrey v. City of New Orleans\n   </em>\n   , the Louisiana Supreme Court espoused the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   La.

The debtor, Chrysochoos Group, Inc. (\"CGI\"), owned a fifty percent membership interest in JTMC Enterprises, LLC (\"JTMC\"), a limited liability company. Channelside, the judgment creditor, obtained a \"charging order\" against JTMC for payment of the unsatisfied amount of Channelside's judgment against CGI. Channelside issued a notice of records deposition and subpoena duces tecum to JTMC for the production of various business and financial records. When the documents were not produced, Channelside filed a motion to compel their production and JTMC filed a motion to quash. In support of its motion to compel, Channelside maintained that the requested discovery was needed to enforce the charging order and Channelside's judgment against CGI. In support of its motion to quash, JTMC contended that certain provisions within the LLA expressly restrict the rights of a judgment creditor to inspect the books and records of a member of a LLC. The district court partially granted and partially denied the motion to compel and the motion to quash, ordering JTMC to submit any evidence of indebtedness by JTMC to CGI for an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection. Both parties appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On appeal, the\n   <em>\n    Channelside\n   </em>\n   Court balanced the rights of the judgment creditor to obtain information allowed by our discovery and judgment debtor statutes against the rights afforded to JTMC under La.

R.S. 9:4802(A) imposes liability on owners for claims arising out of the performance of work under the contract; and La.

R.S. 9:4802(C), established jurisprudence has found that where a notice of contract and bond has been timely filed and properly recorded, such as in the present matter, an owner can avoid personal liability to subcontractors; and the subcontractors' rights are \"restricted to [a set amount] against the surety company plus whatever contractual privity rights they may have against the general contractor.\"\n   <em>\n    Jefferson Door Company, Inc. v.

Moreover, when we examine the specific reasons the Legislature enacted the LPWA-to delineate and protect the rights and remedies available to parties who engage in construction projects-to provide Franks Construction with a right of action to intervene in the Petition to Enforce Lien would render La. R.S. 9:4802(C) meaningless. It would defeat the legislation's purpose \"not only to protect those who furnish the services, labor, or material for the construction of the property for the owner when he fails to comply with the mandates of the law, but also to protect the owners when they comply with the Act's provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Flournoy Const.

Franks Construction cites no facts it could plead in an amended petition that would cure or remove the grounds for granting the Exception.
