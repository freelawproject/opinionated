The latter policy contained an express provision making the application a part thereof. The application contained a clause inserted after the printed questions, the material portions of which were as follows: \u201c And the said applicant hereby covenants and agrees to and with the said company that the foregoing is a just, full and true exposition of all the facts and circumstances in regard to the condition, situation, value and risk of the property to be insured, so far as the same are known to the applicant, or are material ; and of all the facts inquired for.......The applicant further agrees that the misrepresentation or suppression of material facts shall destroy his claim for damage or loss.\u201d The 13th article of the by-laws, subject to which the policy was issued, provided that \u201c any policy issued by this company shall be void, unless the assured shall have made in his application for insurance a true representation of the risk.\u201d The 5th printed question in this application was as follows: \u201c What is the distance and direction from each other, and from other buildings within one hundred feet, and how are such other buildings occupied ? Make plan on back hereof, showing the relative position of all the buildings.\u201d The answer to this question was, \u201c See plan.\u201d A plan was made on the back of the application containing a sketch of several adjacent buildings, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>with no statement of distances, or description of how they were occupied, except by calling them \u201c Store; \u201d and it was admitted that there were several buildings within one hundred feet of the insured premises which were not shown on the plan. The defendants offered evidence tending to show that the buildings so omitted were not material to the risk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-5\">The plaintiffs admitted that this policy was issued by the Holyoke company, and that the loss was paid under it; but contended that it was invalid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-6\">The defendants offered evidence tending to show that at the time this loss was paid the officers of the Holyoke company had such information respecting the circumstances now relied upon by the plaintiffs to invalidate the policy, that the money so paid could not be recovered back by them; and that after the loss the plaintiffs, at the defendants\u2019 suggestion, notified them of the existence of the Holyoke policy, and had such notice indorsed on another policy of the defendants upon the adjoining building, the plaintiffs then supposing the Holyoke policy to be valid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-7\">Upon these facts, the judge directed the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiffs, which was accordingly done; and the case was reported for the determination of this' court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b227-8\">P. <em>W.

Co. </em>6 Cush. 342, allowing a plaintiff to maintain the validity of his policy by showing his subsequent policy to be void by reason of his own misrepresentation or fraud, is in direct opposition to the decision of the supreme court of the United States, and to the most recent decision of the court of appeals in New York. <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Providence Ins. Co. </em>16 Pet. 495. <em>Bigler </em>v. <em>New York Ins. Co. </em>22 N. Y. 402. It is contrary to the general maxim of law, that no man shall be allowed to take advantage of his own wrong; and it is not to be extended beyond the exact case to which it was applied. The present case is distinguishable from that in the- following respects: The validity of the subsequent policy has never been questioned between the parties to it, but, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>on the contrary, it has been asserted by the plaintiffs, and admitted by the Holyoke company. This payment cannot be recovered back. Besides; the validity of that policy has been asserted by the plaintiffs to the defendants since the loss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-5\">The Holyoke policy was not void. The covenants and answers in the application were not warranties. <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Manuf. Ins. Co. </em>8 Met. 114. <em>Underhill </em>v. <em>Agawam Ins. Co. </em>6 Cush. 440. Their effect is qualified by the subsequent clause, and by the 13th article of the by-laws. <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Hamilton Ins. Co. </em>13 Gray, 139. The plan on its face shows that it is an imperfect answer to the question, and, by accepting a manifestly imperfect answer, the Holyoke company waived a full answer. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Charlestown Ins. Co. </em>5 Gray, 384. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Ins. Co. </em>6 Gray, 185. <em>Liberty Hall Association </em>v. <em>Housatonic Ins. Co. </em>7 Gray, 261. In this respect, the present case differs from <em>Tebbetts </em>v. <em>Hamilton Ins. Co. </em>1 Allen, 305.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b228-8\">Dewey, J.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"AEj\">The plaintiffs were the holders of a policy of insurance on their warehouse, situated in Broad Street, in the city of Boston, executed by the defendants on the 14th of November 1857 ; and it is agreed that the warehouse was subsequently destroyed by fire, during the time covered by the policy. The plaintiffs thus present a <em>prima facie </em>case, entitling them to recover for the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">In answer to this, and as a justification for refusing to pay for the loss, the defendants rely upon the provision found in the policy given by them to the plaintiffs, that <em>\u201c </em>if the said assured, or their assigns, shall hereafter make any other insurance on the property hereby insured, and shall not obtain the consent o\u00ed\" this company thereto, and have such consent indorsed upon this policy, then this insurance shall be void and of no effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">It is conceded that an instrument purporting to be a policy of insurance on the same building was obtained by the plaintiffs on the 17th of September 1858, at the office of the Holyoke Mutual Fire Insurance Company, and that the plaintiffs had neglected to obtain the consent of the defendants, and have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>same indorsed on the policy. This defence is a legal one and may be set up, although, in the particular case, it was a mere oversight, and the consent would have been given as a matter of course, if asked for.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">But the plaintiffs, in reply to this, deny the existence of any policy at the Holyoke office, and attempt to show that, although in form such a policy was issued, it was not a valid policy, and did not therefore defeat the prior policy given by the defendants. If such second policy was void, it did not vitiate the first. It is open to the plaintiffs to take this ground, and deny the validity of the second policy. This is fully settled as the law of this commonwealth, in the cases of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Ins. Co. </em>23 Pick. 418, and <em>Clark </em>v. <em>New England Ins. Co. </em>6 Cush. 353. The plaintiffs have the right to show that the policy which they received from the Holyoke company was invalid for want of compliance with the conditions stated in the same, or the requirements of the by-laws which were incorporated in the policy, and with which the plaintiffs were bound to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Was this second policy void ? It is said by the plaintiffs that it was so, by reason of the answer of the applicant for insurance to the question, \u201c What is the distance and direction from each other, and from other buddings within one hundred feet, and how are such other buildings occupied ? Make plan on back hereof, showing the relative position of all the buildings.\u201d The answer was, <em>\u201c </em>See plan.\u201d But the plan annexed did not show all the buildings within one hundred feet of the insured premises. If such omission was necessarily fatal to the validity of that policy, this would show that there was no subsequent policy procured by the plaintiffs, after taking the present policy of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">But the defendants, for the purpose of controverting this position, and establishing the validity of the second policy, offered evidence tending to show that the existence of the buildings omitted to be stated on the plan accompanying the application was not material to the risk; and the inquiry is, whether such evidence was competent ? The defendants insist that the policy is only avoided where the misrepresentation or false statement is material to the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The distinction between the class of cases which have been held to fall under the rule of avoiding a policy absolutely for false answers, and those where the contrary rule has been applied of allowing the assured to show that such erroneous statement of facts was immaterial to the risk, is not perhaps as precise and satisfactory as might be desirable. As to one class of objections to an answer contained in the application, viz., that of a false answer to a direct inquiry as to a fact, this court has, in reference to mutual insurance companies, been inclined to hold the assured very strictly, while in relation to omissions to state fully as to matters not the subject of particular interrogatories, greater latitude has been allowed in permitting the party to show that the omissions or misstatements were not material to the risk. Thus in <em>Bowditch Ins. Co. </em>v. Winslow, 3 Gray, 415, 432, where the objection to the validity of the policy was a false answer to the question, <em>\u201c </em>State whether or not incumbered, to whom, and to what amount,\u201d it was held that it did not obviate the objection arising from the falsity of the answer, that the misrepresentation was not material to the risk, and had been found so by the jury. It was objected in that case that the applicant in his application only covenanted and agreed that the foregoing was a just, true and full exposition of all the facts so far as Ihe same were known to the applicant, and were material to the risk. It was said in reply, that the applicant also said that he held himself bound by the by-laws of the company, and that article 19 of those by-laws provided that \u201cthe applicant for insurance shall make a true representation of the property on which he requests insurance, and so far as concerns the risk and value thereof, and his title and interest therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">It was held that under these provisions a false answer as to the amount of a mortgage on the property would constitute a defence to the action, and that the materiality of the answer as affecting the risk was not a subject of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The application to the Holyoke Company is in direct terms, on the face of the policy, declared to be a part of the policy. The 13th article of the by-laws provides that \u201c any policy issued by this company shall be void, unless the assured shall have made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>his application for insurance a true representation of the risk.\u201d Applying the principles of the case of <em>Bowditch Ins. Co. </em>v <em>Winslow, </em>and those of <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>New England Ins. Co. </em>6 Cush. 340, and <em>Vose </em>v. <em>Eagle Life and Health Ins. Co. </em>6 Cush. 42, we must hold that such a misrepresentation or false answer as is found in the present case constitutes a good defence to a suit on a policy made by a mutual insurance company. In reference to such policies, a strict adherence to their conditions and to the by-laws of the company is for the general benefit of every policy holder, as all such are members of the company, and affected by all claims for losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The later case of <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Hamilton Ins. Co. </em>13 Gray, 139, apparently qualifies the previous cases, at least so far as to hold that where an application concludes with the agreement \u201c that it is a correct description of the property so far as regards the condition, situation, value and risk on the same,\u201d and \u201c that the misrepresentation or suppression of material facts shall destroy his claim for damage or loss,\u201d it is not a warranty of the truth of the answers, except so far as they are material to the risk, although the policy was made subject to the by-laws, and by an article of the by-laws it was provided \u201c that unless the applicant shall make a correct description and statement of all facts inquired for in the application, and also all other facts material in reference to the insurance, or to the risk, the policy shall be void.\u201d This case has been followed by that of <em>Richmondville Union Seminary </em>v. <em>Hamilton Ins. Co. </em>14 Gray, 459, where the same doctrine was recognized, and it was held that under the form of that policy an omission to disclose the fact that buildings were situated nearer to the premises insured than the distance named in the answer, unless the existence of such buildings was material to the risk, would not defeat the policy. This statement was somewhat broader than the case required, as the same was stated in the report for the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">But these cases were followed by <em>Tebbetts </em>v. <em>Hamilton Ins. Co. </em>1 Allen, 305, where it was held that the omission to mention several buildings within a hundred feet of the property insured, in reply to a question, \u201c What is the distance of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>building from other buildings within one hundred feet, and how are such other buildings constructed and occupied ? \u201d will avoid the policy. Upon recurring to the application and policy in that case, and comparing the same with the case of <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Hamilton Ins. Co., </em>it will be found that they have similar provisions as to making the written application of the assured and the by-laws of the company a part of the policy, a similar provision as a by-law, and also the further provision that the representation shall be a warranty of the facts stated. The only ground for a distinction between the two cases was the difference in the statement at the close of the application and answers to the interrogatories propounded to the party applying for insurance. The concluding part of the answer in the case of <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Hamilton Ins. Co. </em>has been already stated. That of the applicant in the case of <em>Tebbetts </em>v. <em>Hamilton Ins. Co. </em>was thus : the applicant <em>\u201c </em>covenants and agrees with said company that the foregoing is a correct statement and description of all facts inquired for, or material in reference to this insurance; \u201d <em>\u201c </em>the applicant further agrees that the misrepresentation or suppression of material facts shall destroy his claim for a damage or loss.\u201d The difference between these two statements was held sufficient to change the result, and in the latter case this court held the policy void. It is true that in the latter case there was one provision in the by-laws which is not found in the present case, viz : that \u201c the application upon which a policy is founded shall be held to be a warranty on the part of the assured, and as absolutely a part of said policy and of the contract of insurance as if it were actually incorporated therein in full.\u201d The like provision was found in the case of <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Hamilton Ins. Co., </em>where the policy was held a valid one, and of course the omission or existence of this by-law was not necessarily decisive on the question of the validity of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The present case has the statement at the close of the application in language somewhat differing from either of these cases, although in part it is similar to each of them. Thus it is covenanted and agreed with the company \u201c that the foregoing is a just, full and true exposition of all the facts and circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>in regard t\u00f3 the condition, situation, value and risk of the property to be insured, so far as the same are known to the applicant, or are material; and of all the facts inquired for.\u201d . . . The applicant further agrees \u201c that the misrepresentation or suppression of material facts shall destroy his claim for damage or loss.\u201d Taking the first part of this statement, it will be found to be quite similar to that in the case of <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Hamilton Ins. Co., </em>where, by the effect given to the whole language of the application, the false statement in it was held not fatal to the policy, unless the same was material to the risk. But the statement goes further, and contains the additional stipulation, deemed so material in the case of <em>Tebbetts </em>v. <em>Hamilton Ins. Co., </em>that the assured covenants and agrees that the answer is a full and true answer <em>\u201c of </em>all the facts inquired for.\u201d This makes the present case more analogous to the latter of those cited, and may distinguish it from the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Giving effect to the case of <em>Tebbetts </em>v. <em>Hamilton Ins. Co., </em>and applying the principles sanctioned by this court in the earlier cases that have been mentioned, we are of opinion that the answer to the inquiry, \u201c What is the distance and direction from each other and from other buildings within one hundred feet, and how are such other buildings occupied ? Make plan on back hereof, showing the relative position of all the buildings,\u201d was such an omission to answer fully and truly \u201cas to all the facts inquired for\u201d as avoids the policy issued thereon; it being admitted that there were several buildings within one hundred feet of the insured premises, which were not shown on the plan. The question whether the existence of the buildings which were thus omitted to be stated was material to the risk is not open and the court properly refused to submit that question to the jury. See also <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Shawmut Ins. Co. </em>3 Allen, 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">It is further objected that, however it may be as to the invalidity of the policy obtained at the office of the Holyoke company, yet, inasmuch as the plaintiffs have, since the loss, at the suggestion of the defendants, had that policy, with then consent thereto, indorsed on another policy of the defendants, covering an adjoining building, and more \"especially because the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>have received since the loss the amount of their stipulated insurance from the said Holyoke company, the plaintiffs are estopped to avail themselves thereof. As to this indorsement, it only shows that the plaintiffs supposed at that time the policy was a good one. And as to the other objection, the point of the inquiry is, whether in fact, at the time of the loss, the plaintiffs had a valid claim against the defendants upon their policy. They had such a claim, if the second policy was then invalid; as the taking of an invalid policy did not constitute a breach of the contract existing between the plaintiffs and defendants in reference to a subsequent policy. They had no legal claim upon the alleged subsequent policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Whether a voluntary payment by the Holyoke company of a loss under that policy can be recalled, is a question not necessary to be settled in the present case. We have only to deal with the question whether, during the existence of the policy of the defendants, and before the loss occurred, the plaintiffs had taken a second valid policy. The facts which occurred subsequently to the loss do not constitute a case of estoppel in favor of the defendants. They have not been injuriously affected thereby, and the same cannot alter the rights of the parties in the present suit. <em>Philbrook </em>v. <em>New England Ins. Co. </em>37 Maine, 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict for the plaintiffs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b228-11\"> Bigelow, C.
