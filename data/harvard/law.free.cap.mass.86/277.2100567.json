The title of Smith to the one hundred shares standing in his name cannot be supported. A certificate of stock is not in any sense negotiable; and, the certificate having been issued by mistake, by the agent of the corporation, the corporation are not estopped by it.

He proposed to sell fifty shares, and employed Thomas R. Sewall, a broker, to make the sale. The shares were sold to William W. Keith, a broker, the name of his principal not being disclosed. The blank form for the assignment was then filled, so far as was necessary, by writing the word \u201cfifty\u201d in the proper space to indicate the number of shares sold, and with two marks in ink before it to indicate that nothing else should be written there; and also a line in ink drawn through the blank before the word \u201c shares,\u201d to show that nothing should be written there. The date was filled up, and the assignment was then signed by the plaintiff and witnessed by his broker, who delivered the certificate, with this assignment of fifty shares on its back, to Keith. A blank was left for the name of the assignee, and also for the consideration. The assignment as delivered is copied in the margin<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The delivery gave to the holder the right to fill these blanks, but not to alter the part stating the number of shares assigned. By the exercise of ordinary care, any person could see on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>inspection that only fifty shares were assigned, and that the remaining one hundred and fifty still belonged to the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s broker testifies that this course is common, and there is no evidence to the contrary; and we cannot see why it is not a safe and prudent course. For any alteration in the number of -the shares assigned would be obvious on inspection, as it was in this case, or else it must be done by a very ingenious forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">If there was an obvious alteration, it would be the duty of the defendants to ascertain whether it was authorized, before making a transfer of the shares to the assignee; otherwise they would run the risk of its being unauthorized. If it was a forgery, it would'be void, and no one could acquire a title under it, unless the plaintiff should be guilty of negligence in respect to it. If it were carried to the office of the company for the purpose of procuring a transfer of the fifty shares, the company would retain it; would issue a new certificate to the assignee of the fifty shares; and whenever the plaintiff should have occasion to take a new certificate for his one hundred and fifty remaining shares, the files and books of the company would show that he was still the owner of them, and had not transferred them. His property ought to be as safe without a certificate as with one.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The real purchaser was John B. Neale, and the certificate was delivered to him. He filled the proper blank with the words \u201c J. B. Neale, trustee,\u201d and probably inserted the word \u201c ten \u201d in the blank for the consideration. Having occasion to borrow money of Clark, Cheney &amp; Co., on a pledge of the fifty shares, he erased the words \u201c J. B. Neale, trustee,\u201d and left the certificate with them, in order that they might get the shares transferred. Their clerk, J. E. Bullard, was by some misunderstanding led to believe that the remaining shares belonged to Allen, Neale &amp; Co., a firm of which Mr. Neale was a member. He accordingly wrote in the blank from which Neale\u2019s name was erased, the words \u201c J. E. Bullard, Trt. 50; Allen, Neale &amp; Co., 150 ; \u201d which was intended to indicate that all the shares were sold, but leaving the language of the assignment absurd and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>contradictory. If this had been done fraudulently, it would have been a forgery; but there seems to have been no fraud, and it was merely an act of gross carelessness and wholly unauthorized. He carried the certificate to the office of the company, either in this condition, or with the additional alteration of an erasure of the word \u201c fifty.\u201d He found at the treasurer\u2019s office J. W. Le Barnes, the clerk of the treasurer. Common prudence would have dictated to him to refuse to transfer the shares on the strength of an assignment thus mutilated and altered, and so contradictory and absurd as it then was. Without any fraudulent intent, but with gross carelessness, he undertook to alter the assignment still more. Probably he erased the word \u201c fifty,\u201d though this may have been done by Bullard. He wrote upon the ink line \u201c two hundred,\u201d in the space before \u201c shares; \u201d inserted in another space the word \u201c all,\u201d and erased a superfluous \u201c of; \u201d and thus by his own act made it a proper assignment of the plaintiff\u2019s shares, so far as its language was concerned. After these various alterations, the assignment stood as represented in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Bullard then transferred the shares in accordance with this assignment. Allen, Neale &amp; Co., to whom one hundred and fifty of the shares were issued, became insolvent, and the shares were assigned to Keith as trustee, and a certificate was issued to him accordingly. Keith subsequently transferred twenty-five shares to Davis, and one hundred and twenty-five to Smith. Of these, one hundred yet stand in the name of Smith, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>remaining fifty cannot be distinctly traced. For the wrongful act of the treasurer\u2019s clerk in transferring the one hundred and fifty shares, under the circumstances stated, the Water Power Company are responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The authorities cited show that a certificate of stock is not a negotiable instrument; and without any authorities it is apparent that it has not a negotiable character. But this point is not material. If the plaintiff\u2019s carelessness had been such as to excuse the transfer of the stock to other parties, he could not now claim the stock. The case of <em>Young </em>v. <em>Grote, </em>4 Bing. 253, related to a negotiable instrument. The plaintiff\u2019s agent had filled up his check so carelessly that it did not carry on its face any notice to the banker that it had been altered, and its payment by the banker was excused by this fault of the plaintiff. <em>Coles </em>v. <em>Bank of England, </em>10 Ad. &amp; El. 437, was a case of the transfer of stocks which were not negotiable. The transfer by the bank was excused, because the testator had conducted in the matter with gross carelessness. Therefore, whether the paper be negotiable or not, the law is the same: the plaintiff must exercise reasonable care, adapted to the circumstances of the case ; and so must the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">We need not discuss the doctrine of estoppel alluded to in argument, because we do not put the case on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">As to the other defendants, it was proper to make them parties, because they have been parties to the transfer of the one hundred and fifty shares of stock. Upon the evidence, Neale and some of the other parties would probably be liable to the plaintiff in an action at law for their participation in the unauthorized transfer. By direction of Neale, the shares were transferred from Clark, Cheney &amp; Co. to Keith, in trust, and by him to Smith and Davis, in conformity with sales that Neale had made. What claim the Water Power Company may have upon any of these parties cannot be decided in this case. But the plaintiff, having demanded of the company a certificate of one hundred and fifty shares, had a right to it, and to the shares represented by it. He has also a right to the dividends which have been declared on these shares since they have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>withheld from him. As it appears that the shares are constantly for sale in market; the payment to him of their market price at the time of entering the decree will be a full and adequate compensation for them; and an alternative decree may be en tered, the plaintiff consenting to it, either for the transfer to him of one hundred and fifty shares, or their market value in money.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">There being no occasion for any decree as to the othei parties, and there being equities as between them and the Water Power Company that cannot be settled in this suit, the bill may be dismissed as to them, without costs to either party.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b287-8\"> \u201cIn consideration of me paid, I do hereby sell and assign to</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">Dollars, to</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">of <em>:-Fifty </em>of the within named--Shares of the Corporate Stock of the Boston Wateri Power Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">\u201c Witness my hand and seal, this <em>/5 </em>day of <em>March </em>A.
