The judge declined so to rule, and instructed the jury that the tenant\u2019s right of possession was at an end; that the defendant might then regain possession either by suing out the summary process provided by statute, or by actual entry; that the latter mode of resuming possession is a qualified and carefully limited right; that he had a right to resume possession without process if he could do so without a breach of the peace; that his right to take out the windows and doors and to remove the tenant\u2019s property depended on the contingency of his being able to do so without opposition or resistance; that, on being resisted, and finding that he could not remove the furniture or door without a breach of the peace, it became his duty immediately to desist from the attempt; and that he had no right to eject Webber by actual force, although regular notice to quit had been given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b327-7\"><em>E.
