The Board found that Herrera was ineligible for cancellation of removal because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a), based on his conviction and sentence for a burglary offense, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). The Board reasoned that Herrera\u2019s sentence to one year of house arrest, which was imposed as a special condition of a five-year sentence of probation, constituted \u201cconfinement\u201d that qualified as a \u201cterm of imprisonment [of] at least one year.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B). Herrera argues that house arrest does not constitute \u201cconfinement\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act. We deny Herrera\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-25\">Herrera entered the United States in 1995 as a legal permanent resident. In 2001, Herrera was convicted in a Georgia court of burglary. Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 16-7-1. The trial court \u201csentenced [Herrera] to confinement for a period of 5 years,\u201d which he was allowed to \u201cserve[] on probation provided [he] m[et] all the terms and conditions of probation,\u201d including \u201cservice] [of] one (1) year under house arrest.\u201d If the trial court revoked Herrera\u2019s probation, it reserved the right to \u201corder incarceration for the entire sentence or any portion thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-26\">In July 2014, the Department of Homeland Security charged Herrera as remova<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>ble because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony, the burglary offense. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Herrera admitted to the prior conviction, but he argued that his burglary offense was not an aggravated felony because he was not sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Herrera based his argument on an order of clarification issued in September 2014 by the Georgia court \u201cto avoid any possible future misinterpretation by Immigration Authorities of the actual terms of [Herrera\u2019s] sentence.\u201d The order of clarification stated that Herrera \u201cwas and is sentenced to five (5) years, entirely on straight probation, with all other terms and conditions of the sentence to remain the same,\u201d and that the \u201cCourt did not nor does it now impose any confinement whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">The immigration judge and the Board found that Herrera was ineligible for cancellation of removal and ordered him removed to Peru. The immigration judge ruled that Herrera\u2019s burglary offense was an aggravated felony because it resulted in a sentence of one year of \u201cconfinement\u201d that qualified as a \u201cterm of imprisonment.\u201d Herrera argued that the immigration judge failed to give full faith and credit to the order of clarification and that house arrest served as an alternative to incarceration. The Board concluded that the Georgia court \u201cused the term \u2018confinement\u2019 to mean confinement in a prison or other institution and not to include house arrest, which the clarified Order continued to require as a condition of probation\u201d; that the order did \u201cnot preclude a finding that house arrest does constitute \u2018confinement\u2019 for immigration purposes\u201d; and \u201cthat 1 year of house arrest constitutes a form of confinement which meets the definition for finding that [Herrera] was convicted of an aggravated felony under section 101(a)(48)(B) of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">\u201cWe review questions of law <em>de novo, </em>including whether a conviction [qualifies as] an aggravated felony\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act. <em>Dixon v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>768 F.3d 1339, 1341 (11th Cir.2014). The interpretation of an ambiguous statute by the Board is entitled to deference as long as it is reasonable. <em>Poveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>692 F.3d 1168, 1172 (11th Cir.2012). \u201cJudicial deference to the Executive Branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 425, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 1445, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"AEZ\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-9\">An alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony after his admission to the United States is ineligible for cancellation of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a). Under the Act, a \u201cburglary offense\u201d qualifies as an aggravated felony if the conviction resulted in a \u201cterm of imprisonment [of] at least one year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). \u201cA term of imprisonment ... includes the period of incarceration or confinement ordered by a court of law regardless of any suspension of the imposition or execution of that imprisonment or sentence in whole or in part.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B). Under section 1101(a)(48)(B), a term of imprisonment includes \u201call parts of a sentence of imprisonment from which the sentencing court excuses the defendant, even if the court itself follows state-law usage and describes the excuse with a word other than \u2018suspend.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Ayala-Gomez, </em>255 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-10\">The Board reasonably determined that house arrest is a \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d under section 1101(a)(48)(B). A \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d is defined in the Act as a \u201cperiod of incarceration or con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>finement.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B) (emphasis added). The \u201c[c]anons of construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings,\u201d <em>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., </em>442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 2331, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979), which reinforces the conclusion of the Board that \u201c \u2018confinement\u2019 must mean something other than \u2018incarceration.\u2019 \u201d And a \u201cterm of imprisonment ... includes ... any suspension of the imposition or execution of ... [a] sentence,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B), which suggests that it must encompass \u201cmore than just time spent in jail,\u201d <em>II-chuk v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the U.S., </em>434 F.3d 618, 623 (3d Cir.2006). Because \u201c[wjords in federal statutes reflect federal understandings,\u201d <em>Ayala-Gomez, </em>255 F.3d at 1319, the statement of the Georgia court in its order of clarification that Herrera was not sentenced to \u201cany confinement\u201d was due no weight in his immigration proceeding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Mendez, </em>735 F.3d 1284, 1288-89 (11th Cir.2013) (refusing to credit a \u201csubjective, interpretive clarification order\u201d obtained \u201cto precede and influence [a] federal sentence\u201d). Under the federal sentencing system, a sentence of house arrest that \u201cis imposed pursuant to a criminal convict tion ... is designed to either punish or rehabilitate.\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. Lamer, </em>60 F.3d 745, 749 (11th Cir.1995). For example, house arrest is given equal credit as imprisonment under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 501.1(e)(3) (Nov. 2010). The Board reasonably concluded that house arrest, as a punitive measure that involves a \u201cserious restriction of liberty,\u201d constitutes confinement and is a \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d under the Act. <em>See Ilchuk, </em>434 F.3d at 623. Herrera\u2019s burglary offense, for which he was sentenced to a \u201cterm of imprisonment [of] at least one year,\u201d qualified as an aggravated felony and made him ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\">The order of clarification by the Georgia court also did not affect the length of Herrera\u2019s \u201cterm of imprisonment.\u201d The order of clarification stated that \u201call other terms and conditions of [Herrera\u2019s] sentence ... remain[ed] the same.\u201d The order did not disturb the \u201ccondition\u201d in Herrera\u2019s original sentence that he \u201cserve one (1) year under house arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-6\">IY. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-7\">We DENY Herrera\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
