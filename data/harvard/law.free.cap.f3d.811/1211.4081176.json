The Immigration Judge and Board of Immigration Appeals denied Valencia\u2019s application for adjustment of status, citing a regulation promulgated by the Attorney General that says, \u201cAn alien who was substituted for the previous beneficiary of the application for the labor certification after April 30, 2001, will not be considered to be a grandfathered alien.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.10(j). Valencia, who undisput'edly falls within the scope of that regulation, challenges its validity. Because the regulation is a reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute and entitled to deference, the petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-10\">Valencia entered the United States in June 2006 on a B-2 tourist visa that expired later that year. About five years earlier, on April 26, 2001, Lawrence Equipment, Inc., a California corporation, had filed an application for labor certification, which was approved by the United States Department of Labor. This application, however, did not name Valencia as a beneficiary. At some point after April 30, 2001, Lawrence Equipment obtained approval from the Department of Labor to substitute Valencia as the beneficiary of its approved labor certification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-13\">In January 2007, shortly after Valencia\u2019s tourist visa expired, Lawrence Equipment filed with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) an \u201cImmigrant Petition for Alien Worker\u201d naming Valencia as the beneficiary. US-CIS approved this petition in April 2008, and assigned it a priority date of April 26, 2001, corresponding to the date that Lawrence Equipment had originally filed the application for labor certification. Valencia then filed an application with USCIS to adjust his status to that of a lawful permanent resident under ' 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(l)(B)(ii). That section allows a beneficiary of an application for a labor certification filed on or before April 30, 2001 to apply for an adjustment of status. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(l)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-14\">USCIS found that Valencia did not qualify for relief under \u00a7 1255\u00ae because he was not a named beneficiary of Lawrence Equipment\u2019s labor certification as of April 30, 2001, but was instead later substituted as a beneficiary. The Department of Homeland Security commenced removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-15\">In proceedings before an Immigration Judge (\u201cU\u201d), Valencia renewed his application for adjustment of status and reiterated his argument that he was a grandfathered alien under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\u00ae. The IJ denied Valencia\u2019s application because of a regulation promulgated by the Attorney General stating that \u201c[a]n alien who was substituted for the previous beneficiary of the application for the labor certification after April 30, 2001, will not be considered to be a grandfathered alien.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.10(j). Valencia appealed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), but, in January 2013, the BIA affirmed. The BIA found the regulation controlling and declined to consider its validity. Valencia was given sixty days to voluntarily depart from the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">In the present petition for review, Valencia argues that the BIA erred because the grandfathering provision of \u00a7 1255(i) unambiguously applies to substitute beneficiaries like him, and the Attorney General\u2019s regulation to the contrary is an unreasonable interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">' DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">We must decide whether the Attorney General\u2019s regulation at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.10(j) warrants deference under the familiar two-step analysis set forth in <em>Chevron U.S.A Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). We join the Second and Fourth Circuits in holding that it does. <em>See Lee v. Holder, </em>701 F.3d 931, 938 (2d Cir.2012); <em>Suisa v. Holder, </em>609 F.3d 314, 320 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-7\">1. The Statute is Ambiguous as to Substitute Beneficiaries</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-8\">Step one of the <em>Chevron </em>framework requires us to ask \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Our analysis begins \u201cwith the text of the statute.\u201d <em>Yokeno v. Sekiguchi, </em>754 F.3d 649, 653 (9th Cir.2014). \u201cThe plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself, the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., </em>519 U.S. 337, 341, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997). We do not look at contested phrases in isolation because \u201c[t]he meaning \u2014 or ambiguity \u2014 of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.\u201d <em>FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>529 U.S. 120, 132-33, 120 S.Ct. 1291, 146 L.Ed.2d 121 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-10\">Turning to the statute at issue here, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i), we conclude that Congress did not speak to the question of whether that section applies to substitute \u25a0beneficiaries of labor certifications. That section provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-11\">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (c) of this section, an alien physically present in the United States ... who is the beneficiary ... of ... an application for a labor certification under section 1182(a)(5)(A) of this title that was filed pursuant to the regulations of the Secretary of Labor on or before [April 30, 2001] ... may apply to the Attorney General for the adjustment of his or her status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1252-12\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(l)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-13\">Significantly, the statute uses only the general term \u201cbeneficiaries,\u201d not the more specific term \u201csubstitute beneficiaries.\u201d Valencia argues that the broader term necessarily encompasses the narrower, but the context of the grandfathering provision suggests otherwise. Indeed, as the Second and Fourth Circuits observed, \u201c\u2018the beneficiary\u2019 ... could refer to one of the three classes of aliens: (1) initial beneficiaries only; (2) initial beneficiaries and substituted beneficiaries, but only if the substitution occurred on or before April 30, 2001; or (3) currently named beneficiaries, whether original or substituted, regardless of when the substitution occurred.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>701 F.3d at 936-37 (citing <em>Suisa, </em>609 F.3d at 319). Moreover, Congress\u2019s inclusion of the sunset provision limiting relief to beneficiaries of applications filed by April 30, 2001, indicates that a more restrictive in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>terpretation might be appropriate. At a minimum, \u201c[c]ongressional silence regarding which of these three options is correct suggests ambiguity under step one of the <em>Chevron </em>analysis.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">2. The Attorney General\u2019s Regulation is a Reasonable Interpretation of the Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">Under step two of the <em>Chevron </em>framework, we ask \u201cwhether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. If the agency sets forth a reasonable interpretation that is not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute, then we must defer to it. <em>Id. </em>at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-7\">For the same reasons that we found the statute ambiguous, we hold that the Attorney General\u2019s regulation is a permissible interpretation. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.10\u00ae. The inclusion of the sunset provision suggests that Congress intended to impose a temporal constraint on eligibility for grandfathered status. The ambiguity is in whether Congress intended the statute to benefit a discrete, time-bound group of immigrants, or a discrete, time-bound group of employers with approved labor certifications. The former interpretation is the one adopted by the Attorney General, and indeed it makes better -sense of the statute. <em>See Lee, </em>701 F.3d at 937 (\u201cThe focus of \u00a7 1255(i)(l)(B)(ii) ... is on <em>immigrants, </em>not <em>employers.\u201d) </em>Therefore, it was permissible for the Attorney General to interpret the statute to preclude beneficiaries substituted after the sunset date from obtaining grandfathered status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">Valencia nonetheless argues' that the regulation is an impermissible interpretation of the statute because it conflicts with another regulation at \u00a7 1245.10(a)(3), which says in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-9\">A visa petition that was properly filed on or before April 30, 2001, and was approvable when filed, but was later withdrawn, denied, or revoked due to circumstances that have arisen after the time of filing, will preserve the alien beneficiary\u2019s grandfathered status....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1253-12\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.10(a)(3). We see no conflict between the two regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-13\">According to Valencia, because \u00a7 1245.10(a)(3) lists several post-filing changes to labor certifications that <em>do not </em>affect an original beneficiary\u2019s status, it follows that any unmentioned post-filing changes <em>must necessarily </em>affect the original beneficiary\u2019s status. Thus, Valencia\u2019s argument goes, these latter changes such as the substitution of a new beneficiary would presumably cause the original beneficiary to lose grandfathered status and the substitute beneficiary to gain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-14\">Valencia\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. The Attorney General could well have promulgated \u00a7 1245.10(a)(3) merely to address the consequences of a withdrawn, denied, or revoked petition. That choice doesn\u2019t necessarily imply that there are other post-filing changes to applications that adversely affect the original beneficiaries\u2019 grandfathered status, let alone that such changes include the substitution of a new beneficiary. In fact, by protecting immigrants from losing their grandfathered status, this regulation may actually support the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1255\u00ae as focusing on a discrete group of immigrants rather than a discrete group of labor certification applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-15\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-16\">We hold that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.10\u00ae is entitled to deference. Accordingly, the BIA properly denied Valencia\u2019s application for an adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-17\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1251-16\">. The record does not show exactly when this substitution occurred, but Valencia concedes it occurred after April 30, 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
