We answer that question in the negative based on our recent decision in <em>Espinosa v. Secretary, Department of Corrections, </em>804 F.3d 1137 (11th Cir.2015), which held that a petition for belated post-conviction appeal under Rule 9.141(c) does not \u201cinvolve \u2018collateral review\u2019 of [a] conviction\u201d for the purpose of tolling the same statute of limitation. <em>Id. </em>at 1139. Because Ramon F. Danny Jr.\u2019s petition for a belated direct appeal does not qualify as an application for state collateral review, we affirm the dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-17\">On September 9, 2010, Danny pleaded guilty to the crime of lewd or lascivious molestation of a victim who was less than 12 years old. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(5)(b). Danny pleaded guilty because the state agreed to waive the statutory minimum sentence of 25 years of imprisonment, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 775.082(3)(a)(4), and to request a sentence of 10 years of imprisonment. That day, a Florida court sentenced Danny to 10 years of imprisonment followed by 10 years of supervised probation. Danny did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-18\">On February 18, 2011, Danny petitioned for a belated direct appeal on the ground that his attorney had disregarded his directions to file a motion to withdraw his plea and a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fla. R. App. P. 9.141(c). The First District Court of Appeal relinquished jurisdiction to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>trial court, which appointed a special master to consider Danny\u2019s petition. Following an evidentiary hearing, the special master issued a report that recommended denying the petition. On October 19, 2011, the First District Court of Appeal denied Danny\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-4\">Danny twice collaterally attacked his conviction in the Florida courts. On September 17, 2011, Danny moved for post-conviction relief based on the ineffectiveness of trial counsel, see Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, but the trial court denied the motion as \u201clacking] any factual basis.\u201d The First District Court of Appeal affirmed and issued its mandate on November 14, 2012. On January 3, 2013, Danny again moved for postconviction relief on the grounds of ineffectiveness of counsel and of insufficient evidence, see <em>id., </em>but the trial court denied Danny\u2019s motion as untimely, successive, and frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">On June 15, 2013, Danny filed <em>pro </em>se a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The State of Florida moved to dismiss Danny\u2019s petition as barred by the one-year statute of limitation. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1). Danny argued that his petition was timely because the limitation period was tolled while his petition for a belated direct appeal was pending in the Florida courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-6\">The district court dismissed Danny\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus as untimely. <em>See id. </em>Danny\u2019s petition for a belated direct appeal, the district court reasoned, did not toll the running of the statute of limitation because the state courts refused to \u201creopen direct review\u201d and because Danny\u2019s petition did not \u201centail direct or collateral review of a judgment of conviction or sentence in Florida.\u201d The district court determined that Danny filed his federal petition several months after the limitation period expired. The district court concluded that the one-year limitation period commenced on October 13, 2010, when the time expired for Danny to file a direct appeal, and ran for 339 days; that the period was tolled from September 17, 2011, to November 14, 2012, while Danny\u2019s first motion for state post-conviction relief remained pending; and that the limitation period resumed running on November 15, 2012, and expired on December 11, 2012, six months before Danny filed his federal petition on June 15, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus as untimely. <em>Pugh v. Smith, </em>465 F.3d 1295, 1298 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-10\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-11\">The timeliness of Danny\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus turns on whether the petition for a belated direct appeal that he filed in a Florida court qualifies for statutory tolling as an \u201capplication for State ... collateral review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Danny argues that his petition is an application for collateral review because it involved a matter peripheral to a direct review of his conviction and was filed under a rule entitled \u201cReview Proceedings in Collateral or Post-Conviction Criminal Cases.\u201d The State of Florida responds that Danny\u2019s petition requested the opportunity to pursue a direct appeal and that the title of Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.141 does not alter the nature of the relief that Danny sought. We conclude that Danny\u2019s petition for a belated direct appeal is bereft of the characteristics of an application for collateral review under section 2244(d)(2) and that the district court correctly dismissed Danny\u2019s petition as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-12\">Our recent decision in <em>Espinosa, </em>804 F.3d 1137, forecloses Danny\u2019s argument. Espinosa sought statutory tolling of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>one-year statute of limitation for the period while his petition for belated postcon-viction appeal remained pending. <em>Id. </em>at 1140; <em>see </em>Fla. R. App. P. 9.141(c); Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. But we held that a petition for a belated appeal does not qualify as an application for collateral review because, under Florida law, it \u201cdoes not reach the merits of the anticipated appeal or the validity of the order to be appealed.\u201d <em>Espinosa, </em>804 F.3d at 1141 (quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>922 So.2d 1088, 1090 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-4\">Our decision in <em>Espinosa </em>adhered to the interpretation of the phrase \u201ccollateral review\u201d provided by the Supreme Court in <em>Wall v. Kholi </em>562 U.S. 545, 131 S.Ct. 1278, 179 L.Ed.2d 252 (2011). In <em>Kholi, </em>the Supreme Court explained that, \u201cto trigger the tolling provision, [the] \u2018collateral\u2019 proceeding must also involve a ... \u2018review,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 1285, in which there is \u201ca looking over or examination with a view to amendment or improvement,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Kholi v. Wall, </em>582 F.3d 147, 153 (1st Cir.2009)). Collateral review invites \u201ca judicial reexamination of a judgment or claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Kholi </em>the Court ruled that a motion for reduction of sentence filed under a rule of criminal procedure in Rhode Island qualified as an application for collateral review because it initiated a proceeding in which a state court could modify the movant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1286-87. The Supreme Court distinguished that motion from \u201ca motion for post-conviction discovery or a motion for appointment of counsel, which generally are not direct requests for judicial review of a judgment and do not provide a state court with authority to order relief from a judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1286 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-5\">Both <em>Espinosa </em>and <em>Kholi </em>were consistent with our earlier precedent that a Florida prisoner\u2019s motion for biological testing did not qualify as an application for collateral review. <em>Brown v. Sec\u2019y for the Dep\u2019t of Corn., </em>530 F.3d 1335 (11th Cir.2008). Brown sought statutory tolling for the period during which his motion for DNA testing under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.853 remained pending. <em>Id. </em>at 1337. Brown\u2019s motion did not qualify for statutory tolling, we reasoned, because it \u201cinvolve[d] an application for discovery only\u201d and did not impart authority to the state courts to give Brown \u201crelief from [his] sentence or conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That relief, we explained, had to be pursued in a different \u201cproceeding under Florida\u2019s collateral attack rales.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1334-7\">Danny\u2019s petition for a belated direct appeal did not invite \u201ca judicial reexamination of a judgment or claim.\u201d <em>Kholi </em>131 S.Ct. at 1285. A petition for relief under Rule 9.141(c) requests that a state court \u201creview[] the grounds for relieving the petitioner of his ... failure to timely seek ... an appeal.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>922 So.2d at 1090. The petition, if successful, only revives a petitioner\u2019s right to prosecute a direct appeal. <em>See </em>Fla. R. App. P. 9.141(c). If the petitioner proves that he has been deprived of a direct appeal due to no fault of his own, <em>see </em>Fla. R. App. P. 9.141(c)(4)(F), the state court issues \u201c[a]n order granting a petition for belated appeal ... [that is] treated as the notice of appeal,\u201d Fla. R. App. P. 9.141(c)(6)(D). In contrast, to qualify for statutory tolling, a collateral pleading must \u201crequest[ ] ... judicial review of a judgment and ... provide a state court with authority to order relief from a judgment.\u201d <em>Kholi </em>131 S.Ct. at 1286 n. 4. Danny\u2019s petition did neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-8\">Danny argues that his petition should be treated as an application for collateral review because the Florida rule that governs his petition is entitled, \u201cReview Proceedings in Collateral or Post-Conviction Criminal Cases,\u201d but that label is' of no moment.- \u201c[F]or purposes of applying a federal statute that interacts with state procedural rules, we look to how a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>state procedure functions, rather than the particular name that it bears,\u201d <em>Carey v. Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 223, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 2140, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002), and a proceeding under Rule 9.141(c) does not entail \u201cexamination with a view to amendment or improvement\u201d of a judgment or claim, <em>Khol% </em>131 S.Ct. at 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">As we explained in <em>Espinosa, </em>our decision that a Florida prisoner\u2019s petition for belated appeal does not toll the limitation period for a federal petition creates symmetry with how Florida courts treat the same kinds of filings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1335-6\">Our reasoning mirrors how a Florida court would treat a petition for a belated direct appeal in determining the timeliness of a state motion for collateral review. That is, an unsuccessful petition for belated appeal of a criminal conviction, under Florida law, does not toll the limitation period for state collateral review. <em>See Jones, </em>922 So.2d at 1089-90. Unlike motions for a new trial, for rehearing, or to correct a sentence, which do toll the rendition of a final order, a petition for belated appeal \u201cdoes not challenge directly any specific ruling\u201d in the criminal case. <em>Id. </em>at 1090. In the same way, filing a petition for belated appeal of an order denying state collateral relief does not toll the federal limitation period for a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1335-7\">804 F.3d at 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-9\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Danny\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
