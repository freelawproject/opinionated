The appellant then moved to \u201cvacate or correct illegal sentence.\u201d That motion was denied by the District Court on June 19, 1953, but that court, the same day, granted leave to the appellant to proceed on appeal without prepayment of costs. The sole issue on the appeal is whether the sentence imposed was greater than the maximum permissible by law. We think that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-13\">D.C.Code Title 22, \u00a7 2901 (1951), under which the appellant was indicted, reads: ' \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-14\">\u201cWhoever by force or violence, whether against resistance or by sudden or stealthy seizure or snatching, or by putting in fear, shall take from the person or immediate actual possession of another anything of value, is guilty of robbery, and any person convicted thereof shall suffer imprisonment for not less than six months <em>nor more than fifteen years.\u201d </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">D.C.Code Title 22, \u00a7 3202 (1951), provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-16\">\u201cIf any person shall commit a <em>crime of violence </em>in the District of \u25a0 Columbia when armed with or having readily available any pistol or other firearm, he may, in addition to the punishment provided for the crime, be punished by imprisonment for a term of not more than five years. . . . \u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-18\">D.C.Code Title 22, \u00a7 3201 (1951), defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-19\">\u201c \u2018Crime of violence,\u2019 as used in this chapter, means any of the following crimes, or an attempt to commit any of the same, namely: Murder, manslaughter, rape, mayhem,, maliciously disfiguring another, abduction, kidnaping, burglary, housebreaking, larceny, any assault with intent to kill, commit rape, or robbery, assault with a dangerous weapon, or assault with intent to commit ' any offense punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-20\">It will be observed from the foregoing-that under Section 3201 the crime of robbery is not included within the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d although assault, with intent to commit .robbery is. There-.fore the additional penalty of five years\u2019' imprisonment imposable under Section 3202 upon one who commits a crime of violence armed with or having readily available any pistol or other firearm cannot lawfully be imposed upon persons convicted of robbery \u201cbeing then and there armed with a pistol.\u201d According<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number><em>ly, </em>as the sentence imposed upon appellant exceeds the fifteen-year maximum permissible term under Section 2901, we are obliged to set aside the order denying appellant\u2019s motion to vacate sentence and to remand the ease to the District Court for resentencing under the provisions of D.C.Code Title 22, \u00a7 2901 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
