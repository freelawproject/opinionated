The findings of the court are supported by substantial evidence and are not clearly erroneous. Wherefore, it is the view of this court that the decision of the Tax Court should be affirmed upon its findings of fact and upon its memorandum opinion filed January 30, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
