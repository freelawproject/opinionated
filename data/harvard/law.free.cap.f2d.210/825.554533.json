It is conceded by the government that the appeal is timely. Mercado v. United States, 1 Cir., 1950, 183 F.2d 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">We disregard allegations in appellant\u2019s brief and appendix thereto having no support in the record. The record before us is brief and presents a simple situation. Upon arraignment in the district court, Claudio Gonzalez Rodriguez, being advised by counsel, signed a waiver of indictment, and pleaded guilty to an information filed by the United States Attorney. After a short statement by the prosecutor as to the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record, the court forthwith imposed the sentence of imprisonment, in a judgment entered October 26, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">On September 15, 1953, appellant filed in the district court his motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate the aforesaid judgment of conviction. The sole ground stated in the motion for attacking the validity of the judgment is the allegation that \u201cthe evidence on which the conviction rests was illicit\u201d, in that it was procured in the course of an unconstitutional search and <em>seizure. It is </em>not even claimed in the motion that appellant was innocent of the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">But the judgment of conviction does not rest on evidence turned up in an unlawful search and seizure but, rather, upon the plea of guilty. The judgment of conviction upon the plea of guilty cannot be held to be void, and thus open to attack on <em>habeas corpus </em>or on a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, a substituted remedy provided by Congress for correcting erroneous sentences without resort to <em>habeas corpus. </em>If one is guilty, there is nothing wrong in pleading guilty \u2014 nor is there error by the court in accepting such a plea and sentencing the accused thereon- \u2014 even though it might be true that the government would have been unable to establish the accused\u2019s guilt had he pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">The order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
