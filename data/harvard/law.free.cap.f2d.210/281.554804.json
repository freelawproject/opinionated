The case presents facts very similar to those before us in N. L. R. B. v. United Mine Workers of America, District 2, 3 Cir., 1953, 202 F.2d 177. The petition is undefended in this Court. We have satisfied ourselves, however, that the evidence supports the findings of the Board and the prayed for enforcement order will be issued.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
