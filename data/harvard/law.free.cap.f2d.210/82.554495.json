At that time, as at present, in so far as it appears, he was eligible for citizenship. Nor was he then liable for deportation. Two days later, on December 24, 1952, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 et seq. \u2014 enacted on June 27, 1952 \u2014 went into effect. It created as a new ground for deportation the commission at any time of two felonies involving moral turpitude. \u00a7\u00a7 241(a) (4), 241(d), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1251 (a) (4), 1251(d).' Since petitioner had committed two such felonies, one in 1918 and one in 1915, he then became and is now liable for deportation, though this in terms does not affect his eligibility for citizenship. \u00a7 405(a, b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 footnote, quoted below. On June 22, 1953, while his naturalization petition was still pending, deportation proceedings were instituted against him, based on the ground stated. He made his present motion in the district court on July 28, 1953, and now appeals from its denial by Judge Dimock in a reasoned opinion reported in D.C.S.D.N.Y., 115 F. Supp. 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Initially the government seeks dismissal of this order as not appealable, arguing that it does not come within the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(1) allowing appeal from the refusal bf an injunction. But' since here' a stay is sought of proceedings pending elsewhere than in the current action, we think the order comes within the distinction often adverted to between the enjoining of other legal proceedings and a mere regulation of procedure within the action itself. See, e. g., International Nickel Co; v. Martin J. Barry, Inc., 4 Cir., 204 F.2d 583, 585; Beckhardt v. National Power &amp; Light Co., 2 Cir., 164 F.2d 199; Cover v. Schwartz, 2 Cir., 112 F.2d 566. Hence the order is appealable. The supporting objections advanced by the government, such as that petitioner\u2019s application does not comply with the requirements for the issuance of temporary injunctions stated in Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. rule 65, 28 U.S.C.A., might suggest ground of error had the application been granted, but hardly touch the question of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Turning therefore to the merits we find that the Act of 1952 contains saving clauses, \u00a7 405, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 footnote, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-10\">\u201c[Sec. 405.] . (a) Nothing contained in this Act, unless otherwise specifically provided therein, shall be construed to affect the validity of any declaration of intention, petition for naturalization, certificate<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of naturalization, certificate of citizenship, warrant of arrest, order or warrant of deportation, order of exclusion, or other document or proceeding which shall be valid at the time this Act shall take effect; or to affect any prosecution, suit, action, or proceedings, civil or criminal, brought, or any status, condition, right in proc- ' ess of acquisition, act, thing, liability, obligation, or matter, civil or \u25a0 criminal, done or existing, at the time'this Act shall take effect; but as to all such prosecutions, suits, - actions, proceedings, statutes, conditions, rights, acts, things, liabilities, obligations, or matters the statutes or parts of statutes repealed by this Act are, unless otherwise specifically provided therein, Hereby continued in force and effect. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\">\u201c(b) Except as otherwise specifi- * cally provided in title III, any petition for naturalization heretofore filed which may be pending at the time this Act shall take effect shall \u25a0 be heard and determined in accordance with the requirements of law in effect when such petition was filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">It also has a priority provision, \u00a7 318, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1429:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>\u201c[Sec. 318.) * * * Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405(b) of this Act, and except as provided in sections 1438 and 1439 of this title no person shall be naturalized against whom there is outstanding a final finding of deport-ability pursuant to a warrant of arrest issued under the provisions of this chapter or any other Act; and no petition for naturalization shall be finally heard by a naturalization court if there is pending against the petitioner a deportation proceeding pursuant to a warrant of arrest issued under the provisions of this chapter or any other Act * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Our problem is to find an harmonious interrelation of these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Petitioner argues that \u00a7 318 was intended to apply only to cases where naturalization proceedings were instituted subsequent to the effective date of the Act, and that its predecessor, \u00a7 329 (c) of the Nationality Act of 1940, which makes substantially the same provision, can apply only to deportation proceedings under that Act. He thus finds an interstice covering the narrow category of cases where naturalization was commenced under the old law and deportation is attempted under the new. To support his position he points out that when Congress added the proviso, \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section 405(b)\u201d in drafting \u00a7 318, it added the semicolon which separates the \u201cfinal finding of deportability\u201d from the pending deportation proceedings provisions of the section. From this he argues that the matter following the semicolon is not subject to the \u201cNotwithstanding\u201d clause and not removed from the impact of \u00a7 405(b). This close reading of the statute might be justified if there were any indications in the general scheme of the provisions or in legislative history to lend support. But in the absence thereof, we are not constrained to grant such substantive effect to so minor and ambiguous a punctuational variation'.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">. Next it is urged that since the \u201cNotwithstanding\u201d clause makes reference only to \u00a7 405(b), it necessarily leaves \u00a7 405(a) in effect; that \u00a7 405(a) decrees that \u201cNothing contained in this Act * * * shall be construed * * * to affect any * * * right in process of acquisition * * * \u201d; that petitioner\u2019s naturalization is a \u201cright in process of acquisition\u201d; and that to allow deportation proceedings, not possible except under this Act, to suspend his right to a final hearing is to construe the Act to \u201caffect\u201d a \u201cright in process of acquisition.\u201d At first blush this argument is persuasive, for naturalization has been held to be a \u201cright,\u201d once the statutory qualifications have been met. Tutun v. United States, 270 U.S. 568, 578, 46 S.Ct. 425, 70 L.Ed. 738. But on closer inspection it is clear that the proffered reading is at the expense of several other provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">In the first place, to read \u00a7 405(a) so broadly as to remove petitioner\u2019s case from \u00a7 318 is to give it scope which makes \u00a7 405(b) entirely redundant. For if a petition for naturalization, once filed, confers a \u201cright in process of acquisition\u201d which may not in any way be \u201caffected\u201d by the Act, it must necessarily follow that the petition \u201cshall be heard and determined in accordance with the requirements of law in effect when such petition was filed.\u201d Of course it is conceivable that Congress intended to sacrifice brevity to clarity and inserted \u00a7 405 (b) to make doubly clear what was already the law under \u00a7 405(a). But in this view the phrase \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section 405(b)\u201d must refer only to the clarifying subsection, and thus have no significance \u2014 a result which seems unlikely.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">As noted above, the prior law contained a provision for priority of deportation proceedings which must be deemed a part of \u201cthe requirements of law in effect when [the instant) petition was filed.\u201d And there can be no doubt that \u00a7 318 provides the same priority in respect to proceedings commenced under the new act. If there were nothing more, petitioner\u2019s argument of an hiatus would be rather persuasive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>But \u00a7 B18 makes specific reference to \u00a7 405(b), which by its terms applies only to cases within the alleged hiatus. The conclusion is inescapable that the urged construction does violence to the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Furthermore, the \u201cNotwithstanding\u201d clause is not confined to \u00a7 318. It appears in several other provisions, e. g., \u00a7 313(a) 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1424(a); \u00a7 315 (a) , 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1426(a); \u00a7 331(d), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1442(d), and each time raises the same problem. A single example will suffice. Section 331(d) provides for the termination of enemy alien status and goes on to declare that: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section 405 (b) of this Act, this subsection shall also apply to the case of any such alien whose petition for naturalization was filed prior to the effective date of this chapter and which is still pending on that date.\u201d Under the urged construction the filing of a petition would confer a \u201cright in process of acquisition\u201d which, notwithstanding the patent effort of Congress to extend the benefits of this section, could not under \u00a7 405(a) be \u201caffected\u201d thereby. Such interpretation is ridiculous.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The phrase \u201cright in process of acquisition\u201d appears in a context which if taken alone is obviously broad and quite embracing. It is not now before us for definition of its full sweep; but it would seem that petitions may be saved from various technical and procedural changes, and presumably rights \u201cin process of acquisition\u201d other than those stemming from a naturalization petition will be discovered. Compare generally Petition of Menasche, D.C.P.R., 115 F.Supp. 434. Be that as it may, in holding that its general terms must be read with the specific provisions of \u00a7 405(b) and do not override \u00a7 318 we are not denying it effect in the manner that a contrary construction would nullify other portions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">It is suggested that in thus concluding we are reading the instant case out of \u00a7 405(a) by implication in contravention of the section\u2019s mandate that it apply \u201cunless otherwise <em>specifically </em>provided.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) On the contrary, we have followed merely the time-honored precept of reading a statute as a whole. Nor is it significant that the draftsman of \u00a7 330(b), 8 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1441(b), in providing a limited saving clause, expressly leaves \u00a7 318 intact. The draftsman there was faced with a narrow problem, and the impact of all related sections was immediately foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">If the conclusion thus made inevitable appears harsh, the decision and responsibility is that of Congress, which has disclosed its general and over-all intent in unmistakable terms. It has made the new ground of deportability of 8 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1251(d), supra, clearly applicable to aliens entering or facts occurring prior to June 27, 1952; and its retro-activity has been recognized and upheld. U. S. ex rel. Nukk v. District Director of Immigration &amp; Naturalization, 2 Cir., 205 F.2d 242 and cases cited 243, note 1. To allow the anomaly of an apparent try for citizenship by such deportable persons who had the foresight or the accident of seeking citizenship during the brief period between enactment and effective date of the new Act is to make mercy strange and fortuitous indeed. The interpretation here stated has at least the virtue of promoting consistency of treatment of the aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\">. Cf. Johnson, J., in United States v. Palmer. 3 Wheat. 610, 636, 4 L.Ed. 471, that men\u2019s lives should not \u201cdepend upon a comma.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b133-14\">FRANK, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A5l\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">My colleagues say that the conclusion they reach is \u201cinescapable,\u201d and that any other interpretation of the statute \u201cis ridiculous.\u201d My doubts are too strong to allow me to join in such strong language. These doubts do not stem from petitioner\u2019s attempt at a thoroughgoing semicolonization of \u00a7 318; for punctuation should play a small role in statutory construction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> My doubts are provoked by the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Section 318 specifically mentions \u00a7 405(b) as the sole part of \u00a7 405 which is to be inoperative when it clashes with \u00a7 318. This reference to clause (b) discloses a selective purpose, <em>i. e., </em>not to refer to \u00a7 405(a). Moreover, \u00a7 405(a) by its express terms provides, \u201cNothing contained in this Act, <em>unless otherwise specifically provided 'therein, </em>shall be construed * * * to affect any * * * right in process of acquisition. * * *; but as to all such * \u25a0 * * rights * * * the statutes or parts of statutes repealed by this Act are, <em>unless otherwise specifically provided therein, </em>hereby continued in force and effect, \u2022x- -x- * <em>\u00bb 2 </em>it would seem, then, that to apply \u00a7 318 to \u201crights in process of acquisition\u201d is exactly what both \u00a7\u00a7 318 and 405(a) deliberately said we must not do, since such an application not only (1) disregards the explicit and selective reference in \u00a7 318 to \u00a7 405(b) but also (2) , in reading \u00a7 318 into \u00a7 405(a) by mere implication, disregards the words in \u00a7 405(a) \u201cunless specifically provided therein\u201d. It is noteworthy, too, that the phrase \u201ca right in the process of acquisition\u201d in \u00a7 405(a) is new; it was not in the savings clause of the 1949 Act; it' thus appears that Congress intended to broaden this savings provision. See Petition of Menasche, D.C., 115 F.Supp. 434, 436.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And \u00a7 330(b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a limited savings clause, contains striking evidence that, when Congress meant to have \u00a7 318 apply <em>retroactively </em>\u2014 -i. <em>e., </em>to naturalization petitions pending at the time the 1952 Act became effective \u2014 Congress plainly said so and did not rely upon mere implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">Despite these doubts, I concur, but with much hesitation. I concur only because I think the well-known dominant purpose of the chief sponsors of the Act was to ensure the deportation of persons like petitioner.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\">.
