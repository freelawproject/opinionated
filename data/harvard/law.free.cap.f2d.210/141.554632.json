The evidence amply supported the verdict. Proof that no export license had issued at New York, whence the gold was exported, justified an inference, not rebutted by Parn\u00e9s, that no license did issue. The furtive conduct of Parn\u00e9s and the co-conspirators made it reasonable to infer that they knew that there had been no compliance with the conditions of lawful exportation, and accordingly that it was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">We assume, arguendo, that, over objection, the reception of Davidowitz\u2019 testimony, as proof of another crime, would have been error. However, defense counsel not only failed to object to Davidowitz\u2019 testimony on direct, but cross-examined Davidowitz at length. Only then did defense counsel move to strike this testimony. In these circumstances, the trial judge committed no error in refusing to grant that motion. See Marx v. United States, 8 Cir., 86 F.2d 245, 251; Metcalf v. United States, 6 Cir., 195 F.2d 213, 216-217.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
