It has to do with the question whether a loss was to be treated as an ordinary loss or charged as a capital loss. The district court decided the case against the taxpayer and rendered a thoroughly considered opinion in so doing, D.C.E.D.Pa. 1953, 115 F.Supp. 594. We do not have anything to add to that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-16\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
