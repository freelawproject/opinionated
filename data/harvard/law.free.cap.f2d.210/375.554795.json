Van Heyghen Freres Societe Anonyme, 2 Cir., 163 F.2d 246, certiorari denied 332 U.S. 772, 68 S.Ct. 88, 92 L.Ed. 357, by ordering the plaintiff to refrain from alleging matters which would cause the court to pass on the validity of acts of officials of the German government. Following our decision, however, the State Department issued Press Release No. 296 on April 27, 1949, entitled: \u201cJurisdiction of United States Courts Re <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Suits for Identifiable Property Involved in Nazi Forced Transfers.\u201d The substance of this Release follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-4\">\u201cAs a matter of general interest, the Department publishes herewith a copy of a letter of April 13, 1949 from Jack B. Tate, Acting Legal Ad-visor, Department of State, to the Attorneys for the plaintiff in Civil Action No. 31-555 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">\u201cThe letter repeats this Government\u2019s opposition to forcible acts of dispossession of a discriminatory and confiscatory nature practiced by the Germans on the countries or peoples subject to their controls; states that it is this Government\u2019s policy to undo the forced transfers and resti-tute identifiable property to the victims of Nazi persecution wrongfully deprived of such property; and sets forth that the policy of the Executive, with respect to claims asserted in the United States for restitution of such property, is to relieve American courts from any restraint upon the exercise of their jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of the acts of Nazi officials.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The letter from Mr. Tate is then quoted, pertinent parts of which follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">\u201c1. This Government has consistently opposed the forcible acts of dispossession of a discriminatory and confiscatory nature practiced by the Germans on the countries or peoples subject to their controls. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">\u201c3. The policy of the Executive, with respect to claims asserted in the United States for the restitution of identifiable property (or compensation in lieu thereof) lost through force, coercion, or duress as a result of Nazi persecution in Germany, is to relieve American courts from any restraint upon the exercise of their jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of the acts of Nazi officials.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">In view of this supervening expression of Executive Policy, we amend our mandate in this case by striking out all restraints based on the inability of the \u00a1court to pass on acts of officials in Germany during the period in question. See 173 F.2d at pages 75-76. This will permit the district court to accept the Release in evidence and conduct the trial of this case without regard to the restraint we previously placed upon it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
