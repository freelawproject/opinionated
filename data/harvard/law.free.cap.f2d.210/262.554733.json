C., to cease and desist from certain unfair labor practices and to reinstate with back pay one Steelman whom it found to have been discriminatorily discharged because of union activities. The facts are fully set forth in the decision and order of the board and the intermediate report of the trial examiner and need not be repeated here. We have given careful consideration to the briefs and arguments of counsel, but we cannot say that the findings and order of the board are not supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. The board\u2019s order will accordingly be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-23\">Order enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
