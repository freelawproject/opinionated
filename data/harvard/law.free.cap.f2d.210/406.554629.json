At the conclusion of all the evidence, the district judge finding in substance:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the driver of the jeep was guilty of negligence in failing to keep a proper look out; that such negligence was the proximate cause of the accident and resulting injuries to plaintiff; but that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in failing to keep a proper look out, and such contributory negligence was the proximate cause of the accident and resulting injuries to the plaintiff; found and adjudged that plaintiff was not entitled to recover and that judgment should be rendered in favor of the United States; and judgment was entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-15\">Appealing from that judgment, plaintiff is here insisting, in brief and oral argument, that in so finding, holding, and adjudging, the district judge erred, because, assuming that the plaintiff failed to keep a proper look out, that failure could not, under Texas law, constitute a proximate cause of the accident or injury in this, that at the time of the injury she was in a cross walk where she had the right of way and she was not, therefore, obliged to anticipate or fore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>see that the driver of the jeep would negligently run into her. In support of this view, she exhaustively discusses Section 77, Article 6701d, Vernon\u2019s Texas Revised Civil Statutes and Section 51 of the Traffic Ordinance of the City of Beaumont, which gives pedestrians in cross walks the right of way at intersections such as the one where she was struck, and cites and discusses authorities which she claims support her view.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Agreeing that statutes and ordinances such as the one invoked by her do not confer an absolute, but only a relative or comparative right, she yet insists that they do confer a sufficiently definite and positive right to prevent the failure to anticipate that a vehicle will be, and to observe that it is being, negligently driven into collision with her, from being said to be a proximate cause of an injury resulting from such negligence, since one crossing at a cross walk where she has a right to be may assume and reasonably count upon it that vehicles using the street will not be driven negligently into collision with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Of the many cases which she cites, mention may be made of these upon which she particularly relies: Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Rhodes, Tex.Civ. App., 256 S.W.2d 448; Texas &amp; New Orleans R. Co. v. Brannen, 140 Tex. 52, 166 S.W.2d 112; Kuykendall v. Doose, Tex.Civ.App., 260 S.W.2d 435; and Volk-mer v. Curlee, Tex.Civ.App., 261 S.W.2d 870.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Pointing to the evidence of the driver that he had slowed nearly to a stop when he approached the intersection, appellant argues that she had the right to assume, under the authorities above cited, that the driver would not pick up speed again and strike her, and that her failure to keep a look out against his negligence ought not, indeed cannot, be regarded in law as the proximate cause of the injury so as to deprive her of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">To these arguments, appellee replies by citing many cases from Texas and elsewhere holding that, though one may have the right of way, he is not, because of this fact, excused from the exercise of due care for his own safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">To appellant\u2019s argument that, in view of the driver\u2019s evidence that the jeep slowed down, she should be excused from not anticipating that it would negligently run her down, appellee replies that this argument completely fails in the face of plaintiff\u2019s evidence that she did not see the jeep until it hit her and in the face of the evidence of the driver of the jeep, corroborated by circumstances, and evidently credited by the district judge, that plaintiff was not openly and visibly in the cross walk but that she came out suddenly from behind a car and walked in front of the jeep.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">In support of this argument, appellee-quotes freely from plaintiff\u2019s testimony that she did not see the jeep until she heard the brakes <em>screak </em>and the jeep-hit her. In further support of its position, that there was duty on appellant, appellee quotes from the Beaumont City ordinance which, while giving the pedestrian a right of way, imposes a duty upon him in the following language: \u201cBut no pedestrian shall suddenly leave-a curb or other place of safety and walk, or run into the path of a vehicle which, is so close that it is impossible for the-driver to yield.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">Upon the basis of plaintiff\u2019s testimony and the finding of the district judge that plaintiff was contributorily negligent and her negligence was the proximate cause of the injury, appellee, citing many cases, with particular emphasis on the case of Todd v. La Grone, Tex.Civ.App., 234 S.W.2d 99, Lewis v. Martin, Tex.Civ. App., 120 S.W.2d 910, and Edson v. Perry-Foley Funeral Home, Tex.Civ.App., 132 S.W.2d 282, where the trial court rendered judgment for the defendant on a jury finding that the plaintiff was negligent in not keeping a look out and such negligence was the proximate cause of the injuries, urges, upon us that the case was a fact case- and that the findings and judgment appealed from may not be overturned. Drawing also on the jurisprudence of' other states, appellee cites many cases,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>including Gray v. Southern Auto Wreckers, Inc., La.App., 166 So. 154, holding \u201cEven when one has the right of way, he is not relieved from looking into the direction from which others may be expected to approach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Amalyzing and discussing the Texas cases relied on by appellant, and pointing out that the decision in each case turned on its particular facts, appellee insists that their holdings are in no wise contrary to the view of the district judge as to the duty of care owed by a pedestrian and that the contributory negligence of a pedestrian may be the proximate cause of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Upon a careful consideration of the facts as the record sets them out, the findings of the judge, and the law as it is declared in the authorities cited by appellant and appellee, we find ourselves unable to agree with the appellant that the district judge\u2019s findings are unsupported and should be set aside and the judgment reversed. We are, on the contrary, of the opinion: that the record furnishes no warrant for our setting aside the fact findings of the judge; and that the judgment must be</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-9\">. In detail Ms findings were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">1. That the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is brought under and by virtue of the Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C. 1346 (b)) for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">2.
