Since (thanks to the great popularity of chlorophyll products) the word \u201cClor\u201d is common to the trade,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it cannot be used as a basis for finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>' trade-mark infringement. Significant here is the acquiescence of plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in the use of the name \u201cClorodets.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For while there is a marked likeness between \u201c \u2014 dets\u201d and \u201c \u2014 ets,\u201d there is little, if any, similarity between \u201c \u2014 aid\u201d and \u201c \u2014 et\u201d in English pronunciation. However, plaintiff, selling in both a national and international market, argues that Clor-Aids and Clorets sound alike in French, and charges that defendants chose the trade-name \u201cClorAid\u201d to capitalize on the popularity of pl\u00e1intiff\u2019s product in French-speaking countries. But the principal market at which defendants aimed was in the United States. . That fact, plus the difficulties of choosing an effective trade-name in this era of brand merchandising and mass media advertising, leave it highly unlikely that defendants chose the name \u201cClor-Aid\u201d for the purpose of winning away plaintiff\u2019s French-speaking customers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">It has been suggested, however, that, because they had the deliberate intention of palming off, through the use of the imitative package,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendants, although their trade-mark does not infringe plaintiff\u2019s, nevertheless should be enjoined from using the name Clor-Aid. In support of this proposition, the case of Mainzer v. Gruberth, 287 App.Div. 89, 260 N.Y.S. 694, 698, has been cited. There the plaintiff produced a baking product under the registered trade-name \u201cApricoating\u201d which it packaged and sold with a distinctive yellow label bearing the picture of a baker. Defendants copied plaintiff\u2019s package style and label, using a picture of a baker and the same words which plaintiff for so many years had used on its own labels. In addition, defendants chose, as a trade-name for their product, the name \u201cApricot Coating.\u201d The court enjoined defendant\u2019s use of this obviously copied package design and label. Defendant\u2019s use of its trade-name \u201cApricot Coating\u201d was likewise enjoined \u2014 not at all because of the defendant\u2019s misconduct in deliberate copying of the plaintiff\u2019s package and label but solely because the defendant had used the name \u201cApricot Coating\u201d in deliberate imitation of plaintiff\u2019s name \u201cApricoating\u201d which, by plaintiff\u2019s activities, had attained a secondary meaning. In enjoining defendants from fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>ther use of the name \u201cApricot Coating,\u201d the court said, \u201cSuch unfair use of the <em>same or similar words </em>by a competitor will be restrained by injunction * * \u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It appears, then, that the injunction against defendants, in so far as it prohibited the use of their trade-name \u201cApricot Coating,\u201d rested clearly upon a finding of sameness or similarity in the two trade-names and thus, upon intentional copying of plaintiff\u2019s trade-name. As a consequence, defendants were properly enjoined from unfair competition in both (1) the use of similar packages and labels and (2) the use of a trade-name which infringed plaintiff\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In that context, the court said: \u201cWhen unfair competition is so designedly accomplished, all opportunity to continue it in any form should be prevented by an injunction sufficiently broad to insure such a result.\u201d To extend that language as suggested \u2014 so that (a) unfair competition in copying a package justifies an injunction against (b) what would otherwise be a legitimate use of an uncopied name \u2014 is to ignore well-settled doctrine. \u201cIt is,\u201d said Chief Justice Marshall in a much quoted statement in Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 398, 5 L.Ed. 257, \u201ca maxim not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used. If they go beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit, when the very point is presented for decision. The reason of this maxim is obvious. The question actually before the court is investigated with care, and considered in its full extent. Other principles which may serve to illustrate it, are considered in their relation to the case decided but their possible bearing on all other cases is seldom completely investigated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">The holding in Mainzer v. Gruberth is in accord with the precedents which hold that a plaintiff in such circumstances is entitled to an injunction which will free him of harm resulting from so' much of defendant\u2019s threatened future conduct as constitutes unfair competition but to no more. For the issuance of an injunction against the use of a non-infringing, non-similar, trade-name on the sole ground that defendant wil-fully copied plaintiff\u2019s package could only be rationalized on a theory that equity uses an injunction to punish past misconduct. But that theory the United States Supreme Court and the New York courts have rejected. See e. g., Hecht Company v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329, 64 S.Ct. 587, 592, 88 L.Ed. 754: \u201cThe historic injunctive process was designed to deter, not to punish.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See also May\u2019s Furs and Ready-to-Wear, Inc., v. Bauer, 282 N.Y. 331, 343, 26 N.E.2d 279, 284: \u201cIt has often been said by the courts of this State than an injunction is protection for the future and not punishment for the past.\u201d With particular reference to unfair competition, see Warner &amp; Company v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., 265 U.S. 526, 532, 44 S.Ct. 615, 618, 68 L.Ed. 1161, where the Court said: \u201cIf petitioner had been content to manufacture the preparation and let it make its own way in the field of open and fair competition, there would be nothing more to be said. It was not thus content, however, but availed itself of unfair means, either expressly or tacitly, to impose its preparation on the ultimate purchaser as and for the product of respondent. Nevertheless, the right to which respondent is entitled is that of being protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>against unfair competition, not of having the aid of a decree to create or support,-or assist in creating or supporting, a monopoly of the sale of a preparation which every one, including petitioner, is free to make and vend. The legal wrong does not consist in the mere use of chocolate as an ingredient, but in- the unfair and fraudulent advantage which is taken of such use to pass off the product as that of respondent. The use dissociated from the fraud is entirely lawful, and it is against the fraud that the injunction lies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-16\">. See 112 F.Supp. at page 849.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b730-5\">.

Defendant, in its brief, answers as fol- \u2022 lows plaintiff\u2019s charges that (1) Clorets and Clor-Aids sound alike - in French, and (2) defendants deliberately chose the name Clor-Aid to deprive plaintiff of its French-speaking market:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\"><em>\u201cLes Prononciations en Frangais </em>\u201cEn franeais le mot \u2018clorets\u2019 peut Stre prononc\u00e9 \u2018cloray,\u2019 et le mot \u2018chiclets\u2019 peut \u00e9tre prononc\u00e9 \u2018sheeklay.\u2019 D\u2019autre part, la marque de fabrique Clorets, est-elle prononc\u00e9e \u2018clo-ray,\u2019 et la marque de fa-brique Chiclets, est-elle prononc\u00e9e \u2018sheek-lay\u2019? Mais non. There is not a shred of evidence\u2019 that any customer ever entered une eonfiserie in New Orleans, Quebec, Paris or Madagascar and, addressing Monsieur le Propri\u00e9taire, said: \u2018Donnez-moi, s\u2019il vous plait, un paquet de Clo-ray.\u2019 Au contraire, plaintiff knows\u2014 but now forgets \u2014 that even Frenchmen chew Clorets. (That is, where Topps\u2019 Clor.-Aid is not purveyed.) And if any Frenchman, by 'some strange mischance, <em>should </em>ask for Clo-ray or Sheek-lay, no one would be more surprised \u2014 or cha- \u2022 grined \u2014 than plaintiff, whose policy it is to have its trade-marks given their American pronunciations, even in the uttermost parts of the earth. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-11\">\u201cAny resemblance between the pronunciations of Olorets and- Clor-Aid in any language, living or dead, is purely coincidental. It is hard enough to choose a word mark to be pronounced in plain American. If, in addition, a trader must consider how his mark <em>may he </em>pronounced in parts of Louisiana, New Mexico, Minnesota and Pennsylvania (not to mention Mott Street), in Paris, France, as well as in Paris, Kentucky, a difficult task will have been made impossible.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b730-12\">. In advertising Clor-Aid, defendants sent out a streamer with the legend \u201cNow 10$.\u201d The District Court found that this \u201ccould only mean one thing and that was to rivet the attention of the buyer on the thought that he was now getting something for 10$ that had previously cost more, <em>i. e., </em>the 15$ package of the plaintiff.\u201d Accordingly, the court held that defendants had unfairly tried to pass off their own goods as plaintiff\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b731-6\">.

See John H. Woodbury, Inc., v. William A. Woodbury Corp., D.C.S.D. N.Y., 1938, 23 F.Supp. 162, quoting from Coty, Inc., v. Parfums De Grande Luxe, Inc., 2 Cir., 1924, 298 F. 865, 870; Handler &amp; Pickett, \u201cTrade-Marks and Trade Names \u2014 An Analysis and Synthesis II/\u2019' 30 Col.L.Rev. 759, 769-77 (1930). But here we have a deliberate; fraud by an habitual offender and. the remedy should be sufficiently drastic to prevent any further filching of plaintiff\u2019s customers. \u201cA \u25a0 defendant whose business enterprise is based upon-express and deliberate fraud will not find a court of equity strenuous-to preserve all rights he might have-h\u00e1d if his conduct and motives had been honest.\u201d Peninsular'Chemical Co: v. Levinsbn, 6 Cir., 1917, 247 F. 658, 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">In American Chicle Company v. Topps Chewing Gum, Inc., 2 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d 560, this Court affirmed a judgment restraining this same defendant from continuing to use a package deliberately designed to attract buyers of plaintiff\u2019s Chiclets. Concerning defendant\u2019s conduct, Judge Learned Hand wrote-208 F. 2d at pages 562-563:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">\u201cIt would be absurd to see in this anything but a hope to bring to its own net just those buyers who are on the fringe of the plaintiff\u2019s possible customers. * * * Indeed, \u25a0 it is generally true that, as soon as we see that a second comer in a market has, for no reason that he can assign, plagiarized the \u2018makeup\u2019 of an earlier comer, we need no more; for he at any rate thinks that any differentia he adds will not, or at least may not, prevent the diversion and we are content to accept his forecast that he is \u2018likely\u2019 to succeed. Then we feel bound to compel him to exercise his ingenuity in quarters further afield.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Defendant\u2019s new scheme to appropriate to its own use plaintiff\u2019s customers and good will in relation to Clorets must be viewed as an integral whole, and against the background of the conduct just described. The package, together with the name \u201cClor-aid,\u201d has, for a-very considerable period of time, been used to accomplish defendant\u2019s illegal purpose. There is only one way effectively to compel defendant to exercise its' \u201cingenuity in quarters further afield,\u201d and that is to enjoin all further' use of the scheme, lock, stock and barrel. Otherwise, there will be the usual making of a few miiior changes in design, leading to further proceedings and perhaps further changes. This is the course pursued by the typical infringer, and it closely resembles'efforts to escape the effect of cease and desist order's of the Federal Trade Commission relative to' false and misleading practices of one kind or another. The basis for numerous\u2019 decrees in antitrust cases, where the entire scheme is enjoined, and not \"merely the patently illegal features, is that equity will fashion its decrees in such a manner as definitely to put a stop to the monopoly or restraint of trade under attack. There is no reason perceptible to me why the courts should treat an habitual infringer more leniently. This is not by way of punishment or the imposition of any penalty. It is no more than the exercise of plain common sense in order to make a decree which shall accomplish its purpose. The more cunningly devised and specious the scheme or plan, the more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>alert should the courts be to stamp it out. Otherwise, the honest merchant is at the mercy of an unscrupulous competitor. Surely there is enough before us here to show that this defendant cannot be trusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">These views find ample support in the authorities. The principle involved is clearly stated in Mainzer, Inc. v. Gruberth, 1st Dept., 1932, 237 App.Div. 89, 260 N.Y.S. 694, 698-699, affirmed 262 N.Y. 484, 188 N.E. 30, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">\u201cCases of unfair competition present varying degrees of wrongdoing. There is a distinction between those where one accidently uses a label or design owned by another, or where there has been an honest mistake, and those where there has been a deliberate attempt to appropriate a trade-mark, label, or design, or the business of a competitor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">\u201cIn the interest of common honesty and fair dealing, the courts naturally frown upon such practices. The bold attempt to take away the business of another by adopting the trade-marks, even to the extent of adopting the color, size, and form of packages in which the goods are sold, indicates to what extreme some of our modern businessmen will resort. When unfair competition is so designedly accomplished, all opportunity to continue it in any form should be prevented by an injunction sufficiently broad to insure such a result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">Where a defendant\u2019s past conduct has convinced the court that nothing short of such an injunction would give plaintiff adequate protection, a competitor has been enjoined from all use of his own personal name in his business. Westphal v. Westphal\u2019s World\u2019s Best Corp., 1st Dept., 1926, 216 App.Div. 53, 215 N.Y.S. 4, affirmed 243 N.Y. 639, 154 N.E. 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">As Justice Holmes wrote, in Schlitz Brewing Co. v. Houston Ice &amp; Brewing Co., 1919, 250 U.S. 28, 29, 39 S.Ct. 401, 63 L.Ed. 822, \u201cIt is a fallacy to break the fagot stick by stick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">Accordingly, I would modify the judgment below by broadening the terms of the injunction and restraining the use of the name \u201cClor-aid.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
