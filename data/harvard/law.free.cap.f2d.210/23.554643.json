United States, 93 U.S.App.D.C. ___, 210 F.2d 21, decided this day. Like Thomas, the appellant was convicted, after he had entered a plea of guilty, and was sentenced to serve six years and eight months to twenty years. The appellant then moved to \u201cvacate or correct illegal sentence.\u201d That motion was denied by the District Court on June 19, 1953. But that court, the same day, granted leave to the appellant to proceed on appeal without prepayment of costs. The sole issue on appeal in this case, as in Thomas v. United States, is whether the sentence imposed was greater than the maximum permissible by law. For the reasons stated in the opinion in the Thomas case, it was. Therefore, in view of the decision in Thomas v. United States, we reverse the order of the District Court denying appellant\u2019s motion to vacate sentence and we remand for re-sentencing under D.C.Code Title 22, Section 2901.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-21\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
