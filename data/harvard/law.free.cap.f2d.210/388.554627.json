Maxwell v. Campbell, 5 Cir., 205 F.2d 461, that failure cannot confer jurisdiction on the Tax Court to entertain taxpayers\u2019 petitions for relief, absent the notices required by Section 273(b) if notices have not been mailed under Section 272(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">We agree with the commissioner that this is so and that, since it is, the Tax Court had no alternative, upon the showing made in this record, to dismissing the petition for want of jurisdiction. None of the cases cited by the taxpayers, including McConkey v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 199 F.2d 892, hold to the contrary of this view, indeed they affirm its correctness.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">The orders appealed from were correctly entered. The petitions to review them are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-13\">. In L. E. Mason's case the ground of the motion was that the appeal (to the tax court) was not taken from a statutory notice of deficiency as required by Section 273(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. In Floy Mason\u2019s case it was that the appeal is from notice of tax lien under Internal Revenue Laws dated March <em>14, </em>1952.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b436-14\">. The petitions requested \u201ca redetermination of the deficiency set forth by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in his jeopardy assessments of March 14,1952,\u201d and in reports of the Internal Revenue Service dated April 30, 1952, and mailed to taxpayers\u2019 attorney on May 26, 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">The petitions allege that the jeopardy assessments were received by the taxpayers on or about March 17, 1952, that such assessments show income tax due for 1948 in the amount of $17,355.44, penalties of $9,719.05, and interest of $3,-117.08, or a total of $30,191.57, which is all in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-22\">The petitions allege also that a notice of a tax lien was received at about the same time as the statement of assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-23\">The petitions then assert that the Tax Court obtained jurisdiction when the Commissioner determined deficiencies on March 14, 1952, that the Commissioner cannot take away such jurisdiction subsequently \u201cby purposely or inadvertently failing to give the statutory notice within the 60 day period required by Section 273 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code,\u201d and that the taxpayers did not pay the tax indicated but mailed a cashier\u2019s check in the amount to the Collector of Internal Revenue \u201conly to remove the tax lien.\u201d The petitions end with a prayer that the Tax Court determine the jeopardy assessments made by the Commissioner on March 14, 1952, to be null and void, because of the failure of the commissioner to comply with the requirements of Section 273(b), I.R.C., 26 U.S.C.A., and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>give such further relief as may be fit and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">No copy of the report of the Internal Revenue Service of April 30, 1952 (on which taxpayers rely) appears in the record but a letter written to the Deputy Collector about the check referred to above, was attached to the petitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b437-9\">. \u201c\u00a7 273.
