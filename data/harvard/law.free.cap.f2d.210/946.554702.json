We think there is ample evidence to support the finding of the trial examiner in his intermediate report, which was adopted by the National Labor Relations Board, that the respondent encouraged, assisted, interfered with and dominated the Employees\u2019 Committee to the extent that its disestablishment is required. The record reveals that the committee has no independent means of support, that all its meetings have been attended by at least one top management official of the respondent and that such meetings are held on respondent\u2019s property; that the representatives of employees are paid for time spent at such meetings, that the elections of the departmental representatives were not free from participation by foremen, that a superintendent of the company served as secretary of all joint meetings of the committee; and that the committee has had no legal advice of its own but has conformed in its functions to the explanations by a company manager of what could or could not be lawfully done.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">We think that, on its facts, this case cannot be distinguished upon principle from National Labor Relations Board v. General Shoe Corporation, 6 Cir., 192 F.2d 504, certiorari denied 343 U.S. 904, 72 S.Ct. 635, 96 L.Ed. 1323, and from the later case of National Labor Relations Board v. Sharples Chemicals, Inc., 6 Cir., 209 F.2d 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">Accordingly, the petition of the National Labor Relations Board for enforcement of its order is granted as prayed therein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
