The Civil Service Commission, after entering his name on the resulting registers of eligibles,'told him his eligibility was being cancelled because of his handicap. He asserted a right to be restored to the registers, and asked for injunctive and declaratory relief. His complaint alleged, among other things, that the cancellation of his eligibility violated 62 Stat. 351, 5 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 633(2)9, which forbids the Commission to discriminate against a physically handicapped person \u201cwith respect to any position the duties of which, in the opinion of the Civil Service Commission, may be efficiently performed by a person with such a physical-handicap, # * *\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">- Since the registers to which appellant seeks to be restored have expired under the Commission\u2019s usual practice, - the District Court rightly dismissed the, complaint as moot. The fact that the legal question appellant seeks to raise may recur in the future does not defeat the defense of mootness. Eastern Air Lines, Inc. v. Civil Aeronautics Board, 341 U.S. 901, 71 S.Ct. 613, 95 L.Ed. 1341, reversing 87 U.S.App.D.C. 331, 185 F\u201e2d 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
