The specific question posed is, does \u00a7 67, sub. c of the Bankruptcy Act alter the priorities of statutory liens recognized by \u00a7 67, sub. b of said Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">The facts are not disputed. Prior to June 12, 1950, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue perfected statutory liens upon the real and personal property of Claude E. Gee for the nonpayment of federal insurance contributions and withholding taxes. The California Department of Employment, hereafter the State, pursuant to the California Unemployment Insurance Act filed tax liens upon Gee\u2019s property, and on June 12, 1950, took actual possession of Gee\u2019s personal property. On July 19, 1950, Gee filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy and was adjudicated a bankrupt. The receiver in bankruptcy entered into a stipulation with the State whereby the assets in the State\u2019s possession were turned over to the receiver subject to whatever rights the State might have in the property by virtue of its possession. The bankrupt\u2019s estate, on liquidation, amounted to $2,100.00, which sum was insufficient to pay the state and federal tax claims and expenses of administration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">On February 27, 1951, an order to show cause was issued to the State and the Government to appear before the referee for determination of their respective rights in the proceeds of the bankrupt\u2019s estate. The referee found that the Government tax liens were entitled to priority of payment over the State tax liens. The District Court affirmed the order of the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\"> Section 67, sub. b of the Bankruptcy Act expressly provides that liens for taxes owed to the United States or any state are valid against the trustee. 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 107, sub. b. Section 67, sub. b places federal and state liens in the same category. The rank and position of such liens is determined by applicable lien law. In re Pennsylvania Central Brewing Co., 3 Cir., 1940, 114 F.2d 1010, certiorari denied 312 U.S. 685, 61 S.Ct. 612, 85 L.Ed. 1123; In re Mt. Jessup Coal Co., D.C.Pa.1934, 7 F.Supp. 603; Collier on Bankruptcy, 14th Ed. Vol. 4, Par. 67.24. It is clear that the Government tax liens, having been perfected first, take precedence over the state tax liens. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3670, 3671, 3672; Michigan v. United States, 1943, 317 U.S. 338, 339, 63 S.Ct. 302, 87 L.Ed. 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">The State, while conceding that prior to bankruptcy its tax liens were subordinate to the government liens, argues that after bankruptcy its liens became superior to the Government liens by virtue of its possession of the bankrupt\u2019s personal property. The State\u2019s argument is that \u00a7 67, sub. c gives its liens which are accompanied by possession priority over administrative expenses, and since by \u00a7 67, sub. c the Government liens, unaccompanied by possession, are subordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>nate to administrative expenses, they are therefore subordinate to the state liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The Government acknowledges that its lien position is subordinate to expenses of administration by reason of \u00a7 67, sub. c, but contends that the priority of its tax liens as against the state liens is unaffected by \u00a7 67, sub. c. This contention is bottomed on the theory that \u00a7 67, sub. c merely postpones payment of statutory liens to the payment of the debts specified in clauses (1) and (2) of \u00a7 64, sub. a but does not alter the order of priority as between lienholders placed in the same category by \u00a7 67, sub. b.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">From a consideration of both the language used in the Act and the legislative history we are persuaded that \u00a7 67, sub. c does not affect or impair the priorities of liens recognized by \u00a7 67, sub. b. The relevant part of \u00a7 67, sub. c provides that \u201c * * * statutory liens, including liens for taxes or debts owing to the United States or to any State * * * on personal property not accompanied by possession of such property * * * shall be postponed in payment to the debts specified in clauses (1) and (2) of subdivision a of section 64 of this title * * 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 107, sub. c. The section deals only with the relationship of the lienholder without possession to <em>unsecured </em>creditors having priorities under \u00a7 64, sub. a. It does not attempt to deal with priorities as between <em>secured </em>creditors under \u00a7 67, sub. b. Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Sun Lumber Co., 4 Cir., 1942, 126 F.2d 731. As pointed out by Collier on Bankruptcy, 14th Ed., Vol. 4, p. 242, \u201c\u00a7 67 [sub.] c does not, nor does any other provision of the Bankruptcy Act for that matter, set up any scheme of priorities among liens.\u201d Thus we see that statutory liens unaccompanied by possession of the personal property to which they attach are postponed in payment only to the two claims specifically mentioned, viz. wages and expenses of administration. The state tax liens are not within either of these two classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">From the legislative history it appears that the sole concern of Congress in enacting \u00a7 67, sub. c was to insure payment of administrative expenses and small wage claims. Goggin v. Division of Labor Law Enforcement of California, 1928, 336 U.S. 118, 127, 69 S.Ct. 469, 93 L.Ed. 543 citing Committee Report Analysis of H.R. 12889, 74th Congress, 2d Sess. (1936) and Weinstein, The Bankruptcy Law of 1938 (1938). Prior to the .Act of 1938 all liens valid in bankruptcy had precedence over unsecured creditors having only priority claims under \u00a7 64, sub. a. Liens in favor of contractors, materialmen, and particularly accumulated tax liens, frequently consumed the bankrupt\u2019s estate to the exclusion of the costs and expenses of administration incurred in the proceeding. To insure payment of administrative expenses and wage claims Congress decided to subordinate statutory liens to a limited extent, that is, to unsecured claims having a first and second priority under \u00a7 64, sub. a. Collier on Bankruptcy, 14th Ed., Vol. 4, par. 67.20. We find no suggestion that Congress intended by \u00a7 67 sub. c to permit a subordinate lienholder who secures possession of personal property prior to bankruptcy to thus place himself in a superior position to an otherwise prior and superior lienholder. See, Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Sun Lumber Co., 4 Cir., 1942, 126 F.2d 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">In determining the distribution of the proceeds in the hands of the trustee, the lien priorities under \u00a7 67, sub. b should be resorted to before considering \u00a7 67, sub. c. Since under \u00a7 67, sub. b the Government liens are superior to the state liens, a sum equal to the government claim should be set aside from the proceeds and the remainder, if(any, should be applied to the state tax liens. In the instant case the State takes nothing since it appears from the record that the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>of the Government exceeds the proceeds realized from the sale of the bankrupt\u2019s estate. The Government liens unaccompanied by possession of the bankrupt\u2019s personal property are subordinated by \u00a7 67, sub. c to the expenses of administration. Hence, administrative expenses must be satisfied out of the sum set aside for the Government claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-15\">. No challenge is made to the validity or the amount of any of the liens.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b292-10\">. Section 64, sub. a establishes what unsecured debts are entitled to priorities. Clause (1) of \u00a7 64, sub. a deals with expenses of administration and clause (2) deals with wage claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
