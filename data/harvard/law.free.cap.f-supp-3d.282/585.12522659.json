The Government filed its memoranda in opposition to the appeals on June 28, 2017. (Dkt. 649 (Scanlon Opp.); Dkt. 651 (McIndoo Opp.)). Scanlon filed a reply in further support of his appeal on July 14, 2017 (Dkt. 675), followed by a notice of supplemental authority on July 19, 2017 (Dkt. 677). The Government filed a response to the supplemental authority on July 20, 2017, as well as a motion to strike the supplemental authority, which the Court denied. (Dkt. 683; Dkt. 687).

Scanlon argues that he had a subjective expectation of privacy in the KMC Olean Chapter clubhouse. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 615 at 11). Scanlon also argues that his expectation is objectively reasonable because he was freely able to use the clubhouse and to exclude others from using it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Judge Roemer found that Scanlon's expectation of privacy was not one that society was prepared to accept as reasonable. (Dkt. 568 at 18-20). Specifically, Judge Roemer concluded that Scanlon-who neither owned nor worked at the clubhouse, and who did not have the right to exclude guests of other KMC members-failed to establish standing sufficient to challenge the search warrant.

(Dkt. 648 at 20-21;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 732).

Proceedings with respect to search warrant applications have not historically been open to the press and general public, and the affidavits supporting a search warrant application are typically filed under seal and remain under seal at least while the investigation is ongoing. Certainly, hearings related to the suppression of evidence obtained pursuant to a search warrant have historically been open to the press and general public, and once the issues related to a search warrant evolve into a suppression hearing, the Court can envision the potential for a First Amendment right to be recognized. However, in this case, Scanlon has not sought a suppression hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In this case, even though an indictment has been returned, the Government has consistently represented that the investigation is ongoing. As a result, Scanlon has failed to meet his burden to establish a First Amendment right under the \"experience\" prong of the \"experience and logic\" test. Scanlon criticizes Judge Roemer's reasoning in finding no First Amendment right of access because he took into account the potential detrimental impact that unsealing would have on the ongoing investigation. Scanlon argues that Judge Roemer's \"attempt to identify a governmental interest more important than Mr. Scanlon's First Amendment right of access necessarily assumes that the right exists.\" (Dkt. 615 at 24). This Court does not read Judge Roemer's decision as doing what Scanlon claims it does. Rather, as recognized in the cited caselaw, the \"experience\" prong must necessarily evaluate the stage of the criminal proceedings to determine whether the judicial records have historically been open to the press and general public. A search warrant affidavit related to an ongoing investigation that pertains to unchallenged searches of property in which no indicted defendant\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   has claimed a reasonable expectation of privacy interest has not historically been open to the press and general public. At the least, Scanlon has not cited any authority for the notion that under these circumstances, the judicial document is open to the press and general public. Thus, Scanlon has failed to\n   satisfy the experience prong of the experience and logic test, and he has not established a First Amendment right to the affidavit.

Although courts have a number of internal checks, such as appellate review by multi-judge tribunals, professional and public monitoring is an essential feature of democratic control. Monitoring both provides judges with critical views of their work and deters arbitrary judicial behavior. Without monitoring, moreover, the public could have no confidence in the conscientiousness, reasonableness, or honesty of judicial proceedings. Such monitoring is not possible without access to testimony and documents that are used in the performance of Article III functions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, Judge Roemer determined that the presumption in favor of access was outweighed by the \"Government's significant interest in protecting the integrity of the investigation and the identity of its informants.\" (Dkt. 568 at 16). Judge Roemer went on to conclude that the search warrant affidavit should remain sealed due to the extensive information contained in the affidavit about cooperating witnesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Government's stated need to maintain confidentiality due to the ongoing nature of its investigation is a legitimate basis to justify maintaining the sealing of significant portions of the search warrant affidavit. This Court has reviewed the search warrant affidavit, and it contains detailed information regarding cooperating witnesses. While some of this information may be disclosed in due course as part of pretrial filings in this case, a common law right of access does not justify wholesale disclosure of the information in the form set forth in the search warrant affidavit. The need to maintain the confidentiality of this information plainly outweighs any common law right of access.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   On the other hand, other aspects of the search warrant affidavit set forth information that has already been disclosed as part of the proceedings in this case, including, for instance, background information about the KMC. Certainly, disclosing that information would not compromise the ongoing investigation, and the Court does not view the Government as arguing otherwise. However, because the confidential witness information encompasses a large portion of the affidavit and is contained throughout the affidavit, redaction of that information from the affidavit would render the affidavit of little use. Judge Roemer recognized this, and his decision not to\n   order the disclosure of even a redacted copy of the search warrant affidavit is neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Newsday, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527322\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/895/74/\">\n    895 F.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 80 (2d Cir. 1990) (\"[A] district court has the authority to redact a document to the point of rendering it meaningless....\");\n   <em>\n    Hawit,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203016794\">\n    2017 WL 3016794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (finding that releasing redacted version of search warrant affidavits would serve no purpose \"given the scope of the redactions necessary to protect the governmental interests implicated by these documents.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Eyecare Physicians of Am.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11937068\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/100/514/#p516\">\n    100 F.3d 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 516 (7th Cir. 1996) (concluding that neither magistrate judge nor district court abused discretion in refusing to unseal or allow access to search warrant affidavits, where, among other things, it was determined that \" 'redaction would entail such a large portion of the affidavit that it is not a practical alternative' \").

(Dkt. 392-7 at 35 (Enix); Dkt. 467 at \u00b6\u00b6 45-48 (Caruso)). Further, as noted by Judge Roemer, each defendant moved to join the discovery motions of his co-defendants, and Judge Roemer concluded that his Decision and Order applied to all other defendants, to the extent applicable. (Dkt. 568 at 3). However, no defendant other than Scanlon and McIndoo filed an appeal from Judge Roemer's Decision and Order concerning the search warrant affidavit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Although Scanlon correctly cites the standard of review as the highly deferential clearly erroneous standard (Dkt. 615 at 10), McIndoo argues (as he has before with other non-dispositive decisions by the magistrate judge (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 327 at 4 n. 4)), that this Court must review Judge Roemer's Decision and Order\n    <em>\n     de novo.\n    </em>\n    According to McIndoo,\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    review is required because the denial of the request to unseal the warrant affidavit \"is the equivalent to the denial of a motion to suppress, not a denial of discovery\" and purportedly relates to the effective assistance of counsel. (Dkt. 616 at 16, 21). McIndoo cites no legal authority supporting his position, and his argument is unpersuasive. McIndoo has not filed a suppression motion-rather, he seeks discovery related to a potential suppression motion. A discovery decision, such as this, is non-dispositive, and therefore\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    review is not applicable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Indeed, just because the issue at play\n    <em>\n     potentially\n    </em>\n    relates to a dispositive issue, such as suppression, does not mean that the reviewing court must conduct a\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    review of all aspects of the decision.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

In any event, for the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that McIndoo's argument in support of his request for the search warrant affidavit is flawed, and therefore, even if the standard of review was\n    <em>\n     de novo,\n    </em>\n    it would reach the same conclusion concerning McIndoo's argument.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The Court does acknowledge that, while not specifically advanced by either McIndoo or Scanlon, there is a potential argument that Judge Roemer's decision concerning standing should be reviewed\n    <em>\n     de novo.\n    </em>\n    When a decision concerning standing is made in the context of a motion to suppress, it is typically reviewed by the district court\n    <em>\n     de novo.

While this Court agrees that standing has nothing to do with the common law right of access analysis, Scanlon has not cited any caselaw supporting the proposition that an attorneys' eyes only option is an appropriate consideration for production of a judicial document pursuant to a common law right of access. The concept of producing a judicial document pursuant to the common law right of access for attorneys' eyes only is incongruous. In other words, a document is either available to the public under the common law analysis or it is not. The concept of protective orders is more applicable to discovery production involving parties in a litigation-such as where a search warrant affidavit is produced pursuant to a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
