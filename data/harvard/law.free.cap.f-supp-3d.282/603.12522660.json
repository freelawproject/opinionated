(Dkt. 688). In that Decision and Order, the Court denied all motions for bills of particulars, except to the extent that Defendants sought particularization of Counts 34 through 36 (in which only defendant Filip Caruso (\"Caruso\") is named), and Counts 45 and 46 (in which all Defendants are named). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-59). With respect to those counts, the Court reserved decision on the motions for bills of particulars and requested supplemental briefing.

The Court directed the Government to \"identify why it believes that\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   Defendant has enough information about these counts to prepare his defense, with specific reference to documents or other information supporting its position.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201961\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201961\">\n    at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Government should identify why it believes that Caruso has enough information about these counts [Counts 34 to 36] to prepare his defense, with specific reference to documents or other information supporting its position.\")).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As mentioned, only Caruso is named in Counts 34 through 36.

(Dkt. 721 at 1). The Government then highlights some of the information that each defendant has-including the Indictment itself, discovery that the Government has provided Defendants, photographs, grand jury testimony, detention hearing testimony, statements to law enforcement, and Facebook messages-that, in its view, demonstrates a connection to the KMC South Buffalo Chapter clubhouse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-18). As to Caruso, the Government contends that he, \"possibly more than any other defendant remaining in the case, has gained substantial insight into the case\n   against him and the KMC\" (Dkt. 725 at \u00b6 5) through,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , information gleaned through a related federal prosecution (docketed in case number 14-CR-203), discovery and proceedings in the instant prosecution, and the Indictment.

The Government also contends that Caruso will be receiving disclosure of Jencks Act materials that will aid him in his defense of Counts 34 through 36 and Counts 45 and 46. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants David Pirk (\"Pirk\"), Thomas Scanlon (\"Scanlon\"), Timothy Enix (\"Enix\"), Robert Osborne, Jr. (\"Osborne\"), Andre Jenkins (\"Jenkins\"), and Sean McIndoo (\"McIndoo\") filed responses to the Government's supplemental submission regarding Counts 45 and 46.

Each of those defendants argues, in the main, that the Government's supplemental submission provides no useful information regarding his individual conduct that would provide a basis for Counts 45 and 46, and as a result, particularization of Counts 45 and 46 is necessary. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 743 (Pirk); Dkt. 745 (Scanlon); Dkt. 746 (Enix); Dkt. 752 (Osborne); Dkt. 757 (Jenkins); Dkt. 760 (McIndoo)).

Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(f), a defendant may seek a bill of particulars \"in order to identify with sufficient particularity the nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be prosecuted a second time for the same offense.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

A bill of particulars amplifies the pleading (i.e. the indictment), and therefore, the Government will be \"strictly limited to proving what it has set forth in it.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As a result, a bill of particulars should not be substituted for a form of discovery-it \"should not function to disclose evidence, witnesses, and legal theories to be offered by the Government at trial or as a general investigative tool for the defense.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Summary of the Government's Additional Submission\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Government maintains that particularization of Counts 45 and 46 is not warranted because of the \"voluminous discovery provided to the defendant[s] since June 2016 ... considered in conjunction with allegations set forth in the Indictment.\" (Dkt. 721 at \u00b6 1). The Government highlights four general categories of information-the Indictment, physical evidence, Defendants' prior statements, and Defendants' Facebook activity-in support of its position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Indictment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Government points to the Indictment-particularly its introduction (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3), the \"manner and means\" section (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5), and the Overt Acts section (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6)-as one source of information available to Defendants that obviates the need for a bill of particulars. The introduction summarizes the history of the KMC; its organizational structure, rules, and chain of command, both nationally and within local chapters; and certain expectations of KMC members, including the requirement that KMC members follow orders from leaders of the KMC and attend mandatory parties in KMC chapters located in New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Tennessee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3). The introduction also alleges that KMC members maintained firearms, and that KMC chapter clubhouses \"maintained firearms and ammunition to defend the KMC against rival motorcycle gangs and to protect club proceeds\" and \"permitted illicit drug use and distribution, including cocaine, marijuana, and other controlled substances, between club members, associates, friends, and supporters of the KMC.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Government also cites the Indictment's allegations that the \"manner and means\" by which Defendants agreed to conduct and participate in the conduct of the KMC enterprise to further the goals of the enterprise and achieve its purposes included the following. Members and associates \"purchased, stored, maintained, and circulated firearms, and agreed that club members and clubhouses would possess and contain firearms, for use in criminal activity by members and associates, in order to defend KMC members and associates, and to retaliate against rival motorcycle gangs and other rivals who pose a threat to the KMC.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5). They also \"agreed that the club and club members would maintain certain premises including but not limited to KMC clubhouses for the manufacture, importation, receiving, concealment, selling, and distribution of controlled substances.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Government additionally cites Overt Act 37, which \"places four (4) of the remaining charged defendants directly inside the South Buffalo KMC clubhouse on or about August 3, 2014.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 7-11). The discovery includes the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 an American flag recovered from the KMC South Buffalo Chapter clubhouse during the execution of a search warrant on August 26, 2015, which was signed by Defendants\n   Willson, Koszuta, Scanlon, Williams, McIndoo, Stacharczyck, Myrtle, and Olejniczak;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 a KMC South Buffalo Chapter clubhouse \"members only\" sign-in ledger, dated between 1999 through 2015, that was found inside a safe within the South Buffalo KMC chapter clubhouse;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 photographs, which were found in the safe, that depicted a number of Defendants, and, in some instances, were labeled with the address of the KMC South Buffalo Chapter clubhouse;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 a receipt for the purchase of two firearms by McIndoo on August 13, 2010, which was also found in the safe;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 notes, dated September 14, 2013, listing KMC members who had \"house keys,\" which was also found in the safe;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 a log of payments of KMC South Buffalo Chapter clubhouse dues, which was also found in the safe;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 a list of phone numbers dated \"Spring (98),\" which was also found in the safe.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 7-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Defendants' Prior Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Government also cites various prior statements by certain Defendants as sources of information that, in its view, reveal the nature of the charges against Defendants in Counts 45 and 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Government points to Scanlon's grand jury testimony on July 15, 2015, when he stated that he had been to the KMC South Buffalo Chapter clubhouse, and on September 16, 2015, when he indicated that he attended a KMC meeting in Buffalo with Daniel \"DJ\" Szymanski and other individuals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Government also refers to Pirk's joint interview with Enix and the FBI on December 14, 2011, during which Pirk stated that he was at the KMC South Buffalo Chapter clubhouse on Septembers 6, 2014-the day on which Szymanski and Maue were killed-and had seen those two individuals there before they died. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). During the same interview, Enix \"made statements to the FBI ... that serve to confirm that [he] ... was at the South Buffalo KMC Chapter clubhouse when ... Caruso was armed and confronted ... Pirk, as alleged in Count 1, Overt Act 37 of the Indictment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Government cites to McIndoo's testimony during his detention hearing that he had been to the KMC South Buffalo Chapter clubhouse, and his interview on November 4, 2015, by FBI agents, when he said that he was a member of several KMC chapters, including the South Buffalo Chapter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   According to the Government, Stacharczyck also stated that he has been to the KMC South Buffalo Chapter clubhouse in August 2014 and observed Caruso, Pirk, and Dekay there as well; Stacharczyck also admitted to using cocaine at KMC events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16). Willson, in a post-arrest interview, stated that he had been a KMC member for 19 years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Facebook Activity and Other Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Government also highlights various Facebook messages from Enix's account and the private KMC group for which he was the group administrator, which, according to the Government, indicate that he \"organizes payment of taxes for the clubhouses in New York, including the Buffalo clubhouse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19). The Government points to Jenkins' Facebook activity, which includes messages indicating that he has been to Buffalo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Government also mentions that \"[m]ultiple witnesses are expected to testify, in sum and substance, that drugs, such as cocaine, have been used in the South Buffalo KMC Chapter clubhouse dating back to the 1990s, and that firearms are maintained in the clubhouse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21). It anticipates making disclosures regarding these witnesses before trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants' Supplemental Submissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendants argue, in the main, that the Government's supplemental submission offers little if anything that would allow them to prepare a defense to the charges set forth in Counts 45 and 46. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 743 (Pirk); Dkt. 745 (Scanlon); Dkt. 746 (Enix); Dkt. 752 (Osborne); Dkt. 757 (Jenkins); Dkt. 760 (McIndoo)). Defendants argue that the supplemental submission serves to highlight the unfairly broad nature of the allegations and limited supporting factual allegations, given that the supplemental submission focuses on innocuous activities such as signing an American flag and visiting the clubhouse. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 721 at 4 (Scanlon); Dkt. 743 at 4-7 (Pirk); Dkt. 746 at 3-6 (Enix)). Defendants contend that the submission may-at best-connect them to the clubhouse, but merely showing a connection to the KMC South Buffalo Chapter clubhouse is insufficient. (Dkt. 757 at 4 (Jenkins); Dkt. 760 at 7-8 (McIndoo)). Osborne further contends that \"the Government does not allege any conduct of Mr. Osborne relevant to charges 45-46 in the indictment.... In fact, the Government... does not even mention Mr. Osborne.\" (Dkt. 752 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Pirk additionally argues that particularization of Count 46 is necessary because of Count 2, which is a \u00a7 924(c) charge related to the RICO conspiracy charged in Count 1:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [W]ithout particularization, a juror could convict a defendant of Count 2 on the basis that the defendant possessed a firearm to further the RICO conspiracy (which specifically includes maintaining the South Buffalo as a drug-house). Then the juror could convict the same defendant of count 46 on the identical basis that the defendant possessed a firearm to further the maintenance of the South Buffalo clubhouse as a drug house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (Dkt. 743 at 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   McIndoo also challenges the Government's assertion that particularization is unnecessary because Defendants \"know what they did,\" arguing that it is inconsistent with the presumption of innocence. (Dkt. 760 at 4-5). He persists in his argument that the Government \"nearly complete[ly] reli[es] on membership in the KMC as the foundation for criminal liability under counts 45 and 46.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendants Are Presumed Innocent and, Therefore, Ignorant of the Facts on Which the Charges Are Based\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   According to the Government, particularization of these counts is unnecessary because \"each defendant is inherently in the best position to know what his relationship is with a particular location, such as the KMC South Buffalo Chapter clubhouse (Counts 45-46), and what, if any, involvement he has had with controlled substances and firearms.\" (Dkt. 721 at \u00b6 2). McIndoo specifically opposes this argument. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 760 at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Courts have rejected the argument advanced by the Government as inconsistent with the presumption of innocence: \"Since [a] defendant is presumed innocent because of his plea of not guilty, it cannot be assumed that he knows the particulars sought and he can only be considered 'ignorant of the facts on which the pleader founds his charges'.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, the Court rejects the Government's opposition to the extent that it is based on this faulty argument. Defendants are presumed innocent, and any purported gaps in the Government's ability to specify the nature of its charges cannot be filled with allegations concerning Defendants' knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Particularization of Counts 45 and 46 is Not Warranted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Having reviewed the totality of the information available to Defendants-including the Indictment and the materials attached to and referenced in the Government's supplemental submission-the Court concludes that a bill of particulars is not warranted. In reaching this conclusion, the Court is sensitive to the notion that \"the Government may not be compelled to provide a bill of particulars disclosing the manner in which it will attempt to prove the charges, the precise manner in which a defendant committed the crime charged, or to give a preview of its evidence and legal theories.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendants' requests for particularization of Counts 45 and 46, are, in essence, discovery requests concerning precisely how Defendants committed the crimes charged. For example, with respect to Count 45, Osborne requests, the \"day, time, and place, of any conduct material to count[ ]... 45,\" the \"nature, volume, and weight of any controlled substance relevant\" to that count, and \"[a]ny scientific tests related to any controlled substance related to\" that count. (Dkt. 387 at \u00b6 17). Enix, Pirk, Caruso, and Jenkins request particularization of Count 45 as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   a.

To require particularization in the manner sought by Defendants would amount to requiring a preview of the Government's case-and the questions posed by Defendants seek disclosure of information that the Government need not prove in order to sustain its burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Based on the available information, Defendants are not in danger of mistaking the charges against them in Counts 45 and 46.

For example, the Indictment alleges that \"KMC chapter clubhouses permitted illicit drug use and distribution, including cocaine, marijuana, and other controlled substances, between club members, associates, friends, and supporters of the KMC.\" (Dkt. 33 at \u00b6 18). The \"introduction\" also provides additional detail about firearms activity at all KMC clubhouses. For example, the Indictment alleges the following: \"KMC chapter clubhouses maintained firearms and ammunition to defend the KMC against rival motorcycle gangs and to protect club proceeds\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16), and \"[i]ndividual KMC members and associates maintained access to firearms, including handguns, rifles, and shotguns\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Indictment alleges that the drug premises crime in Count 45 and \u00a7 924(c) count in Count 46 both began \"on a date unknown, but starting no later than the year 2006, and continuing to the date of the return of...

Mar. 23, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   While the time frame alleged is broad and the number of defendants significant, Defendants have not convinced the Court that those factors push Counts 45 and 46 over the line to require further particularization-or, more to the point, that the particulars requested by Defendants would be appropriate. The underlying allegations in the Indictment concerning the RICO conspiracy cover the same time frame,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the Government's supplemental submission concerning Counts 45 and 46 provides additional evidentiary detail. (Dkt. 721). The Government highlights portions of the Indictment, physical evidence, Defendants' prior statements, and Defendants' Facebook activity (summarized above), which are available to the Defendants. Moreover, in several of its prior submissions, the Government has represented that the only significant items that it has not yet disclosed to Defendants are grand jury transcripts of witnesses who testified before the grand jury, witness statements, and FBI 302 summaries of witness interviews. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 437 at 25; Dkt. 451 at 9-10; Dkt. 452 at 11). The Government represents that \"[d]isclosures related to ... witnesses will be made prior to trial in accordance with the Protective Order\" (Dkt. 721 at \u00b6 21 (citing Dkt. 662)), which allows for early disclosure of such material. In light of the previous and anticipated disclosures by the Government, the Court rejects the notion that Defendants will be surprised by the charges against them in Counts 45 and 46. \"It is the defendant's burden to show that a bill of particulars is necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Nagi,\n   </em>\n   No. 15-CR-148-A,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273816\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/254/548/#p562\">\n    254 F.Supp.3d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 562-63,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202240258\">\n    2017 WL 2240258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (W.D.N.Y. May 23, 2017). Considering the totality of information available to Defendants, Defendants have not met their burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Government points out that Defendants are charged additionally as accomplices, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Dkt. 721 at \u00b6 22). That statute proscribes the aiding and abetting the commission of an offense, as well as causing another to do an act which would be an offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Government also advises Defendants that they may be liable under a\n   <em>\n    Pinkerton\n   </em>\n   theory of liability. (Dkt. 721 at \u00b6 23). Under that theory, a \"conspirator can be held responsible for the substantive crimes committed by his co-conspirators to\n   the extent those offenses were reasonably foreseeable consequences of acts furthering the unlawful agreement, even if he did not himself participate in the substantive crimes.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Romero,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526488\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/897/47/#p51\">\n    897 F.2d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 51 (2d Cir. 1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). These alternative theories of liability undercut Osborne's assertion (Dkt. 752 at 2) that the Government must provide a bill of particulars because the Government's supplemental submission lacks information concerning Counts 45 and 46 that is specific to him. It seems apparent that the Government intends to proceed on a theory of aider and abettor liability, or\n   <em>\n    Pinkerton\n   </em>\n   liability, as to Osborne. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 721 at \u00b6 21). For example, the Government states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [W]hile every defendant remaining in this case,\n   <em>\n    with the possible exception of defendant Robert Osborne,\n   </em>\n   has a personal connection to the South Buffalo KMC clubhouse as demonstrated by: membership in the South Buffalo KMC Chapter at various times; presence in the South Buffalo KMC Chapter on various occasions; control via position of authority at either the Chapter, Region, and/or National level; and/or relationship to other KMC members,\n   <em>\n    a personal connection to the physical structure of the clubhouse on Eagle Street is not required for criminal liability to extend to all charged defendants pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 2\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added)). Under either an aider and abettor theory, or a\n   <em>\n    Pinkerton\n   </em>\n   theory, whether a defendant-such as Osborne-personally visited or maintained the KMC South Buffalo Chapter clubhouse would be irrelevant. In any event, requiring the Government to specify its theory of liability with respect to each Defendant (including Osborne) is not within the proper scope of a bill of particulars. In other words, Counts 45 and 46 plainly adequately allege violations of the statutes set forth therein. The Government has set forth in its supplemental submission the evidence that it is relying upon to support the charges in Counts 45 and 46, with the primary exception of witness statements that will be produced shortly (or are in the process of being produced). For some defendants, such as Osborne, it is apparent that the basis for any claimed liability against him is vicarious under a\n   <em>\n    Pinkerton\n   </em>\n   theory or as an aider and abettor. But requiring the Government to further delineate its theory of liability in this regard would run afoul of proper particularization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the Government has adequately notified Defendants concerning the nature of the drug premises charge in Count 45 and the related \u00a7 924(c) charge in Count 46, and that the Government's disclosures to date allow Defendants to prepare a defense, and avoid prejudicial surprise at trial and double jeopardy concerns. Accordingly, the Court denies Defendants' motions for a bill of particulars regarding Counts 45 and 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Counts 2 and 46 Are Not Multiplicitous\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   To the extent that Pirk's response to the Government's supplemental submission suggests a potential argument that a bill of particulars is warranted because Count 2 is multiplicitous of Count 46, that argument is unpersuasive. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 743 at 7-8). \"An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been committed.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Chacko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11756807\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/169/140/#p145\">\n    169 F.3d 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 145 (2d Cir. 1999). \"It is not determinative whether the same conduct underlies the counts; rather, it is critical whether the 'offense'-in the legal sense, as defined by Congress-complained of in one count is the same as that charged in another.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11756807\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/169/140/#p145\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11756807\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/169/140/#p145\">\n    at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When the same statutory\n   violation is charged multiple times, as is the case with Counts 2 and 46, \"the question is whether the facts underlying each count were intended by Congress to constitute separate 'units' of prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

According to the Second Circuit, the appropriate unit of prosecution under \u00a7 924(c) is the underlying predicate offense rather than the number of firearms.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lindsay,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515028\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/985/666/#p674\">\n    985 F.2d 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 674 (2d Cir. 1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Count 2 is a different unit of prosecution (RICO conspiracy) than Count 46 (using and maintaining premises for drug dealing). Thus, the Court rejects the argument that a bill of particulars is needed in light of the multiplicity of Counts 2 and 46. Further, as the Court stated in its prior Decision and Order, the Court is mindful of Defendants' concerns about the alleged multiplicity of the \u00a7 924(c) counts, but those issues can be appropriately addressed at trial and do not justify further particularization to be ordered by the Court. (Dkt. 688 at 48-49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

(Dkt. 467 at \u00b6\u00b6 25-26). Count 34 charges Caruso with distribution of cocaine \"[b]eginning in or before 2010 and continuing until in or about September 2014, the exact dates being unknown\" in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(C) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Summary of the Government's Additional Submission\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In its sealed supplemental submission concerning Caruso, the Government cites a\n   variety of information in support of its contention that the Court should not order particularization of Counts 34 through 36 and 45 and 46. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 725). Having already considered the need for particularization of Counts 45 and 46 as set forth above, the Court addresses only Counts 34 and 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Government points to information adduced through Caruso's related federal prosecution for being a felon in possession of a firearm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6). In that case, docketed under 14-CR-203, Caruso pleaded guilty; Overt Acts 32 and 35 in the instant case are based on the same conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Before trial in that case, the Government moved to revoke Caruso's release based on allegations that he had tested positive for marijuana on 12 occasions, in violation of his conditions of release; the motion was denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11). Also before trial, the Government provided Caruso a witness list, pretrial memorandum, and Jencks Act materials that overlap with this case; that is, some of the same witnesses will be called in this case, and Caruso already has certain disclosures relating to those witnesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12). The Government also cites to Caruso's own statements (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3) and statements of witnesses as examples of materials that indicate Caruso's drug and gun involvement as relevant to Counts 34-36. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 15-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). As the Government's supplemental submission is filed under seal (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 695), the Court declines to summarize the contents in detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Caruso did not respond to the Government's additional submission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Particularization of Counts 34 through 36 is Not Warranted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   As an initial matter, as the Court noted in its prior Decision and Order, Caruso's motion for a bill of particulars cited nothing but Rule 7(f), thus arguably falling woefully short of his burden to show that the information is necessary to the preparation of his defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306904\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/88/117/#p120\">\n    88 F.Supp.3d 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 120 (N.D.N.Y. 2015) (denying request for bill of particulars where defendant cited \"nothing more than Rule 7(f)\" and had \"made no attempt to demonstrate need to prepare a defense or avoid surprise at trial\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nagi,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273816\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/254/548/#p562\">\n    254 F.Supp.3d at 562-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202240258\">\n    2017 WL 2240258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (explaining that the defendant bears the burden to show that a bill of particulars is necessary). Moreover, he did not take the opportunity to respond to the Government's supplemental submission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Even setting aside the issue of Caruso's failure to meet his burden, a review of the totality of the information available to Caruso-such as the Indictment and the materials attached to and described in the Government's supplemental submission-leads the Court to conclude that a bill of particulars is not warranted for Counts 34 through 36. The Government's supplemental submission is replete with specific references to instances in which Caruso allegedly distributed cocaine and marijuana and instances in which he possessed firearms in furtherance of those distribution activities. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 725). Moreover, in Counts 34 through 36, the Indictment tracks the specific language of the relevant statutes and specifies the relevant timeframes, and location of the offenses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 33 at 57-58). In short, the Government has adequately notified Caruso of the drug distribution charges in Counts 34 and 35, as well as the \u00a7 924(c) charge in Count 36 so that he may properly prepare a defense, and avoid prejudicial surprise at trial and double jeopardy concerns. Therefore, the Court denies Caruso's motion for a bill of particulars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies Defendants' motions for bills of particulars\n   with respect to Counts 34 through 36 and 45 and 46.
