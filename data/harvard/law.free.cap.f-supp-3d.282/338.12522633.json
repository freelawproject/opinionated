Def.'s Mot. for Recon. &amp; to Alter J. [Dkt.\n   <em>\n    #\n   </em>\n   46] (\"Def.'s Mot.\"). The Court previously concluded that two documents that defendant redacted pursuant to Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") Exemption 5 were not exempt, and it ordered defendant to produce the two documents-C05739592 and C05739595-to plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

Based on the Court's review of the State Department's supporting declaration, as well as the Court's previous review of the information sought to be withheld during an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection, the Court finds that the State Department failed to invoke Exemption 1 due to human error, and that disclosure of the redacted information would threaten national security. Therefore, the Court concludes that it is appropriate to reconsider its prior ruling, and it has determined that the withheld material falls within the scope of FOIA Exemption 1. Accordingly, defendant's motion for reconsideration is granted, and defendant need not disclose the redacted information within C05739592 and C05739595 to plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 4, 2014, plaintiff initiated this action against defendant under FOIA, seeking records relating to notes or reports created in response to the September 11, 2012 attack on the United States Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

The State Department's declarant explained that the important national security interests that prevented disclosure of the McDonough email within C05702404 \"appl[y] with equal force to the text as it appears in documents C05739592 and C05739595.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. He observed that certain information withheld dealt with the \"security situation in Egypt, including discussions with foreign government officials conducted with an implicit expectation of confidentiality.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. He stated that disclosure of that information could hurt foreign relations and lead to foreign officials being less willing to \"furnish information important to the conduct of U.S. foreign relations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, disclosure could \"inject friction into, or cause serious damage to, a number of [ ] bilateral relationships with countries whose cooperation is important to U.S. national security, including some in which public opinion might not currently favor close cooperation with the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The State Department's declarant also averred that the documents \"should have [been] marked ... as classified\" and that this \"oversight occurred because of a confluence of unique circumstances related to the processing of emails provided to the Department by former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.\" Stein Decl. \u00b6 9. Specifically, C05739592 and C05739595 were among the emails provided by former Secretary Clinton in response to a request from the Department of State, while C05702404, because it does not contain any email messages to or from Secretary Clinton, was not part of the emails provided to the State Department by her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Documents C05739592 and C05739595 were responsive to requests of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, and were originally compiled and reviewed in response\n   to congressional requests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. The documents were then reviewed for exempt information in this case and were produced with the same redactions as the versions given to Congress.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. In comparison, document C05702404 was received from a different custodian and reviewed by a different FOIA team, and it was produced a few weeks after C05739592 and C05739595.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. The information in C05702404 was redacted pursuant to Exemption 1 because of its classified content, and the information redacted in C05739592 and C05739595 is the same as the information redacted in C05702404.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the redacted information within all three documents had been classified as of May 15, 2015, which was before the documents had been produced to plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6, 11, 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   According to the State Department's declarant, this mistake occurred because the agency \"was facing enormous time pressure to produce approximately 30,000 Clinton emails to the public on its website and laboring under a very heavy FOIA workload at the time.\" Stein Decl. \u00b6 14. As a result, \"there was little opportunity for coordination across the teams processing different FOIA requests involving Secretary Clinton's emails at that specific time, and the differences in redactions and exemptions asserted amongst the three documents went unnoticed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, during the time period when the agency was producing the declaration and narrative\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index in this case, there had been a leadership change in the Office of Information Programs and Services (\"IPS\") the month before, and there was a \"new vacancy in a critical manager position with oversight of FOIA litigation cases in IPS.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although the Court does not excuse defendant's lack of organization, it recognizes that the agency \"has been taking steps to ensure better coordination when documents are reviewed and produced in response to FOIA requests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Specifically, the State Department has increased its use of \"text mining,\" to allow employees to determine if a document has previously been reviewed in the same case or a different case, and it has introduced new tools to enable searches of document collections in order to avoid duplicates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In light of the substantiation of the important national security interests at stake, it does not appear that the agency's failure to invoke Exemption 1 was part of an effort to gain a tactical advantage, but rather, that it stemmed from inefficiencies at and extraordinary burdens placed upon defendant's FOIA unit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    August\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9134100,3719606\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/328/697/\">\n    328 F.3d at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff argues that defendant deliberately failed to invoke Exemption 1 in order to protect the agency's interests, which included avoiding \"designating emails from Secretary Clinton's unofficial server as classified.\" Pl.'s Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3, 6. But this argument is unpersuasive because the agency had already classified the information at issue on May 15, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stein Decl. \u00b6 6. And, as plaintiff concedes, the agency redacted the same material from another document produced in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. \u00b6 1 (\"The only material difference in the emails is the sources-Secretary Clinton's unofficial server or the official server.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Because the State Department's failure to raise FOIA Exemption 1 at the outset of the proceedings resulted from human error, because disclosure of the information\n   would pose a significant risk to national security, and because the agency has taken steps to ensure that it does not make the same mistake again, the Court will reconsider its ruling concerning the production of C05739592 and C05739595, and it will address whether the State Department's redactions are proper under FOIA Exemption 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
