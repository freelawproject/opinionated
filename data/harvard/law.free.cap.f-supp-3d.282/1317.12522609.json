Dr. Wellington's Reports\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Expert Report of Brian I. Wellington, Ph.D., P.E.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In his Expert Report, Dr. Wellington notes that he \"reviewed the Complaint ..., analyzed the hydrology report and development plans, and considered the State of Georgia's [General Permit], Georgia water quality standards set forth in Ga. R. &amp; Reg. \u00a7 391-3-6-.03\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the [CWA],\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201311\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1317, 1321, 1342, 1344, and 1362.\" (Wellington Expert Report at 2.) Dr. Wellington notes that he attempted to determine: (1) the extent of storm water impacts to the Property from storm water discharge from the Subdivision; (2) what portion of the Subdivision was discharging storm water to the Property; (3) the extent of sediment impacts to the Property; and (4) the extent of sediment[ ] impacts to Little Pumpkinvine Creek. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Wellington noted that he visited the Property and Subdivision on February 24, 2016, and on August 24, 2016, and that he\n   \"reviewed dozens of photographs and video provided to [him] by [Plaintiffs].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In Opinion 1 of his Report, Dr. Wellington opined that the Property received a significant volume of storm water from upgradient lots in the Subdivision. (Wellington Expert Report at 2.) According to Dr. Wellington:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The [Property] is located at the low point in the cul de sac of Lullwater Lane, a street that has slope of as much as 11%. Storm water generated on lots 7, 8[,] 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 drains towards [the Property] via Lullwater Lane. These lots also receive significant storm water generated from upgradient offsite areas, located in Seven Hills Unit C. On the section of Lullwater Lane that drains towards [the Property] are located two curb inlets that were installed to capture storm water. However, due to the steep slopes of this road section, these drop inlets have proven ineffective for capturing storm water from the identified upgradient lots. This has resulted in significant quantities of storm water being discharged down the road towards [the Property]. Located adjacent to [the Property] is a third curb inlet that was installed to capture any storm water bypassing the initial 2 catch basins. However, the driveway of [the Property] is located at approximately the same elevation as the road side drains that transport storm water to this inlet. Therefore instead of flowing into this curb inlet, a significant volume of storm water is discharged onto [Plaintiffs'] driveway and directed to their home causing flooding. In order to alleviate this flooding two grate inlets were installed, one at the top of the driveway and the other at the bottom of the driveway and immediately in front of the garage of [Plaintiffs'] home. However, due to the volume and velocity of storm water being discharged down Lullwater Lane, this solution has proven to be ineffective in capturing and prevent[ing] storm water from flowing towards and flooding [the Property].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   In an attempt to prevent sediments from entering the catch basins on the site, erosion control devices referred to as \"pigs in a blanket\" were installed at the entrance of the catch basin. These \"pigs in the blanket\" resulted in restricting flows into the catch basin and directing more storm water to [the Property], further exacerbating the flooding of [the Property].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Dr. Wellington also opined that the Property receives significant sediment during the construction of homes on upgradient lots. (Wellington Expert Report at 3.) Dr. Wellington noted that Plaintiffs' home was one of the first constructed in the cul de sac, and during construction on Lots 9, 10, 11, and 12, sediments escaped the construction sites and were directed to, and deposited on, the Property, aided by the volume of stormwater discharged from upgraded lots onto the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Wellington stated that \"[s]ediment laden water that does not enter [Plaintiffs'] home and garage[ ] crosses the western portion of [the Property] and is ultimately discharged into Little Pumpkinvine Creek in violation of the Seven Hills Erosion Control Permit and the CWA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Dr. Wellington noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   During my site visit on February 24, 2016, Lots 7 and 8 had been cleared with Lot 8 appearing to be the most active. I observed evidence of sediment-stained grass in areas receiving storm water drained from Lot 8, ... and also stained water flowing in the side drain along Lullwater Lane.... These flows suggest that the erosion control measures installed on Lot 8 are allowing sediments\n   to escape the site. In fact, Lot 8 contained a large pool of standing water which will ultimately flow from the lot and to the road during significant storm events.... During my visit I also observed a significant build up of sediments behind the silt fences on Lot 8, ... and a partially collapsed silt fence on Lot 7, ... indicating poor maintenance of erosion and sediment controls. In my opinion, the failure to properly maintain erosion and settlement controls is a violation of the Seven Hills Erosion Control Permit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Dr. Wellington further observed that, during his August 24, 2016, visit, Lot 7 was under construction, and large portions of the lot consisted of bare soil. (Wellington Expert Report at 10.) Dr. Wellington noted that \"[s]torm water generated from these bare soils is directed to the entrance of the lot which is unprotected by silt fences or other sediment control BMPs,\" and opined that \"[t]he failure to properly design, install and maintain BMPs is a violation of the Seven Hills Erosion Control Permit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Dr. Wellington also stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The main erosion control measures or [BMPs] designed and installed on Seven Hills Subdivision Unit D included silt fences and three (3) temporary settlement detention ponds. The design of these ponds requires that the volume of the ponds be determined by the total area draining into the ponds and not by the disturbed area. If the disturbed area is used to size the ponds, then ponds are ineffective in trapping sediments resulting in discharge of sediments to streams, wetlands, and other water bodies in the vicinity of the property being developed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   In designing the temporary sediment ponds for the Subdivision, the design engineer failed to adhere to design according to the required design standards. All the temporary sediment basins were designed using the disturbed area and not the total drainage area. This resulted in under sizing of pond A by 7% and pond B by 441%. This resulted in significant sediments escaping the site and being deposited in Little Pumpkinvine creek in violation of the CWA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   During the construction of the Subdivision, various BMP violations have been documented starting in 2013 and have continued in 2016, in weekly inspections report[s] provided by Gaia Environmental Consulting. These violations include but are not limited to the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   a) Formation of rills and gullies\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   b) Lack of installation of silt fences per approved plans\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   c) Lack of maintenance of silt fences\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   d) Sediments on road surfaces\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   e) Lack of final stabilization on completed lots\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Due to these violations the development received various citations, including a notice of violation and stop work orders issued by Paulding County Erosion and Sediment Control on January 6, 2014, [and] May 29, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (Wellington Expert Report at 12 (footnotes omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In his fourth opinion, Dr. Wellington opined that sediments originating on the Subdivision have been, and were continuing to be, discharged into Little Pumpkinvine Creek. (Wellington Expert Report at 12.) Dr. Wellington explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   The catch basins on the Subdivision discharge through a culvert outlet pipe located on the western boundary of [the Property].... A small sediment trap built with riprap is located at the exit of the culvert outlet. Storm water discharged\n   from the culvert flows over the northwest portion of [the Property] and into Little Pumpkinvine Creek. During my site visit of February 24, 2016, I observed a buildup of sediment within the sediment trap at the culvert outlet. Since no detention or other storm water controls exist on the Site, the uncontrolled peak rate of storm water discharge more likely than not will re-suspend the sediments and discharge them into Little Pumpkinvine Creek.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.) Dr. Wellington also noted that Plaintiffs previously \"observed sediment laden storm water originating from upgradient lots and flowing through the culvert pipe being discharged into Little Pumpkinvine Creek.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) Dr. Wellington stated: \"The discharge of sediment laden storm water is obvious in the photographs ... and constitutes a clear violation[ ] of the Seven Hills Erosion and Sediment Control Permit and the [CWA], the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act, and the Georgia Water Quality Control Act.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Wellington also noted that he viewed a video that Plaintiff Wendy Coward took on December 15, 2015, in which \"the catch basin inlet protection (i.e. pig in blanket) had been removed allowing sediment laden storm water to enter directly into the catch basin and discharges through the drainage pipe then over the northwest portion of [the Property] and into Little Pumpkinvine Creek in violation of the CWA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Dr. Wellington concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Based on inspections of [the Property] and the Subdivision; review and analysis of the construction drawings and hydrology report; and review of historic erosion and sedimentation control violations, it can be concluded that [the Property] is being negatively impacted by storm water and sediments discharged from the Subdivision. Specifically[, the Property] has been and continues to be impacted by excessive, sediment laden storm water flows resulting in flooding of the garage and basement of [Plaintiffs'] home and property. It can also be concluded that sediments generated during construction in Unit D of the Subdivision have been discharged and more likely than not continue to be discharged into Little Pumpkinvine Creek in violation of the CWA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Wellington Expert Report at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Amended Wellington Expert Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiffs filed another version of Dr. Wellington's expert report, which appeared simply to add his CV, a statement of compensation, a list of publications, and a list of previous testimony. (Am. Wellington Expert Report (Docket Entry No. 54-2).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Supplemental Expert Report of Brian I. Wellington, Ph.D., P.E.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In his Supplemental Expert Report, Dr. Wellington noted that, \"[s]ince my initial report I have been provided with additional documents related to the design, installation and maintenance of [BMPs] of [Defendants] and I have reviewed the depositions of various individuals involved in this litigation,\" and offered \"Supplemental Expert Opinions.\" (Wellington Suppl. Expert Report at 2.) Dr. Wellington stated that he reviewed Plaintiffs' Complaint and their allegations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Wellington further observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   The CWA requires a permit under the NPDES for storm water discharges associated with construction and industrial activities including clearing, grading and excavation of at least one acre. Point source discharges of pollutants to waters of the United States are prohibited unless they are in compliance with certain\n   provisions of the CWA. Based upon my investigation, Little Pumpkinvine Creek is considered both Waters of the United States and State Waters of Georgia and is identified as the receiving waters on [Defendants'] Notice of Intent (NOI).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Wellington stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   The issuance of [t]he General Permit for development of a property in Georgia is based on, among other things, the designed and approved construction drawings that include BMPs in both (1) erosion and sedimentation control plans and (2) the storm water management plans. Once the permit has been issued the developer (i.e. [the Forestar Defendants] ) is obligated to develop the property in accordance with approved plans incorporating all designed BMPs. Any deviation[,] modification or omission of BMPs from the plans requires approval of the local issuing authority (i.e. Paulding Co.). The General Permit is violated when no approval is sought and/or given and modification or omissions in erosion and sediment control and/or storm water management BMPs are undertaken during development.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Dr. Wellington also noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   The Seven Hills subdivision was built in different phases or units. [The Property] is located in Unit D, which was designed and developed after Unit C. Unit C discharges storm water into and onto Unit D. A review of the approved construction plans for Unit C shows that a ditch (i.e. a storm water BMP and sometimes referred to as a drainage swale) was designed to transport storm water from unit C to Pumpkinvine Creek. The ditch was designed to be located in a 20 feet drainage easement atop the ridge on the western boundary of Unit D. The location of this ditch and drainage easement [is] shown in the approved development drawing for Unit D.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   The approved construction plans for Unit C and Unit D are dated April 21, 2004 and April 21, 2005. However, based on the evidence and testimony of the developer's representative, Joshua Baxter ..., the approved ditch (i.e. a storm water BMP) was not installed until June or July 2015 and August of 2016, and only after [Plaintiffs] complained about the storm water and erosion and sediments problems that were occurring on [the Property] due to land disturbance activities, and being discharged into Little Pumpkinvine Creek. The General Permit requires BMPs to be properly designed, installed and maintained to prevent or reduce pollution for all construction activities. Where BMPs are not properly designed, installed and maintained, it is a violation of the General Permit for each day those BMPs are not properly designed, installed and maintained. Thus, [t]he General Permit for development of [the Subdivision] was being consistently and continuously violated for a period of approximately 10 years. No reasons were provided by Mr. Baxter as to why the ditch that was designed and required to be installed around 2005 was only installed more than 10 years later. Mr. Baxter stated that \"... but the plans don't call specifically, the date that it needs to be installed.\" Mr. Baxter is wrong. Construction plans are very specific as to when BMPs are to be installed. The ditch was included as part of the Phase 1 Erosion and Sedimentation control plan sheet for Unit C. The Phase 1 Plan included the installation of a check dam within the ditch. In the Phase 3 Erosion and Sedimentation control plan for Unit C the upper portion of the ditch was to be graded. Thus, based on the 2005 plans for Unit C, the ditch was an approved\n   and necessary BMP that should have been installed when other erosion and sedimentation BMPs were being installed during the defined phases and not more than 10 years later. The failure to install the ditch in the designed phase sequence as dictated by the construction drawings is a significant violation of the Seven Hill subdivision [l]and disturbance permit. The design intent of the ditch was to provide a conveyance system to discharge storm water from Unit C in a controlled manner into Pumpkinvine Creek via Unit D. However, the failure to install the ditch resulted in 10 years of uncontrolled storm water discharge from Unit C into Unit D creating both storm water and erosion problems as experience[d] on [the Property] and as evidenced by repeated sediment discharges in excess of permit limits into Little Pumpkinvine Creek. The erosion problems experienced by [Plaintiffs] were significantly exacerbated when individual lots proximate to [the Property] underwent vertical construction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   I have reviewed numerous photographs and videos provided to me by [Plaintiffs] taken during rain events. These photographs and videos show excessive amount[s] of sediment-laden storm water being discharged from [Defendants'] property onto [the Property] and into Little Pumpkinvine [C]reek resulting in substantial visual contrast by these discharges into the receiving waters. In my opinion, it is more likely than not that these discharges constitute violations of the CWA, the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act and the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. These discharges are a direct result of [Defendants'] failure to install approved BMPs at both Seven Hills Unit C and Seven Hills Unit D.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   The erosion control plans for Unit D include[ ] BMPs designed for each individual lot. These individual lot BMP design[s] are based on the assumption that the BMPs will only provide erosion and sedimentation control for storm water generated within a given lot. The failure to install the ditch to transport storm water from Unit C resulted in substantial additional and uncontrolled storm water from Unit C impacting the lots in United D. Since the individual lot BMPs in Unit D only account for flows generated in the lots, the BMPs as installed were ineffective in providing erosion and sedimentation control. This more likely than not exacerbated erosion control problems on these lots resulting in sediments being transported and deposited on [the Property]. My opinions in this regard are further supported by Jon Vansant of [Defendant New Towne], who reportedly followed the approved BMPs plan when constructing homes [on] these lots. In his affidavit dated August 30, 2017, section 15, Mr. Vansant stated that \"[Defendant] New Towne followed the erosion control plan developed by Gaskins Engineering for the [Subdivision]. However, it is my belief that the plans were not designed to handle the excess water that came from Unit C because of the failure to construct the drainage swale below Unit C.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   The failure to install the ditch to convey storm water generated in Unit C in a controlled manner across Unit D and into Little Pumpkinvine Creek for more than 10 years is a violation of the [l]and disturbance permit for [the Subdivision]. This violation directly contributed to the storm water and sedimentation problems on [the Property] and discharges of excessive levels of sediment to Little Pumpkinvine Creek.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The failure to install the ditch for 10 years and its effects on erosion and sediment control BMPs more likely than not\n   also impacted Little Pumpkinvine Creek to which storm water from Unit D ultimately discharges. By rendering some lot BMPs ineffective within Unit D, the storm water generated in Unit C resulted in the escape of sediments in excess of permitted levels from these lots and their discharge into Pumpkinvine Creek resulting in a substantial visual contrast therein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   In his report, [the Forestar Defendants'] expert, Dr. Nutter, claims that the BMPs were adequately installed and maintained in Unit D. He based his opinion on an analysis of rainfall event. Dr. Nutter concluded from his analysis that some of the rainfall events \"were intense enough to overwhelm the BMPs\" and that \"(a) BMP overwhelmed is not necessarily a violation of the General Permit\". Dr. Nutter provides examples of these \"extreme\" rain events as follows: June 24, 2016 with a total rainfall of 2.14 inches, a 7-day event occurring in August 2015 with a total of 2.44 inches, and a rainfall event that occurred between December 24 to 25 2015 with a total rainfall 2.74 inches. It is unclear what rainfall criteria or official/approved BMP design manual Dr. Nutter used to define rainfall events as extreme enough to overwhelm BMPs installed in Unit D. In the State of Georgia, the General Permit requires that BMPs\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be designed in accordance with the design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. This Manual was developed in accordance with provisions of the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act. The Act requires that erosion and sediment control protection for land disturbance activities must provide protection for up to a 24-hour rain storm event with a 25 year return period. Based on the rainfall standards for this area and as utilized in the Stormwater management report for Seven Hills, the rainfall quantity for the 24-hour rain storm event with a 25 year return period is approximately[ ] 6.2 inches. Thus based on the Act, the BMPs on the site should provide protection for rainfall[ ] events up to [ ] 6.2 inches.

The Forestar Defendants argue that Dr. Wellington's Supplemental Report is not a proper supplementation under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(e), as that rule allows supplementation only for the purpose of correcting inaccuracies or adding information that was not available when the initial report was issued. (Br. Supp. Mot. Strike (Docket Entry No. 81-1) at 7-10.) The Forestar Defendants further contend that the Supplemental Wellington Report contains improper and untimely rebuttal opinions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-14.) The Forestar Defendants also argue that the Supplemental Wellington Report includes improper sur-rebuttals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-16.) The Forestar Defendants contend that they will suffer harm if the Court allows Plaintiffs to present the Supplemental Wellington Report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) Finally, the Forestar Defendants argue that certain portions of the Supplemental Wellington Report are inadmissible legal conclusions and are subject to exclusion under Federal Rule of Evidence 702. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs argue that the Supplemental Wellington Report was timely under the Amended Scheduling Order and the Local Rules. (Resp. Mot. Strike (Docket Entry No. 84) at 2-6.) Plaintiffs also note that the Supplemental Wellington Report is not an untimely rebuttal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Plaintiffs argue that they were simply required to disclose the opinions ninety days before trial, and claim that they complied with this requirement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Plaintiffs also argue that the Supplemental Wellington Report is not an improper surrebuttal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Plaintiffs contend that, even if the Supplemental Wellington Report is untimely, the untimely disclosure was harmless and did not prejudice the Forestar Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-10.) Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the statements in the Supplemental Wellington Report to which the Forestar Defendants object \"are opinions on issues of fact,\" and contend that those opinions are not objectionable simply\n   because they embrace an ultimate issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Forestar Defendants argue in their reply that Plaintiffs have erroneously interpreted the Amended Scheduling Order as allowing entirely new expert reports, even when the reports are not based on new information. (Reply Supp. Mot. Strike (Docket Entry No. 88) at 1.) The Forestar Defendants contend that Rule 26(e) does not allow Parties to use supplementary disclosures to permit their experts to conduct additional work or offer new opinions, and contend that the Wellington Supplemental Report is improper supplementation under Rule 26(e). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6.) The Forestar Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not met their burden to show that the delay in producing the Wellington Supplemental Report was substantially justified or harmless, and contend that they will suffer harm if the Court allows Plaintiffs to present this latest expert report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9.) The Forestar Defendants also argue that the rebuttal statements in the latest expert report are untimely because Dr. Wellington did not make those statements within thirty days after the Forestar Defendants served their expert report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-11.) Further, the Forestar Defendants contend that the latest expert report is a sur-rebuttal, not a rebuttal, and is improper. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.) Finally, the Forestar Defendants complain that the latest expert report contains inadmissible legal conclusions.

The purpose of expert reports and a deadline for serving them is to put an opposing party on notice of what it must contend with at trial. Plaintiffs' strategy of ongoing testing and report amendment defeats the purpose of the report requirement and the order of this Court, which was to end discovery and fix for the parties the evidence and opinions with which they would have to contend at trial so a trial court be fairly and efficiently conducted. That effort would be hopelessly and unfairly frustrated if the Court allowed Plaintiffs' tactic in this case. Rule 26(e) requires a party to supplement a report it finds was 'incomplete or inaccurate.' Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(e)(1)(A). It is not a device to allow a party's expert to engage in additional work, or to annul opinions or offer new ones to perfect a litigating strategy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Judge Duffey also observed that \" Rule 26(a) is clear that an expert's report must contain 'a\n   <em>\n    complete\n   </em>\n   statement of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   opinions the witness will express,' 'the data or other information considered by the witness in forming them,' and 'any exhibits that will be used to summarize or support them.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6 (quoting Fed.

Plaintiffs claim that they were required to make these additional disclosures as 'supplemental' disclosures under Rule 26(e), which provides that if a party learns that its disclosure is 'incomplete or incorrect,' it must supplement or correct it 'in a timely manner.' \" Plaintiffs' twisted attempt to use Rule 26(E) to justify their untimely disclosures is unprecedented, and unfair.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Although Edmondson was retained months in advance of the expert report deadline, Edmondson failed to conduct the testimony upon which to formulate his expert report.

The Court therefore must exclude the Wellington Supplemental Report unless Plaintiffs' failure to disclose it was substantially justified or harmless. Here, Plaintiffs have not shown substantial justification for the delay. Indeed, Plaintiffs waited approximately ten months to present the Wellington Supplemental Report, which appears to be based on information that was available, or should have been available, to Plaintiffs from a very early stage in the litigation. Under those circumstances, Plaintiffs cannot show substantial justification for the delay in presenting the Wellington Supplemental Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Further, the late disclosure is not, as Plaintiffs argue, harmless to the Forestar Defendants. Notably, Plaintiffs, not the Forestar Defendants, bear the burden of showing that the late disclosure was harmless. The Forestar Defendants will suffer harm if the Court allows the Wellington Supplemental Report, as they must expend resources responding to the new opinions in the report even if the Court waives the expert disclosure deadline and allows them to present a report from their expert in response to it.
