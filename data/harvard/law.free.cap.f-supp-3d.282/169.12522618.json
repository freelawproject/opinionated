BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In response to an Order from then-Mayor Vincent Gray, the D.C. Department of Human Resources determined that all Office of Chief Medical Examiner employees would be subject to random drug and alcohol testing upon relocation to the new Consolidated Forensic Laboratory building. Plaintiff Patricia Lewis, a former OCME employee, objected and was ultimately terminated in April 2013. She responded with this suit alleging a host of constitutional and common-law claims against the District and several individual officials. Deciding earlier Motions to Dismiss, the Court narrowed both the claims and the number of Defendants. Following discovery, both sides have now filed Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment on the remaining counts. As genuine issues of material facts loom on some, the Court will deny the Motions in part, but enter judgment for Defendants on two causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because both sides have filed Cross-Motions, the facts cannot be set forth in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. As a result, the Court recounts the undisputed facts, while noting specific disagreements about others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the better part of a decade, Lewis worked as a \"[Human Resources] Advisor, Management Liaison Specialist\" in D.C.'s Office of Chief Medical Examiner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 7 (Am.

Compl., \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At some point, the city undertook a plan to design and construct the Consolidated Forensic Laboratory. This new laboratory would house under one roof a number of\n   city departments, including OCME, the Department of Forensic Sciences, and several divisions of the Metropolitan Police Department, such as the Firearms and Fingerprint Examination Division, the DNA laboratory, and the Forensic Sciences Services Division.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.C. Council Resolution No. 19-726 \u00a7 2(b) (Dec. 4, 2012). On June 18, 2012, Mayor Gray signed Order 2012-84, providing authority for the Director of the D.C. Department of Human Resources to \"identify[ ] and designat[e] high-risk or sensitive positions\" for employees who would have a duty station at the CFL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

Pursuant to the Mayor's Order, the letter advised that, \"due to the nature of work performed in the CFL, employees occupying positions which have duty stations\" there would be \"subject to mandatory criminal background checks and testing for controlled substance use.\" Def. MSJ, Exh. E (Letter from DCHR Director Shawn Stokes to Lewis). The letter indicated that recipients could contact Plaintiff, the agency's HR Advisor, for additional information, and it directed policy-related questions to DCHR's Legal and Compliance Administration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-1401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the meeting, DCHR also distributed several forms, including an \"Individual Notification of Requirements Form for Drug and Alcohol Testing.\" Def MSJ, Exh.

According to her, Tucker \"rude[ly]\" descended upon the OCME staff, informing them of the move to the CFL and the resulting requirement \"to undergo a background check and drug testing.\" Pl. SOF, \u00b6 12. He told them that they had until 4:00 p.m. to sign and return the forms or they would be fired.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-1401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-1401\">\n    , \u00b6 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Several employees, including Lewis, were taken aback by the request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-1401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-1401\">\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 39-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Reply, Attach. 2 (Declaration of Patricia Lewis), \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants dispute nearly all of Lewis's account. According to them, Tucker held the meeting to inform OCME staff about the move to the CFL and the accompanying drug-and-alcohol-testing requirements. He did not give an ultimatum or tell anyone that they would have to undergo drug and alcohol testing, but merely informed them that they would be subject to substance testing \"as a condition of relocating to the CFL.\" Def. SOF, \u00b6 12. Tucker denies that he was anything other than the \"messenger,\" sent to \"carry out a mayor's directive.\" Pl. MSJ, Exh. 1 (Deposition of Charles Tucker) at 46:22. Defendants aver that employees were asked to sign the acknowledgment form without any time pressure, at which point Lewis \"belligerent[ly]\" and \"disrespectful[ly]\" voiced her objection to the Mayor's Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. SOF, \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Two days after the meeting, Plaintiff sent a grievance letter to Tucker protesting the policy and claiming that he was \"violating [her] rights to be made aware of any change in working conditions and conditions of employment.\" Def. MSJ, Exh. H (July 20 Letter from Lewis to Tucker) at 1. Lewis stated that she \"was hired into a non-sensitive position that has not been re-classified nor designated as high risk\" and would not sign the acknowledgment form until DCHR conducted a \"reclassification and risk assessment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-1401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She further alleged that her direct supervisor, Beverly Fields, retaliated against her for speaking up at the meeting.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-1401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-1401\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff acknowledged that she had \"asked a lot of questions in the meeting,\" but attributed her inquisitiveness to surprise.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-1401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-1401\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"As the agency's HR Advisor,\" Lewis noted that she \"might have taken a different approach if [she] had prior knowledge or involvement in this process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-1401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She lamented that \"no one at this agency nor the DC DCHR ha[d] involved [her] in any way about this relocation and the requirements that would be imposed,\" despite the fact that her \"name was included in every employee's letter as being the point of contact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-1401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff maintained that she \"had every right to protect [her] own best interests\" and that the Agency as a whole was \"caught totally off guard by this process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-1401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On August 30, 2012, Tucker denied the grievance as unauthorized by the District Personnel Manual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ, Exh. I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In October 2012, DCHR Director Shawn Stokes sent Lewis two follow-up notices, requesting that she sign and return the notice-and-acknowledgment forms, but Plaintiff refused to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Exhs. J-K. The notices further advised that \"corrective and/or adverse action\" could result if she did not \"comply with this process\" by November 8, 2012. In late October, OCME moved to the CFL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ, Exh. J (Notification of Relocation to CFL). On October 23, Lewis attempted to move some of her files into the CFL but was escorted out of the building.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. SOF, \u00b6 69. She alleges that she had supervisor approval to move, but Defendants maintain that she was not cleared to enter the building because she had still not signed the acknowledgment forms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. SOF, \u00b6\u00b6 69, 84; Def. MSJ, Exh. K (October 23, 2012, Letter from Stokes to Lewis). While the rest of the OCME staff moved to the CFL, Lewis thus remained alone at the Massachusetts Avenue building. The parties disagree as to her working conditions there but, suffice it to say, they were not ideal. The building was old and had issues with the heat, elevators, and phones.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. SOF, \u00b6\u00b6 44, 46-47. Plaintiff nonetheless continued to work there until she received an Advance Written Notice of Proposed Removal on January 3, 2013, when she was placed on administrative leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ, Exh. L; Def. SOF, \u00b6 83. The letter charged her with \"neglect of duty and insubordination\" on three occasions: (1) refusing to sign the notice-and-acknowledgment forms on July 18; (2) refusing to sign the forms after the October follow-up letters; and (3) attempting to move into the CFL without being cleared.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-1401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205-1401\">\n    at 1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On April 9, 2013, the District officially terminated Lewis based on the charges in the January 3 letter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ, Exh. M (Notice of Final Decision on Proposed Removal).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Nearly two years after her termination, Lewis filed this suit against the District, former Mayor Gray, Tucker, Beverly Fields (OCME Chief of Staff and Lewis's supervisor), Paul Quander (former Deputy Mayor for Public Safety), and an unspecified group of John Does.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. at 1. The Complaint alleged a bevy of claims, some against only the District, some against only individuals, and some against all. On August 10, 2015, the District, Gray, and Fields filed a Motion to Dismiss, which the Court granted in part.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 30-31. Specifically, the Court dismissed Counts I (wrongful termination), III-VII (alleging Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress and violations of Title VII, the D.C. Human Rights Act, \u00a7 1983, and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act), X (defamation), and XI (Declaratory and Injunctive Relief). The Court also dismissed Lewis's ADA claim except to the extent that she alleged the District had made an improper inquiry into her medical history. The Court further dismissed Gray and Fields as Defendants, finding that any claim against them in their official capacities was redundant given Plaintiff's naming of the District, and any individual-capacity claim did not sufficiently assert their personal involvement. Defendants Tucker and Quander separately filed Motions to Dismiss, and the Court denied the former but granted the latter in a separate Opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 34. The prior Opinions, therefore, left standing the District and Tucker as the sole remaining Defendants and the following claims: violations of the Fourth Amendment (Count II), ADA by making an improper medical inquiry (Count VIII), First Amendment (Count IX), as well as claims for defamation (Count X) and IIED (Count VI).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Having conducted discovery for over a year, the parties now submit Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment. Plaintiff does not appear to have conjured up any use for the Doe Defendants, and she also voluntarily dismisses her defamation claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. MSJ at 39.

To assist the parties going forward, the Court separately addresses the two remaining components of Plaintiff's ADA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Alcohol Inquiry\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Notice and Acknowledgment form distributed at the July 18 meeting stated that, upon signing, the employee would \"be subject to drug and alcohol testing, unless [she] acknowledge[s] a drug or alcohol problem during the 30-day notification period.\" Def. MSJ, Exh. G at 1. Lewis argues that the District violated the ADA by requiring her to disclose alcoholism, a protected impairment and potential disability under the ADA. Defendants first counter that\n   <em>\n    Lewis I\n   </em>\n   allowed Plaintiff's claim to go forward only as it relates to her prescription-drug use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

The prior Opinion focused on impermissible drug testing only because that was the emphasis of the parties' argument regarding dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 20 (Defs. Reply to Pl. Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss) at 7-8. The Court never held that her improper-medical-inquiry claim was confined to this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4330955\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/161/15/#p25\">\n    161 F.Supp.3d at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Lewis's improper-inquiry claim under Count VIII thus survives.\"). The Complaint clearly alleges that both the alcohol and drug tests violate the ADA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 86-93. And Plaintiff incorporated these allegations, albeit quite generally, in her Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 19 (Opp. to Defs.

Reply at 21. Such a stance is irrelevant. \"It makes little sense to require an employee to demonstrate that he has a disability to prevent his\n   employer from inquiring as to whether or not he has a disability.\"\n   <em>\n    Griffin v.

Many circuits have therefore held that a plaintiff is not required to prove or allege a disability in order to challenge a medical inquiry under the ADA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conroy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109048\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/88/#p97\">\n    333 F.3d at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases). Lewis's claim that the District improperly required her to disclose an alcohol-related disability, therefore, rises and falls on whether the city can show that such an inquiry was \"job-related\" or \"vital\" to its business needs.\n   <em>\n    Corwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5743905\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/483/516/#p527\">\n    483 F.3d at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That, just like the Fourth Amendment claim,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Section III.B,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , is a question for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Prescription-Drug Inquiry\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that the policy required her to disclose her prescription-drug regimen. She points to Tucker's August 30 letter, which listed a number of controlled substances for which the drug test would screen but specifically exempted \"authorized prescription medications.\" Def. MSJ, Exh. I at 2. According to Lewis, that language means that, if she had a positive drug test, she would have to disclose her prescription medications in order to show that they were \"authorized.\" She also avers that DCHR's compliance manager, Asha Bryant, told the OCME staff at the July 18 meeting that they would have to reveal their prescription medications if the test came back positive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lewis Decl., \u00b6 4. Defendants, unsurprisingly, contest this version of the facts. They argue that Lewis would not have been required to disclose any prescription medications \"on the acknowledgment forms or otherwise.\" Def. SOF, \u00b6 25. This factual dispute cannot be decided on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Claims Against Tucker\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff brings a Fourth Amendment claim and a common-law IIED claim against Tucker, the former DCHR General Counsel, whom Lewis may sue only in his individual capacity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4330955\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/161/15/#p25\">\n    161 F.Supp.3d at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissing causes of action brought against individual Defendants in their official capacities as redundant of those against District).
