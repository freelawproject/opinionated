KOELTL, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pro se plaintiff Claude Staten, an officer with the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\"), brings this action against the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association of the City of New York (the \"Union\"). This suit-Staten's fourth federal lawsuit relating to his claims of alleged discrimination and retaliation by the NYPD-includes a variety of claims under federal, state, and local laws. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges in his amended complaint (\"AC\") that the Union violated his rights when they failed to provide him with legal representation for his prior employment discrimination lawsuits against the City of New York (the \"City\"). The Union now moves to dismiss the complaint in its entirety pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, arguing that many of the claims are time-barred and that the amended complaint otherwise fails to state a plausible claim for relief. For the reasons set forth below, the motion is\n   <strong>\n    granted.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff is currently a police officer with the NYPD, a position he has held for over thirty years. AC \u00b6 7. He identifies as a black, Hispanic male. AC \u00b6 7. He is also a member of the Union. AC \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A brief history of the plaintiff's prior lawsuits is relevant to this action. Before he filed this case, the plaintiff had previously filed two employment discrimination lawsuits against the City in federal court. He filed complaints on May 3, 2012, AC \u00b6 14, and on June 16, 2014, AC \u00b6 17. In these lawsuits, the plaintiff alleged a variety of employment discrimination claims, including failure to promote, unequal terms and conditions of employment, hostile work environment, harassment, retaliation, race discrimination and age discrimination. AC \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff requested the Union to provide him representation for those lawsuits. The then-treasurer of the PBA, Joseph Alejandro, called the plaintiff on August 12, 2015 in response to this request and informed him that the Union would not provide him with legal representation for these lawsuits. AC \u00b6 31. Mr. Alejandro allegedly told the plaintiff that his \"problems and issues do not involve the Union's membership base as a whole\" and that the Union will \"only represent women who are not promoted due to pregnancy\". AC \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff subsequently sent a letter, on December 29, 2015, requesting reimbursement for his legal fees from the Union. AC \u00b6 36. The Union responded on May 3, 2016, informing the plaintiff that it had \"considered [the plaintiff's] request for reimbursement\" and \"[b]ased on our understanding of the facts and circumstances presented in your request, the allegations you assert do not fall within the parameters of the civil legal plan.\" AC at Ex. 7H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response to the Union's refusal to provide legal representation or to reimburse him for his legal fees, the plaintiff brought this action, alleging that the Union discriminated against him. He filed an EEOC complaint against the Union on June 29, 2016, the same day that he filed this action. AC \u00b6 27. He filed a second EEOC complaint against the Union on January 11, 2017. AC at 14. The plaintiff filed the current amended complaint on January 13, 2017. Dkt. No. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In his amended complaint, the plaintiff has alleged a variety of claims regarding\n   the Union's refusal to provide him with legal representation in his lawsuits against the City. He has affirmatively alleged a claim for breach of contract, AC \u00b6\u00b6 3, 31-37, federal claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1983, AC \u00b6 2, and state and local discrimination claims under the New York State Human Rights Law (\"NYSHRL\") and the New York City Human Rights Law (\"NYCHRL\"), AC \u00b6 3. Reading his complaint generously, he also appears to allege a federal claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , as well as a claim for a breach of the duty of fair representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the allegations in the complaint are accepted as true, and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in the plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    McCarthy v.

Dec. 8, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Here, the plaintiff has not pointed to any specific provision in the CBA that obligates the Union to provide legal representation to the Union's members to prosecute employment discrimination lawsuits. Instead, in support of his claim, the plaintiff attaches to his amended complaint a print-out from the Union's website detailing the benefits provided by the Legal Services Fund. AC at 24-27. The plaintiff contends that this brochure guarantees him the right to be represented by the Union in his civil discrimination cases against the City, and that the Union breached its contract with him when it refused to provide such representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   However, the brochure plaintiff cites provides no such right. The list of legal services offered by the Fund to its members does not include the prosecution of an employment discrimination claim. AC at 27. In fact, the description of the provided services specifically states that the \"Fund's attorneys will provide legal\n   <em>\n    defense\n   </em>\n   in certain civil proceedings brought against a covered member in State and Federal Courts.\" AC at 27 (emphasis added). It does not guarantee legal services for the prosecution of civil proceedings. Indeed, the Union stated to the plaintiff in its May 3, 2016 letter that his lawsuit did not \"fall within the parameters of the civil legal plan,\" AC at 35, and the plaintiff has provided no plausible allegations to show that any provision of the CBA required the Union to provide representation for the plaintiff in his lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The plaintiff also argues that, because the Union has represented female police officers in cases alleging pregnancy discrimination, he also has a right to be represented. However, representation of some union members in other unrelated cases does not establish that the plaintiff has any contractual right to be represented in his individual employment discrimination cases. Thus, even accepting as true plaintiff's allegation that \"Mr. Joseph Alejandro ... stated [to plaintiff] that the PBA will only represent women who are not promoted due to pregnancy\", AC \u00b6 33, that does not establish a contractual right for the plaintiff to be represented. The Union had the right to decide whether providing representation in individual cases might provide a more general benefit to other members without requiring the Union to provide legal representation in every lawsuit that one of its members brought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Therefore, because the plaintiff points to no language \"in the [CBA] specifically indicating an intent to create obligations enforceable against the union by the individual employees\",\n   <em>\n    Rawson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634313\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/362/#p374\">\n    495 U.S. at 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634313\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/362/#p374\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , his claim for breach of contract must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Moreover, the plaintiff has brought his claim for breach of contract against the wrong defendant.

The defendant argues that this claim must be dismissed because the Union is not a state actor and therefore cannot be held liable under that statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because \"the core purpose of \u00a7 1983 is to provide compensatory relief to those deprived of their federal rights by state actors,\" relief under that statute is only available when the \"actions alleged by the [plaintiff] come within the definition of 'under color of' [state] law.\"\n   <em>\n    Kia P. v.

However, at argument on this motion, the defendant withdrew that argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    At argument on this motion, the plaintiff stated that the Union also provided legal representation for one of those officers in a promotion hearing. The circumstances and extent of this representation are unclear, and the Union described its representation as a \"legal defense against criminal proceedings.\" Defs.' Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 18. In any event, such representation is not similar enough to the plaintiff's request for representation to pursue his employment discrimination dispute to establish any intent to discriminate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The plaintiff also makes a plethora of other allegations in Counts Four and Five of the amended complaint and in his opposition papers. He argues that: certain Union delegates receive perks on the job that he is not allowed; the Career Advancement Review Board is corrupt and unreasonably denied his promotion; officers at the NYPD falsified a domestic incident report related to an incident at his home; he was assigned to patrol an unsafe location at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade; and he was retaliated against by the Union delegates and members of the NYPD after he filed complaints against the department. With respect to his allegations in his opposition papers, it is unclear whether these allegations are meant to be a summary of his prior lawsuits against the City or allegations to be considered in this case. However, to the extent any of these allegations could be construed to contemplate claims of discrimination or retaliation under \u00a7 1981, they are not properly made against the Union, because no Union official is alleged to have taken any of those actions against the plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The plaintiff alleges claims of \"Unequal Terms and Conditions of Employment\" and \"Reprisal for Engaging in Protected Activities, Hostile and Abusive Working Environment\" in Counts Four and Five of the amended complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The Court does not have before it the EEOC complaint from which the March 31, 2016 right to sue letter was issued, but the plaintiff stated at argument on this motion that it was not filed against the Union, and the March 31, 2016 right to sue letter does not name the Union.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
