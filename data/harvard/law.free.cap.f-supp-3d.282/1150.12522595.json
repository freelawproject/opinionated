Instead, they argue that JASTA's express statement of purpose is \"to provide civil litigants with the broadest possible basis, consistent with the Constitution of the United States,\" to seek relief against those who provide material support to terrorists. Plaintiffs contend that this language conveys Congress's \"clear expression that any other limitation on the Antiterrorism Act ... is abrogated,\" including every possible statutory immunity. [Docket No. 105 (July 27, 2017 Hr'g Tr.) 8-9.] According to Plaintiffs, Congress could have stated its intention that civil ATA claims should be given the \"broadest possible\" application \"consistent with the Constitution\n    <em>\n     and laws\n    </em>\n    of the United States,\" but did not. Per Plaintiffs, this should be interpreted to mean that any existing immunity law, short of what may be in the Constitution itself, cannot bar an ATA claim.

Plaintiffs' indirect repeal argument rests solely on the phrase \"consistent with the Constitution of the United States\" contained in JASTA's statement of purpose. They do not offer any legislative history or other support for their sweeping argument that JASTA expresses Congress's intent to abrogate\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    statutory immunities for ATA claims, including section 230.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Plaintiffs' argument is not well taken. JASTA does not reference any portion of the CDA either directly or indirectly, nor does it address the responsibilities of or\n    protections for interactive computer service providers. JASTA thus evinces no \"clear and manifest\" congressional intent to repeal any part of the CDA. In contrast, JASTA expressly amended the FSIA to modify the immunity provision of that particular statute.

JASTA modified the FSIA to add 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605B, which allows claims for damages against foreign states in any case \"in which money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or death occurring in the United States\" caused by \"the tortious act or omission of that foreign state\" on U.S. soil.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605B(b) ; JASTA \u00a7 3(a) (adding 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605B, \"Responsibility of foreign states for international terrorism against the United States\").

The legislative history contains no evidence that Congress contemplated that JASTA would abrogate any statutory immunities other the immunity afforded by the FSIA. Instead, JASTA's history, including statements by members of Congress, reflects Congress's clear intent to provide an exception to the FSIA's presumptive immunity for foreign states in order \"to hold foreign sponsors of terrorism that target the United States accountable in Federal courts.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    160 Cong.

They argue that their claims are based upon the fact that Google provides ISIS followers with access to powerful tools and equipment to publish their own content. These tools include expert assistance, communications equipment, and personnel. Opp'n 18. Plaintiffs assert that they challenge Google's provision of the means for ISIS followers to self-publish content, rather than challenging the actual content itself.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    This argument essentially tries to divorce ISIS's offensive content from the ability to post such content. However, Plaintiffs' parsing of means and content is utterly inconsistent with their allegations in the SAC. Plaintiffs do not allege that they have been harmed by the mere provision of the YouTube platform to ISIS. Instead, they allege that \"ISIS uses YouTube as a tool and a weapon of terrorism,\" and that ISIS recruits, plans, incites, instructs, threatens, and communicates its terror message on YouTube. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 148, 150. The SAC is replete with detailed descriptions of the actual content that ISIS has posted on YouTube in furtherance of its terrorist activity, including over 15 pages of allegations of \"ISIS's extensive use of Google's services\" to disseminate its terrorist message. SAC 23-40. In this way, Plaintiffs' claims are inextricably bound up with the content of ISIS's postings, since their allegations describe a theory of liability based on the \"essential\" role that YouTube has played \"in the rise of ISIS to become the most feared terrorist organization in the world.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at \u00b6\u00b6 139, 238 (\"Google's Services have played an essential role in enabling ISIS to grow, develop, and project itself as the most feared terrorist organization in the world.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Moreover, like the plaintiffs in\n    <em>\n     Cohen\n    </em>\n    , Plaintiffs \"rely on content to establish causation,\" thus undercutting their argument that their claims do not seek to treat Google as a publisher of information.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cohen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273814\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/252/140/#p157\">\n     252 F.Supp.3d at 157-59\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202192621\">\n     2017 WL 2192621\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *13.

As the\n    <em>\n     Cohen\n    </em>\n    court observed, Google's \"role in publishing that content is thus an essential causal element\" of Plaintiffs' claims, and \"allowing liability to be imposed on that basis would 'inherently require[ ] the court to treat the defendant as the publisher or speaker of content provided by' \" ISIS.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273814\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/252/140/#p157\">\n     252 F.Supp.3d at 158\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202192621\">\n     2017 WL 2192621\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *13.

As such, Plaintiffs seek to treat Google as the publisher of ISIS's video content.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Plaintiffs offer a second argument to support their position that they are not suing Google in its capacity as a publisher or speaker of third party content. This contention is based on the \"functionality\" that Google provides to YouTube users. Plaintiffs argue that Google provides proprietary functions that are not \"traditional publishing\" activities. These functions enhance ISIS's ability to conduct operations; they include allowing accounts that are taken down to rapidly \"reconstitute\" by permitting bulk friend/follow requests, and failing to take steps to minimize or mitigate \"incremental naming\" of accounts. Opp'n 20-21.

The\n    <em>\n     Stratton Oakmont\n    </em>\n    court reasoned that Prodigy's decision to perform some voluntary self-policing made it akin to a newspaper publisher, and thus responsible for messages on its bulletin board that defamed third parties. The court distinguished Prodigy from CompuServe, which had been released from liability in a similar defamation case because CompuServe \"had no opportunity to review the contents of the publication at issue before it was uploaded into CompuServe's computer banks.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cubby, Inc. v.

According to Plaintiffs, Google selects an ad to be displayed alongside user content based on information it gathers about the viewer and the posting, thus creating \"new unique content\" in the form of a composite page for specific viewers. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 460-461. This specifically-created content is intended \"to capture [a viewer's] attention\" and keep the viewer on the page longer. Hr'g Tr. 58.

In\n    <em>\n     Roommates\n    </em>\n    , which is controlling Ninth Circuit authority, the court interpreted the term \"development\" as used in the section 230(f)(3) definition of \"information content provider\" \"as referring not merely to augmenting the content generally, but to materially contributing to its alleged unlawfulness.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3738362\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/1157/#p1162\">\n     521 F.3d at 1167-68\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . \"In other words, a website helps to develop unlawful content, and thus falls within the exception to section 230 [immunity], if it contributes materially to the alleged illegality of the conduct.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 1168.

They do not claim that Google's ads (which are themselves third-party content) are objectionable, or that the ads played any role in making ISIS's terrorist videos unlawful. For example, Plaintiffs do not allege that any ads paired with ISIS-related content offered tools or instructions on how to carry out ISIS's threats, or otherwise encouraged individuals to commit acts of terrorism. The SAC contains only one screenshot example of an alleged targeted ad next to an ISIS video on YouTube; the screenshot shows an advertisement for a product called \"ThreatMetrix Cybercrime Report: Q4 2015.\" SAC \u00b6 458. Plaintiffs do not make any allegations about the relationship between this product and terrorism.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063579\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/755/398/#p416\">\n     755 F.3d at 416-17\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding interactive service provider was not information content provider as to allegedly defamatory third party posts; even though provider appended his own comments to the posts, the plaintiff did not allege that the provider's comments were themselves defamatory).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Nor do Plaintiffs suggest that Google's targeted ad algorithm is anything but content neutral. Notably, the court in\n    <em>\n     Roommates\n    </em>\n    distinguished between a website that merely provides \"neutral tools\" that may be used by third parties to post unlawful content, and a website that \"both elicits the allegedly illegal content and makes aggressive use of it in conducting its business.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3738362\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/1157/#p1162\">\n     521 F.3d at 1171-72\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

So too here. Google's provision of neutral tools, including targeted advertising, does not equate to content development under section 230, because as currently alleged, the tools do not encourage the posting of unlawful or objectionable material.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    . at 1171-72.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    At the hearing, Plaintiffs suggested for the first time that the\n    <em>\n     Roommates\n    </em>\n    \"material contribution\" test does not apply because the\n    <em>\n     Roommates\n    </em>\n    court was not considering the exact question presented here, which is whether targeted advertising is a form of content development. Hr'g Tr. 59-60.

In support, Plaintiffs cite\n    <em>\n     MCW, Inc. v.

In\n    <em>\n     MCW\n    </em>\n    , the website at issue was a consumer complaint forum. The defendants, one of which operated the website, did not dispute that they \"themselves create[d], develop[ed], and post[ed] original, defamatory information\" regarding the plaintiff, nor did they dispute that they \"personally [wrote] and create[d] numerous disparaging and defamatory messages about [the plaintiff] in the form of report titles and various headings,\" such as \"Con Artists,\" \"Scam,\" \"Ripoff,\" and \"Corrupt Companies.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at *9, n.11. Additionally, the defendants actively encouraged a consumer to take certain photos depicting the plaintiff's company name so that they could be included on the website.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at *10. Based on these facts, the court concluded that the defendant website had acted as an \"information content provider\" with respect to some of the defamatory information on their site and could not claim \u00a7 230(c)(1) immunity.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . In contrast with the defendant in\n    <em>\n     MCW\n    </em>\n    , Plaintiffs do not allege that Google created any content that was itself objectionable or unlawful.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Plaintiffs provide no support for their position that\n    <em>\n     Roommates\n    </em>\n    does not apply here.

Courts have applied the material contribution test in various factual scenarios. For example, the Sixth Circuit's 2014 decision in\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n    is instructive. In\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n    , the court adopted and applied the\n    <em>\n     Roommates\n    </em>\n    test to determine whether the operator of an interactive service provider was a content developer under section 230(f)(3) where he selected allegedly defamatory statements for online publication, appended commentary to the postings, and refused to remove them upon request.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063579\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/755/398/#p416\">\n     755 F.3d at 415-16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court observed that the \"crucial distinction\" for determining what constitutes \"development\" in section 230(f)(3) is \"on the one hand, taking actions (traditional to publishers) that are necessary to the display of unwelcome and actionable content and, on the other hand, responsibility for what makes the displayed content illegal or actionable.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 414.

It also noted that the defendant's provision of neutral tools for third parties to use to submit information did not constitute a material contribution to any defamatory speech that had been uploaded by third parties.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 416 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    . at 412-13 (discussing cases adopting and applying material contribution test). As with the interactive service provider's own commentary in\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n    , Plaintiffs do not allege that Google's own actions-here, its targeted ad algorithm-contribute in any way to what makes the ISIS-related videos unlawful or objectionable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Google's ad pairings do nothing to enhance the unlawfulness of ISIS videos, encourage the posting of ISIS videos, or make posting ISIS videos easier.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Roommates\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3738362\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/1157/#p1162\">\n     521 F.3d at 1172\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (discussing\n    <em>\n     Carafano\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9104618\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/339/1119/#p1125\">\n     339 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1124 ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Plaintiffs also argue that by sharing advertising revenue with ISIS, Google is directly contributing to ISIS's unlawful activities.

According to Plaintiffs, the focus of the entire CDA is \"regulation of speech\" on the internet, and the immunity provided in section 230(c)(1) is merely \"tangential[ ].\" [Docket No. 105 (Hr'g Tr.) 27.] However, Plaintiffs did not brief this argument in their opposition. That alone is reason to ignore it. Moreover, the basis for their position is unclear. Congress enacted the CDA as Title V of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Pub. L. 104-104,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Stat.%2056\">\n      110 Stat. 56\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (Feb. 8, 1996). The CDA included multiple anti-indecency and anti-obscenity provisions or amendments to existing law, including criminal prohibitions against \"the knowing transmission of obscene or indecent messages to any recipient under 18 years of age\" and \"the knowing sending or displaying of patently offensive messages in a manner that is available to a person under 18 years of age.\"\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Reno v.

In asserting that the court must \"look at the whole statute,\" (Hr'g Tr. 27), Plaintiffs did not explain whether they are referring to the entire CDA as enacted in 1996, including its criminal provisions, or to anything else.

Federal criminal statute.\" Opp'n 18 n.8. Plaintiffs make a convoluted argument that Congress intended the ATA to provide a private means of enforcing federal criminal antiterrorism statutes, and thus the terms of the CDA exempt its application to ATA claims. In other words, Plaintiffs appear to contend that the ATA's civil suit provision is part of the \"enforcement\" of a federal criminal statute, and thus falls outside section 230(c)(1)'s protections, in accordance with section 230(e)(1). This argument has been considered and rejected by other courts. For example, in\n     <em>\n      Jane Doe 1 v.
