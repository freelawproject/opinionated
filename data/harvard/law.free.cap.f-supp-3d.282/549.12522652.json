Alleged Lying by Police Officers\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that street sale drug charges against him were trumped up by a group of New York Police Department (\"NYPD\") officers, because they wanted to make an arrest near the end of their tour\n   of duty in order to obtain overtime for completing the attendant paperwork. He contends that there was no factual basis for his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Such cases are becoming increasingly difficult to try fairly. Jurors are ever more aware of stories in the media reporting police officers lying to justify false arrests and to convict criminal defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   New York's police department is widely admired for its overall effectiveness; most jurors find officers more credible than persons accused of crimes. But, as one commentator discussing police officer veracity indicates: some experts on police practice treat lying by police at trials and in their paperwork as the \"norm,\" \"commonplace,\" or \"routine.\" Michelle Alexander,\n   <em>\n    Why Police Lie Under Oath\n   </em>\n   , N.Y. Times, Feb. 2,\n   2013 (\"In 2011, [in New York City] hundreds of drug cases were dismissed after several police officers were accused of mishandling evidence. That year, Justice Gustin L. Reichbach of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn condemned a widespread culture of lying and corruption in the department's drug enforcement units ... 'this court was shocked, not only by the seeming pervasive scope of misconduct but even more distressingly by the seeming casualness by which such conduct is employed.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A NYPD official took the position that the problem of perjury is not pervasive within the department, and that the tendency of police officers to fabricate testimony is no greater than that of non-police witnesses. Joseph Goldstein,\n   <em>\n    Scrutiny of Decorated Detective Raises Specter of Lying as Routine\n   </em>\n   , N.Y. Times, Oct. 11, 2017 (\"Lawrence Byrne, the [police] department's top legal official\" stated that the department does not have \" 'a widespread perjury problem ... I don't believe-although no one has done an empirical study-that the incidence of perjury among police officers is any higher or lower than the incidence of perjury among other categories of witnesses, which includes civilian witnesses, complainants, expert witnesses.' \"). This statement misses the point. Police officers, unlike civilians, have the power to terminate constitutionally protected liberty; with this power comes great responsibility, as well as the need for appropriate oversight.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., N.Y.P.D. Officers Are Charged with Lying About a Suspect\n   </em>\n   , Feb. 16, 2017 (\"Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, said the charges against the detectives were a 'gross violation of their training, N.Y.P.D. protocol and the law. When members of law enforcement commit misconduct,' he added, 'they threaten the credibility of our work and the safety of the citizens whom we are sworn to protect.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In the present case the court will allow the plaintiff to proceed against the City of New York on\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   grounds that allege the failure to take reasonable steps to control lying by police officers is a policy of the NYPD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monell v. Department of Social Services,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    436 U.S. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    56 L.Ed.2d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978). His theory is that the police department has long been aware of a wide-spread practice of false arrests at the end of tours of duty in order to obtain overtime and that it has failed to sufficiently address this practice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff\n   argues that the city's policy is not to track or adequately discipline policemen for testifying falsely. And that it has failed to supervise or properly discipline police officers with a record of being unsuccessful defendants in Title 42 U.S. Code Section 1983 cases because they fabricated evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   B. Charges\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Before the court are four officers from a special narcotics unit who together received over twenty hours of overtime pay for processing two arrests, including that of the plaintiff for an alleged street drug sale. The officer who observed the purported sale, Hugo Hugasian, has a disciplinary record for falsification of overtime as well as a number of prior lawsuits against him claiming false arrest. The officers are personally being sued for: (1) unlawful stop and search; (2) false arrest; (3) malicious prosecution; (4) denial of right to a fair trial; (5) unlawful strip-search;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (6) failure to intervene; and (7) supervisory liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The city is being sued on the theory that its overtime policy and policy on lying by its officers encouraged their unlawful action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Canton v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p388\">\n    489 U.S. 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 388,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p388\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p388\">\n    103 L.Ed.2d 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989) (\"[A] municipality can be liable under \u00a7 1983 only where its policies are the moving force [behind] the constitutional violation.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   One difficulty in administering such a case if it goes to a joint trial on individual and\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims is that the City of New York will be prejudiced in defending its liability by evidence about the individual officers' lack of veracity. The individual defendants will suffer prejudice by the introduction of wide-spread municipal misconduct-lying by police officers-needed to prove a municipal policy. Plaintiff may be inhibited by exclusion of relevant evidence prejudicial to the defendants.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 403 (\"The court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of ... unfair prejudice.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   C. Bifurcation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   To avoid these evidentiary problems, the court has ordered a bifurcated trial. The first phase will be against the officer defendants, the second phase on the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   issue will only need to go forward if the jury finds against the individual defendants in the first phase.\n   <em>\n    Amato v. City of Saratoga Springs, N.Y.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11585879\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/311/#p315\">\n    170 F.3d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 315 (2d Cir. 1999) (\"[B]ifurcation may be appropriate where, for example, the litigation of the first issue might eliminate the need to litigate the second issue or where one party will be prejudiced by evidence presented against another party.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The city, at a hearing on the defendants' summary judgment motion, has in effect admitted liability on the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim if an individual defendant is found liable by stating: \"If plaintiff wins [on the individual claim], we will consent. You can throw the City in the judgment and we will throw a dollar to it and we will avoid the second trial.\" Hr'g Tr. 34:15-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The dollar damages suggested somewhat contemptuously by the city's counsel is not a convincing argument for rejecting a trial of the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   phase\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Even if the city's damages, whether or not the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   phase goes forward, will be the same, a finding by a petty jury that a municipal policy encouraged widespread police officer misconduct can be significant. It may indicate the need for more careful tracking of individual police officers' litigation history and a more effective discipline policy to avoid repeated lying by a number of officers.\n   <em>\n    Amato,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11585879\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/311/#p315\">\n    170 F.3d at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hile the monetary value of a nominal damage award must, by definition, be negligible, its value can be of great significance to the litigant and to society.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The following claims will be tried in phase I: (1) false arrest against Officer Hugasian; (2) malicious prosecution against Officer Hugasian; (3) denial of a right to a fair trial against Officer Hugasian; (4) unlawful strip search against Officer Rubin; (5) failure to intervene, by Officer Essig, in the alleged strip-search; and (6) supervisory liability against Lieutenant Moran.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In phase II\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims against the City of New York will be tried, if any of individual claims 1 to 6 are found proven by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   II.
