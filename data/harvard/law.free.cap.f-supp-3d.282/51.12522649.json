The claims arise out of DynCorp's alleged overcharging for services provided to the government.

In brief, DynCorp provided lodging, security, transportation and other services to support the Iraqi civilian force through a contract awarded by the United States Department of State (\"DOS\"). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-37.) DynCorp subcontracted some services through Corporate Bank Financial Services, Inc. (\"Corporate Bank\") even though, the government asserts, \"DynCorp knew that the rates provided by Corporate Bank ... were unreasonable.\" (\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  </em>\n  \u00b6 4.) The government alleges that \"DynCorp knowingly made material false statements and key omissions about unreasonable labor rates that distorted its negotiations with the State Department.\" (\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  </em>\n  \u00b6 64.) Further, the government claims that \"[b]y misrepresenting and omitting information reflecting the true nature and bases of Corporate Bank's rates, DynCorp skewed price negotiations with the State Department and caused the State Department to agree to higher contract prices than it otherwise would have.\" (\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  </em>\n  \u00b6 6.)\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  DynCorp moved to dismiss the government's claims. (Def.'s Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 10.) The Court concluded that for both the FCA presentment claim and false statement claim, the government had adequately pled falsity, materiality, and scienter under an implied certification theory for the cost-reimbursable charges and a fraudulent inducement theory for the fixed-price charges.\n  <em>\n   DynCorp Int'l\n  </em>\n  , 253F.Supp.3d at 5-6,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202222911\">\n   2017 WL 2222911\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , at *3.

In response, the government took the unusual step of moving to strike four of these defenses, arguing that they \"are legally invalid or improperly pled.\" (Mot. Strike at 1, ECF No. 31.) Two of the four defenses-the fifth and the sixth-relate to an audit conducted by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\"DCAA\") and DynCorp's settlement with DOS. DynCorp argues that if the government found the contract prices reasonable, it cannot now be allowed to revisit that determination. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer at 29-31.)

This determination, however, does not speak to the potential evidentiary relevance of the DCAA audit or DOS's settlement with DynCorp. The Court declines to strike the statute of limitations defense, the laches defense insofar as it pertains to prejudgment interest (seventh defense) and the breach of contract defense (ninth defense).

Breach of Contract and Inequitable Conduct (Ninth Defense)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The government moves to strike what it characterizes as DynCorp's unclean hands\n   defense. (Mot. at 8.) This refers to DynCorp's argument that the government's \"claims are barred by the [g]overnment's prior breach of contract and inequitable conduct.\" (Answer at 31.) Specifically, DynCorp alleges DOS \"ignored contractual formalities ... caused confusion ... provided insufficient time for [DynCorp] to respond to task orders,\" and required performance \"at risk, without adequate assurance that [DynCorp] would be properly compensated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The unclean hands doctrine \"may not be invoked against a governmental agency which is attempting to enforce a congressional mandate in the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

DynCorp therefore cannot sustain an affirmative defense asserting the government engaged in inequitable conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The doctrine of prior material breach provides that \"a party may defend against a breach of contract claim on the ground that its performance was excused by the other party's prior breach of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, the Court denies the government's motion to strike the prior breach of contract defense, but it grants the motion to strike the inequitable conduct or unclean hands defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The government's motion to strike is granted in part and denied in part. The motion is granted as to the fifth and sixth defenses, and granted in part as to the seventh and ninth defenses and it is denied as to laches if asserted as to prejudgment interest (seventh defense) and the breach of contract defense (ninth defense).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Other courts have come to different conclusions about whether to strike a waiver defense under similar circumstances, but these cases do not bind this Court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Landis\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328815\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/308/1/#p4\">\n     308 F.R.D. at 5\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (denying a motion to strike an affirmative defense of waiver in an FCA case in light of the high standard for striking and the early litigation stage);\n    <em>\n     United States ex rel.
