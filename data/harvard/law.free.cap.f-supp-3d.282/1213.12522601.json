The district court applied the Career Offender enhancement and sentenced Petitioner to 188 months' imprisonment-the upper end of his mandatory 151 to 188-month Guidelines range. J. and Commitment 1. Without the career offender finding, Petitioner's range would have been 120 to 150 months. Presentence Report \u00b6 52.

If, however,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   did recognize the asserted right, then Petitioner's claim is timely under \u00a7 2255(f)(3) and he must be resentenced unless the Guidelines' residual clause, as applied in this case, can survive constitutional scrutiny under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   or, in the alternative, his Career Offender designation finds support in another provision of \u00a7 4B1.2. Although the Court finds that Petitioner's motion is time barred under \u00a7 2255(f)(1), it further concludes that, even if\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   did recognize an applicable right within the meaning of \u00a7 2255(f)(3), that right, as applied in this case, would not render his Guidelines sentence unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.
