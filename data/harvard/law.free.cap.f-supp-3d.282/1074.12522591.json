BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a shareholder derivative action on behalf of Wells Fargo &amp; Company\n   (\"Wells Fargo\") against the company's officers, directors, and senior management. ECF No. 83, Consolidated Amended Verified Stockholder Derivative Complaint (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 64. Plaintiffs allege that, \"[f]rom at least January 1, 2011 to the present ('the Relevant Period'), Defendants knew or consciously disregarded that Wells Fargo employees were illicitly creating millions of deposit and credit card accounts for their customers, without those customers' knowledge or consent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Those quotas translated into unrelenting pressure on bankers to open numerous accounts per customer. Bank employees were thus driven to engage in unlawful account-creation practices. And because Wells Fargo's success in cross-selling was central to its financial results and market participants' assessment of the Company, Defendants were also highly motivated to foster and perpetuate those unlawful practices. Indeed, the goal of Wells Fargo's high pressure cross-selling strategy was to show leadership in cross-selling, and, most importantly drive up the Bank's share price ... result[ing] in enormous compensation for the Bank's executives.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo's Officers and Directors either knew or should have known about the allegedly fraudulent cross-selling practices as early as 2007, when the Board's Audit and Examination Committee and then-Chairman and CEO John Stumpf \"received letters from an employee discussing how the Gr-Eight Initiative created a high pressure sales culture that resulted in 'unethical and illegal activity,' including 'routine deception and fraudulent exploitation of [Wells Fargo's] clients.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants were on notice of the fraudulent practices based on (1) complaints as early as 2008 through Wells Fargo's \"EthicsLine\" service related to \"gaming\" and \"sales incentives\"; (2) a 2008 whistleblower lawsuit by an employee related to creation of fake brokerage accounts; (3) several wrongful termination and employment discrimination lawsuits filed as early as 2009 that included allegations of unethical practices; (4) investigations and inquiries by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\") and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\n   (\"CFPB\") as early as 2012; and (5) a December 21, 2013 article in the\n   <em>\n    Los Angeles Times\n   </em>\n   that detailed the fraudulent account creation and the internal policies and pressure that led to it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that \"[n]otwithstanding that knowledge ... neither Stumpf nor the other Defendants disclosed the improper activities to the public, and instead continued to tout their purported success in cross-selling, including reporting artificially inflated cross-selling metrics.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.

Plaintiffs note that the 2013 and 2014 Annual Reports, which were incorporated by reference into the Form 10-K filings, touted Wells Fargo's focus on \"the financial success of [its] customers\" and its management of \"operational risk\" in line with \"regulatory requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22, quoting Compl. \u00b6 372-74, nn. 183-85.

According to Plaintiffs, these statements were false and misleading because Wells Fargo's \"risk controls and oversight policies ... were not strong and robust but were rather ... weak and near-nonexistent\" and because Wells Fargo's compensation scheme actually encouraged employees to engage in illegal behavior, according to the findings of the OCC in its Consent Order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs also defend their repeated reference to the collective knowledge and actions of all \"Defendants\" and their use of incorporation by reference, both of which the Director Defendants cite as evidence that Plaintiffs have impermissibly engaged in shotgun pleading.

As the Court already observed in denying the prior motions to dismiss based on demand futility, the complaint includes \"extensive and detailed allegations\" that the Director Defendants knew of the improper account creation scheme by 2014, and that they made disclosures in SEC filings that they knew were false or misleading as of the time they were made. ECF No. 129 at 29. Indeed, Plaintiffs identified specific statements in the SEC filings that they allege to be false or misleading-namely, the cross-selling metrics that were reported in all quarterly and annual filings and statements in those filings regarding Wells Fargo's success at cross-selling and its risk-management controls.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 124-45; ECF No. 151 at 19-26.

The complaint also cites to the products per household cross-selling metrics reported in annual reports between 2011 and 2015. Compl. \u00b6 144. Plaintiffs allege these metrics and statements about the contribution of cross-selling to the company's financial performance were misleading because of the company's illicit account-creation scheme. The complaint identifies such statements in nearly all of Wells Fargo's SEC filings over the relevant period, and includes a table that shows which Defendants signed, and are thus presumed to have made the statements in, each filing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 367.

First, just as the Director Defendants, Mr. Shrewsberry is liable for false and misleading statements identified by Plaintiffs in any SEC filings he signed. Second, Plaintiffs allege that, throughout the relevant period, the reason Wells Fargo's cross-selling metrics remained high was because of the illicit account-creation scheme that Wells Fargo management encouraged. As the Court has previously noted, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the Board and Wells Fargo senior management, and certainly a company CFO, should have known-based on any of a number of \"red flags\"-that the company's cross-selling practices were fraudulent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 129 at 23-27.

In determining that Plaintiffs adequately pleaded scienter for the Director Defendants, the Court noted that the following factual allegations \"plausibly suggest[ed] that a majority of the Director Defendants knew about the widespread illegal activity by 2014\": (1) Defendant Stumpf testified before Congress that the Board was made aware of \"issues\" related to fraudulent account-creation by 2011, and by 2014 or 2015 had \"connected the dots on customer harm\"; (2) from 2011 forward, the Board's Audit and Examination Committee received periodic reports on the activities of Wells Fargo's Internal Investigations Group, which would have reviewed EthicsLine complaints; (3) consumer lawsuits regarding violation of whistleblower protection laws and the action filed by the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office; (4) the\n   <em>\n    Los Angeles Times\n   </em>\n   article regarding the fraudulent account-creation scheme; (5) intervention by government regulatory agencies, including the OCC and CFPB; and (6) widespread termination of employees due to unauthorized account creation.

Ms. Tolstedt, as head of the group at the center of the fraudulent account-creation allegations, not only would have had access to the cross-sell metrics for her group, but would have had access to any complaints by employees in her group regarding the pressures created by the incentive schemes that she approved.

ECF No. 151 at 49. Plaintiffs argue that Mr. Sloan's \"shifting\" roles as a Wells Fargo executive support an inference that he was aware of the cross-selling fraud and privy to the various red flags the Court highlighted in its earlier order, as he was involved in multiple aspects of the company's operations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs further note that Mr. Sloan admits to being\n   contacted by the\n   <em>\n    Los Angeles Times\n   </em>\n   in connection with the December 2013 article on the allegations of unauthorized account creation, and providing a comment on the allegations from his \"vantage as CFO.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 139 at 11.

The same red flags that the Court noted in finding that the Director Defendants faced a substantial likelihood of liability for breach of fiduciary duty apply to Mr. Sloan, as a senior manager and officer of the company. As CFO and CEO of Wells Fargo during the relevant period, Mr. Sloan would have been privy to the cross-sell metrics that Plaintiffs allege were fraudulent. And even if somehow Mr. Sloan had no knowledge of the fraudulent practices before 2013, which seems unlikely given the senior positions he held at the company, he certainly was aware of these issues as of December 2013 when the\n   <em>\n    Los Angeles Times\n   </em>\n   article was published.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 168 (commenting that he was \"not aware of any overbearing sales culture\" at Wells Fargo).

Mr. Shrewsberry contends that the Court cannot make such an inference, as \"Plaintiffs do not allege what Mr. Shrewsberry knew of this inadequacy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Shrewsberry also argues that Plaintiffs do not allege facts showing that \"Mr. Shrewsberry knew the cross-sell metrics were inaccurate at the time he made the statement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Plaintiffs counter that Mr. Shrewsberry made comments about the Los Angeles City Attorney's lawsuit-commenting in May 2015 that \"none of [the company's] internal systems for getting feedback [on sales practices] like that have been tripped until this [lawsuit] came along\"-indicating that at least as of that date, he had knowledge of the lawsuit.

As has been shown, Matthews and Tizzio both were provided huge equity incentive packages, rendering both their total net wealth and ongoing income highly dependent on AIG's stock-trading price. Moreover, much of the fraud alleged was motivated by a desire to prop up that price. If Matthews and Tizzio knew about much or all of the fraud that was occurring, as I must infer at this stage that they did, it is reasonable to assume that they sold their stock to diversify their holdings and lock in the value the market placed on AIG while in ignorance of AIG's real worth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 801.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The factual allegations before the Court in\n   <em>\n    In re Am. Int'l Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   more closely resemble the ones present here than do the allegations in\n   <em>\n    Rattner\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Guttman\n   </em>\n   . While the Complaint's allegations regarding Ms. Tolstedt's stock sales are not as robust as they could be, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs allege enough facts in support of their Delaware insider trading claims to survive dismissal. Plaintiffs allege in detailed fashion all of Ms. Tolstedt's sales during the relevant period, which amount to roughly $130 million. Compl. \u00b6 386. Plaintiffs also plausibly allege that Ms. Tolstedt had material nonpublic information regarding Wells Fargo's cross-sell metrics and, as head of the Community Banking Division, made repeated public statements about the company's cross-sell success and would have uniquely knowledge regarding the allegedly fraudulent account-creation scheme.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72, 129, 137, 332, 350, 363. While Plaintiffs do not connect the dots by alleging, for example, suspicious timing of trades, one could infer from the detailed information about Ms. Tolstedt's trades and the extensive timeline in the complaint that Ms. Tolstedt traded based on material nonpublic information-namely, the knowledge that cross-sell metrics were artificially inflated. Moreover, whether Ms. Tolstedt's trades were part of a regular schedule or deviated from her normal trade practices is a question of fact that should be left to a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <strong>\n    J. Contribution and Indemnification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Defendants Sloan, Tolstedt, and Shrewsberry each move to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims for contribution and indemnification. ECF No. 139 at 19; ECF No. 140 at 26; ECF No. 143 at 21.

Plaintiffs respond that \"Wells Fargo has already incurred billions of dollars in damages as a result of the illicit account-creation scheme,\" and faces additional liability in other actions. ECF No. 151 at 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The financial harm Wells Fargo has suffered as a result of the allegedly fraudulent account-creation scheme is not relevant to this claim, as Plaintiffs specifically seek compensation as a result of liability \"in connection with the securities fraud class action against the Company currently pending in this district.\" Compl. \u00b6 595.
