While difficult to decipher, the Amended Complaints appear to invoke the District of Columbia's Occupational Safety and Health Act, the District's Industrial Safety Act, and the federal Jones Act. Defendants now move to dismiss, contending that the first statute provides no private right of action and that claims asserted under the latter two are insufficiently pled. Agreeing with the first argument but only some of the second, the\n   Court will grant the Motion in part and deny it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As the two Amended Complaints (one in No. 17-1159 and one in No. 17-1410) are virtually identical-save for a few exceptions addressed shortly-the Court will principally cite the more recent one, which was filed in No. 17-1159 on August 29, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 23. The Court presumes the allegations therein true at this stage and sets forth the following facts accordingly. This is no easy task as much of the factual recitation is jumbled, and what actually happened on board the ship is not easily discerned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff, who served in the U.S. Navy for 20 years, was employed as a deckhand on vessels operated by Entertainment Cruises in the District of Columbia's harbor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 13, 16. On April 25, 2015, an injury to a member of the dining staff left the boat's captain \"in a bad mood.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. In the casting-off process shortly thereafter, Grant assisted the Captain, who \"yanked the gangway ... [and] began slamming it back and forth in the walkway.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19. Another officer was concerned that she had been injured, but Plaintiff informed him that she had \"moved [her] hand.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   There was then a second incident when the boat was preparing to dock after the outing, in which the Captain, \"upset with the many negative events that day,\" attempted to dislodge a stuck rope or line, but ended up \"whipp[ing] the line over Ms. Grant['s] head\" and \"smack[ing] [her] on the fore head.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 22. She \"became dazed and began to faint,\" but he only smiled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 23.
