CBX was represented by Mark Fassold; Defendants were represented by Manuel Mungia and Daniel Lane. After careful consideration of the memoranda in support of and in opposition to the motions, and in light of the parties' arguments at the hearing, the Court, for the reasons that follow,\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Ace's motion for partial summary judgment,\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   CBX's motion for partial summary judgment, and\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULES\n   </strong>\n   CBX's objections and motion to strike evidence\n   <strong>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   CBX was the lessee of the Hibdon Lease, a mineral tract located in Zavala County, Texas. (Dkt. # 16 at 7.) As lessee, CBX arranged for the drilling and operation of the Picosa Creek 1V Well (\"the Well\") to be performed by Espada Operating, LLC (\"Espada\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In 2011, Espada drilled the well bore, placing almost 900 feet of surface casing and more than 5,700 feet of production casing into the Well, and installed a fracking system into the production casing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On October 25, 2011, Espada attempted to pressurize the fracking system; a few months later, on January 25, 2012, Espada attempted to pull the production casing out of the well bore. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In pulling out the production casing, Espada discovered a fracture of about 3,400 feet in the Well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Espada determined that the production casing below the fracture could not be recovered from the well bore. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because the casing was irremovable, the well bore could not be restored, resulting in the plugging and abandonment of the Well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Espada was a named insured on a Commercial General Liability (\"CGL Policy\") issued by Ace American, with a coverage period from April 2, 2011, through April 2, 2012. (Dkt. # 16 at 7.) The CGL Policy was accompanied by an \"Underground Resources and Equipment Coverage Endorsement,\" which replaced and/or added exclusions in the CGL Policy, while adding certain definitions to the CGL Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Espada was also a named insured on an Umbrella Policy issued by Ace Property, which covered the same policy period of April 2, 2011, through April 2, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND-STATE COURT CASE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 21, 2013, CBX brought suit for damages arising from its total loss of the use of the Well against several defendants-but not Espada-in the 293rd Judicial District Court of Zavala County, Texas (\"underlying case\"). (Dkt. # 16 at Ex. C.) In October 2013, CBX amended its state court petition, adding Espada as a defendant, and appending a Certificate of Merit of a licensed engineer who described Espada's role in the failure of the Well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. D.) According to CBX, Espada filed its original answer on November 19, 2013, represented by counsel retained by Ace American after Espada tendered the defense of the lawsuit to Ace.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Exs. E, L.) The state court set a trial in this case for February 9, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. F.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 7, 2015, CBX filed its second amended petition, itemizing alleged damages to its tangible property including: drilling operations, surface casing, unrecovered production casing, the Well and the well bore, the oil and gas itself, and the lease. (Dkt. # 16 at Ex. G.) On August 13, 2015, Espada filed a third party petition, suing three separate parties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. H.) Espada's third party petition stated that it \"alleges that a catastrophic failure of the casing occurred down hole in the Well,\" and that the \"Well allegedly could not be repaired and was plugged and abandoned.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 22, 2015, CBX served a\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   demand upon Espada through its counsel, seeking to fully and unconditionally release its claims for an amount within the limits of the policies issued to Espada by Ace American and Ace Property. (Dkt. # 16 at Ex. I.) By its terms, the\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   demand was set to expire on October 23, 2015, at 5:00pm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   However, on October 15, 2017, the Claims Director for Ace American, Matthew Spector, sent a withdrawal letter to Espada. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. K.) The letter indicated that Ace American intended \"to cease the retention of defense counsel effective fourteen days from that date of [the] letter,\" or, on October 29, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Spector's letter characterized CBX's claims as non-professional liability negligence claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On November 30, 2015, approximately 71 days before the February 9, 2016 trial setting, the state court granted Espada's defense counsel's motion to withdraw as counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Exs. L, M.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A pre-trial hearing was held in the state court case on February 1, 2016; Espada failed to appear at the hearing. (Dkt. # 16 at Ex. N.) Because of Espada's failure to appear at the hearing, CBX requested the state court enter judgment in CBX's favor against Espada.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court ordered that judgment be entered in CBX's favor and set the matter for February 10, 2016, to hear evidence in support of damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On February 10, 2016, the state court heard evidence from CBX's witnesses and exhibits in support of its claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. O.) The state court entered judgment, finding that Espada was negligent and awarded damages and post-judgment interest payable to CBX by Espada. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. N.) According to CBX, the judgment became final and is no longer appealable. (Dkt. # 16 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 1, 2016, the state court entered an Order for Turnover Relief (\"turnover order\"), transferring ownership of Espada's causes of action against Ace American and Ace Property to CBX.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. # 16 at Ex. P.) The turnover order also compelled Espada to execute an assignment of those claims to CBX; according to CBX, Espada has complied with that portion of the turnover order. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 11; Ex. P.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND-FEDERAL COURT CASE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 10, 2017, CBX filed suit in this Court against Ace American and Ace Property. (Dkt. # 1.) Its first amended complaint alleges claims against Defendants for (1) breach of the\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   duty to reasonably settle claims within the scope of coverage and for an amount within the limits of the applicable policy; (2) bad faith; (3) breach of contract; (4) deceptive insurance practices; and (5) declaratory judgment regarding Defendants' duties to\n   defend and indemnify Espada in the underlying case. (Dkt. # 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Pursuant to the Court's scheduling order entered in this case on April 13, 2017, the parties were allowed to file partial motions for summary judgment regarding Ace's duty to defend the underlying case based on the terms and conditions of the CGL Policy and the Umbrella Policy. (Dkt. # 14.) In accordance with that Order, CBX filed the instant motion for partial summary judgment on May 19, 2017. (Dkt. # 16.) Ace filed its own motion for partial summary judgment on the same day. (Dkt. # 17.) Both parties filed responses in opposition to the respective motions on June 16, 2017. (Dkts. ## 20, 21.) The parties filed replies on June 30, 2017. (Dkts. ## 27, 29.) On June 16, 2017, CBX filed an objection to, and a motion to strike, evidence in support of Ace's motion for partial summary judgment. (Dkt. # 22.) Ace filed a response in opposition on June 30, 2017. (Dkt. # 28.)

(Dkt. # 8-1 at 39, 53.) The Professional Services Exclusion provides, in relevant part, that coverage is precluded for \"property damage ... arising out of the rendering of or failure to render any professional services by you or any engineer, architect or surveyor who is either employed by you or performing work on your behalf in such capacity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The UREC Endorsement addresses \" 'property damage' included within the 'underground resources hazard' or the 'underground equipment hazard' and arising out of the operations performed by [the Named Insured] or on [the Named Insured's] behalf.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53.) \" 'Underground\n   resources hazard' includes 'property damage' to ...

(Dkt. # 20 at 6, 8; Dkt. # 17 at 17, 24.) In support of its summary judgment motion, Ace contends that the \"damage to property\" exclusion and the \"Professional Services Exclusion\" exclude coverage for property damage as a result of Espada's defective work.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 17 at 18; Dkt. # 21 at 11.) Instead, the dispute is whether paragraph j(5) excludes coverage only for damage to the production casing and/or the completion liner of the Well, but not physical injury to, and loss of use of, the Well in its entirety. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 17 at 18; Dkt. # 21 at 11.) To answer this question, the Court must consider the parties' opposing definitions of \"that particular part\" as stated in the exclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Basic Energy Servs., Inc. v.

(Dkt. # 21 at 11.) In support, CBX argues that its second amended petition in the underlying case clearly alleges damage to property that occurred only during Espada's performance of operations on the production casing of the Well and/or the completion liner of the Well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. # 21-8.) CBX contends that, even if paragraph j(5) excludes damage to the production casing and/or the completion liner of the Well, it does not exclude damage to the remaining components of the Well. (Dkt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   # 21 at 11.) CBX argues that it has alleged other damage not within this scope of this exclusion, including damage to tangible property that is still covered by Ace American's CGL Policy, including (1) drilling operations, (2) surface casing, (3) unrecovered production casing, (4) the well and the wellbore, (5) the oil and gas itself, and (6) the lease. (Dkt. # 16 at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Ace American, on the other hand, argues \"that particular part\" means not only the production casing and/or the completion liner, but the entire well. (Dkt. # 29 at 6.) In other words, because all the parts are necessary to the whole, the exclusion bars coverage for the whole well rather than just a component of it. Under this reading of the exclusion, the Well is a singular unit and, therefore, CBX would be barred from recovering any damages. Ace American contends that Espada was not hired to work on a discrete component of an already completed well, but was instead hired to drill, operate, and construct the entire well, and in the course of its operations, Espada damaged the entire well. (Id. at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In support of its position, CBX cites cases where parties were contracted to perform work on discrete components of previously completed projects, such as wells, but not to oversee and construct the entire project.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Basic Energy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3765758\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/655/666/#p676\">\n    655 F.Supp.2d at 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (refusing to apply same exclusion on basis that insured was hired only to replace an oil pump and tubing on a previously constructed well);\n   <em>\n    Underwriters at Lloyd's London v.

CBX alleges that: (1) Espada was hired to drill and operate the Hibdon lease; (2) Espada and/or its subcontractors drilled the Well's well bore; (3) Espada and/or its subcontractors placed over 5,000 feet of production casing and a fracking completion system into the Well; (4) Espada and/or its subcontractors attempted to pressurize the completion system; (5) the production casing was fractured at about 3,400 feet; and, as a result of the fractured casing; (6) the Well was plugged and abandoned.

First, it reduces the aggregate limits of liability applicable to claims arising out of certain property damage from $2,000,000 to $1,000,000. (Dkt. # 8-1 at 53-54.) Second, the UREC Endorsement expressly replaces part of the language of the exclusion contained within paragraph j(4) in the CGL Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54.) As a result, paragraph j(4), stating that \"property damage\" to the \"[p]ersonal property in the care, custody or control of the insured\" will be excluded from coverage, narrows that exclusion and now includes language that \"[t]his exclusion does not apply to any 'property damage' included within the 'underground resources hazard' or the 'underground equipment hazard' other than 'property damage' to that particular part of any real property on which operations are being performed by you or on your behalf if the 'property damage' arises out of those operations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Last, the UREC Endorsement defines \"Underground resources hazard\" and \"Underground equipment hazard.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The UREC Endorsement expressly provides that \"[a]ll other terms and conditions of the policy remain unchanged.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In support of its interpretation of the UREC Endorsement, CBX cites\n   <em>\n    Mid-Continent Cas.

The Oil &amp; Gas Endorsement in\n   <em>\n    Bay Rock\n   </em>\n   did not contain wording specifically identifying any express exclusion(s) in the CGL Policy to which it applied or superseded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. Instead, the district court determined that \"a potential conflict with the coverage grant in the Oil &amp; Gas Endorsement existed\" because the endorsement \"purport[ed] to exclude coverage for damage to that particular part of property that the insured was working on.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Fifth Circuit, in affirming the district court, noted that \"[t]he Oil &amp; Gas Endorsement provided Bay Rock with additional coverage for property damage to the\" underground resources hazard.\n   <em>\n    Bay Rock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706397\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/105/\">\n    614 F.3d at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, however, there is no similar language in the UREC Endorsement specifically providing coverage for either the underground resources hazard or the underground equipment hazard. Instead, the UREC Endorsement\n   clearly and explicitly adds coverage only to the exclusion in paragraph j(4), while indicating that \"[a]ll other terms and conditions of the policy remain unchanged\"-no such similar language appears in Bay Rock's Oil &amp; Gas Endorsement. (Dkt. # 8-1 at 54; Dkt. # 17-3 at 87-89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Therefore, contrary to CBX's contention, the Court finds the language in the UREC Endorsement unambiguous and that its language does not conflict with the exclusion in paragraph j(5). As discussed, the UREC Endorsement clearly and explicitly states that it is replacing\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   paragraph j(4)'s exclusion, stated above, with language that expands Espada's coverage for damage to property that occurs in the area defined as the \"underground resources hazard\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the \"underground equipment hazard.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. # 8-1 at 54.)

Tex. Sept. 5, 2012), the Court observes that the UREC Endorsement does not specifically alter, amend, or\n   add any other coverage in the CGL Policy, aside from the exclusion in paragraph j(4)-which it explicitly and squarely purports to replace. For these reasons, the Court concludes that the UREC Endorsement and the exclusion in paragraph j(5) do not conflict, and thus the UREC Endorsement does not supersede the exclusion in paragraph j(5). Accordingly, despite CBX's argument to the contrary, Ace American had no duty to defend Espada in the underlying case on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Professional Services Exclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Ace American further argues that the Professional Services Exclusion, defined above, also precludes coverage for Espada's property damage to the Well. (Dkt. # 17 at 24.) Ace American asserts that the underlying case is based on Espada's failure to use its specialized or technical knowledge in its work on drilling and operating the Well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In opposition, CBX disputes that Espada's work on the Well qualifies as \"professional services.\" (Dkt. # 21 at 18.) Although the Court has already found that the property damage to the Well was excluded from coverage pursuant to the CGL Policy, to be thorough, the Court will consider the Professional Services Exclusion, as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Since the CGL Policy does not define professional services, the relevant definition is that provided by Texas law: \"the task must arise out of acts particular to the individual's specialized vocation, [and] ... it must be necessary for the professional to use his specialized knowledge or training.\"\n   <em>\n    Atl.

App.-Dallas 1998, pet. denied). While it does not define professional services, the CGL Policy does include a list of activities that fall within the exclusion, including: \"supervisory, inspection, architectural or engineering activities.\" (Dkt. # 8-1 at 39.) None of these terms are further defined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In accordance with the eight-corners rule, the Court will look to the state court petition in the underlying case to determine whether the conduct alleged falls within the Professional Services Exclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. Merchs.

CBX's second amended petition alleges that \"Espada was retained for the purpose of implementing [another's] plan, procuring and using the proper materials to include casing, and performing related oil and gas well drilling and completion services to deliver a producing well for [CBX].\" (Dkt. # 21-8 at 7.) CBX further alleges that \"Espada owed a duty to perform these activities within recognized industry standards and practices, as well as to deliver a competent well design that would result in a completed and productive well.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) CBX alleges that Espada's breach of this duty resulted in \"deviations from accepted industry practices and standards constitute[ing] professional negligence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In support of its negligence claim, CBX attached to the petition, an affidavit from a licensed engineer who opined that Espada was professionally negligent in its actions, stating that Espada's \"acts, errors, and/or omissions renders the professional services provided insufficient and inadequate.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 21-5 at 12-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Here, while CBX acknowledges that some of its allegations against Espada are for professional negligence, it asserts that it also alleged ordinary negligence against Espada for the \"mundane tasks of drilling and operating.\" (Dkt. # 27 at 19.) For instance, CBX contends that its live state court petition \"leaves open the possibility that the negligent [acts] resulted from ordinary negligence-e.g., a worker fell asleep during [the] operation, dropped a tool that damaged equipment, etc.\" (Dkt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   # 27 at 13.) CBX also argues that, in any case, the UREC Endorsement, discussed above, supersedes the Professional Liability Exclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   First, the Court finds CBX's argument that the UREC Endorsement supersedes the Professional Services Exclusion meritless. The Court has already determined, as discussed above, that the UREC Endorsement does not supersede any of the real property damage to the Well at issue. Additionally, to the extent an endorsement can conflict with an added exclusion not contained within the main body of a CGL Policy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court finds that the UREC Endorsement and the Professional Services Exclusion do not conflict with each other, and therefore, the UREC Endorsement does not supersede the Professional Services Exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Second, the Court finds that CBX's argument that its petition alleges claims based on non-professional services also fails. CBX has clearly alleged that its claims are based on Espada's failure \"to deliver a producing well for [CBX],\" and they are grounded on Espada's \"professional negligence,\" stemming from the \"deviations of accepted industry practices and standards.\" (Dkt. # 21-8 at 7.) CBX further alleges that \"Espada owed a duty to perform these services within recognized industry standards.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) CBX's allegations do not otherwise clearly allocate some of the breach of duty to any non-professional duties, and its attached affidavit of an engineer in support of its claims for professional negligence does not do so either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Court also finds that CBX's request for the Court to consider that perhaps \"a worker fell asleep during [the] operation, [or] dropped a tool that damaged equipment,\" asks the Court to look beyond the eight-corners of the petition and CGL Policy. CBX has not alleged these ordinary negligence facts in its state court petition, and the Court cannot now consider them as the basis-either in whole or in part-for its claims against Espada.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merchants Fast Motor Lines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10015789\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/939/139/#p141\">\n    939 S.W.2d at 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If a petition does not allege facts within the scope of coverage, an insurer is not legally required to defend a suit against its insured.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Additionally, the Court finds the Fifth Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Admiral Ins.

In\n   <em>\n    Admiral\n   </em>\n   , the insured had contracted to provide professional services in drilling an oil well. The Fifth Circuit stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Aside from Exco's bald statement that certain (unspecified) acts were non-professional, the only arguably nonprofessional conduct alleged was failing to look for metal shavings or to use a magnet to detect shavings in mud. The actual performance of these acts is perhaps akin to conduct that we have found to be non-professional. But Exco is not suing Ford because Ford was told to watch for pipe wear and metal shavings and failed to do so. Rather, the complaint is that Ford failed to act upon its specialized knowledge that those tasks needed to be performed (i.e., Ford failed to instruct the mud logger to look for shavings). Indeed, the specific failures are listed as sub-parts of a general failure \"to perform adequate and competent drilling operations.\" In other words, the allegations are not that Ford incorrectly performed some non-professional activity, but that Ford failed to properly implement a plan to drill a well over 16,000 feet deep.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682813\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/420/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682813\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/420/\">\n    at 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Dkt. # 17 at 28.) Ace Property contends that exclusion E(5) in the Umbrella Policy is identical in language to the exclusion in paragraph j(5) of the CGL Policy, and also that the Umbrella Policy's Professional Service Exclusion is substantially the same as the one in the CGL Policy, discussed above. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ace Property argues that for the same reasons identified above, the Court should find that the Umbrella Policy and its Professional Services Exclusion preclude coverage for the underlying suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, Ace Property contends that the Umbrella Policy's Oil and Gas Industries Limitation Endorsement precludes coverage for underlying case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   For the same reasons discussed herein, as stated above, the Court finds that exclusion e(5) in the Umbrella Policy and its Professional Services Exclusion\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   preclude coverage for the underlying case. As for the Oil and Gas Industries Limitation Endorsement, stating that the Umbrella Policy does not apply to \"any injury, damage, expense, cost, 'loss,' liability or legal obligation for any ... \"[l]oss of damage to ... \"[a]ny well, hole, formation, strata or area in or through which exploration for any production of any substance is carried on,\" the Court arrives at the same conclusion. As discussed, CBX's state court petition clearly alleges such damage to the Well and its casing therein, which is precluded from coverage under the Oil and Gas Industries Limitation Endorsement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 21-8.) Accordingly, the Court concludes that the underlying case is not covered by the Umbrella Policy, and Ace Property had no duty to defend Espada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Ace American and Ace Property had no duty to defend Espada in the underlying\n   case. The Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Ace's motion for partial summary judgment on this issue (Dkt. # 17), and\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   CBX's motion for partial summary judgment (Dkt. # 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    CBX's Objections and Motion to Strike Ace's Summary Judgment Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   CBX objects to seven of Defendants' exhibits offered in support of summary judgment. (Dkt. # 22.) First, CBX objects to the declaration of Manuel Mungia, Jr., on the basis that he has attempted to authenticate documents, attached as exhibits to his declaration, without any personal knowledge of them. The Court finds this objection mostly meritless-the bulk of documents attached to Mr. Mungia's declaration are public court filings from the underlying case. Additionally, the Fifth Circuit has recently ruled that, at the summary judgment stage, evidence need not be authenticated or otherwise presented in an admissible form.\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276353\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/353/#p355\">\n    859 F.3d at 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In any case, in ruling on Ace's motion for summary judgment, the Court only reviewed CBX's Second Amended Complaint and the Ace Policies at issue in this case; the Court did not consider any of the other attachments to Mr. Mungia's declaration. This objection is\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   CBX next objects to Ace's exhibits 2 through 9, on the basis that they are not relevant under Rule 402 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. (Dkt. # 22 at 2.) CBX also objects to Ace's exhibits 3 through 9, on the basis that they are inadmissible hearsay and not properly authenticated. However, the Court, in making its ruling on Ace's partial summary judgment motion, did not rely on the evidence that CBX now objects to and moves to strike. In accordance with the eight-corners rule, discussed above, the Court relied mainly on CBX's Second Amended Petition (Dkt. # 21-8), as well as on the two Ace Policies in question (Dkt. # 8-1, Dkt. # 17-1 at 9). Therefore, the Court finds each objection to be without merit and\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULES\n   </strong>\n   the objections and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the motion to strike (Dkt. # 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Because the Court has found that the CGL Policy does not apply to the type of \"property damage\" alleged by CBX, Ace did not have a duty to defend Espada in the underlying case.

(\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) However, CBX's own pleadings in state court do not allege these damages directly as a result of Espada's physical injury to, and loss of use of, the Well. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. # 21-8.) Instead, CBX sought to recover these damages as result of that property damage. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 9-10 (\"[t]hese damages flow from the loss of its drilling operations due to the subsequent forced plugging and abandoning of the [Well]\").) Furthermore, CBX has not presented sufficient evidence in its motion and its responses to Ace's motion-and Ace does not concede-that these alleged damages were \"property damage\" caused by an \"occurrence\" as defined in the CGL Policy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Although not discussed in\n    <em>\n     Bay Rock\n    </em>\n    , the Oil &amp; Gas Endorsement does not add coverage for property damage to\n    <em>\n     real property\n    </em>\n    within the defined \"Underground Equipment Hazard,\" but does, however, appear to apply to\n    <em>\n     personal property\n    </em>\n    included in the exclusion in paragraph j(4) of the CGL Policy, as the Court has found so in this case. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. # 17-3 at 89 (stating that the insurance \"does not apply to ...

(Dkt. # 21 at 15.) \"Underground Resources Hazard\" is defined as \"property damage\" to \"[a]ny well, hole, formation, strata, or area in or through which exploration for or production of any substance is carried on.\" (Dkt. # 8-1 at 54.) The Court disagrees with CBX's contention, finding that the UREC Endorsement narrows the exclusion in paragraph j(4) by providing coverage for damage to certain real property not already included in paragraph (j)(5)'s exclusion-such as underground damage to real property on which Espada's operations are not being performed. Examples of this include damage to neighboring minerals, wells, holes, or formations that result from Espada's operations on the Well that may occur as a result of horizontal drilling or \"frackquakes.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Ace American informs the Court of one value to the insured of this interpretation of the UREC Endorsement's additional coverage to personal property: \"[a] well operator such as Espada will routinely have in its care, custody, or control, personal property (such as pipes, drill bits, and other well-servicing machinery) that could potentially be damaged in the course of its drilling operations\" and that the endorsement \"provides coverage for claims against the insured for damage to those types of personal property.\" (Dkt. # 29 at 9.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    CBX has failed to cite any authority for this proposition.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The cases CBX cites in support of its contention that Espada's drilling and completion services constituted non-professional services are inapposite and do not completely support CBX's position.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Willbros RPI, Inc. v.
