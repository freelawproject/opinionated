She alleges that her property damage claim for the total loss of her vehicle to fire was wrongly denied, and that her agent improperly continued to collect premiums on the policy notwithstanding their knowledge of the destruction of the insured property. Defendants have removed this action to federal court, seeking dismissal of the claim against the (non-diverse) agent on the ground that the agent was fraudulently joined, and further seeking dismissal of the entire case on the ground that the Plaintiff violated a condition precedent of the insurance contract by failing to give a recorded statement before bringing this action. I am not persuaded that the agent for the policy was fraudulently joined, and will therefore not reach the merits of the case, but rather remand it to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The complaint alleges that Plaintiff Melinda Bradley-Williams, a Pennsylvania resident, could not find her vehicle as she was leaving for work one morning and reported it missing to the police. The vehicle was found set on fire and destroyed that same day. The vehicle was insured by Agency Insurance Company (\"the carrier\"), a Maryland corporation, and the policy had been issued through Durham Insurance Group (\"the agent\"), a Pennsylvania company, which acted on Agency's behalf in issuing the policy and assisted in handling Plaintiff's claim (collectively, \"the Defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The claim was investigated by the insurer, which requested a substantial amount of documentation from Plaintiff during the course of its inquiry. Ultimately, Plaintiff was advised that the insurer was rejecting the claim, which included refusal to supply a rental car. According to the complaint, which asserts claims for breach of contract and bad faith, she was specifically told \"[the carrier] would not be paying for the claims and to get a lawyer.\" Compl. \u00b6 30. Meanwhile, Plaintiff continued to receive billings from the agent and the carrier for coverage of her destroyed car. She continued to pay the premiums, pleading that she did so because she was \"unsure of what to do\" and \"intimidated\" by the aggressive conduct of the carrier. Compl. \u00b6 34. She thus alleges that the Defendants collected these payments and failed to remove the vehicle from the policy, despite knowing the vehicle had been destroyed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Under the doctrine of fraudulent joinder, a defendant may remove a non-diverse case if it can establish that all in-state defendants were sued solely to prevent removal to federal court.\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Plaintiff responds that, as the insurance agent who services her account, Durham owed a duty to Plaintiff, Compl. \u00b6 28, and violated its duty to act in her best interest by continuing to process her car insurance premium payments while knowing the vehicle had been destroyed. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs' complaint is not a model of clarity, and Defendants are certainly correct that the principal focus of this ligation will be the conduct of the carrier. Defendants confidently assert that the claim against the agent would not have survived preliminary objections in state court, but chose not to seek a ruling there, one which would have definitively determined whether diversity exists. Having reviewed Pennsylvania law, I find no clear answer, and that ambiguity weighs in favor of remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On its face, an agent's continued collection of premiums to insure property that no longer exists seems blameworthy, the type of conduct for which a remedy ought to exist. The parties do not cite, nor has this Court independently found, any Pennsylvania law that addresses such a situation.

Nonetheless, Pennsylvania law regarding the obligations of brokers provides some benchmark, which is that a broker may be sued for breach of the duty of care to an insured, with their actions measured by the traditional standard of \"reasonable\" conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kearns,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"643527\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/75/413/#p423\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"643527\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/75/413/#p423\">\n    75 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   423 (citing\n   <em>\n    Consolidated Sun Ray, Inc. v.

At a minimum, such principles would seem to weigh in favor of the claim Plaintiff advances. The defense argues that insurance regulations might have limited Durham's ability to cancel the policy in the absence of a specific request from the insured, but that goes to the ultimate merits of the claim, and not the threshold question of whether a cause of action exists under Pennsylvania law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the absence of controlling authority, Defendants argue that I should predict how the Pennsylvania Supreme Court might rule on such a claim, citing\n   <em>\n    Peer v.
