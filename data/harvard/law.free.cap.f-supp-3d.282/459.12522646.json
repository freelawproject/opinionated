So the question for the Court is whether Mancini has marshalled enough evidence to demonstrate that there is a material issue of disputed fact as to the claim of pretext that needs to be resolved by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Mancini presents several arguments in his attempt to show that the City\n   intentionally discriminated against him because of his alleged disability. Plaintiff's arguments, read in conjunction with each other, state his theory that genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether (1) Mancini's performance of his assigned duties justified an award of \"0\" service points; (2) Mancini was the least qualified for the position of lieutenant as compared to the other promotional candidates; and (3) Clements had legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons to award Mancini a \"0,\" when two years earlier in 2010, Clements had recommended Mancini a \"5\" for the same promotional exam, and three years later awarded him a \"4.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiff's arguments are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the City intentionally discriminated against him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garcia-Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4152521\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/81/#p87\">\n    761 F.3d at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a genuine issue of material fact \"must be built on a solid foundation-a foundation constructed from materials of evidentiary quality.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nieves-Romero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047901\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/375/#p378\">\n    715 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   378 ). When boiled down, Plaintiff's argument is simply that a reasonable jury will not believe Colonel Clements and instead it would be compelled to find Mancini more qualified than the other candidates. But this theory does no more than beg the question. Plaintiff's burden is to show some evidence of intentional discrimination, i.e., that the City's proffered reasons are pretextual. Although Mancini presents a colorable argument that his service points score of \"0\" was unfair, he presents no evidence to establish a relationship between his score and his alleged disability. While direct evidence of intentional discrimination is not necessary for Mancini to overcome his burden of persuasion, Mancini has failed to provide the \"compelling proof of the pretextual nature of the employer's explanations[s]\" necessary for a reasonable jury to infer a fact of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rathbun\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645570\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/62/#p71\">\n    361 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   72 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mesnick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524144\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/950/816/#p823\">\n    950 F.2d at 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that a \"plaintiff must offer some minimally sufficient evidence, direct or indirect,\n   <em>\n    both of pretext and of the employer's discriminatory animus\n   </em>\n   to prevail in the face of a properly drawn Rule 56 motion.\" (emphasis added)). Not only is there no evidence of pretext or animus, the evidence that is in the record shows that, during the 2012 Sergeant's Promotional Exam, eleven candidates were on IOD status, and every candidate with such status was awarded a \"5\" or a \"4\" on the service points section by Clements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   It defies reason that Clements would penalize Mancini for his alleged disability as he sought a promotion to the rank of lieutenant, while Clements simultaneously disregarded that fact for other officers seeking a promotion to the rank of sergeant. One may be able to infer that Clements thought Mancini undeserving, or perhaps disliked him for one reason or another-but such inferences are of no consequence. Plaintiff's argument as to pretext rests ultimately on speculation, not evidence, and therefore must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   III.
