Class representatives in the parallel state action move to intervene and, along with defendants, oppose class certification. For the reasons herein, lead plaintiff's motion for class certification is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   Lead plaintiff's motion for an injunction is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n   State plaintiffs' motion to intervene is\n   <strong>\n    CONDITIONALLY GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    1. THE FEDERAL ACTION.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The background of this action has been set forth in a prior order (Dkt. No. 181). In brief, a number of putative class actions were filed in our district court on behalf of investors who purchased securities of defendant LendingClub Corporation in its initial public offering. The actions were consolidated and an order appointed Water and Power Employees' Retirement, Disability and Death Plan of the City of Los Angeles (\"WPERP\") as lead plaintiff (Dkt. No. 90). Remaining defendants include LendingClub, Renaud Laplanche (LendingClub's founder and former CEO), Carrie Dolan (LendingClub's former CFO), LendingClub directors and former directors, and the financial firms that underwrote LendingClub's IPO (Dkt. No. 126 at 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   LendingClub acted as a so-called peer-to-peer lender. It operated an online marketplace that connected borrowers to investors. When a borrower and investor matched, LendingClub facilitated the loan and then acted as the loan servicer, earning fees for servicing and loan origination (Dkt. No. 126 at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 11, 2014, LendingClub completed its IPO, selling more than 66.7 million shares of common stock at $15 per share. In connection with the IPO, it issued a registration statement, which it filed with the SEC. That statement included representations about LendingClub's internal control procedures for financial reporting, which stated that LendingClub had evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that they were \"effective at a reasonable assurance level.\" The registration statement\n   further represented that LendingClub evaluated borrowers using \"sophisticated risk assessment\" processes and maintained an effective data-security program (Dkt. No. 126 \u00b6\u00b6 35, 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The registration statement also specified a 180-day \"lock-up\" period, beginning on December 11, 2014, during which only IPO shares were available to the public. When the lock-up period ended on June 9, 2015, both IPO and non-IPO shares became available on the open market (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35, Dkt. No. 223 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   WPERP began purchasing shares of LendingClub stock on May 4, 2015, and by the time the lock-up period ended on June 9, 2015, it owned 306,620 shares. WPERP continued thereafter to buy and sell LendingClub shares, never holding fewer than the 306,620 shares, eventually acquiring more than 1.7 million shares (Dkt. No. 231-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 9, 2016, less than eighteen months after the IPO and issuance of the registration form, LendingClub's CEO, Laplanche, resigned following \"an internal review of sales of $22 million in near-prime loans to a single investor, in contravention of the investor's express instructions as to a non-credit and non-pricing element.\" LendingClub also reported that it had discovered that Laplanche had a financial stake in Cirrix Capital, L.P., a company formed for the sole purpose of purchasing LendingClub loans. One week later, LendingClub's quarterly report revealed that it had \"identified material weakness,\" including a \"[l]ack of transparent communication and appropriate oversight\" in dealing with investors. These weaknesses resulted from \"the aggregation of control deficiencies related to the Company's 'tone at the top,' \" which deficiencies \"also existed at the end of 2015\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43, 105-06).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As these and other revelations of improprieties came to light, LendingClub's share price went into precipitous decline. Three securities actions were filed in federal court in San Francisco in June 2016. They were related to the undersigned judge, and later consolidated with WPERP appointed as lead plaintiff, and Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd LLP as lead counsel (Dkt. Nos. 71, 90, 113). The consolidated complaint asserts claims under Section 11 and Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Lead plaintiff now moves for certification of a class consisting of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   All persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of LendingClub Corporation (\"LendingClub\" or the \"Company\") during the period from December 11, 2014 through May 6, 2016, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), and were damaged thereby, including those who purchased LendingClub common stock traceable to the Registration Statement (collectively, the \"Class\"). Excluded from the Class are defendants and their families, the officers, directors, and affiliates of defendants, at all relevant times, members of their immediate families and their legal representatives, heirs, successors or assigns, and any entity in which defendants have or had a controlling interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant LendingClub and director defendants filed an opposition to the motion, which the remaining defendants join.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    2. THE STATE ACTION.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In February 2016, approximately three-and-a-half months before this action, a class action complaint was filed against LendingClub in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Mateo, alleging violations of Sections 11, 15, and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    In re LendingClub Corp. Shareholder Litig.\n   </em>\n   , Master File No. CIV537300 (Cal. Super. June 23, 2017). Like this action, the state action alleges LendingClub's registration statement contained misstatements and omissions concerning, inter alia, \"material weaknesses in LendingClub's internal controls,\" \"undisclosed related-party transactions,\" and the assumption of undisclosed but material credit and liquidity risks. The court in the state action certified a class in June 2017. Class Notice, however, remains unsent (Dkt. No. 227 \u00b6 8; Exh. C \u00b6 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On September 21, the date oppositions to class certification were due in the federal action, class representatives in the parallel state action moved to intervene for the limited purpose of opposing class certification of Sections 11 and 15 claims. They filed an opposition to class certification as an attachment to their motion to intervene. An order set the hearing on their motions for October 12, the same date as the hearing on this motion for class certification (Dkt. Nos. 222, 229).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   All parties to both actions appeared at the October 12 hearing. This order follows full briefing and oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This order first addresses state plaintiffs' motion for intervention. It then turns to WPERP's motion for class certification, and finally addresses WPERP's motion to enjoin the state action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    1. INTERVENTION.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   State plaintiffs move for permissive intervention, and in the alternative for intervention as of right. For the reasons herein, permissive intervention is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   subject to certain conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For permissive intervention, the applicant need only show that (1) independent grounds for jurisdiction exist; (2) the motion is timely; and (3) the applicant's claim or defense shares a common question of law or fact with the main action. FRCP 24(b) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Benny\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10549543\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/791/712/#p721\">\n    791 F.2d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 721-22 (9th Cir. 1986). Further, in exercising its discretion, the court should consider \"whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties' rights.\" FRCP 24(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   WPERP opposes the motion to intervene only on the grounds of timeliness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Timeliness.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   WPERP argues that state plaintiffs' motion is prejudicial because, by waiting to move until only three weeks before the hearing on class certification, they have denied WPERP any opportunity to take discovery that would aid WPERP in showing that it is better suited to protect the putative class (Dkt. No. 235 at 8). State plaintiffs' delay in bringing this motion, WPERP argues, was tactical. It forced WPERP either to respond without sufficient information, or to seek a continuance, which would have given state plaintiffs an opportunity to advance their case, including by distributing their class notice, which was approved on September 22 (but has not yet been sent). That notice, WPERP observes, would not inform class members of the existence of the federal suit (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Allowing the state plaintiffs to proceed and distribute notice, WPERP contends, will prejudice absent class members for a variety of reasons, chief among them that the state action's Sections 11 and 15 claims are capped at a much lower recovery amount than the federal action-a claim that state plaintiffs dispute (\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Though cognizant of the limited time WPERP had to respond to state plaintiffs' motion, this order finds that intervention is appropriate because absent class members will be best served by allowing state plaintiffs, who also purport to act in the putative class's best interest, to set forth their argument for why they are the better representative. WPERP had two weeks to prepare a response to state plaintiffs' opposition\n   to class certification, which was adequate under these circumstances. Therefore, state plaintiffs' motion is timely for the limited purpose for which they seek to intervene.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   State plaintiffs' motion to intervene is therefore\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   on the condition that they remain under this Court's jurisdiction so that the undersigned judge may coordinate their action with the federal action to avoid any prejudice to absent class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To a limited degree, such coordination is already underway. At the hearing on this motion, state plaintiffs agreed they will participate in the settlement conference before Chief Magistrate Judge Joseph Spero on November 28, and have further assured the undersigned judge that they will not send class notification until this order issued. Moreover, state plaintiffs agreed that they will not discuss settlement (except at the settlement conference) until the Supreme Court issues a decision in\n   <em>\n    Cyan, Inc. v. Beaver Cty.

Before addressing those conditions, however, this order first turns to WPERP's motion for class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. CLASS CERTIFICATION.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The party seeking class certification bears the burden of first showing that it meets the four prerequisites of FRCP 23(a) : (1) numerosity; (2) common questions of law or fact; (3) typicality; and, (4) adequacy. FRCP 23(b) sets forth three conditions under which, if the prerequisites of FRCP 23(a) are satisfied, a class action may be maintained. Class certification is appropriate if a plaintiff meets all the prerequisites of FRCP 23(a) and at least one condition of FRCP 23(b).\n   <em>\n    Abdullah v. U.S. Sec. Assocs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049337\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/731/952/#p956\">\n    731 F.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 956-57 (9th Cir. 2013). Under FRCP 23(b)(3), the district court must find \"that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,\" and \"that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\" The Supreme Court has \"cautioned that a court's class-certification analysis must be rigorous and may entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff's underlying claim,\"\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

FRCP 23(a).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (1) Numerosity.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants do not challenge certification based on the numerosity element. Here, plaintiff estimates that there are thousands of members in the proposed class based on the over 394 million outstanding shares of LendingClub common stock. This is sufficient to satisfy the numerosity requirement of FRCP 23(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (2) Commonality.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants likewise do not challenge certification under FRCP 23(a)'s\n   commonality requirement. To show commonality, a plaintiff \"need not show...that every question in the case, or even a preponderance of questions, is capable of class wide resolution. So long as there is even a single common question, a would-be class can satisfy the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2).\"\n   <em>\n    Parsons v.

Here, WPERP's allegations that investors were defrauded by the same misleading registration statement over the same period of time, and suffered similar losses as a result are sufficient to fulfill FRCP 23(a)'s commonality requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (3) Typicality.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Typicality is satisfied if \"the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.\" FRCP 23(a)(3). \"The test of typicality is whether other members have the same or similar injury, whether the action is based on conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiff[ ], and whether other class members have been injured by the same course of conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Wolin v.

Class certification is inappropriate, however, if a putative class representative is subject to \"unique defenses which threaten to become the focus of the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Hanon v.

Specifically, defendants argue that WPERP cannot show that its shares are traceable to IPO purchases, a necessary element of a Section 11 claim. Defendants further argue that WPERP's Sections 10(b) and 11 claims are both subject to negative loss causation defenses that threaten to predominate over common questions and render their claims atypical. Each argument is addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (a) Traceability.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   To prove a violation of Section 11, a plaintiff must show the securities it purchased were issued under a materially false or misleading registration statement.\n   <em>\n    In re Century Aluminum Co.

If a company issues multiple rounds of stock under different registration statements, this requires proof that the plaintiff's shares are traceable to the misleading statement and not to an innocent one. Otherwise, the plaintiff has not been damaged, and has no standing to sue.\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .\"The burden of tracing shares to a particular public offering rests with plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Wells Fargo Mortg.-Backed Certificates Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4021915\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/712/958/#p963\">\n    712 F.Supp.2d 958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 963 (N.D. Cal. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Here, LendingClub issued approximately 295 million shares via private offering to insiders prior to its IPO. These were not traded during the lock-up period. WPERP did not acquire any of these shares, nor were they connected with the allegedly misleading registration statement (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 231-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   LendingClub then issued 67 million shares in the IPO under an allegedly false registration statement, which issuance was followed by a lock-up period from December 11, 2014, to June 8, 2015, during which only IPO shares were available for purchase. WPERP purchased IPO shares beginning in May 2016, and acquired over 300,000 shares prior to the last day of the lock-up period (Dkt. No. 223 at 3). On June 9, 2015, private shares entered the open\n   market, and were commingled therein with IPO shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Therefore, only shares that were purchased in the IPO or on the open market before June 9, 2015, are traceable to the allegedly misleading disclosure statement (absent an individualized showing that post-lock-up purchases were individually traceable to the IPO). This is so because \"[i]f there is a mixture of pre-registration stock and stock sold under the misleading registration statement, a plaintiff must either show that he purchased his stock in the initial offering or trace his later-purchased stock back to the initial offering.\"\n   <em>\n    Hertzberg v.

At the end of the lock-up period it owned 306,620 shares, and its holdings never dropped below this number (Dkt. No. 231-1). It is likewise undisputed, however, that WPERP traded in the post-lock-up market. In fact, it purchased and sold hundreds of thousand more shares during the post-lock-up period than it had purchased in the lock-up period (\n   <em>\n    ibid\n   </em>\n   .).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As a result of the post-lock-up commingling, defendants argue that WPERP cannot trace its current shares to the allegedly misleading registration statement and, therefore, lacks standing. They observe that our court of appeals has strictly construed the tracing requirement. In\n   <em>\n    In re Century Aluminum Co. Sec.

Sept. 30, 1993) (Judge David Williams) held that though the plaintiff purchased stock in a market containing 97 percent shares issued under the misleading statement, this was not enough to show traceability because its shares could have come from the innocent three percent. Traceability, it held, is not a matter of probability, but rather is construed literally and requires a showing that the shares purchased were actually the offending shares.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   These decisions, though they illustrate the strict application of Section 11's traceability requirement, are inapposite here. It is uncontested that WPERP purchased shares issued under the allegedly misleading registration statement before they were commingled with any other shares. Nobody argues otherwise and, therefore, probability does not enter into the analysis. The only question is whether WPERP\n   <em>\n    retained\n   </em>\n   the shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This, in turn, presents the question of which accounting treatment those shares should be given. WPERP correctly observes that if its transactions are afforded \"last-in, first-out\" (\"LIFO\") treatment, all of its holdings as of June 8, 2015 would remain traceable to the lock-up period (Reply at 2). If, on the other hand, the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method is used, WPERP will be deemed to have owned no traceable shares by the corrective disclosure date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Whether LIFO or FIFO applies is a matter of first impression in the Section 11 traceability context. In the somewhat different context of calculating estimated\n   losses under the PSLRA, however, the majority of courts in our district have preferred the LIFO method.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bodri v.

A lead plaintiff who suffered the greatest losses under a Section 10(b) claim might also be deemed to lack standing under a Section 11 claim based on such an incongruity. Accordingly, this order finds that the LIFO method, preferred for determining estimated loss, is likewise best suited to determine the number of IPO shares retained. Using this method, WPERP has demonstrated that it retained over 300,000 shares from the end of the IPO-period until the date it filed suit and, therefore, will not be subject to defendants' unique standing defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (b) Negative Loss Causation.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendants further argue that WPERP's claims are susceptible to a showing of \"negative loss causation,\" which is an affirmative defense to both Section 11 and 10(b) claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v.

As an initial matter, it is undisputed that WPERP retained 1.7 million shares through the end of the class period (Dkt. No. 223 at 16). Those shares are unaffected by defendants' anticipated negative loss causation defense. Moreover, WPERP is not in any way uniquely vulnerable to a negative loss causation defense. Negative loss causation will apply to any class member who sold shares prior to the corrective disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, plaintiff correctly observes that our court of appeals has recognized a \"leakage\" damages model, under which a plaintiff may recover for interim manifestations of later-disclosed fraud that begin to \"leak out\" prior to the corrective disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Daou Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8956253\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/411/1006/#p1026\">\n    411 F.3d 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1026 (9th Cir. 2005). Leakage may very well prove to be a viable damage model in this action-a determination that will be informed by discovery. If so, applicable leakage damages may overcome defendants' negative loss causation theory. This is a class question that is not unique to\n   WPERP, and will benefit from WPERP's development as this action proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (4) Adequacy.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   To determine whether a plaintiff will adequately serve the class, courts consider two questions: \"(1) do the named plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts of interest with other class members [,] and (2) will the named plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the class?\"\n   <em>\n    Hanlon v.

Instead, they argue that WPERP has shown that it will not vigorously prosecute this action because it allegedly lacks basic knowledge about LendingClub stock and the underlying litigation (Br. at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In support of their argument, defendants highlight portions of the deposition of WPERP chief investment officer, Jeremy Wolfson. In particular, they note that Wolfson was not aware that WPERP had purchased LendingClub securities \"until this case\" and has not reviewed any of LendingClub's SEC filings (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13; Dkt. No. 227-5 at 103:23-104:01, 96:17-24). Moreover, Wolfson was unaware that LendingClub remained one of the top ten holdings in WPERP's portfolio (making up 2.2 percent of its investments) as of July 2017 (Dkt. Nos. 227-5 at 122:12-123:14; 227-1). Additionally, defendants observe that Wolfson could not say exactly what alleged misstatements LendingClub had made in its registration statement without looking at the complaint (Dkt. No. 227-5 at 154:15-18), and could not name each defendant in this action from memory (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 144:1-10). Based on the foregoing, they contend that this is an attorney-driven suit, and that WPERP cannot adequately represent unnamed plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   These arguments overstate the burdens placed upon lead plaintiffs.

The Rule does not require more.\"). FRCP 23(a)(4) imposes only a modest burden, and one that WPERP has carried here. WPERP has vigorously prosecuted this action to date, and the fact that its chief investment officer had not personally consulted SEC filings or memorized portions of the complaint does not undercut this. Wolfson otherwise demonstrated a basic understanding of the theory of the lawsuit, different defendants' roles in the underlying schemes alleged, and WPERP's past and continuing investment in LendingClub (Dkt.

Fund\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12606745,12606746,12606747,12606748,12606749\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2325/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 2325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12606752,12606753,12606757,12606758,12606748\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/198/754/\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). The issue certified is whether state courts lack subject-matter jurisdiction to hear securities class actions alleging only claims under the Securities Act of 1933. If the Supreme Court finds that state courts lack jurisdiction over such actions, its decision will effectively end the state case, which raises only 1933 Act claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , WPERP observes that it has litigated more vigorously than the state representatives. Though defendants asserted similar affirmative defenses in both actions, the state plaintiffs raised no objections to those defenses while WPERP, after bringing a motion to strike, convinced defendants to drop 115 of their 154 affirmative defenses (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Forge Decl., Exhs. 8-12; Dkt. Nos. 193, 206). Additionally, defendants raised similar reliance-on-counsel defenses, while also asserting privilege in both actions. State plaintiffs did not object, whereas WPERP sought and obtained an order requiring defendants to either abandon their reliance-on-counsel defenses or produce the ostensibly privileged documents (Dkt. Nos. 217-218).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   State plaintiffs, who intervened in this action for the sole purpose of objecting to certification, make additional arguments for why the state action is superior to this action for adjudicating Section 11 and 15 claims. Their primary argument is that the state case provides for greater recovery than this action and is, therefore, superior. For the reasons below, their argument falls short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (a) Extent of Available Recovery.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The state plaintiffs contend that because WPERP no longer alleges Securities Act theories of liability based on the loan-approval process (which claims were dismissed (Dkt. No. 181 at 16-17)), it will be unable to seek as broad a recovery as the state plaintiffs, whose loan approval process claims survived the pleading stage (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 221-1 \u00b6\u00b6 68-75, 81-89). It further points out that the state action maintains Section 11 and 15 claims based upon LendingClub's alleged failure to adequately disclose the extent to which its loans violated state usury laws, which claims are likewise absent from the federal action (Dkt. No. 222-1 at 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   State plaintiffs contend that these additional Section 11 theories increase their potential recovery by at least $200 million (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9; Dkt. No. 221-2 \u00b6 17). This is so, they argue, because Section 11(e) provides that if a defendant can show that any portion of a plaintiff's claimed damages arise from something other than their claimed theory of liability, \"such portion of or all such damages shall not be recoverable.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(e). Therefore, to the extent LendingClub can show that damages are a result of theories not included in the federal action, WPERP will not be able to recover those damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Specifically, state plaintiffs argue that they will be able to recover damages on days where LendingClub stock price dropped and the only negative news was related to the deficient loan-approval process, whereas WPERP will not (Dkt. 222-1 at 9-10). State plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Scott Hakala, identified nine dates during which he claims price declines related to theories at issue only in the state action (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10; Dkt. 221-2 \u00b6 13). Dr. Hakala opines that it is, therefore, likely that defendants will be able to successfully assert a negative loss causation defense against WPERP for any price drops that occurred during these nine days, reducing WPERP's damages accordingly (Dkt. 221-2 \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   WPERP strenuously disputes Dr. Hakala's methodology. It observes that losses that Dr. Hakala attributes to state theories only-for example, LendingClub's \"8-K updating loss projections and interest rates for standard loan program\"-could as easily be related, in whole or in part, to material weaknesses in internal controls or concealed assumptions of credit risk (which would be recoverable in the federal action). Dr. Hakala, they observe, does not explain in his declaration\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   these damages could not be attributed to federal claim theories, or even appear to consider possible alternative causes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Moreover, our plaintiff correctly notes that the burden to prove the effect these events allegedly had on LendingClub stock prices rests with\n   <em>\n    defendants. See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. 77k(e). In order for Dr. Hakala's numbers to bear out, defendants will have to prove that all of the losses Dr. Hakala allocated to problems with LendingClub's loan origination process were, in fact, caused by news related to issues with loan origination and not any of the other myriad of possible causes. This is a tall order. WPERP will no doubt submit its own expert report tying these losses to different events.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Furthermore, even accepting Dr. Hakala's calculations, WPERP argues that it is nevertheless in a position to reap a greater recovery. This is so, it argues, because under Section 11, damages are limited to \"the difference between the amount paid for the security... and [ ] the value thereof\n   <em>\n    as of the time such suit was brought\n   </em>\n   ....\" 15 U.S.C. 77k(e) (emphasis added). The state plaintiffs' Section 11 suit was filed on February 26, 2016, when the closing price of LendingClub's stock was $8.41 per share. The day the federal suit was filed, May 16, 2016, LendingClub's stock closed at $3.94 per share. Therefore, WPERP contends, the state plaintiffs are foreclosed from pursuing $4.47 per share, which damages are available to the federal plaintiff. Using the state plaintiffs' experts' own calculations (accounting for price drops he claims are recoverable in the state court, but not here), the state plaintiffs would still recover $.39 less per share than WPERP, which amounts to approximately $26.6 million greater recovery for WPERP (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 221-2 at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   While all parties agree that damages are capped by the date upon which suit is filed, state plaintiffs contend that the cap is not based upon the market price at that date, but instead by the true value of the stock, which should take into account any theretofore undisclosed misrepresentations. They ground this argument in the plain language of Section 11, which provides that damages shall be limited to \"the difference\n   between the amount paid for the security...and [ ] the\n   <em>\n    value thereof\n   </em>\n   as of the time such suit was brought,\" 15 U.S.C. 77K(e)(1), and a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit holding that under Section 11 value\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be distinct from price,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McMahan &amp; Co. v. Wherehouse Entm't, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413940\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/65/1044/#p1048\">\n    65 F.3d 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1048 (2d Cir. 1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Unquestionably, the typical value used to measure Section 11 damages is the stock's price on the day a plaintiff files suit, and in an open market value is ordinarily synonymous with price. Whether a stock's \"value\" on the date suit is filed can be distinct from its price for the purpose of calculating Section 11 damages is a question unresolved by our court of appeals. Whether, even if value and price can diverge for the purpose of Section 11 damages, such divergence is appropriate in the state plaintiffs' action is yet another unresolved question. In any event, this presents a difficult issue (not decided here) that could seriously hamper state plaintiffs, limiting their damages to a number well below that of our plaintiff, who is no doubt entitled to a damage calculation based upon LendingClub's stock price the day WPERP filed suit. The threat that they will be limited in ways our plaintiff will not-in combination with other advantages our plaintiff has, noted above-is enough to show that our plaintiff satisfies the superiority requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Accordingly, the federal class action remains the superior forum with respect to maximizing recoverable damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (b) Juror Confusion Outweighed By Efficient Disposition of Claims.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The state plaintiffs further contend that the Section 11 claims should be separated from the Section 10(b) claims to avoid juror confusion due to the different scienter and causation standards applied to these claims (Dkt. No. 222-1 at 15). It argues that it may be difficult for jurors to separate the requirements of these different claims, though state plaintiffs cite no case law for this proposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Contrary to state plaintiffs' contention, jurors are regularly called upon to resolve difficult questions involving different mental state and causation requirements. Indeed, because of the similar conduct underlying Securities Act and Exchange Act claims, jurors are often presented with this very situation of differentiating between the requirements of Section 10(b) and Section 11. \"While there are some legal differences between the Securities Act and Exchange Act claims-such as whether defendants acted with scienter-the similarities are far greater because the claims in all cases revolve around whether [the defendant] materially misrepresented its financial condition.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Century Aluminum Co.

Cal. Sept. 8, 2009) (Judge Susan Illston).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   State plaintiffs' suggestion that it would be more efficient and effective to sever the Section 11 claims from this action does not hold water. WPERP has shown that moving forward with its Section 11 claims as lead plaintiff in the federal forum is the superior means for resolving this dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    C. CLASS DEFINITION\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Defendants next argue that even if this order certifies a class, it should place certain limitations on the class definition. Defendants first contend that any Section 11 Class must end on June 8, 2015, since subsequent purchases cannot be traced to the IPO. While it is possible to trace later-purchased stock to the IPO through individualized proof, the practical value of this limitation is persuasive. It will head off the problem of trying to adjudicate individual claims of traceability, which may prove resource intensive and time consuming, while leaving intact any claims that individuals who did not purchase before June 9, but can nevertheless trace to the IPO may have. If, on the other hand, the class definition includes shareholders who purchased after June 8, 2015, those who do not come forward, because they did not realize they could trace back to the IPO, would have their claims extinguished. In light of these risks, the class definition is hereby amended to include only persons and entities who purchased LendingClub common stock before June 9, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Defendants next argue that any investors who sold their securities before the May 2016 corrective disclosure should be excluded from the class because, under\n   <em>\n    Dura\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5891157\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/336/#p345\">\n    544 U.S. at 342-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5891157\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/336/#p345\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , they cannot demonstrate a loss caused by the alleged misrepresentation. As discussed above, such an exclusion is premature as WPERP may prove that some of the truth \"leaked out\" prior to the corrective disclosures and caused injury at an earlier date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Daou Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8956253\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/411/1006/#p1026\">\n    411 F.3d at 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, this order declines to impose this limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Defendants also argue that the class should exclude any \"short sellers\" (Opp. at 21). Defendants do not define short sellers and their usage is ambiguous. This order declines to exclude from the class every investor who ever took a short position on LendingClub stock. Moreover, since the proposed class definition limits the class to individuals who were damaged by their acquisition of LendingClub stock, it automatically excludes any short sale profits based on price declines. It is, however, possible that a short sale could have resulted in a loss (for the short seller) during the class period if, for instance, the short sale occurred during a period in which their was a short-term price increase. Given the practical difficulties of tracing the short seller's loss to any alleged fraud, excluding short sellers who incurred losses from short sales during the class period is a sensible limitation that is hereby incorporated into the class definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Finally, WPERP and the underwriter defendants seek to include the following additional language not previously in the proposed class definition (bolded language):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   All persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of LendingClub Corporation (\"LendingClub\" or the \"Company\") during the period from December 11, 2014 through May 6, 2016, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), and were damaged thereby, including those who purchased LendingClub common stock traceable to the Registration Statement (collectively, the \"Class\"). Excluded from the Class are defendants and their families, the officers, directors, and affiliates of defendants, at all relevant times, members of their immediate families and their legal representatives, heirs, successors or assigns, and any entity in which defendants\n   have or had a controlling interest.\n   <strong>\n    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Class shall include any investment company or pooled investment fund, including, but not limited to, mutual fund families, exchange traded funds, fund of funds and hedge funds, in which the Underwriter Defendants, or any of them, have, has or may have a direct or indirect interest, or as to which any Underwriter Defendant's affiliates may act as an investment advisor, but as to which any Underwriter Defendant alone or together with any of its respective affiliates is neither a majority owner nor the holder of a majority beneficial interest.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The other defendants do not object to this modification. This order accepts this modification. Accordingly, the class definition is modified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   All persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of LendingClub Corporation (\"LendingClub\" or the \"Company\") during the period from December 11, 2014 through\n   <strong>\n    June 8\n   </strong>\n   , 2016, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), and were damaged thereby,\n   <s>\n    including those who purchased LendingClub common stock traceable to the Registration Statement\n   </s>\n   (collectively, the \"Class\"). Excluded from the Class are\n   <strong>\n    short sellers who incurred losses during the class period as a result of their short sales,\n   </strong>\n   defendants and their families, the officers, directors, and affiliates of defendants, at all relevant times, members of their immediate families and their legal representatives, heirs, successors or assigns, and any entity in which defendants have or had a controlling interest.\n   <strong>\n    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Class shall include any investment company or pooled investment fund, including, but not limited to, mutual fund families, exchange traded funds, fund of funds and hedge funds, in which the Underwriter Defendants, or any of them, have, has or may have a direct or indirect interest, or as to which any Underwriter Defendant's affiliates may act as an investment advisor, but as to which any Underwriter Defendant alone or together with any of its respective affiliates is neither a majority owner nor the holder of a majority beneficial interest\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    3. INJUNCTION?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   On October 10, an order granted the parties in this action an opportunity to respond to each of state plaintiffs' motions to intervene and oppose class certification (Dkt. No. 229). WPERP responded on October 5 opposing intervention, and requesting an order enjoining the state action pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. 1651(a), and the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. 2283 (Dkt. No. 235 at 17-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   It argues that such an order is permitted\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   because the PSLRA expressly provides district courts the authority to enjoin state actions, and\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   because allowing the state case to proceed will interfere with this Court's jurisdiction. WPERP requests that even if the Court is not inclined to enjoin the state action, \"At a minimum...it should enjoin the imminent dissemination of the class notice in the State Case, as it is an unnecessary expense for the class to bear\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the notice conceals from class members the existence of this litigation and the February 26, 2016 damages cutoff in the State Case\" (\n   <em>\n    ibid\n   </em>\n   .).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Each argument is addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The Anti-Injunction Act, in turn, limits the power of federal courts in order to preserve comity, providing just three circumstances under which a federal court may use its delegated powers to enjoin a state court proceeding: (1) where a federal statute expressly provides the court the power to enjoin a state proceeding; (2) where an injunction is necessary in aid of the federal court's jurisdiction; or, (3) where an injunction is necessary to protect or effectuate the federal court's judgments. 28 U.S.C. 2283 ;\n   <em>\n    Atl.

No Injunction Pursuant To The \"Express Authority\" Exception.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   WPERP argues that the PSLRA confers \"express authority\" upon district courts to enjoin state actions by making it incumbent upon them to appoint a lead plaintiff who is \"most capable of adequately representing the interest of class members.\" 15 U.S.C. 78u-4(a)(3)(B). It contends that if district courts could not enjoin state court proceedings to carry out the mandate of the PSLRA, then the PSLRA could not be given its intended meaning or scope (Dkt. No. 235 at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Only one court, however, has found an express right to enjoin a state court proceeding based upon the PSLRA. In\n   <em>\n    BankAmerica Corp. Sec.

Mo. 2000), the court stayed a state securities suit due to the woefully inadequate representation in the state action, which it found threatened the rights of the federal litigants. There, the state court had not yet certified a class, state plaintiffs had taken almost no discovery and held substantially less stock than the federal plaintiffs (1/26th the number of shares), and yet the state plaintiffs were engaged in negotiations to settle all class claims on behalf of all class members, including members of the already certified federal class. The court further observed that the state plaintiffs' attorneys had engage in \"precisely the sort of lawyer-driven machinations the PSLRA was designed to prevent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11522029\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/95/1044/#p1049\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11522029\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/95/1044/#p1049\">\n    at 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They had filed numerous inadequate motions for class certification, overlooked potential conflicts of interest among classes, and attempted to restructure the classes, \"not in the best interest of the class members, but to avoid federal courts at all costs.\" When this restructuring proved difficult, the attorneys pushed for settlement despite the early stage of the proceedings and the fact that almost no substantive discovery had been completed. The court held that \"under the facts of [that] case...an injunction [was] necessary to preserve the federal plaintiffs' rights under the PSLRA.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   We have a vastly different scenario before us.

Moreover, at the present no party has raised the specter of a settlement, certainly not a settlement that threatens to dispose of all claims on behalf of all class members.

No such circumstances are present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Nevertheless, concerns remain regarding the current form of state plaintiffs' class notice, which fails to notify class members of the parallel federal action, the pendency of\n   <em>\n    Cyan\n   </em>\n   and its potential effect on their case, or the potential that the filing date of their suit could substantially limit damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   In order to address those concerns and others that may arise from these parallel proceedings, the undersigned conditionally granted state plaintiffs' motion to intervene, with the condition being that state plaintiffs remain subject to this Court's jurisdiction for the purpose of coordinating its Section 11 class with WPERP so as to assure that absent class members are protected. To that end, state plaintiffs shall reform (and federal plaintiffs shall prepare) their class notices to inform class members of the parallel actions, the important differences between those actions, and their right to opt out of either, both, or neither action (which, in the latter event, will bind them to whichever action should reach judgment first). Specifically, the notices must inform class members of\n   the following: (1) There are two lawsuits proceeding in parallel, one in state and one in federal court, which overlap in certain respects and not in others; (2) Some important differences between these suits include: (a) the state action maintains certain theories of liability under which the class may be granted relief including as a result of LendingClub's allegedly usurious loan rates, and alleged problems with LendingClub's loan application procedures. The federal action does not contain these theories of liability and, therefore, risks a lower recovery depending upon whether defendants can successfully show that damages should be attributed to the state theories; (b) class members in the federal action are potentially entitled to a greater recovery based upon the date federal lead plaintiff filed its action. Whether the state class members are entitled to this recovery remains uncertain; and, (c) the state action may be subject to dismissal depending upon the outcome of\n   <em>\n    Cyan, Inc. v.

Defendants do not challenge the presumption of reliance under the fraud-on-the-market theory (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Opp. at 14). Defendants, do, however, contend that WPERP cannot prove reliance under\n    <em>\n     Affiliated Ute\n    </em>\n    because this is a mixed case, not a case of pure omission. This argument is waged in the sections of the parties' briefs otherwise devoted to FRCP 23(b) commonality. It is not, however, an issue of commonality, and is instead an argument about the merits of different causation models. The parties' dispute about causation models does not resolve any issues regarding class certification and is, therefore, not considered here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    WPERP also points to five decisions in the last twelve years in other districts rejecting Dr. Hakala's loss causation opinions under\n    <em>\n     Daubert\n    </em>\n    (Dkt. No. 235 at 11-12). It argues that these are evidence that Dr. Hakala's opinions are generally unreliable, and so should be disregarded. These other cases, however, are not evidence that Dr. Hakala has rendered an unreliable opinion in\n    <em>\n     this\n    </em>\n    action, and this argument therefore carries little weight.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    WPERP argues that our court of appeals has held that under Section 11 the value of a stock is equivalent to its price and, therefore, state plaintiffs' interpretation is foreclosed by binding authority. This, however, is an inaccurate characterization. WPERP relies upon two decisions in which our court of appeals stated that damages for a Section 11 claim are measured by the \"price\" of the stock at the date suit is filed, but neither of those cases actually directly addressed the issue at stake here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Worlds of Wonder Sec.

Instead, each found that plaintiffs had failed to prove loss for reasons entirely unrelated to whether Section 11 damages were measured by stock price or some alternative value, and stated that damages can be measured by stock price on the day suit is filed only in passing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
