He argues that the AP falsely accused him of \"involvement in criminal activities and other improprieties.\" (Compl. \u00b6 4.) The AP has filed two motions to dismiss, one under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and the other under the District of Columbia Anti-Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (Anti-SLAPP) Act of 2010,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016-5502\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 16-5502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Upon consideration of the motions, opposition, and record, the Court finds that Deripaska has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and therefore grants the defendant's motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). A separate Memorandum Opinion, ECF No. 16, addresses the AP's Anti-SLAPP special motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts here are relatively straightforward. On March 22, 2017, the AP separately published an article and online video discussing the relationship between Donald Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Russia. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-7, ECF No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The article opens with the sentence, \"Before signing up with Donald Trump, former campaign manager Paul Manafort secretly worked for a Russian billionaire with a plan to 'greatly benefit the Putin Government,' The Associated Press has learned.\" (Exh. A at 1, ECF No. 6.) The article goes on to explain that \"Manafort proposed a confidential strategy plan as early as June 2005\" to Deripaska, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), who is described as an \"aluminum magnate\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   and \"a close Putin ally with whom Manafort eventually signed a $10 million annual contract beginning in 2006.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Deripaska alleges that the article contains three defamatory statements and that it defames him when read as a whole. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-7, ECF No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The three alleged defamatory \"statements\" are each comprised of between two and four non-consecutive sentences pulled from the article. The first statement includes a sequence of alleged falsehoods that Deripaska claims inculpate him in criminal activity. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-26.) Deripaska alleges that the following three sentences make up the first statement: 1) \"Manafort worked for Deripaska pursuant to a 2005 strategy plan that was to 'greatly benefit the Putin Government' \" (Opp. Mot. Dismiss at 9-10, ECF No. 10); 2) \"The federal Foreign Agents Registration Act requires that 'people who lobby in the U.S. on behalf of foreign political leaders or political parties must provide detailed reports about their actions to the department,\" and \"[w]illfully failing to register [under FARA] is a felony\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10); and 3) \"Manafort did not disclose details about the lobbying work to the Justice Department during the period the contract was in place.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Deripaska argues that by \"express[ing] certainty about the connection between the plans set forth in the 2005 Manafort Memo and funds paid by Mr. Deripaska to Mr. Manafort\" (Compl. \u00b6 17), alongside the assertion that the memo proposed a \"model [to] greatly benefit the Putin Government,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16), the AP made \"a false and defamatory statement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Specifically, Deripaska alleges that the AP \"assert[ed] in substance that Mr. Deripaska paid Mr. Manafort to act as an unregistered foreign agent,\" and thus made \"him appear to have been engaged in criminal conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As for the second allegedly defamatory statement, Deripaska turns to a quote from United States Senator Lindsey Graham and a statement summarizing the view of the House Intelligence Committee Democrats. He alleges that the following two sentences makes up the second statement: 1) \"Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic, said of Manafort: 'Clearly if he's getting millions of dollars from a billionaire close to Putin, to basically undermine democratic movements, that's something I'd want to know about\" (Opp. at 10); and 2) \"Democrats on the House intelligence committee said the new revelations will feature in their investigations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Deripaska claims the second statement \"strongly and falsely conveys that Mr. Deripaska's contracts with Mr. Manafort had criminal implications and merit a congressional investigation.\" (Compl. \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The third allegedly defamatory statement strings together several sentences discussing Manafort's involvement in events in the Ukraine in 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-50.) Deripaska alleges that the following language makes up the third defamatory statement: 1) \"Deripaska became one of Russia's wealthiest men under Putin, buying assets abroad in ways widely perceived to benefit the Kremlin's interests\" (Opp. at 10); 2) \"Manafort worked as Trump's unpaid campaign chairman last year from March until August, a period that included the Republican National Convention that nominated Trump in July\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); and 3) \"The newly obtained business records link Manafort more directly to Putin's interests in the region. According to those records and people with direct knowledge of Manafort's work for Deripaska, Manafort made plans to open an office in Moscow, and at least some of his work in Ukraine was directed by Deripaska, not local political interests there,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); and 4) \"[F]ederal criminal prosecutors became interested in\n   Manafort's activities years ago as part of a broad investigation to recover stolen Ukraine assets after the ouster of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych there in early 2014.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Deripaska argues that their \"juxtaposition ... reasonably conveys that Mr. Deripaska stole Ukrainian assets in 2014, and that he is implicated in federal prosecutors' investigation of that theft ... [and] that the alleged theft of assets from Ukraine is somehow tied to the Trump Campaign Controversy.\" (Compl. \u00b6 44.) As a result, Deripaska alleges that \"[r]eaders of the Article and of its numerous republications by news outlets around the world have been left with the impression that Mr. Deripaska's private, commercial dealings were-and still may be-deeply intertwined with the Trump Campaign Controversy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The AP has moved to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), arguing that the first statement is not capable of defamatory meaning and is not \"of-and-concerning\" Deripaska, the second statement is nonactionable because it is both an opinion and privileged, and the third statement does not reasonably convey the defamatory implication alleged. (Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 6.) The AP also argues in the alternative that Deripaska is a limited-purpose public figure and has failed to allege publication with actual malice.

The Court notes that Deripaska does not dispute any material facts presented in the AP's discussion of the factual background as it relates to Deripaska's biography and his role in advancing Russian interests internationally.

Given this concession and the many articles cited that reference Deripaska on this topic (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mot. at 2-8, &amp; n.2-33), there can be no doubt a public controversy exists relating to Russian oligarchs acting on behalf of the Russian government.

And, the article's allegedly defamatory statements relate to these very issues for they describe Deripaska as a Russian oligarch who allegedly contracted with an American to promote Russian interests. This is precisely the area in which Deripaska can be fairly described as a limited-purpose public figure who has pursued a central place in a public controversy, particularly given that Deripaska has been the subject of more than a decade of media coverage on topics related to his wealth and his relationship with the Russian government.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As such, Deripaska is required to plausibly allege that the AP \"published the defamatory falsehood with 'actual malice,' that is, with 'knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.' \"\n   <em>\n    Liberty Lobby,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332522,1310477\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/1287/\">\n    838 F.2d at 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    N.Y.

The AP responds that the article asks \"whether\n   <em>\n    Manafort\n   </em>\n   should have registered as a foreign agent but does not reach any conclusion beyond this point\" (Reply at 5), making it impossible to find an implication that Deripaska is criminally liable under the Foreign Agent Registration Act.

Moreover, to the extent that Deripaska argues that associating him with the Russian government is defamatory (Opp. at 25), the AP correctly suggests there is \"no legal support for allowing a Russian citizen with a diplomatic visa to maintain a libel claim based on a statement associating him with his home country.\" (Reply at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"Defamation is personal; a plaintiff who alleges defamation must show that the statement was published 'of and concerning' him.\"\n   <em>\n    Provisional Gov't of Republic of New Afrika v.

Under the circumstances, the answer must be no. Deripaska does not deny that a contract in some form existed. (Opp. at 6.) Moreover, it is readily available, judicially noticeable information that Deripaska openly associates himself with the Russian government.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the AP to do the same cannot be defamatory, even if it were not true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In yet another stretch regarding the first statement, possibly in an attempt to explain how having a contract to further Russian interests might be defamatory, Deripaska argues that the article \"indicates that Deripaska's business dealings implicate criminal activity related to government corruption.\" (Opp. at 24-25.) But the article makes no reference to government corruption. Rather, it describes Manafort's strategy memos as proposing that \"Deripaska and Putin would benefit from lobbying Western governments, especially the U.S., to allow oligarchs to keep possession of formerly state-owned assets in Ukraine.\" (Exh. A at 4.) Further, Manafort \"proposed building 'long term relationships' with Western journalists and a variety of measures to improve recruitment, communications and financial planning by pro-Russian parties in the region.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) None of this is defamatory to Deripaska. Defamation is not made up of hints and suggestions and it cannot be merely unpleasant or offensive.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Milkovich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212323\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/1/#p19\">\n    497 U.S. at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212323\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/1/#p19\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"loose, figurative, or hyperbolic language ... would negate the impression that the writer was seriously maintaining that petitioner committed the crime\").

STATEMENT 2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Deripaska argues that two sentences comprise the second statement: 1) \"Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic, said of Manafort: 'Clearly, if he's getting millions of dollars from a billionaire close to Putin, to basically undermine democratic movements, that's something I'd want to know about' \" (Opp. at 10); and 2) \"Democrats on the House intelligence committee said the new revelations will feature in their investigations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The AP responds that these statements are \"subjective assessments ... not capable of being proven true or false\" (Reply at 8), and even if they \"could reasonably be interpreted as making an actionable allegation of wrongdoing, AP's neutral reporting of those allegations is itself protected from liability under the First Amendment.\" (Mot. Dismiss at 22-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Determining whether an utterance is fact or opinion requires viewing the \"totality of the circumstances\" with four specific factors in mind: \"(1) the specific language used; (2) whether the statement is verifiable; (3) the general context of the statement; and (4) the broader context in which the statement appeared.\"\n   <em>\n    Milkovich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212323\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/1/#p19\">\n    497 U.S. at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212323\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/1/#p19\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ollman v.

Second, to attach meaning to the use of the present tense when a Senator is interacting with the press is unreasonable.

Read as a whole, although the article jumps backwards and forwards in time with respect especially to Deripaska, it specifically includes facts that negate the implications that Deripaska conjures up. For example, early on, the article quotes an official representative of Deripaska indicating that his contract with Manafort related to investment consulting services \"which now is a subject to legal claims.\" (Exh. A at 2.) Later the article notes that \"federal criminal prosecutors became interested in Manafort's activities years ago as part of a broad investigation to recover stolen Ukraine assets after the ouster of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych\n   there in early 2014,\" which is immediately followed by the statement that no \"U.S. criminal charges have ever been filed in the case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) The article also states that Deripaska was never mentioned \"during the hearing of the House intelligence committee,\" where Manafort was mentioned 28 times \"mostly about his work in Ukraine.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Later, in discussing the relationship with Manafort, the article explains \"people familiar with the relationship said money transfers to Manafort amounted to tens of millions of dollars and continued through at least 2009.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Toward the end, the article states that \"Manafort's work with Deripaska continued for years, though they had a falling out laid bare in 2014 in a Cayman Islands bankruptcy court.\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) While this information is spread throughout the article, all of it is there, making it impossible to find the implications that Deripaska insists are present. Accordingly, the third statement cannot convey any actionable defamatory meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    V. THE ARTICLE AS A WHOLE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The AP argues that Deripaska \"cannot state a free-floating claim for defamation unmoored to specific false, defamatory statements\" (Reply at 11), because a plaintiff must \"plead the defamatory statements with particularity.\" (Mot. Dismiss at 26 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Caudle v.

Deripaska argues that the article \"as a whole is defamatory because its essential message is that two private emissaries of Presidents Trump and Putin entered into an agreement to undermine governments of elected leaders.\" (Opp. at 2.) But Deripaska's complaint fails to identify any single statement as false that is both capable of verification and capable of defamatory meaning.

But the article makes no such statement. The only statement that comes close is the indeterminately-phrased quote from Graham, discussed above. Deripaska has cherry-picked sentences and strung them together to give the AP's article an effect it does not have when read in full.
