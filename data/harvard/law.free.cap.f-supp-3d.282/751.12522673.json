RAKOFF, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This litigation pits several putative classes of consumers against defendants L'Oreal USA, Inc. (\"L'Oreal\") and its subsidiary Soft Sheen-Carson LLC. The general details of this case are set forth in the Court's Memorandum dated July 18, 2017, granting in part and denying in part defendants' motions to dismiss, familiarity with which is here presumed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In brief, plaintiffs allege that defendants created, marketed, and distributed \"Amla Legend Rejuvenating Ritual Relaxer,\" a hair relaxer that plaintiffs claim causes unreasonable pain and damages the hair and scalp. Plaintiffs further allege that defendants did not disclose these dangers and, instead, actively misled consumers into believing that the product was gentler and safer than other relaxers. Such misrepresentations, plaintiffs allege, were inherent in four statements made on every iteration of the product's packaging, to wit, that the product was \"No-Lye,\" contained \"Amla Oil\" and a \"Scalp Protector,\" and had \"rejuvenating properties of intense\n   nourishment and conditioning.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Class Certification, Appointment of Class Representatives, and Appointment of Class Counsel (\"Pls. Mem.\") at 6, n.3, ECF No. 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff now seeks to certify four classes pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3). The proposed \"National Class\" is defined as \"All persons who bought one or more of the Products in the United States from December 1, 2012 to the present,\" and seeks a full refund for each class member on the basis of fraud and negligent misrepresentation. The proposed \"Multistate Class\" is defined as \"All persons who bought one or more of the Products in Alaska, California, Colorado, Delaware, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming from December 1, 2012 to the present,\" and seeks a full refund on the basis of a breach of express warranty. The proposed \"New York Class\" is defined as \"All persons who bought one or more of the Products in New York from August 19, 2013 to the present,\" and the proposed \"Florida Class\" is defined as \"All persons who bought one or more of the Products in Florida from December 1, 2012 to the present.\" These two latter classes both seek full refunds on the basis of unjust enrichment, and the New York Class also seeks $50 in statutory damages for each class member pursuant to New York's General Business Law \u00a7 349. Pls. Mem. at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Separately, plaintiffs also seek to certify the New York Class and Florida Class, as defined above, pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2), contending that they are entitled to injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.204\">\n    Fla.

Mem. at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In addition to all this, plaintiffs seek to certify a \"Non-Economic Injury Class\" under Rule 23(c)(4). This class is defined as \"All persons who bought one or more of the products in Illinois, Kentucky, California, Missouri and Pennsylvania from December 1, 2012 to the present.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This class seeks only a liability determination under negligence and strict product liability, leaving for subsequent, individual lawsuits the issues of proximate causation and damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.204\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20501.204\">\n    at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants oppose the motion, arguing that plaintiffs fail to satisfy various requirements of Rule 23. The Court received briefing from the parties and held oral argument on September 13, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Having fully considered the parties' submissions and arguments, the Court hereby grants plaintiffs' motion to certify the New York and Florida Classes under Rules 23(b)(2) and (3), but otherwise denies certification. The Court appoints Sandi Turnipseed, Jennifer Sanon, and Jasmin Hervey as class representatives for the New York Class, and Tiffany Raines as class representative for the Florida Class. The Court appoints Levi &amp; Korsinsky, LLP and Geragos &amp; Geragos, APC as class counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Rule 23(a) Requirements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To prevail on their motion for class certification, plaintiffs must first satisfy the four requirements of Rule 23(a): numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). The Court considers each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Rule 23(a)(1) provides that a class may be certified only if it \"is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\" In the Second Circuit, numerosity is usually presumed for classes larger than forty members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania Pub. Sch. Emp.'s Ret. Sys. v. Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314722\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/111/#p120\">\n    772 F.3d 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 120 (2d Cir. 2014). The evidence of defendants' revenue shows that there were well over forty purchasers in each proposed class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Michael Rosner (\"Rosner Decl.\") dated August 11, 2017, Ex. 19 (filed under seal). Defendants do not challenge this prong. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the classes satisfy the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Commonality is met when \"there are questions of law or fact common to the class.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2). The commonality requirement may be met where individual circumstances differ but \"injuries derive from a unitary course of conduct by a single system.\"\n   <em>\n    Marisol A. v. Giuliani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"943566\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/126/372/#p377\">\n    126 F.3d 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377 (2d Cir. 1997). Each alleged injury in this case arose from the same product whose packaging contained the same allegedly misleading representations and omissions. Each claim is premised on,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , whether the product is capable of causing undue pain and injury, and the answer will be the same for every class member. Defendants do not meaningfully challenge this prong. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the proposed classes satisfy the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Rule 23(a)(3) requires that \"the claims or defenses of the representative parties [be] typical of the claims or defenses of the class.\" The typicality requirement is met when \"each class member's claim arises from the same course of events and each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove the defendant's liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Robidoux v. Celani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515627\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/987/931/#p936\">\n    987 F.2d 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 936 (2d Cir. 1993). Defendants argue that \"[t]here is no plaintiff or class member with a typical claim here,\" pointing to evidence of widely varying experiences, from satisfaction with the product to excruciating pain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification, Appointment of Class Representatives, and Appointment of Class Counsel (\"Defs. Mem.\") at 22, ECF No. 115. These atypicalities are only, however, relevant to individual causation and damages for personal injuries; but plaintiffs here seek remedies for the economic injury of purchasing an unsafe product and the unjust enrichment earned by selling such a product, and the named plaintiffs in the proposed 23(c)(4) class reserve the question of damages for later, individual actions. Accordingly, plaintiffs have satisfied the typicality requirement of Rule 23(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The adequacy requirement is met when \"the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). \"Adequacy entails inquiry as to whether: 1) plaintiff's interests are antagonistic to the interest of other members of the class and 2) plaintiff's attorneys are qualified, experienced and able to conduct the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Flag Telecom Holdings, Ltd. Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675902\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/574/29/#p35\">\n    574 F.3d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 35 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants argue that plaintiffs who seek only a refund or $50 in statutory damages cannot adequately represent class members who suffered more serious damages. But those with graver injuries will have the opportunity to opt out. Moreover, personal injury claims that cannot be litigated in this class action will not be barred in later proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18 Wright &amp; Miller, et al. Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. \u00a7 4413 (3d ed.) (\"A judgment that expressly leaves open the opportunity to bring a\n   second action on specified parts of the claim or cause of action that was advanced in the first action should be effective to forestall preclusion.\");\n   <em>\n    Cooper v. Fed.

As the Court determined when it granted the motion to appoint interim counsel, counsel is qualified, experienced, and should continue to ably conduct the litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 88. Defendants do not challenge counsel's adequacy. Accordingly, the Court holds that plaintiffs have satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Second Circuit imposes an implied fifth requirement of \"ascertainability\" on class actions. \"[A] class is ascertainable if it is defined using objective criteria that establish membership with definite boundaries.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Petrobras Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275849\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/250/#p257\">\n    862 F.3d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 257 (2d Cir. 2017). The proposed classes have such definite, objective boundaries: they include only those who purchased the Relaxer between certain dates and in certain places. Defendants do not challenge this prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court thus concludes that plaintiffs have satisfied all requirements of Rule 23(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. National and Multistate Classes Under Rule 23(b)(3)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To prevail on their motion for class certification, each class must also meet one of the three conditions of Rule 23(b). Plaintiffs seek to certify under Rule 23(b)(3) a class of \" [a]ll persons who bought one or more of the products in the United States from December 1, 2012 to the present\" to bring claims of fraud and negligent misrepresentation. Pls. Mem. at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Rule 23(b)(3) requires that \"the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.\" To meet the predominance requirement, plaintiff need not \"prove that each element of her claim is susceptible to classwide proof. What the rule does require is that common questions\n   <em>\n    predominate\n   </em>\n   over any questions affecting only individual class members.\"\n   <em>\n    Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Ret.

The National Class Claim of Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs seek to certify a \"Nationwide Class\" for their claims of fraud and negligent misrepresentation. The basic elements of fraudulent misrepresentation are the same across jurisdictions. The plaintiff must show (1) that the defendant made a material misrepresentation, with (2) scienter (i.e., the intent to defraud), and (3) that the plaintiff relied on the misrepresentation to her detriment (i.e., she suffered an injury proximately caused by the misrepresentation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Second Circuit has held that \"fraud claims based on uniform misrepresentations made to all members of the class,\" unlike those \"based on individualized misrepresentations,\" are \"appropriate subjects for class certification because the standardized misrepresentations may be established by generalized proof.\"\n   <em>\n    Moore v. PaineWebber, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11441914\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/1247/#p1253\">\n    306 F.3d 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1253 (2d Cir. 2002) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re U.S. Foodservice Inc.

Pls. Mem. at 6, n.3; Defs. Mem. at 10. L'Oreal did sell the product in three different cartons during the class period-the Launch Carton, the Revised Carton, and the Bilingual Carton-and the challenged statements appeared in different contexts on those various cartons. But defendants offer no reason to believe these peripheral changes were material to plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   However, the presence of uniform misrepresentations \"only satisfies half of the equation\" where reliance is also an element.\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin v. Am.

Thus, in\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit decertified a class of purchasers of \"Light\" cigarettes who made RICO claims based on the widespread and uniform misrepresentation that the cigarettes were healthier than non-Light cigarettes. The Court held that \"individualized proof is needed to overcome the possibility that a member of the purported class purchased Lights for some reason other than the belief that Lights were a healthier alternative.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3762280\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/215/#p223\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3762280\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/215/#p223\">\n    at 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   There is, however, no \"blanket rule\" in the Second Circuit that \"a fraud class action cannot be certified when individual reliance will be an issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3762280\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/215/#p223\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3762280\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/215/#p223\">\n    at 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Castano v.

Plaintiffs do not allege that the product does not actually relax hair, but only that defendants in effect misrepresented the product's safety and gentility to consumers. There are numerous reasons someone may have purchased the product apart from believing that it is gentler or safer than other relaxers. Indeed, some named plaintiffs did not know or care about the challenged representations, purchasing the product because of, among other reasons, brand loyalty, endorsements, or the price.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. Mem. at 11-12 (citing deposition testimony).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This case is therefore substantially similar to\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   , where the court noted, \"each plaintiff in this case could have elected to purchase light cigarettes for any number of reasons, including a preference for the taste and a feeling that smoking Lights was 'cool.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3762280\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/215/#p223\">\n    522 F.3d at 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Individual issues predominate for the same reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In response, plaintiffs attempt to recast their claim as involving not fraudulent misrepresentations, but rather fraudulent omissions, i.e., a failure to disclose the alleged dangerousness of the product. To this end, plaintiffs submit a declaration from their expert, alleging that the product has a fundamentally dangerous chemical\n   composition that, if revealed to the consumer, would cause every reasonable consumer to refrain from purchasing the product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rosner Decl., Ex. 1. According to plaintiffs, no reasonable, properly informed consumer would purchase such a product, and therefore classwide reliance can be shown by proving that, in the absence of such information, every purchaser inherently believed that the product was not as dangerous as plaintiffs' expert claims it to be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   However, omissions generally cannot serve as the basis for a fraud claim. In most states, there are two exceptions. The first exception is where a party takes active steps to prevent the buyer from discovering a defect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 550 (1977). Plaintiffs do not allege any affirmative act of concealment beyond the challenged assertions, on which they would have to show individual reliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The second exception is where the defendant has a special duty, such as a fiduciary duty, to disclose the omitted information to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 551 (1977).

The package warns consumers that use of the product in 20 separate circumstances risks damage to their scalp or hair, and the application process involves 7 principal steps, each with a variety of substeps. Defendant's expert outlines ways in which misapplication of the product could result in injury. Declaration of Mort Westman dated August 25, 2017 \u00b6\u00b6 5-13, ECF No. 124. Defendants also collect deposition testimony from named plaintiffs showing that none correctly applied the product. Declaration of Justin Lewis, dated August 25, 2017, Ex. 8, ECF No. 120. While it is not clear that these errors actually resulted in these plaintiffs' alleged injuries, it is clear that negligence in the application of the product is likely very common, and therefore likely to be a frequent defense in later proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Under plaintiffs' proposal, later juries will have to decide comparative negligence and proximate causation, both of which overlap with the issue of defendant's negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11365458\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/51/1293/#p1303\">\n    51 F.3d at 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A later jury would have to decide whether and to what extent the inherent danger of the product caused any individual plaintiff's injury, as opposed to the plaintiff's own negligence. To do so, the jury would have to decide how negligent it believes defendants were, and could find that they were not negligent at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1793430\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/734/#p745\">\n    84 F.3d at 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, every jury would have to hear from an expert to decide whether and to what\n   extent defendants' negligence, rather than the plaintiff's, caused that plaintiff's injury, reducing the efficiency gains from this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Furthermore, should the New York and Florida Classes (discussed below) succeed on their claims, they will have shown that the product inherently and unreasonably damages hair and scalps. Defendants will likely be precluded from arguing otherwise in other actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parklane Hosiery Co. v.

Defendants will thus be hard pressed to argue that the product is not defective or unreasonably dangerous, or that it is reasonably safe for its intended use. The marginal efficiency gains from this proposed class are therefore minimal, while the risk of a second jury deciding the same issue is high. The Court therefore denies plaintiffs' motion to certify the Non-Economic Injuries Class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Defendants cite no case law, and this Court has found none, suggesting that reliance is required for either state or that material omissions cannot form the basis of unjust enrichment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendant argues that the threshold issue of whether an alleged class member actually purchased the product during the class period will require individual determination and thus overwhelm common questions. Plaintiffs propose that individuals come forward with receipts, the serial number on their product box, or a sworn affidavit to prove their membership. Credit card records may also prove class membership. These are undeniably individual inquiries, and this concern is well taken. But the class action device is designed for cases like this, where a large number of consumers have been injured in the same way, but few or none have suffered an injury sufficiently large as to justify bringing an individual lawsuit. \"[P]redominance requires a qualitative assessment too; it is not bean counting.\"\n   <em>\n    Butler v.

The individual inquiry required to determine class membership is far outweighed by the central, common question of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendants also point to allegedly individual issues regarding damages, which they argue preclude class treatment. While plaintiffs have avoided many of the individual questions by seeking only a refund, defendants argue that plaintiffs are not entitled to a full refund because the product is not completely worthless. Indeed, several named plaintiffs admitted that they experienced some benefit from the product. Defs. Mem. at 19 (collecting deposition testimony). However, plaintiffs, relying on their expert, assert that they will still be able to show damages warranting a full refund. Therefore the defense's contention is \"properly addressed at trial or in a ruling on a summary-judgment motion. The allegation should not be resolved in deciding whether to certify a proposed class.\"\n   <em>\n    Amgen Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407588\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/455/#p469\">\n    568 U.S. at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407588\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/455/#p469\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted). Plaintiffs' full refund damages model may fail on the merits, but if it does, it will fail for the entire class at once.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Furthermore, in the context of an unjust enrichment claim, a full refund may be available even where the product does ultimately confer a benefit on some purchasers. If a product is so dangerous that no informed, reasonable person would purchase it, then even if an actual purchaser from whom the danger was concealed went ahead and purchased it and received some incidental benefit thereby, the purchaser may still be entitled to a full refund on the product she never would have purchased but for defendant's concealment, since the defendant was unjustly enriched by the very act of plaintiff's purchase. In an analogous context, several circuit courts have held that an economic, point-of-sale injury is not erased just because the purchaser was lucky enough to avoid the effects of the alleged misrepresentations or omissions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wolin v.

Defs. Mem. at 20 (citing evidence). Plaintiffs argue that this does not present a problem because the total damage\n   amount-that is, defendants' total revenue from sales of the product-is readily discoverable, as is the number of sales, so each individual plaintiff can simply receive the average price. This practical approach provides plaintiffs with a remedy and prevents defendant from paying more than they owe. In any case, even if individualized inquiry is required on this point, it will not cause individual issues to predominate over the fundamental common question of liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiffs have therefore shown that common issues predominate as to their unjust enrichment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The lead plaintiffs of the New York Class also seek statutory damages of $50 pursuant to New York's General Business Law \u00a7 349(h). \"To state a claim under \u00a7 349, a plaintiff must allege: (1) the act or practice was consumer-oriented; (2) the act or practice was misleading in a material respect; and (3) the plaintiff was injured as a result.\"\n   <em>\n    Spagnola v.
