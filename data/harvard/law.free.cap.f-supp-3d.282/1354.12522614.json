This litigation currently consists of 34 actions pending in 13 districts, as listed on Schedule A. Since the filing of the motion, the Panel has been notified of 19 related federal actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Defendant McKesson Corporation supports centralization in the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs in 27 actions on the motion and three potential tag-along actions support centralization in the Eastern District of Louisiana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs in three other actions on the motion (\n   <em>\n    Segovia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Orr\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Tidmore\n   </em>\n   ) oppose centralization and, alternatively, request centralization in the Eastern District of Louisiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The plaintiffs opposing centralization do not dispute the presence of common factual questions. Instead, they contend that informal coordination is a preferable alternative to centralization, describing the number of involved counsel as limited and noting certain procedural differences in the actions. In particular, they point out that two plaintiffs' firms represent plaintiffs in 26 of 34 actions on the motion, motions to dismiss have been decided in four actions, and some actions have begun early discovery. But defendants represent that the parties' efforts at informal coordination, which began over six months ago, have been unsuccessful. They note that there are at least eight other distinct plaintiffs' firms representing plaintiffs in this litigation, and the number of involved firms and actions has resulted in failure to reach consensus on basic discovery orders as well as a coordinated discovery plan. We find that, on this record, informal coordination is not an efficient alternative to centralization. In addition to the unsuccessful efforts to coordinate discovery informally, it is clear that the number of involved counsel, the large number of actions and districts, and the complexity of the factual issues pose significant obstacles to informal coordination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   There are now a total of 53 actions pending in 17 districts\n   raising substantially the same factual and legal issues concerning plaintiffs' alleged injuries arising from Eliquis and over a dozen involved plaintiffs' firms. Moreover, the parties unanimously agree that there is a strong likelihood of additional federal actions and also report a significant number of state court actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On the basis of the papers filed and the hearing session held, we find that these actions involve common questions of fact, and that centralization will serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and promote the just and efficient conduct of this litigation. All the actions share common factual questions arising out of allegations that plaintiffs suffered severe bleeding and related injuries as a result of taking Eliquis (apixaban), that defendants did not conduct sufficient testing of the drug, and that defendants' warnings and instructions as to the alleged risks, including the unavailability of a reversal agent to counteract bleeding, were inadequate. Issues concerning the design, testing, manufacture, regulatory approval, labeling, and marketing of Eliquis thus are common to all actions. Centralization will eliminate duplicative discovery; prevent inconsistent pretrial rulings on\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   issues and other pretrial matters; and conserve the resources of the parties, their counsel and the judiciary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We conclude that the Southern District of New York is an appropriate transferee district for this litigation. Common defendants BMS and Pfizer both have their corporate headquarters within the district, and therefore relevant documents and witnesses are likely to be located there. Sixteen actions on the motion and three potential tag-along actions are pending there. Judge Denise L. Cote, who presides over all actions in the district, is an experienced transferee judge with the willingness and ability to manage this litigation. We are confident she will steer this litigation on a prudent course.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the actions listed on Schedule A and pending outside the Southern District of New York are transferred to the Southern District of New York and, with the consent of that court, assigned to the Honorable Denise L. Cote for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    SCHEDULE A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   MDL No. 2754 -\n   <strong>\n    IN RE: ELIQUIS (APIXABAN) PRODUCTS LIABILITY LITIGATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Southern District of California\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   LITTLE, ET AL. v.
