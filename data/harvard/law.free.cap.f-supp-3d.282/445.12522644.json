On October 30, 2007, Aho signed a collective bargaining agreement on behalf of Monadnock Iron with local unions (\"Iron-CBA\"), which required it to make contributions to the Taft-Hartley trust fund administered by Plaintiffs for each hour worked by any employee for pension, health insurance, and other employee benefits. Monadnock Iron was dissolved in July 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2015, to avoid the Iron-CBA, Aho formed Monadnock Steel, located at 52 Whittemore Hill Road, New Ipswich, New Hampshire, which was previously the Registered Office Address provided for the Registered Agent of Monadnock Iron, Aho. Like Monadnock Iron, its principal purposes are steel erection and installation subcontracting. As owner or controller of Monadnock Steel, Aho submits bids to customers, negotiates bid prices, engages in other contract negotiations, hires employees, and coordinates the work and operation of Monadnock Steel. Operating under Monadnock Steel, Aho refused to pay contributions on at least three construction sites in Massachusetts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When reviewing a motion to dismiss the Court asks \"whether the well-pleaded factual allegations, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, state a claim for which relief can be granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Germanowski v.

Several factors are used to determine whether an alter ego exists including \"continuity of ownership, similarity of the two companies in relation to management, business purpose, operation, equipment, customers, supervision, and anti-union animus-i.e., whether the alleged alter ego entity was created and maintained in order to avoid labor obligations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275315\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/22/#p27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275315\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/22/#p27\">\n    at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotations omitted).

Monadnock Iron and Monadnock Steel conduct the same business operations and purposes: they both perform steel and precast erection. While there are no specific allegations to support ownership, the Plaintiffs allege Mr. Aho manages and operates Monadnock Steel, in areas like hiring and work coordination. Both companies appear to have similar geographic ties and similar customers. Finally, and of significant weight, Plaintiffs allege anti-union animus by pointing out there was a lawsuit involving failure to make contributions under ERISA by another company, Monadnock Erectors, owned by Aho, who allegedly set up Monadnock Iron as an alter ego.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When these allegations are taken together, Plaintiffs state a plausible claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIES\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss, and the motion for summary judgment is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIED\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   without prejudice (Docket No. 8).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    There is also a legal dispute as to whether the CBA's \"work preservation clause\" is binding even if there is no alter ego status.
