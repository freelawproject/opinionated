Plaintiff Raul Pestana,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , filed a Response on May 4, 2017, (\"Response,\" D.E. 17), to which Defendants filed a Reply on May 16, 2017, (\"Reply,\" D.E. 24). Upon review of the Motion, Response, Reply, and the record, the Court finds as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   From August 2012 to June 2013, Plaintiff was incarcerated at what he refers to\n   as the \"Main Jail\" in Miami-Dade County's jail system, located at 1321 N.W. 13th Street, Miami, FL. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17, 20.) Plaintiff told Corrections Health Service (\"CHS\") and the Doe Defendants that he suffered from several medical issues, including anxiety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) On August 24, 2013, the Doe Defendants evaluated Plaintiff, and CHS prescribed Plaintiff certain medications that he had not been prescribed prior to incarceration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) The prescribed medication made Plaintiff nauseous and caused him to have more anxiety attacks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Plaintiff complained to CHS and the Doe Defendants that the prescribed medication was not effective, but Defendants were unreceptive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff also filed multiple medical requests and grievances with Defendants Miami-Dade County Board of Commissioners, the Doe Defendants, and CHS in an attempt to receive proper medical treatment, including Clonazepam and/or Alprazolam for his anxiety, which were prescribed to him before his incarceration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Plaintiff alleges that these requests and grievances were never answered, and that he was never given Clonazepam and/or Alprazolam because of budget cuts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that he was permitted to furlough to the VA hospital for treatment on his eye and would return on his own accord with eye drops and an anti-inflammatory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28.) However, John and Jane Doe would confiscate the medication when he returned, and would not dispense it to him thereafter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff was also \"repeatedly forced to live under horrific conditions\"-for example, he was subject to extremely cold temperatures; he slept on the floor with a thin mattress, one sheet, and a wool blanket that he was allergic to; there were insects and rodents; he did not always receive proper medication; and he was denied use of the \"yard facility\" which resulted in a lack of exercise that has complicated some of his medical conditions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 28, 2016, Plaintiff filed a two-count Complaint, although it appears that both counts allege deliberate indifference to serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , against all Defendants.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. at 5 (\"While it may have been convenient to name the Director (MDCR) in his official capacity as suggested by Defendants, the Plaintiff still would have had to prove he/she was the proper Defendant.\").
