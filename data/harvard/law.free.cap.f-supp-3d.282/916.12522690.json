Symbology's request to amend the complaint is superfluous and, accordingly, denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Disposition of this Suit Under \u00a7 1406(a)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Because Symbology has not demonstrated that venue properly lies in this District or that it is entitled to discovery, this case must either be dismissed or transferred pursuant to \u00a7 1406(a). Lego Systems requests that if the Court elects to transfer, it should transfer it to the District of Connecticut. Supp. Br. at 6. Symbology requests\n   that if transfer is warranted, this case be sent to the District of Delaware-Lego Systems' state of incorporation (and a popular choice of forum among patent plaintiffs).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Resp. at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   J. Jonas Anderson,\n   <em>\n    Court Competition for Patent Cases\n   </em>\n   , 163 U. PA. L.

Whether to Transfer or Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Court must first decide whether to transfer the case. Federal law empowers the Court to \"dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.\" \u00a7 1406(a). When deciding whether to transfer or dismiss, \"district courts generally favor transfer over dismissal, unless there is evidence that a case was brought in an improper venue in bad faith or to harass defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    Cont'l Cas. Co. v. Argentine Republic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278012\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/893/747/#p754\">\n    893 F.Supp.2d 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 754 (E.D.

However, there are no grounds upon which the Court could determine that Symbology selected the Eastern District of Virginia in bad faith or to harass Lego Systems. Rather, Symbology chose this venue in good faith reliance on the Federal Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    VE Holding\n   </em>\n   and twenty-seven years of practice in accordance with that case. Therefore, in the interests of justice, the Court elects to transfer, rather than dismiss, this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Appropriate Transferee Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Having decided to transfer rather than dismiss this action, the remaining issue for the Court is where it should be transferred. Lego Systems requests a transfer to the District of Connecticut, and Symbology prefers the District of Delaware.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Resp. at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Supp. Reply at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   When a plaintiff files suit in an improper venue, the court may transfer the action \"to any district in which it could have been brought.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201406\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). To determine where a case \"could have been brought,\" the \"movant must establish that both venue and jurisdiction with respect to each defendant is proper in the transferee district.\"\n   <em>\n    Koh v.

Va. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Proper Venue in the District of Connecticut\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   This case can be transferred to the District of Connecticut only if venue exists there pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Because Lego Systems resides in Delaware for purposes of \u00a7 1400(b), venue lies in Connecticut only if Lego Systems committed acts of alleged infringement and has a regular and established place of business there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Symbology contends that the Amended Complaint alleges no acts of infringement in Connecticut.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Resp. at 20. This is plainly untrue.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am. Compl. \u00b6 39. Symbology also contends (somewhat more plausibly) that because Lego Systems denies those acts of direct infringement, venue does not lie in the District of Connecticut.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Resp. at 12-13. However, as acknowledged, a complaint's well-pled factual allegation of infringement may satisfy this requirement regardless of this type of factual dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Funnelcap, Inc. v. Orion Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787922\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/392/938/#p943\">\n    392 F.Supp. 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 943 (D. Del. 1975). Therefore, Symbology's allegations of infringement satisfy the \"acts of infringement\" requirement of \u00a7 1400(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Second, Lego Systems must have a regular and established place of business in Connecticut. The parties agree that Lego Systems has its principal place of business in the District of Connecticut, where its United States headquarters is located.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 3. The company's headquarters qualifies as a \"regular and established place of business.\" Therefore, venue is proper in the District of Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Personal Jurisdiction Exists in the District of Connecticut\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Connecticut district court must also have personal jurisdiction over Lego Systems. A corporation is subject to general personal jurisdiction where it has \"affiliations with the State [that] are so 'continuous and systematic' as to render [the corporation] essentially at home in the forum State,\" such as the corporation's place of incorporation or principal place of business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BNSF Ry.

Lego Systems is \"at home\" in Connecticut, where its United States headquarters are located. Therefore, personal jurisdiction exists in the District of Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Symbology's Request for Transfer to the District of Delaware\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Symbology counters that the District of Delaware is a better choice for transfer, arguing that after\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   , venue is certain only in the alleged infringer's state of incorporation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Resp. at 19. The District of Delaware would be a valid choice. As Lego Systems' state of incorporation, the company \"resides\" in Delaware for purposes of \u00a7 1400(b), and is subject to general personal jurisdiction in that state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1517 (holding that for purposes of \u00a7 1400(b), a corporation resides in its state of incorporation);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BNSF Ry. Co.\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1558 (holding that corporations are subject to general personal jurisdiction in their state of incorporation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Symbology exercised its prerogative as plaintiff to commence suit in this District.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    JTH Tax, Inc. v. Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5751246\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/482/731/#p736\">\n    482 F.Supp.2d 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 736 (E.D. Va. 2007) (\"The\n   <em>\n    initial\n   </em>\n   choice of forum, from among those possible under the law, is a privilege given to the plaintiff.\") (emphasis added). Allowing Symbology to interject its second-choice venue into Lego Systems' Motion to Transfer would encourage filing suit in improper venues based on tenuous connections to the forum, with the confidence that the plaintiff's second-choice forum could be obtained should a defendant secure a hard-fought transfer. This would introduce substantial inefficiency into a doctrine intended to ensure the convenient resolution of controversies, and would over-extend the preference given to the plaintiff's choice of forum. Having chosen an improper venue in the first instance, Symbology's attempt to tap its ruby slippers and make another wish is uncompelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In sum, because it is in the interests of justice for Symbology to have its day in court, and no countervailing reasons warrant\n   denying transfer, the Court transfers this case to the District of Connecticut. Although the District of Connecticut is not the only permissible venue to which this action could be transferred, it is the one requested by Lego Systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
