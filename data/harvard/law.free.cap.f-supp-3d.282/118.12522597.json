In addition, the defendants point to the burdens generated by allowing the plaintiff to amend his complaint, including that the defendants would have to file additional motions and answers, even after the parties have initiated discovery and exchanged initial disclosures. Agency Opp'n at 6-7. The Court appreciates the burden on defendants associated with investing considerable time and resources to confront essentially the same complaint in repeated rounds of briefing on motions to dismiss. Indeed, the plaintiff is not entitled to\n   <em>\n    seriatim\n   </em>\n   advisory opinions apprising him of the deficiencies in different versions of his complaint. Nonetheless, leave to amend shall be freely given \"when justice so requires,\" FED. R. CIV.

Specifically, for all the constitutional tort claims raised against the individual defendants (Counts XI-XV), as well as for the civil rights claim under \u00a7 1983 (Count XVII), the plaintiff has added no allegations of any significance but instead opts to add legal conclusions and policy arguments that are insufficient to \"cure\" the claims of any deficiency.

Count III was previously dismissed for two reasons. First, the use of Craig as a comparator failed for the same reasons discussed regarding Count V.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.A.2. Second, McCarthy was deemed an implausible comparator because of her status as EPA Administrator, FAC \u00b6 23, whereas the plaintiff held a far different position as a \"middle-manager,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1, and \"Senior Science Advisor,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   To support this reasserted claim in the SAC, the plaintiff offers little more than what was alleged in the FAC. To the extent the plaintiff relies on Craig's alleged knowledge of her subordinate Beale's time-and-attendance misconduct, such argument fails for the same reasons articulated with respect to Count V. The plaintiff also alleges that \"while McCarthy is\n   <em>\n    now\n   </em>\n   the Administrator of EPA, she was\n   <em>\n    during the relevant time period\n   </em>\n   John Beale's direct supervisor and enabled Beale to defraud the government for many years.\" SAC \u00b6 146 (emphasis in original). To the extent McCarthy was not the EPA administrator at the time of the alleged discrimination, she was nonetheless part of \"EPA upper management,\" SAC \u00b6 31, and thus McCarthy and the plaintiff's employment situations were plainly not even close to \"nearly identical,\"\n   <em>\n    Burley v.

Count IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In Count IV, the plaintiff alleges that he was treated less favorably than a prior supervisor, Oscar Hernandez, who is \"Hispanic, while Plaintiff is white.\" SAC \u00b6 155. It remains the case, however, that Hernandez is not a plausible comparator. In\n   <em>\n    Townsend I\n   </em>\n   , Hernandez was rejected as a comparator because \"Hernandez retired prior to any investigation by EPA officials into time-and-attendance fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Townsend I,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268044\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/236/280/\">\n    236 F.Supp.3d at 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff now alleges that Hernandez retired \"nearly a year\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   investigation by EPA officials of his ordering Plaintiff to accommodate [a subordinate], and following his false narrative implicating Plaintiff.\" SAC \u00b6 154 (emphasis in original). Nonetheless, as alleged in the FAC, investigators had sought to interview Hernandez by March 15, 2013, but he \"retired effective March 12, 2013, and disappeared to his family's native South American country-where he stayed secreted for several months.\" FAC \u00b6 68. By contrast, in his own account of his employment history, the plaintiff's employment was terminated after five separate investigations into his role in time-and-attendance fraud at the EPA. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 82; SAC \u00b6 8. Thus, unlike for Hernandez, EPA was able to conduct a thorough inquiry of the plaintiff's alleged misconduct while the plaintiff was still employed with the EPA. Given that Hernandez retired before investigators were even able to interview him, no inference can be drawn that the plaintiff was treated less favorably than Hernandez on account of his race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Further, the plaintiff states he was replaced by \"far less experienced and less competent African-Americans,\" SAC \u00b6 159, and \"thus there is sufficient evidence to infer pretext and a plausible inference can be drawn that he was terminated because of his race,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 158. Aside from this conclusory assertion, however, the plaintiff provides no allegations to support his claim that the replacements were, in fact, \"less experienced\" and \"less competent.\" Further, because the plaintiff now \"narrowly concedes\" that he followed his supervisor's instructions to commit time-and-attendance misconduct, \"the mere fact that his replacements were less qualified would not be sufficient to infer pretext.\"\n   <em>\n    Townsend I,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268044\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/236/280/\">\n    236 F.Supp.3d at 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Second, and more important, \"the plaintiff's allegations indicate[d] that his complaints to OCR were made\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   McCarthy and Perciasepe gave the order to terminate the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Townsend I,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268044\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/236/280/\">\n    236 F.Supp.3d at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In the SAC, the plaintiff attempts to address the first problem by alleging that \"EPA HR was harshly criticized during this precise time period for taking inordinate periods of time to render discipline, which publicly explained (and criticized) any 'lengthy time lag' between Plaintiff filing EPA Office of Civil Rights complaints, and the retaliation by the EPA for Plaintiff having done so-and thus EPA HR incompetence (also publicly established) supports an inference of a causal relationship.\" SAC \u00b6 222. The plaintiff is too clever by half. To whatever extent EPA HR may be dilatory about discipline, that fact assumed to be true does not render the plaintiff's claim any more plausible. First, the plaintiff alleges that it was Administrator McCarthy, not \"EPA HR,\" who ordered the termination of the plaintiff's employment. SAC \u00b6 112. Second, as the Supreme Court observed in\n   <em>\n    Breeden\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he cases that accept mere temporal proximity between an employer's knowledge of protected activity and an adverse employment action as sufficient evidence of causality to establish a prima facie case uniformly hold that the temporal proximity must be 'very close.' \"\n   <em>\n    Breeden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301161\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/268/#p273\">\n    532 U.S. at 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301161\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/268/#p273\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing cases). Absent close temporal proximity, an inference cannot be drawn that there is a causal relationship between protected activity and an adverse employment action. The plaintiff must show more to survive a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As for the second problem, although the plaintiff makes clear that McCarthy had already given the order to terminate the plaintiff's employment\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the plaintiff made his OCR complaints, the plaintiff now emphasizes that McCarthy \"did not give the\n   <em>\n    final\n   </em>\n   order to terminate Plaintiff until well after Plaintiff filed (and subsequently consolidated) his OCR matters.\" SAC \u00b6 225 (emphasis in original). The plaintiff's effort to draw a distinction between \"initial\" and \"final\" orders for termination of employment has no legally cognizable basis-what matters is whether a plaintiff \"engaged in a statutorily protected activity,\" \"suffered a materially adverse action,\" and \"a causal connection existed between the two.\"\n   <em>\n    Nurriddin v.

To the contrary, rather than show any error, let alone \"clear error,\" the SAC repeats the allegations underlying this conclusion regarding the plaintiff's admitted involvement in \"time-and-attendance fraud.\"\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    SAC \u00b6\u00b6 56-57.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The SAC omits the FAC's description of the plaintiff as a \"superlative middle manager.\" FAC \u00b6 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    As in the FAC, Counts VI and VII \"allege 'disparate treatment' based on race and sex respectively\" and largely \"repeat the allegations in Counts III and IV, both of which allege 'disparate treatment' under Title VII.\"\n    <em>\n     Townsend I,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268044\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/236/280/\">\n     236 F.Supp.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    311 n.12. Accordingly, because \"Counts VI and VII do not purport to be based on a different law, nor do they assert any different or new evidence.. ., they amount to mere surplusage\" and would be dismissed for the same reasons as Counts III and IV.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268044\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/236/280/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
