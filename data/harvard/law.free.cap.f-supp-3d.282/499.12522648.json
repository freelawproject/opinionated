As REinvest's manager, Defendant Riel waived service of the summons on REinvest's behalf and the SEC promptly filed REinvest's waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 8. As such, proof of service was not required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(4). Thereafter, Magistrate Judge Peebles ordered REInvest to answer or otherwise respond to the complaint by January 21, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 13. REinvest has since defaulted by failing to appear, answer, or otherwise defend itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   On December 2, 2016, the SEC requested the Clerk of the Court to enter default against REinvest, which was entered on December 5, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 20 &amp; 21. Further, the SEC has provided that the party in default is not an infant or an incompetent person, and is not in military service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   As to the substantive allegations against Defendant REinvest, since REinvest was a one-person operation, the facts set forth above as to Defendant Riel are equally applicable to REinvest. Having reviewed the complaint, the Court finds that the well-pleaded allegations establish REinvest's liability. \" 'To prove liability against a corporation, of course, a plaintiff must prove that an agent of the corporation committed a culpable act with the requisite scienter, and that the act (and accompanying mental state) are attributable to the corporation.' \"\n   <em>\n    Marini v.

Requested Relief\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   As to the relief request, the Court first finds that the SEC is entitled to the requested permanent injunction against REinvest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.E.C. v. Syndicated Food Services Intern., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 04-cv-1303,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%204668777\">\n    2010 WL 4668777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *1-*2 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, 2010) (issuing default judgment permanently enjoining the defendant from future violations of the federal securities laws, in reliance on the complaint's allegations). As set forth in the complaint, Defendants Riel and REinvest misled investors about the very nature of their investment, and Defendant Riel used investor proceeds for his personal purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 26-97. An injunction is warranted to ensure that REinvest does not resume its fraud or state a new fraud, and the relevant factors weigh heavily in favor of an injunction. REinvest, through Defendant Riel, had a high degree of scienter as the complaint alleges that Defendant Riel knowingly committed the fraudulent activity.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32-33, 36, 41, 45, 50, 57, 62, 65, 78-79, 82, 98-104. Additionally, REinvest's conduct was recurrent as the complaint alleges that the conduct spanned more than three years and involved repeated misrepresentations to investors.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1-3, 26-97. Moreover, REinvest has defaulted in this action and, therefore, has not recognized the wrongful nature of its conduct and has made no assurances against future violations. Finally, given REinvest's use of two separate websites, there is a chance that it could use these or other websites to conduct future securities fraud if the Court declines to enjoin REinvest. Accordingly, the Court grants the SEC's motion insofar as it seeks to permanently enjoin REInvest from future violations of Section 17(a), Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Next, the Court finds that disgorgement of $197,500.00 is appropriate. In addition to the reasons set forth above as to Defendant Riel, the Court notes that \"where two or more individuals or entities collaborate or have a close relationship in engaging in the violations of the securities laws, they have been held jointly and severally liable for the disgorgement of illegally obtained proceeds.\"\n   <em>\n    S.E.C. v.

Additionally, the Court finds that, from November 1, 2013 through September 27, 2017, prejudgment interest of $27,875.20 has accrued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Finally, as to the civil penalty, the Court declines to impose the maximum penalty requested by the SEC. REinvest, which is an entity as opposed to a natural person, is subject to higher potential third-tier penalties. For violations occurring after March 3, 2009 and before March 5, 2013, the third-tier penalty for entities is the greater of $750,000.00 per violation or the gross amount of the pecuniary gain to that entity from each violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77t(d)(2)(C) ; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u(d)(3)(B)(ii) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20201.1004\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.1004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the violations occurring after March 5, 2013, the third-tier penalty for entities is the greater of $775,000.00 per violation or the gross amount of the pecuniary gain to that entity from each violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77t(d)(2)(C) ; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u(d)(3)(B)(ii) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20201.1005\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the Court were to find the number of violations requested by the SEC (five) and apply the statutory maximum civil penalties, this would result in a civil penalty of $3,725,000.00. The Court finds that such an\n   amount, given the facts of this case, would be grossly disproportionate to the fraud perpetrated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Initially, the Court was inclined to hold Defendants Riel and REinvest jointly and severally liable for the same civil monetary penalty, since Defendant Riel is the owner and only employee of REinvest. The Second Circuit has made clear, however, that a finding of joint and several liability for civil penalties is contrary to the securities statutes providing for a civil penalty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.E.C. v. Pentagon Capital Management PLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071478\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/279/#p285\">\n    725 F.3d 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 287 (2d Cir. 2013).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Considering that REinvest and Defendant Riel are one and the same, the Court declines to grant the SEC's request for a civil penalty against Defendant REinvest. Such a penalty would penalize Defendant Riel for the same conduct that the Court found warranted the imposition of the civil monetary penalty discussed above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.E.C. v.

REinvest was based out of Defendant Riel's home and he clearly used the REinvest Bank Accounts as his own personal accounts. Since REinvest was nothing more than Defendant Riel's alter ego, Defendant Riel's pecuniary gain is necessarily the same as the pecuniary gain to REinvest.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    The SEC's motion for summary judgment against Defendant Riel is denied only insofar as it was seeking judgment as to its control person liability claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
